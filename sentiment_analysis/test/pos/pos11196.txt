I was specifically looking for a heat-resistant set of lightweight utensils that wouldn't scratch my plastic lunchware the way metal can, and searched for a nylon set because nylon is more durable than other plastics used for travel/disposable utensils. Nylon eating utensils are quite rare, apparently. The boiling point of water is 212F, while these can withstand over 400F.Besides the temperature durability, the nylon is also much firmer than other polymer reusable utensils, and the knife can definitely cut through chicken breast wrapped in bacon. The fork tines are a bit wide compared to metal, as expected because of the material, but that means certain delicate foods will end up being crushed instead of skewered properly. The spoon is a bit wide for my preferences--much wider than the usual disposable plastic spoons--but the flat tip does help with scraping bits out of the bottom of a bowl. I'd prefer a deeper but narrower spoon bowl, but oh well.I have to take a star off for the case, however. It's simply too bulky for minimalist lunch packing and feels more for show than necessity, taking up a good inch more space than the utensils' actual length. I don't use it, nor the toothpick that I left stowed in it because otherwise it'd just get lost.
