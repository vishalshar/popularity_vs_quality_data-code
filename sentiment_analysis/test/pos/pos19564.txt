My brush guards were lost in the mail. I emailed The Brush Guard after waiting for two weeks and they emailed me right away. The representative was super helpful and I was able to get another package mailed to me that day and received it within three days! I was even gifted an extra variety pack for my inconvenience. As far as the product goes, just what I expected. My brushes look and feel awesome!
