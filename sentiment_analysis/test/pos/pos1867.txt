I really like this 5-in-1 adapter for my Macbook.  I read other reviews where people said it didn't stay plugged in, but I've used this several times, for a few hours each use, and it's stayed in place just fine.  Based on other users' feedback I decided not to put a cover on the bottom (I did by a hard plastic clamshell cover, but only put on the top, which means I'm not affecting access to the port).Mostly I have used this as a USB connector for other devices like a DVD drive, etc., but I also used an SD card on which I had photos and it all worked well.  The price was good vs buying multiple adapters, since almost nothing works with the Macbook USB-C drive without an adapter. Also, the cover is metal -- I was afraid it would be cheap plastic, but it seems solidly made if you consider that all that holds it onto your Macbook is the USB-C plug. Unlike some reviewers I haven't had any experiences where it's slipped or had poor connectivity. It just works and does its job.The only minor downside is: This adapter doesn't have a USB-C connector.  I was using the DVD drive for a few hours and the battery on my Macbook got very low. It would have been nice to be able to charge my Macbook at the same time that I was using the DVD drive.  But that's not my normal use, so this isn't a big deal for me.
