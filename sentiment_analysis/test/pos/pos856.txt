Purchased the uKeg 64 about six weeks ago.  Followed the instructions & filled it with a Chipotle Porter for my local home-brew club meeting, exactly one month ago today.  Got plenty of good comments at the meeting, brought it home and put it in my beer refrigerator since there was about one beer left in the keg.  I forgot about it until today when I was getting ready for this month's home-brew club meeting.  Pulled it out & the pressure gage showed pressure in the keg.  I pulled the beer out and it was still carbonated and good!  I ordered a second one for a Christmas present.  I do recommend using keg lube as per the instructions.
