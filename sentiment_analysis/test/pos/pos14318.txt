I really like this holder. It's functional, it's sturdy, it grips my iPhone really well. But whoever decided that those prongs at the bottom should be that close together made a huge mistake. I have a Lifeproof Nuude case and that little latch you see at the bottom is the charge port cover. I can't charge my phone while it's in this holder. Other mounts resolve these kinds of issues by having swivling prongs, or ones that are set wider apart. Even 1cm wider would have made the difference for me. As it is, I'll either be returning this product, or I'll have to cut those prongs off to charge while I'm out and driving from client to client.iOttie, if you have a fix for this, please contact me, a revision like I ask isn't difficult and wouldn't compromise the rigidity you offer after your trial and error of the last two models.Edit 1: I was contacted very quickly by iOttie customer service.  Brittany worked out a temporary solution as a replacement while they work on changing the foot pegs and spreading them further apart in this product. I'll be receiving an iOttie easy one touch 2 for the time being.This is really a level of service that I haven't encountered before,  my original of review gave this product two stars, and though I might agree that it was probably a bit harsh comparatively, I also have never seen any phone holder product that has foot pegs so close together and didn't consider the fact that you might have a charge port somewhere other than really close to center.In this case I would say that their customer service goes far above and beyond any flaws that their product might have, and their quick response times to adapt their product to customer needs is quite extraordinary.I am awaiting my One touch 2 mount. I will update when it arrives!
