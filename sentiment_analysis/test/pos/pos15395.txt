I've been using this brand of detergent every time I can find it at TJ Maxx or Marshalls. All of the scents are great. My clothes actually smell like the detergent after they were washed. The scent isn't too strong after the wash but it is definitely present which I personally love. I've been using these in my HE washer and it is absolutely fine. Our package doesn't have the HE logo on the front but I believe on their website it says these work fine in HE. I also use 2 pods if I'm doing a larger load, but if it's just a few items on a quick wash, one will do! I absolutely love this scent and wish more scents were available in the larger package.
