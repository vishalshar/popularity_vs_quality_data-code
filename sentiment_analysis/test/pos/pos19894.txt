I was a litte hesitant to buy this camera after reading the bad reviews.  I am happy I ignored them and went ahead with the purchase.  The camera arrived about 20 minutes ago and the setup could not be easier.  This is my second D-Link Camera so I already had the mydlink app installed which did make the setup super easy.  I told the app to add the camera, scanned it's QR code, pressed the WPS button on the router then the camera and in a couple minutes I was good to go.  I think it took all of 5 minutes.  Camera works well, already dropped it a bunch of times with no issue, I did not upgrade the firmware when asked I will do it later.  I have been very happy with both my cameras.
