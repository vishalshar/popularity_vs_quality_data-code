WOW.  Was purchased to help with work.  I was recommended by intern to incorporate a bluetooth speaker for music while providing treatment to children.  It needed to be sturdy.  I was also hoping to find something that handled outdoors well.  This little gem pairs with my cell phone perfectly.  I am now even able to conduct conference calls via cell outside the office!  Perfect!  Rechargeable batteries, so no dealing with replacements.  The sound is appropriate for my needs.  Overall, very impressed.
