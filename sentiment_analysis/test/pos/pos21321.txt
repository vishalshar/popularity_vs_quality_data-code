I have just set up the Rachio Iro today so this review  will focus on that aspect as well as initial impressions.  I was replacing a Hunter brand timer that was adequate but definitely not the easiest to program.  The Iro was purchased to enable better control, save water, and monitor usage.Installation was straight forward and the wires mapped from the old unit to the Iro easily.  Very quickly the Iro was mounted to the wall and wired up and I was ready to begin the app side of the setup.  My first hiccup came during the Blink setup which flashes lights on your phone screen to send wifi credentials to your Iro. This seemed to work but the Iro wouldn't connect.  It turns out it only supports 2.4 Ghz networks, not 5ghz. This was noted in the online help but not in the quick setup pamphlet which came with mine, that would have been nice to know ahead of time. Getting the wifi straightened out I blinked over the 2.4 ghz network info and it was off and attempting to connect but I wasn't getting the flashing green light I expected from the pamphlet description. It was red/Amber then solid green then cycling through that sequence but not showing connected on the app. A trip through the online documentation led me to believe it was Downloading updates so I decided to let it continue. After about 30 minutes or so it stopped and gave me the flashing green lights I expected but the app still wasn't connected. It had long since given up trying to find the Iro so I repeated the wifi setup by unplugging the Iro and starting again, this time after having all the updates already downloaded and installed everything went smoothly.This process could definitely trip up some one not so tech savvy but I worked through it ok. Rachio could definitely do a better job with its printed instructions given that many users would probably have this same situation.Once I was connected the app had me thinking how easy this was going to be. It seemed well designed and was prompting me to discover and name all my zones, but nothing was turning on.  The Iro never seemed to get the zones to start up.  I was a little nervous that I may have gotten a dud at this point but I had one thing that concerned me when attaching the wires in the Iro that I thought may be the problem. The way the Iro connects to the wire harness it snaps on and I thought perhaps my wiring was preventing it's harness from being seated properly. I pulled everything out and stripped back some sheathing and left out the unused wires I had folded up in the Iro.  This let it head unit slide just a bit further on to the harness and everything started working great.With the Iro up and running I began sorting through all the options and toying with toggling zones on and off. I named my zones and disabled unused zones. I took pictures of each area and began documenting the soil type, plant type, sun exposure, slope, and nozzle type of each section.  Supposedly the Iro can take all these factors into consideration when watering with its Eco sense mode. I haven't enabled the Eco sense mode yet and am currently just setting up a timed schedule while I read up on everything the Iro can do.Ultimately Rachio has a few bumps in its setup process but really even for all the minor issues I had I was still impressed with how easy it was to install.
