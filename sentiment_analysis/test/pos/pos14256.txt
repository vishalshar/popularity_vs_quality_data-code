So far so good! I've already noticed a positive mood change in my gulping food kitty. I know he's happier having food throughout the day now.I like that I can see he's eating via web cam. Since I am controlling his portions it's very important to know the feeder worked and he was fed.By day 3 he was charging the feeder like a racehorse upon the sound of the motor ???I LOVE that there is no app but a web interface. I've had to many bad experiences with apps breaking due to an apple or google OS change. It seems like it can take a week or two to get an app break fix through their approvals.I feel a little safer knowing Feed and Go has complete control of the website. I just hope they don't bail out and leave the feeder useless.Also the seller has responded promptly to my questions.It was a bit much to spend but so far it's been worth it.
