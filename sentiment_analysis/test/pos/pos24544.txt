Although a little expensive, and a little heavier than the plastic cases, the aluminum case has a nice feel to it and is very durable.I use it to mount my iPhone 6 Plus on the handlebar of my Indian RoadMaster, for music, NAV, etc. With the combined twist lock and magnet, the case holds the phone tightly in place, even at high speed or on bumpy roads. Excellent product !
