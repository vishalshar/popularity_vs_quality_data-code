I've been a fan of Rokform cases for many years; I've had them on my iPhone 4s, 5s, 6s, 6s Plus and now 7 Plus.  This is just an all-around fantastic case that meets or exceeds my criteria: lightweight (a case shouldn't add weight to the phone a manufacturer has worked so hard to remove), thin (nor should a case be so damned bulky that it defeats how thin a phone is), durable, available in orange.  I wish the aluminum wasn't $30 more, but this one will do fine...my only complaint is that it lacks the modular piece that has come with each previous model, one with an adhesive back that allows me to snap the phone in anywhere I mount that piece.  Instead, it comes with a magnetic-front adhesive-back mount, which is fine I suppose...I just prefer the modular one.  Either way, I'd order this case again in a minute and love the solid feel of my iPhone 7 (at a mere $1200) being protected from any miscellaneous drops...
