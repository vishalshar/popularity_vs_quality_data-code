Most items you purchase never do exactly what they say they will. To my surprise Grip Boost does what it says it will do. Restores glove grip back to "New" condition. With this stuff my worn gloves regained their brand new sheen and tackiness. I definitely will continue to buy Grip Boost in the future. It's going to give my gloves longevity. I'll probably be able to go 2-3 seasons with a pair of gloves vs just one. Just a little bit on your gloves does the trick. You'll get many uses out of 1 bottle. And at just around 11 bucks, that's great value. I couldn't be more pleased! :)(Fyi...Maria is my wife, this is her husband. Lol)
