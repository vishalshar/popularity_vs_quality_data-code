I love these. They are better than I thought they'd be, sturdier and more practical. the plastic is stiff enough to stand in its own and I feel like it helps keep my brushes clean longer when I'm traveling. I'm thinking of getting some more to put on all my brushes. I would recommend these to anyone.
