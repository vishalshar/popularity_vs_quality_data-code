The product itself is great.  It is a good quality and is exactly what is expected based on the description. HOWEVER, the magnets they give you with it are a joke. I would have been very frustrated if it weren't for my husband's strange obsession with magnets. I pulled a few out of his collection, grabbed the super glue, and the problem was solved. Make sure you are prepared with better magnets and you will be very satisfied with the product.They do send an adhesive option, but I wasn't about to use that on my wall. I have no idea how well that would hold.
