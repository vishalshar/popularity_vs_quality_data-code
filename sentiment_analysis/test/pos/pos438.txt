It was simple to install and is very small. It took up very little space. And adjusting the sensitivity is simple as well. I just applied the velcro to the top of the rear wheel and repositioned it as needed. I like the built in 4 flashes and then constant on pattern. However, because I already had the "custom LED Universal Magic Strobes Brake Light Flasher" installed,  It would like to have the option of having no flash pattern. However, since I added on a separate pair of red LED strips as additional brake lights, I just kept the LED strips attached to the gear brake modulator and the combination of the two different flash patterns turned out work extremely well. I love this thing. I no longer have to worry about having to touch my brakes to make sure the car behind me knows that I've slowed down when I engine brake or downshift.
