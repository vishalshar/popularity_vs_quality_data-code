I love this thing. It allows me to check up on my dogs while I'm at work and interact with them.I always feel bad about having to leave my dogs in the bedroom all day while I have to go to work.While I prefer not to have to leave them, the Petzi certainly makes it easier.It allowed me to see how my dog wasn't able to get on the bed with her cone of shame and I was then able to find a solution.I also get to surprise them with treats throughout the day.Pros: one way audio, treat dispense, night vision, picture capture, easy access to petzi via appCons: 3-4 second video lag, one-way audio (would like 2-way), no ability to take video clips, video quality, loud clunky dispenserThe cons aren't a deal breaker just things that could be improved upon.
