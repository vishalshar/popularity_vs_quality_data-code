This product works well and effortlessly connected with both my Android phone and with my Garmin Vivosmart fitness band. Garmin software developer's could take some lessons from Wahoo on phone connectivity. I wanted an ANT+ heart strap that worked with the Vivosmart and Garmin's own straps have a reputation for cutting into the skin (there are online pictures of bleeding wounds in some of the reviews!). The Tickr strap is soft and the unit itself has nice rounded edges.While my current phone has ANT+ I do have other devices with only Bluetooth so it's a big plus Wahoo supports both with their TICKR straps. And I also like the idea of sometimes wearing the strap without needing either a fitness band/watch or my phone on my body and it can still track my workout. So the TICKR X seemed worth the extra few bucks to have it work "offline."The Wahoo app works flawlessly if you have your phone (or I presume a compatible iPod) on you. You go for a run, ride, or walk and, when you finish, your route is already mapped, all the stats summarized, and it gets archived away for future reference. Likewise, the heart rate data is stored by the Garmin Vivofit and Garmin's Connect app (or website) can show you a graph of your heart rate for any workout or event. Your current heartrate and zone, of course, also displays nicely on your wrist during the activity by any wrist device that supports ANT+ heart monitors.It's also very accurate and agrees with a Polar and Timex I checked it against. I never have had an issue with it not reading even when the pads are fairly dry. And I've never had any RF communication issues either. It just works. The strap, rather than having a buckle to fasten simply snaps to the plastic bit. It's very easy. They sell replacements traps.The LEDs are also really useful. And you can double tap the device through your shirt to place "markers" in your workout (or even change the track on your phone/iPod music player).I took a star off because the data is more limited if the activity is monitored "offline." I had hoped, for example, the TICKR X would still give you a graph of your heart rate over the duration of the activity but it only gives you the min, max, and average. I'm not sure if it doesn't have a enough memory to store the heart rate value every few seconds, but that was a bit disappointing. The solution is to either have your phone/iPod on your person or a compatible smart band or watch that can log your heart rate.I also am disappointed they have only one real Android app (and a "utility app) but many iOS apps. That's hard to understand, and forgive, when Android now has a much bigger market share than iOS. So all but one of those cool apps you see on the Wahoo website currently only work with iOS.
