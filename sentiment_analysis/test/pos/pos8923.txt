I was not able to exercise without, you know....After 3 months postpartum and 2 moths of having to hide after my workouts, I finally decided to get it, I thought it was too late to solve the issue but just after two weeks I was 90% better, and now, 4 months postpartum its 100% solved. Im able to run, jump, exercise etc. Its so fast, easy and effective. I know its expensive, but frankly I think its worth it.
