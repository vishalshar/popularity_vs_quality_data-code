This thing is AWESOME. I had my doubts but after watching multiple online reviewers test it out I decided to give it a shot. It performs exactly as advertised. I had bumped it and nudged it dozens of times and still no spill. The only tip that no-one mentioned before hand is make sure your table or desk has a mostly smooth surface. If it is textured or grooved (like old wood or masonry) the cup can't get suction. But with that being its only drawback I can safely say this is a win.
