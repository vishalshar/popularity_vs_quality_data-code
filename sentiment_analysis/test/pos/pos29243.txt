I purchased this speaker after a lot of considerations. I'd been wanting to get a Sonos Play:3 but what held me back was its lack of Bluetooth or line-in capabilities. The Libratone ZIPP meets all my requirements for a $300 speaker. After using it to listen to a variety range of music as well as watching Interstellar and Saving Private Ryan from my laptop and tablet, this is what I think about this speaker:- The sound is great, very natural and balanced. The highs and mids really shine in this speaker, especially with acoustics and guitar sounds. It lacks a little bass but I prefer that over artificial, software boosted bass. It still gives you that warm rumble and you can feel the presence of that bass, but not what you'd expect from the aiwa exos 9 or Bose Soundlink 3.- The app's Soundspace option allows you to change the sound presets as well as the setting type (table, outdoor, floor, neutral). However, it only works over Wifi, not Bluetooth.- It takes a while to boot up, around 35 seconds or so. That is kind of annoying sometimes.- When streaming movies from my iPad or MacbBook via Airplay, the sound gets a 0.3-second delay or so. It definitely is not in sync but not that annoying.- The touch interface could be better, I wish the volume sensitivity is more relative to its touch dial. Sometimes you increase a notch and it could be too much of a difference, a little louder than what you want. I rely on the app to change my volume.- Battery life is OUTSTANDING. I think this speaker is the leader in its class when it comes to battery life. You really get what's advertised, a good 8-10 hours.Overall, I'm satisfied with this speaker. I will use it outdoor or bring it with me during hotel stays. But if you're looking for serious sound to listen to at home, I'd recommend the aiwa exos 9 or a Sonos Play:5
