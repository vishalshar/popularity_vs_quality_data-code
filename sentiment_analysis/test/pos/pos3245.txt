I am veteran DJ that started out in 2001 playing vinyl on belt drive turn tables. I was looking for a way to eliminate the laptop from my mobile set up and this stand alone unit does just that. It has the sturdy build and feel of using CDJ's but with the convenience of an all inclusive unit with loads of options, like running straight from a usb flash drive while simultaneously running Serato DJ.The downside: had to upgrade to Windows 10 (meh). Denon's music software is clunky and doesn't compare to the ease of using Serato. Have had a couple instances where the displayed wave form froze and I had to reset the unit. This only happened at home and since I've played 2-3 gigs a week with no issues. This is a great deal for the price, especially if you don't feel like waiting for Pioneer's inevitable response.
