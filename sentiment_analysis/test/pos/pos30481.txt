I had not heard of Bizzy Coffee until they were demoing it at my local Lunds & Byerlys store. Prior to trying it, I was definitely hit or miss with coffee. I never drink hot coffee, and even the iced drinks I enjoyed infrequently would upset my stomach a bit. Forget instant, and making a pot of coffee just to cool it down for my kind of coffee drinks was simply not worth it.Then along came Bizzy. So smooth and delicious. It has become a morning habit. I put some in my protein drink every morning, and enjoy the taste (Mocha Caramel protein - YUM), NO stomach upset, plus a nice little caffeine hit.I love that I can drink it before I run, cycle or work out at my local gym. I like to put a some in one of my water bottles out on a long ride so I get a nice treat midway. Did I mention it never upsets my stomach?Thank you for a great product, Bizzy! I highly recommend it.
