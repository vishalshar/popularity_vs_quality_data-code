Overall this smart lock is a good retro-fit for an existing door and lock. Install and setup is fairly simple, and the directions are easy to follow. Only a screwdriver was needed to remove the existing lock and install the August Smart Lock. I did take the time to file down the strike plate on my door to ensure the bolt had no issue opening and closing with zero friction. This will ultimately save on battery life and increases the reliability of the lock itself by ensuring it won't get stuck and will lock/unlock with ease.The application for Android is easy to use and fairly responsive. The bluetooth range with my Samsung Note 4 is limited so I did find myself waiting a few seconds as I approached the door for it to connect and unlock. This was with auto-unlock enabled. Manually it works fairly well. Usually by the time I walk from my car to the door it's ready to be unlocked if I do so manually.However, I ended up buying the August Connect as well so I could verify the status of the lock via WiFi. I decided it was worth it for the added security of being able to ensure it had locked automatically as I left the area. Overall I'd say it's been very good about automatically locking and unlocking with only one or two cases where it didn't automatically lock after I had left. This is where the August Connect came in handy.I've been using it now for several weeks and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a simple and stand alone smart lock that will fit into most existing locks and doors.I would also recommend anyone who wants to purchase this to visit the August website and read their guide on how to determine if your lock is compatible or not and consider purchasing the August Connect as well for added security/safety.Pros:Easy to setupLooks nice (a little big, but not too big)Auto lock/unlock is wonderfulCons:August Connect needed for those times when it doesn't automatically lockClosed system, not compatible with any other Home Automation systems EXCEPT HomeKit
