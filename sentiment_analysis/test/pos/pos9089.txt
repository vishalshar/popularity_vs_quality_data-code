I've owned first generation August locks and now the current gen HomeKit models and have had no issues with them. I've owned numerous other smart-locks from Kiwkset Kevo's to Schlage, and hands down August is the best on the market. No need to rekey your locks as this simply replaces the interior deadbolt. After a quick install and setup with August's application, I have not experienced any issues as some have posted. The second generation model has made many improvements over the first, especially with installation and ease of use. Utilizing a magnetic plate solved one of the main complaints some experienced with first generation models. I replaced all my smart-locks in my homes with August HomeKit models and an August Connect for each (necessary for control away from home unless you have an Apple TV 4 or iPad to act as a HomeKit hub).As per some complaints regarding HomeKit and iOS 10 "Home" use:August HomeKit locks have always been HomeKit compliant. Some are confusing HomeKit "Siri" compliancy with iOS 10's "Home" app compliancy, which is now fully supported as Apple has approved the firmware update August submitted months ago. Again, this was Apple's issue as they received the update but did not approve it for months. As a developer, I beta tested August's iOS app whle iOS 10 was in development before its official release this Fall. Strangely, August HomeKit locks worked perfectly during the months of beta testing yet Apple's iOS 10 GM release to the public reversed course without due notice to August. iOS 10 Home app has full support now that Apple has approved the necessary firmware update.Make sure all your devices are running the most current version of iOS and update each lock's firmware within the August iOS app. Each lock needs to be updated for use with the "Home" app, otherwise the lock fully supports HomeKit - Siri control, etc. HomeKit will still work with iOS 9 and earlier.
