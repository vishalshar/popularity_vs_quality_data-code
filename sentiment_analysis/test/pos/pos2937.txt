What's better than seeing, talking, and getting to give your pups treats when you are at work? Plus we put ours upstairs to add a little more exercise to their day by having them have to take rhe stairs up and down to get a treat. Works exactly as outlined. Sometimes multiple treats are dispensed and sometimes just one. It would be nice if it were more consistent in that way but doesn't mike me like it any less. Well worth the money and the app and tech support are awesome and easy. Buy one now!
