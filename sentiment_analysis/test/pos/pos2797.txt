Ok, I have most of all the electronic pens available on the market. This one is special for two reasons. Number one it is a Bluetooth device that does not require a Bluetooth connection to be used. I happen to be typing this review with the pencil in one hand while using my thumb on my other hand. Combined with Fifty-Three's software app called Paper (which is free), when connected to Bluetooth the pencil has magnificent features every artist could ever want. To me, it's like having fifty-three different types of pens, pencils, paintbrushes, a an awesome color palette that can be mixed to your heart's every artistic desire. The other reason I love this pencil is because my father was a carpenter and used the pencil this is modeled after. He is passed on, but working with this pencil brings back warm memories of him as he used his pencil with his work. I cannot recall a day he was not holding one in his hand, or tucked behind his ear. Now, I use one for my art. I am not a professional artist by any stretch, but this pencil can really help someone learn the basics of art without all the mess. It has brought art back into my life after a long hiatus. If you are not sure about this pencil, please know my review is much longer than other products I have purchased here at Amazon.  I took the time because I know how I felt when I was shopping for another digital art tool. Out of all, this is my absolute favorite. Easy to use, extremely comfortable in my hand (ergonomic), and keeps a charge for quite a long time. But again, if you are not needing to use the features of the Paper app, no charge is necessary. Finally, I have attached a piece of art I did with this pencil, to give you an idea on what can be done. Keep in mind, I am an amateur artist.  I hope you are as happy with this product as I am.  Enjoy!
