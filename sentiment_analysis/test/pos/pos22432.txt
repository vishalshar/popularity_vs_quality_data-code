I bought the 1MORE over ear headphones for a long plane trip as my in ear headphones don't block any of the normal plane noises.  They worked great!  Awesome sound quality, blocked out most of the noise, and the headphones are a very durable metal.  They look great (I had several people ask me what they were and where I got them - including one guy with a pair of Beats on).  I got sucked in to a podcast series that had me wearing these for about 8 hours straight, and I couldn't have been happier.
