I bought this to take on vacation so when we were sitting at the beach or by the pool the GF and I could jam out to some sick tunes. This thing was amazing. Got splashed, still worked. The best part that they dont tell you about is that is has these little suction cuppy things on the back of it. I suction cupped it to the wall when I was taking a shower so I could listen to music too. This went from a vacation purchase to a life purchase. It gets super loud. I bring it outside in the garage with me to jam out when I'm working on the car and what not. The value of this thing has easily surpassed what I've payed for it.I've bought a couple bluetooth speakers under $75 and they are garbage. This thing is the best. I may even buy the big brother version for the garage.
