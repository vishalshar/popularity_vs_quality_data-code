I sauté (veggies and chicken) and deep fry (mostly grouper from the gulf) somewhat often, which means I use olive and canola oil (sauté and fry respectively).  After trying Thrive, which costs 9.2 times canola oil and 1.85 times olive oil (that's what I found today, 9/13/2016, but do your own cost research), there is no comparison between the flavor and texture of sautéed veggies and meats and the crispness of fried fish; Thrive just does a better job than canola/olive oil, for both frying and sautéing.  Does Thrive do a 9.2 or 1.85 times better job than canola oil and olive oil respectively...that's hard to determine.  Obviously, the price needs to come down; hopefully, with more volume, that will happen.
