There was a great variety here to help spice up our air-popped popcorn. We've started a healthier lifestyle, so air-popped popcorn is our snack of choice. We have to keep it interesting, and this variety pack fit the bill. My favorite is the white cheddar, but my husband loves the nacho. My daughter is all about the sweet toppings, so those are hers!
