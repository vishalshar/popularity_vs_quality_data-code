I ordered this for my kids on a whim and they just loved it.  Turned out to be their favorite gift next to their new Samsung Galaxy 4, 7" tablets which also work fantastic with this set up.The manufacturer is very specific and clear on what IOS and Android models this works with.Setup was easy and the software was easy to use anb set up.  Even my 5 year old with his very limited reading is able to operate the software and host or join games unaided just fine.The only CON - Amazon Pricing is about 40% to 60% higher than buying directly from the manufacturer.  I pointed this out to them a few weeks ago and they matched the price.  Now they have jacked it up to the ridiculous level.
