I love my Mevo! My favorite part is the ease of use relative to the power of the camera: it's amazing how it allows you to digitally reproduce a multicamera shoot environment, but remains simple to operate. The iOS app it first-class. The video quality really impressed me as well. Great product, wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
