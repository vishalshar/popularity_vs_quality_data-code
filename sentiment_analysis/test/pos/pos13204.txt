Saw this on shark tank and had to get it for my beer drinker at home.  He is picky about how his beer tastes and knows he loves the light tasting draft beer.  He seemed excited about it when he opened up at christmas.  He went to the kitchen immediately to clean it so he could use it right away.  He used it for the first and second day and I have not seen him use it since.  Hopefully on new years he will.  thanks much
