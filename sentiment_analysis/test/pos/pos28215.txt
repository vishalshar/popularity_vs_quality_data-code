I love the updated gen 2 product from TrackR. I had the previous device, and there were some flaw, though nothing worse that other products in this same space, but these new devices have gotten rid of almost all the issues I experienced before, now it runs great and works well.They added what looks like a small hole on the front of the device which makes it ring much louder than older versions as well. It's not GPS, but as long as you know that going in, it does exactly what they advertise.
