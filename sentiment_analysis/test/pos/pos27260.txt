I have an Australian cattle mix puppy whom I rescued from a shelter.  Always was a bit weak and even has a issue with his hip. This is the perfect product to keep him healthy and happy!  He has no issues with the taste, and actually seems to love it.  I am going to begin using this with the skin and coat supplement as well as his skin has always been dry. I also was hoping that our rescue cat would take the supplement, but she seemed shocked that I had added something to her food. But it was anticipated as she is very picky and will only eat one type of food of all that I have tried. I wholly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a way to keep their pet healthy!
