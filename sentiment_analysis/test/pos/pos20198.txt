Item came packaged fine and worked out of the box. I bought this primarily to use on my car wheels,  which get inundated from brake dust. The wheel brush did an ok job of cleaning the rims. It got off surface dust and dirt, but not without the help of wheel cleaner. The head (white one) did pop off at one point through some aggressive use but was easy enough to get back on. It definitely is better than scrubbing by hand but my expectations of how much it could clean may have been a bit high.
