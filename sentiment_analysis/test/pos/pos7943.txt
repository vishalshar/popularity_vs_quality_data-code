Being a business owner, I was very skeptical with the concept that I could replace the energy drinks that give you the major blood sugar crashes, increases blood pressure, and tastes like HE double L, with a product that is all natural, no crash and tastes fantastic.  I wanted badly to prove this wrong and be able to shame the company for their false statements.  Let me be very clear, after ordering cases of the different flavors we set out to test them and taste them.  From the first drink, you could taste the subtle fruit tastes.  I am not talking the artificial fruit flavors, but real honest to goodness fruit without all the sugars that coat your mouth and sets you off to wash down with a glass of water.  This was a crisp, lovely non medicinal taste that had you sipping with joy.  Then the energy levels!  No shakes, no nausea and no sugar drops!  I had drank my drink at the end of the afternoon and expected to be up all night cursing my timing of the testing.  Nope, by bed time I was ready to relax and drift off to slumber.Bottom line, we will be adding these lovelies to all of our stores and look forward to talking with everyone about the benefits of these amazing elixers!
