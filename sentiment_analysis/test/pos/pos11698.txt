Some of the best socks I've purchased, and I'd say I'm pretty particular. The fit is just larger than expected. I am a size 12/13 foot depending on the shoe, and the 12-16 socks are just way too large. They fit, but they're a little higher than ankle socks as a result. Overall though, excellent socks.
