Worth every penny. I'd say it's worth its weight in gold...but it doesn't weigh that much. I was skeptical and have had numerous skeptical friends come over to try it. Their faces are priceless.I always have them taste a regular pour first then with Fizzics...same reaction every time. Everyone loves it!
