This is absolutely the best thing ever for a child with an ipad mini.  We bought my granddaughter one for her birthday and included this cover.  She has dropped it on its face, on the back, from the car, etc...and never a problem.  Well worth the investment and the handle is an added plus.  Gives her a sure hold when she's carrying it to the car.  Great and will buy again if I need to.  has been over a year and still no signs of wear.
