Overall, I'm very happy with my BlueSmart. It makes a great carry-on for a quick weekend trip with all the conveniences I need to make a more enjoyable experience at the airport.The Bag Itself - Design + FunctionalityThe bag overall is sturdy and uses quality materials throughout. One of my pet peeves is cheap zippers so I love that these are sturdy and well designed, even covered nicely with fabric which avoids rubbing my hands up against the zipper teeth and gives the bag a better look. The wheels are similarly well designed and provide easy movement in all directions.My favorite part of the bag is the front pocket. It is very convenient with quick access to my laptop -- a huge upgrade from the struggles of pulling my laptop out of my old bag while going through security. The laptop pocket is nicely padded and holds my 15" MacBook Pro comfortably. There are several other easy access pockets for storing passports, keys, bags for liquids, etc. I also love the magnetic closure that the pocket has, feels very secure. My only gripe with the front pocket is that it's a bit too deep for my desires. If it were half the depth, it would be easier to pull out magazines or a book from the pocket while in flight.The inside runs smaller than my previous bag but has plenty of space for a quick weekend trip or as a carry-on for the essentials when checking a bag -- I always assume my checked-in bag will be lost and bring a day or two worth of clothes and toiletries in a carry-on just in case, this bag is perfect for that.The TechnologyThe integrated technology is clearly what separates this bag from the rest. I love all the bells and whistles this bag comes with. Don't expect them to change your entire life but they make the airport experience all the more friendly. The built-in charger is my favorite. It has 2 usb ports, one inside the front pocket that makes charging devices stored inside easy and one outside for charging while you're at the airport. No more hunting down an outlet and digging through my bag for the cord.The built in scale in the handle is nice. It's not absolutely necessary in this bag since I mostly use a bag this size for carry-on but when I do need it, it's far more convenient than the alternative ways of weighing a bag or just hoping I don't go over.Overall, I am a big fan of this bag. It makes a good bag for short trips or as a carry-on to pair with a checked bag. The bag seems durable and provides the conveniences to make the trip through the airport a bit more friendly.
