I switched to non-antiperspirants a little over a year ago and this is one of the best.  And I have tried EVERYTHING!  I've tried Lavanila (only effective for a few hours), soapwalla (pretty good), thai crystal (nope), tom's of maine (terrible), arbonne natural deodorant (TERRIBLE), Desert essance (TERRIBLE), and about 15 other brands found on amazon and at natural stores.This one is one of the best, although I've noticed that its effectiveness wears off a bit after a few weeks of daily use.  I've started to rotate it with Truly's Natural Deodorant, which is also one of the best I've tried.  I do two weeks of this, two weeks of the Truly's, then back to this, etc.  That seems to have solved my problem.  I also dab on a few drops of tea tree oil when I get out of the shower, let it dry, and then put on this stuff.No problems with redness or skin issues - in fact, my underarms look nicer and better than ever before!  Just like in those dove commercials! So I guess it's worth the bit of extra effort.A jar of this lasts me a good 4 months, used every other day.
