Exact match for another that I bought locally.  Awesome microphone that picks up everything within a reasonable radius.  Syncs with your smart phone and can be downloaded on multiple phones.  You have pre-recorded messages you can use, or speak to the person outside your door yourself.  Good picture quality as well.  I bought this for my son's house after he had some difficulty with an ex-roommate.  I plan to buy one for my own front door at some point as well.
