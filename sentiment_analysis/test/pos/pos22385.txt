I absolutely love this! I got it for my 3 year old and I to do together and we are both having a blast! The seeds start sprout on about day 3! Only thing I noticed is the little bunny will not stand up...unless he is shoved in the dirt lol and the fairy does not sit on the little stools like it shows but other than that is is perfect! I added a picture of it from today...we are on day 5 since we planted the seeds!
