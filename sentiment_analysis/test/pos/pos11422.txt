I bought this speaker back in May for my 11 year old Son. I wanted to see how it worked before I wrote a review, so after three monthsI have to say that it's the toughest best sounding speaker I've ever heard. It's been in water, sand, mud and washed off with the water hose and it keeps on playing. The sound quality is great and the battery last all day. If there was anything to improve on I would have to say the distance of the Bluetooth, after about 6 feet away you start to loose the signal. And I wish it had a little more volume but all in all it still sounds great and is practically indestructible. He zip tied it to the front of his 4 wheeler and has pretty much left it there all summer.
