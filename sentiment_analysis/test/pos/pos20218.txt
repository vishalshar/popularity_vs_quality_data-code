Great toy - only one side of each panel is magnetic (which was a bit disappointing and confusing to my youngest granddaughter...4 years old). We ordered the Draw and Build to go along with this, but as I said in the review of that product, the triangles are not the same size (the D & B are equal lateral) so we were not able to build the fairy tale set up in two stories as the girls had in mind. They enjoyed making their own cloths and objects by drawing onto white magnetic vent covers and then cutting out the pieces. This really is an engaging toy.
