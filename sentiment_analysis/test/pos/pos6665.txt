The advent of flat screen TVs brought a new problem to market - very flat sound one company has come up with an incredible solution and its known as the Enclave Audio 5.1 surround sound system.  While its true you still need a powercord for each speaker, Im shocked no one has figured out a way to do this before at such an affordable price!  For a guy that appreciates the finer things in life such as good quality sound and knows it when he hears it, this system leaves its competition in the dust!These speakers are built and tuned amazingly well, giving you the ability to hear a full range of sounds out of each speaker and it crushes SONOS... they dont do DTS, uncompressed audio transmission.Enclave CineHome HD looks like most home theater-in-a-box systems. It comes with five speakers (center, left, right, left surround, right surround) and a powered subwoofer. Each speaker not only houses the speaker drivers, but also its own built-in amplifier and wireless receiver.The setup is nearly flawless out of the box... simply plug in the powercords, attach an HDMI cable into an input and in moments after you turn on the power you've got amazing sound.But why buy the CineHome HD now?  If you try to get a similar experience in piece meal your not only wasting time youre also going to waste a ton of money and the sound quality will never be the same!
