The Brush Hero lives up to its name.  For many years, I have been looking for a better way to clean the wheels to my car.  I have tried regular brushes, sponges, high-pressure sprayers but nothing does a decent job at removing the brake dust and grime that accumulates in all the nooks of a car wheel until I heard from a friend about this new product called the Brush Hero.  It uses just regular garden hose water to turn a brush.  With quite a bit of torque and its bullet shape, the brush cleans wheels with remarkable ease and is able to reach the in-between the spokes, the corners, the lug nuts and other tight spaces.  I also used it to knock off bugs from my front bumper, grill and hood and the small cracks between the panels of the body of the car.  After I finished with my car, I tried it on my mountain bike.  The mud came right off of it!  I don't think I have every seen my mountain bike this clean. Next weekend, my outdoor furniture and lawn mower!  Very impressive brush for cleaning automotive wheels, bicycles and other things!
