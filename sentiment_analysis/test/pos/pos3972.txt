I don't think I've ever seen so much health packed into one small, ready-to-go and easy-to-carry-around packet. (I have a couple in my glove compartment, and I've been keeping one in my briefcase too.) And I didn't see anything particularly unhealthy added (like salt, extra added sugar, unpronounceable chemicals, etc.*) I'm not an expert on the topic, but I wouldn't exactly call this an "energy bar" per se (like for "instant energy" with tons of sugar, caffeine, electrolytes, carbs, whatever). Rather I'd just call it a simple snack, something to hold you over, fill in the spaces between meals, that kind of thing. Plus, give you some healthy chia and acai!Personally, I've had the bad habit of going all day with just one meal later in the day. I didn't realize it at the time but this put my body into a starvation mode and actually made me put on fat and gain weight, even though I was eating very little. I've been told by health and medical professionals -- and have read -- that it's best to have about five or six small meals or snacks throughout the day. So my problem has been finding GOOD, healthy snacks ... as opposed to junky snacks like Cheetos and potato chips, that kind of thing. Yes, these are a bit on the expensive side, but I'm thinking that one or two a day would be perfect.That's my story and I'm sticking with it. Also, I'm going to order another box right now. :)Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, d'uh ... they taste good too!*Okay, I lied. There's apparently a tiny pinch of sea salt in there at the tail end of the ingredient list. The total sodium listed is 45 mg. I'm guessing it's part of what's needed to hold everything all together, I dunno.
