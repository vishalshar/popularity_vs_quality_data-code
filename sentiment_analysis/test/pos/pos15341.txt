I've used these now for about a month and love them.  I run and bike frequently and they stay in fine.  I haven't swam yet but have gotten them completely wet.  Some advice if you are thinking of buying them; these aren't just headphones, they are a cool new technology that takes some learning and software.  Spend some time learning the controls and you MUST upgrade the software before you use them.  v2.0 has been great for me.  I keep my phone in my right front pocket and streaming is good.  I only very rarely get a blip.  I use the Quad Lock system on my bikes to mount the phone on the handle bars and the connection is always great.  I'm excited for the future of these, Bragi has some awesome ideas on their website.  The stuff it does now is impressive but the possibilities are really cool.
