The Rachio Iro was a device that I first read about 6-8 months ago when looking for a replacement for a very dated Rainbird irrigation timer.  Finally, at the beginning of this watering season, I decided it was time to look again at this vs. other products and version 2 had also arrived.I actually contacted Rachio support and then interacted with a number of customers and technicians in their community support site prior to making my purchase.  In doing so, I discovered that this small company is extremely focused on developing and molding their product  they take customer feedback extremely seriously and continuously change their software to create a better and more functional device.Basically, this is a cloud-based irrigation controller.  Through integration of location data, weather data, irrigation system type, soil type, and plants in each zone, the system has the power to suggest and track watering schedules in an active fashion.  While this can also be used as a simple timer, it becomes much more powerful when adjustments are made for amount of rainfall and zone-specific needs.  The unit does need to be in range of a WiFi network  fortunately in my garage, there is a good signalUpon receipt of my new unit, I had a pretty good sense of the project ahead from talking with support and interacting with others in the Rachio community.  I didnt purchase the outdoor housing as my unit is in my garage.  Installation took me about 60 minutes and most of the time I spent was used in identification and labeling of wires from my poorly labeled old system.  I probably would have been done in 20-30 minutes if my old system had not been so dated.  Once I had labeled the wires and mounted the unit, attaching wires to the specific zones was simple.  As an aside, if you are planning to use this with more than a few zones, labeling the existing wires on your old system can save you a lot of grief.  Activation of the unit with the app on my iPhone went without a hitch.The ability to take pictures of my zones and customize the plant-types and the area to be watered was very helpful.  I have a 12-zone system, and custom labeling of the zones with the app (front yard, south) also helped to allow for ease of use and is very intuitive.  I had my system up and running quickly and made adjustments with the app on my iPhone and on the web-based portal as needed over the next few days to further customize my system.  I was able to give both my landscape company and my irrigation professional access to the system via the web or an app as a guest.  The feedback you get from the system is also helpful.  I recently planted some new grass in 2 of my front yard zones.  I was able to make 2 separate watering schedules, one for all zones and one for extra watering of the 2 planted zones, each limited by daily rainfall.  If the Iro decides not to water, it tells you why and what is further planned with an e-mail or notification of your choice.Adjustments to the system and checking of sprinkler heads is very easy, with the use of the app you can control any zone from anywhere in your yardor the world for that matter as long as the internet is available.While this device itself is fantastic technology, I cant say enough good things about the support and the company.  They really seem to take pride in their customers and their product!  I hope to enjoy the use of the product for many years to come and am sure this will save money in watering by only functioning when needed.
