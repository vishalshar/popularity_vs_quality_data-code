If you are looking for a way so your keys aren't stabbing you at weird angles or jingling as you walk, this is how to solve it.  I've had a few key holders before but I love how this one is adjustable based on how many keys you need.  The leather feels and looks nice.  It's a great enhancement to your pocket!
