Another great dlink product. I have many of their cameras as they are affordable and work great. I was hesitant about this because of the reviews. But as I have done most of my life I ignored online reviews as I usually find the complainers are louder and more vocal than people who are happy with the product..Only issue I have is that while Dlink has a Windows app for my Nokia phone which I use to view my cameras, there is no Windows Dlink app for Dlink Home which is what is needed to control this device. Once again, no love for Windows. But I knew this going in. But my wife has an Android phone so she can make the necessary adjustments when we are out of town. In the mean time I need to find a cheap Android tablet to control this device when I am out of town.Great product. I am buying more of them. Come on Dlink, give me a Windows app for Dlink Home.
