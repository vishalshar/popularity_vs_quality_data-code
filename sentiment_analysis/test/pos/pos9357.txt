Well, my boyfriend LOVES these! They do feel really durable, and they feel like regular condoms on my end, but he says he noticed an immense difference on his (both puns intended). I do wish they were slightly bigger. Average size condoms tend to be a little hard to get on my boy, and that is not a time I welcome frustration. Also bigger packs would be nice.
