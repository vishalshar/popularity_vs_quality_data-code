Got this for my husband's birthday after seeing it on Unbox Therapy. Total hit! He brought it into the office and I think there was a good hour where everyone bumped it and giggled when it didn't move. Not that it would specifically work better for one group than another but if you have a programmer in your life and are looking for a gift--this is it.
