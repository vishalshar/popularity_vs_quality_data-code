Hello All, MY new mushroom kit is growing very, very well! It seems as though this version is ''new and improved'' over the first kit I received. Even better, BACK TO THE ROOTS has extended the offer to send a FREE mushroom kit to the elementary school of my choice after I post a photo' of my homegrown mushrooms on Face Book! Talk about a win win! Thanks BACK TO THE ROOTS!!
