This system is exactly what I was looking for! I wanted a good 5.1 surround sound system that didn't require me to run wiring in the walls or under the carpeting. I purchased stands for the front left and front right speakers and put them in the corners of my TV room. I purchased two stand lights that have shelving underneath the lights for the back corners and tucked the back speakers on them. The main speaker is right under my TV and is also the HUB for this system. The subwoofer sets next to my entertainment center. This system was incredibly easy to set up. After placing each speaker where I wanted them and plugging each speaker into power, i simply turned on the power using the power button on the center speaker and all the speakers linked up. Yes, each speaker has a separate power cord but I didn't find that to be an issue. I have wall jacks where I placed each of my corner speakers and I have a power strip inside my entertainment system that allowed me to run the cords for the sub and for the center speaker.The center speaker is where you plug in all of your devices. My TV is wall mounted and I run cables within the wall from a jack hidden behind my entertainment center to another jack behind the TV. I was actually able to run less cables in the wall because of this system. I only need a single HDMI cable now from the TV to this center speaker (hub). There are then HDMI1, HDMI2 and HDMI3 which I have running to my cable box, PS3 and PS4. There is also a port for Optical and Aux. Bluetooth is also an input option.At first I was considering this product as 4 stars because the small remote that comes with this system is pretty bad. It has issues communicating with the hub. I went with 5 stars because of the incredible support I've received but I'll get to that in a moment. I use a Logitech Harmony Elite remote. I didn't care about the small remote that came with this device since I planned on programming everything using my Harmony Elite. That's when I found out the Enclave system wasn't in the Harmony database (it is now). So I attempted to program my remote manually. It became a massive headache because the way you change your inputs is by scrolling thru the list as it shows on your television. But if you have a device like the PS4 turned off then that HDMI input would be grayed out and scrolling would skip it. The Harmony remote cannot know this and I just couldn't get it to work properly. It would easily go out of sync. I started struggling with Logitech support over it and then I finally decided to contact Enclave support. BIG KUDOS to these guys! Working with Enclave was a pleasure. I found them all extremely professional and pleasant to work with. I didn't realize this was a brand new product and come to find out, they've been working with Logitech to get into their database for months. Luckily, I was able to work along with them testing and figuring out all the issues and was happy to help finally get their system not only listed in the database for the Harmony remotes but also to have it configured, with a new firmware release, so the Harmony remote can tell the system to JUMP direct to an input. No more worries of it getting out of sync due to scrolling past an input that's not available! After updating the firmware on the Enclave system and loading Harmony's programming for the Enclave system, everything works great and I'm really enjoying the amazing sound that comes out of this system.Something I want to note because it wasn't well documented. If you want to adjust the surround, subwoofer, etc, press up on the directional to bring up the volume on screen and then hold right on the directional. (This even works using my Harmony remote. LOVE IT!) It will then bring up the levels where you can scroll thru and change them. For instance, I boosted my subwoofer to +6 and now movies shake my soul!I would happily recommend this system to anyone who wants surround sound for their entertainment system without running a bunch of wires all throughout their room. If you're still concerned about the rear speakers having a power cord and you don't want that due to the planned placement of those speakers, I hear they are working on a battery pack. Even better, is that they're working on a 5.2 system so you can have two subwoofers. Due to my assistance helping them get working with Logitech, I was offered a second subwoofer to test out as a 5.2 system and all I can say is WOW! Movie nights ROCK! Purchasing something like this and knowing you have the company there to back up their product and make sure you get the most out of it is why I give this product an easy 5 stars!UPDATE: Disregard my statement about how to get into the system to change the speaker levels. Since their last firmware update, all of these settings are easily accessible under Speaker Setup under Menu. Perfect!
