First of all, I have been more excited by new functions that I did not expect at first from this remote camera. I was just interested in night vision and 2 way audio. Let me show how I was excited step by step. This product has really simple setup steps. Instruction guide is not needed. It shows three steps and intuitively I could connect and setup after downloading android application. I had a little problem when my network hotspot was dead at home; however, after I installed and recognized successfully, it works fine. I recommend new user who use without instruction like me to check the network status at home first and make silent the environment when making it recognize QR code since camera looks communicating with web server directly and sound must be calibrated as well. The response feedback to phone came from the server after Camera beep recognition sound.I changed network for better another hotspot after de-register camera from my phone and reset camera in the bottom for the second location test at my kids room. They actually really had fun by 2way talking like walky talky. And the camera quality is default HD. It was so clear. It is good to detect home. When I was at the office, I could talk to my wife and playing with siren test. Hahaha....Kids really liked this.When I came back home, it works as like a toy for my kids. Most of the excited moment is at night. It detects motion at night. So, I got notification on my android device in my bed the upstairs when my kids walked down and hang around for water. The quality of night vision was still good! I am looking forward to seeing how it turn on and off IR bulb light in the next week. I hope every my IR home appliances work with this soon. I will see if it works fine with my TV and light of living room during my family vacation.
