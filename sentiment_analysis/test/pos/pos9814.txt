I got this toothpaste because of the watermelon flavor. I don't know about anyone else but I am getting tired of mint flavored toothpaste. Since it was a kids toothpaste, I didn't think it would clean your teeth like the more abrasive stuff. Well, it isn't real abrasive but it gets my teeth cleaner than most toothpastes I have used. My teeth stay cleaner in between brushings . I think the chalky toothpastes add to the tartar buildup on my teeth. Since I have been using it my teeth have stayed cleaner and the sensitivity has gone away. The taste is great! I look forward to brushing now. Before, it felt like my mouth and gums were stripped and irritated, brushing with this stuff doesn't do that.
