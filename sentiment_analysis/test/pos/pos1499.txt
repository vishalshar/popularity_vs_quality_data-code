What first attracted me to this game was that my friends and I are fans of One Night Ultimate Werewolf, plus I loved the box.  I brought this out this past weekend to a game night just as a filler game and it stole the show.  This was very easy and quick to learn and so much fun to play.  We had about 6-7 people each game, with the games lasting around 30-45 minutes each.  I think we got through 3 games but everyone wanted to play more.  The rulebook is pretty concise, but there were a few holes here and there which we were able to look up online.  Anything else we just made house rules for.
