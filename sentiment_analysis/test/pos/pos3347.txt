The Quad Lock system is just awesome.Affording the below features, this mount just makes it easy to use. Whether you're trying to play Pokemon Go while riding your bike or have a GPS tracking system while riding a trail system, this thing will make sure your phone is secure. While the pictures don't show it, there is a rubberized plastic insert that can be removed to allow for different sized bars. Per the description, 25.4mm uses the insert, 31.8mm does not.It only takes one bolt to mount and shouldn't take more than a few minutes to get it on your bike and ready to go.The only con I could find is with the mounting positions on my bike. I cannot move the mount outboard on my bars, as the mount doesn't fit with or without the insert. It is usable right at the stem, which works for me right now.Heads up position provides better viewing angleAerodynamic low profile designSecure dual stage lock (Patent Pending)Can be rotated for over stem mountingSuits handle-bar sizes 31.8mm and 25.4mmCompatible with all Quad Lock Cases
