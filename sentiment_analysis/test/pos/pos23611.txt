We did have one break in the driveway, but one would exspect that with glass. We have dropped them several times on wood, and concret without breaks also. It would be nice if I could buy a replacement glass. This is great for my newly 3 year old who travels with a drink everywhere she goes. We have not had spilling or leaking (and she can figure out how to make any sippy leak). I love that I can put her stainless straw in the sippy spout for at home or she can drink from it like a glass at meals.  Very versital. Bonus the packaging is great for up-cycling in preschool craft projects.
