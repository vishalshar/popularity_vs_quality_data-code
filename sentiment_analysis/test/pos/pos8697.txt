Okay, I am 65 and I love gummy vitamins. I got that way when my 5 year old grandson was living with us. I saw these and thought back to when I had tried his. LOL. I love them. I just need to make sure I only eat the prescribed amount. I wouldn't know if the label is accurate or not, but eat them I will and you will too most likely. LOL
