A mouse was discovered snacking on my stash of survival food, rice etc. 3 bags of rice were destroyed! Upset I hadn't stored them yet in the plastic totes I had. The War is on! I saw the little bugger twice looking for more but I had secured my other items. I purchased peppermint oil hoping it would move on.Saw the varmint again.So trap time arrived. I saw this Zap trap and decided to give it  try. Loaded with fresh batteries this suckers gonna fry! I baited the trap and trailed the entrance as instructed with dry cat food. Rang the dinner bell and closed the door. The next day the trail to the trap was gone and light wasn't flashing.Great! Back to Amazon search for poison. Read how it's not really safe if you have pets around. They could eat the corpse and also face the reaper. Thought about the live traps but this rodent needs to die.I checked the trap again and still no results. I left the bait inside and didn't refresh the trail. Later the following day I went into the garage for something, not even thinking about the trap, as I turned out the light I see a flashing red light! The execution had occurred!  Into a garbage bag and into the trash.No services were held next of kin has been warned! I cleaned the trap and reloaded in case there were more. Conclusion: This Zap Trap worked 100% for me. Thank you. Off to replenish some rice and Properly store it!
