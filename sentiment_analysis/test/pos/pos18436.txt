Love my Wrapadoo!! Bought this to replace a cheaper version that I had been using and I'm so glad I did!! I've used it on my wet hair after a shower, and I've used it to protect my hair when I wanted to keep it dry during a shower. It works great both ways!!! It stays on your head very securely and comfortably. It's also very absorbent. I plan on buying a few more as gifts in the future. Really nice.
