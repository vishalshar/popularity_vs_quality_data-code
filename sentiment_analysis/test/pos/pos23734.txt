Once you size the collar to your pet, the remaining length of collar goes through a little clip to help the collar stay buckled, however this clip isn't attached as a solid piece therefore it falls off the collar and then the collar becomes unbuckled.Otherwise the collar itself works great and does the job it was intended to do - help you train your pet.
