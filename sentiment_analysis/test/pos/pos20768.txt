My husband bought me a TrackR Bravo for Christmas. I am a habitual misplacer of both my keys and cell phone. The Bravo has helped me find my keys numerous times already. I am in my 60's and admittingly not the best with technology. The app is simply, elegant, and easy to understand. The volume however does leave some to be desired. Especially for for us older folks. The crowd gps is also a great feature. I left my keys at my daughters house, who also received a Bravo for Christmas. I went on the app and my keys were shown at her house. I called her and sure enough they were sitting on her kitchen table. Overall I am extremely impressed with my Bravo. I would recommend that s product to anyone who ever loses anything!
