Awesome unit, great reception in country side by our house. No major issues over the last few months of usage. Once stop communication with the base, customer service representative reset the unit remotely and keeps working fine. Good all time support and easy to use, battery life very good  (two days without needing to recharge). We love it, on our 16 month chocolate Labrador. No worries that she'll run off and we'll have trouble finding her. Love the piece of mind.
