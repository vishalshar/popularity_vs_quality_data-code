Can't say enough great things about the product.  Everything from packaging, to installation, to actually working, and to interfacing with other apps and products.  I had a skybell for about 2 weeks & spoke to customer service approximately 3 times and never got it to work & so frustrating.  I made the leap to try another & choose the August over Ring.  I have the smartlock system and connect as well and they were a breeze to set up.
