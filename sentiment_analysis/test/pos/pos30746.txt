Absolutely wonderful stuff. Have used it to fix and mend broken items, build up handles and customize grips, So many other uses to list but I can't be without it. Easy to use and adheres to surfaces well but is removable if you don't like it. Go to Sugru website for fantastic ideas. RECOMMEND FOR EVERYONE
