Since I got 3 different answers about this from the community, let me clarify this point:  This does NOT come with the adapter that is attached to the phone (or other device you are mounting).  This means, in addition to the overpriced amount this will cost you, you will need to buy the adapter, as well.  Price aside, what I like about this mount is that it is simple and versatile.  By using either the rubber rings or the more permanent zip ties, there are a lot of mounting location options.  The simplicity of the system makes mounting and unmounting the phone super easy.  What I don't like about this is that the required adapter, though thin, still makes a bulge on the back of the phone.  It also must be mounted directly to the phone and to a flat surface.  This means, to use this system, I would have to take the protective flexible phone cover off or cut a huge hole in it to mount the adapter.  Also, my phone's back is not flat; it is slightly curved.  While it does not seem like it is curved enough to prevent the adapter from being securely mounted to it, I am not entirely confident it will remain attached during the vibrations & shock of riding.
