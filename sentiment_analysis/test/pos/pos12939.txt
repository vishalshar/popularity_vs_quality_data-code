Fugoo Tough Wireless Bluetooth (Black/Silver)This definitely is a SOLIDLY-BUILT portable bluetooth speaker. My first impression was the packaging ... sturdy well designed, eye-catching box; definitely stands-out beautifully. The acrylic cover show-casing the speaker makes a classy statement "Quality".  The Fugoo Tough eye-catching black and silver color says, "See Me, Hear Me"; an unmistakeable statement of "Confidence".  Sure it is small; and yet packs an impressive 360 degree audio sound. I received my Fugoo Tough bluetooth speaker March 22, 2014. The  speaker comes with a simplistically well-designed diagram outlining speaker features.  However, you will have to go to Fugoo's website to read/download the user manual for specifics. I was surprised I did not find a user manual in the packaging, but it appears this is the future to read/download the user guide/manual.I took the time to review the diagram that came in the packaging; and also went to Fugoo's website and download the user manual to my laptop. Reading both the diagram and user guide definitely helped me to understand the pair method (pretty-much easy setup).  The contents of the Fugoo Tough packaging are neatly layer-out and easily identified. They are listed in the user manual. The following is my first-hand experience with this speaker:Bluetooth connection is easily accomplished with my devices: a. Less-than-minute - MacBook Pro Retina b. Less-than-minute - iPad Air c. Less-than-minute - iPhone 5SNow here is my experience with listening to a spectrum of music via my iPad: a. Rock - Clear and rockin' b.  Metal - Clear and heavy rockin' g. Pop - Clear and dance-like-you-don-t care c. Country - Clear and voice quality excellent d. Electronic Beats - Clear and sound effects outstanding e. Jazz - Clear and hear individually played instrumentals f.  Classical - Clear and hear individually played instrumentalsThere are many portable bluetooth speakers to choose from and I did research several speakers based on forums I read and youtube reviews. I choose Fugoo Tough for its: a. Out-Door-Ability b. Size - Easily held in hand c. Weight - Solid-weight feel d. Looks - Solid little package e. 360 spacial performance sound f. Versatility - (speaker for all my devices) g. Bluetooth - Easily connected with my Apple devicesI do hear the hype about portable bluetooth speakers and I have read forums by customers and professional critics about sound quality of these pint-size portable bluetooth speakers. Yes, any device pushed to its limit will not continuously perform well beyond its engineered design. With that said, anyone who buys into these small "Light-Weight" or "Solidly-Built" bluetooth speakers should realize they will not get the same loud sound volume as in the bigger portable bluetooth speakers; or else they would have bought bigger portable bluetooth speakers. Given todays technology, speakers of the future will still be considered expensive, but again that is marketing the supply and demand of who controls the technology and the customers appetite for more.In conclusion, Fugoo represents its product well in looks and operability.  For me, I knew I bought into an expensively small speaker; but I wanted a small, sturdy, solidly-built portable bluetooth speaker and I found it in Fugoo Tough. Also, all the features and versatility was a plus. I use this speaker for all my apple devices at home and I like the idea of "Solidly-Built-Portability" for on-the-go. I am an outdoors person and this speaker feels, "Tough-Enough" to-go biking, camping, picnicking, or just for outing in general (I will use this speaker for outdoors activities). I give this Fugoo Tough portable bluetooth speaker 5 stars for good looks, solid-built, and out-door-ability. Last of all, there are three models to choose from. And these speakers can be dressed-up with accessories for various looks, functionality, and portability. Go to Fugoo's website to view these accessories.
