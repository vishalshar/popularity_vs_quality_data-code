Awesome product! Looks great, feels great, and it came in a cool case that I have been reusing. I am really happy this product. I power use it for my Samsung Note 3 and my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tablet. I would definitely recommend this product to someone who needs a replacement charger for their phone, because once you use it as a wall charger, it still functions as an on-the-go portable charger. Five Stars!
