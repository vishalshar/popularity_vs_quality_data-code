I am really enjoying my game golf experience. The game golf live has given me really good insights into a number of parts of my game. Firstly club distances - I'm starting to learn what my true distances are and the results are more shots on target or at least the right length - even a little more confidence when taking the shot as I feel much better about club selection.I am also really enjoying the strokes gained feature that game golf created. It  is showing me clearly in numbers where I need to work - yet again I had a sense that my chipping was average at best but it clearly showed this for me in numbers. I plan on focusing my practice on this part of my game over the coming months and hope to lower my score by 4-5 shots per round over the summer. Also the rangefinder on the app is useful to quickly check distances to the front, center and back of the green. Overall I think it's a great product for anyone looking to improve or get more enjoyment from the game.
