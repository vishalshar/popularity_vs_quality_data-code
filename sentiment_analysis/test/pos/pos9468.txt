Our family has been using this brand for years now. Everyone really likes them. I buy the adult version and only give 4 to our kids. This was recommended by the company as a great substitute rather than buying a separate bottle of the children's ones in addition to these. Saves me time, space and money. To be clear, I specifically questioned the ingredient/DV breakdown between the two varieties. They are exactly the same per vitamin. Definitely appreciate the folate in L-methylfolate form. I have tried a few different gummy vitamins over the years and these taste great to us. I do think they could get away with subtracting a gram or two of sugar and not lose out on taste. I have found the best way give these is 3 in the morning and 3 in the evening (or 2 and 2 for the kids). Especially for those worried about sugar in the morning. I will definitely keep purchasing these. I especially appreciate the lightning deals. I stock up then :) My only question is how Costco fits 60 more vitamins in the same size bottle that I just got from Amazon. I switch back and forth depending on price. The Amazon bottle was just opened now and is very full. They appear to be the same size vitamin. Sorry, that last part isn't really too concerning. I just noticed it today after opening the bottle. I'll add pictures later.
