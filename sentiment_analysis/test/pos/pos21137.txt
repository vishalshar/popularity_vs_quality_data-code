These reseal bags exceeded my expectations.  I use at least 3 of them everyday in my lunch and often on the weekends.  Love that I am no longer add wasting money and filling the landfill with baggies.They are really easy to clean and open, but have a strong seal.  I highly recommend these if you are looking for a durable, easy to seal & open strong option.  I will be ordering some more for my family to use.
