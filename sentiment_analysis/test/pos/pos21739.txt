I ordered a different holster for my own car and when my wife broke the same one I currently have, I replaced it with this one. I like it better than the one I have because it's less bulky and the mechanism for placing and removing your phone is pretty nice. The ratchet system is not perfect though - if you don't press both sides equally to release your device then one side will stick out further than the other which does not prevent the mount from working to hold your phone, but can be bothersome if you're obsessive compulsive.
