I have a 98 Chevy Blazer and the cd slot is too wide for the phone Holder to fit securely. It would slip right out...I had to attach the included silicone pads (meant for the phone brackets) to the holder cd slot connectors and that made it thick enough to fit in the cd player slot snugly.It now is secure in place. 5 stars for the actual phone locking side arms- they grip the phone tighter than any other car holder I've used. No more falling phone when I hit bug bumps in the road! Easy one-handed release, too.Used with Samsung Galaxy Note 5
