Very well made and comfortable. Easy to adjust lenses to your desired setting. The iPhone 6 fits perfectly. The iPhone 6 plus is a very tight fit but works. So there is no issue with the product itself, but the iPhone picture quality is the real limitation. It's like watching an old color TV from the 70s. Until the phone picture quality noticeably improves I don't recommend VR headsets at all. If you are determined to get one then this a great one to go with.
