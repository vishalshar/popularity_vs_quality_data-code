I own several pairs of SPD sneakers, and i never thought i would need these adapters. But, there are lots of times that i am out with my bicycle and i forget to grab my shoes (i change my shoes a lot for work purposes) and this is something i did need. I wont get into why only ride dual sided SPD pedals with out platforms on all of my bikes, but that is the reason i would need something like these adapters.I have never been jazzed about clipless platform adapters or half platform half clipless pedals. After meeting the owner of Anykicks at a local bicycle race, he showed me these platform adapters and told me they were made locally. I liked these adapters because they are grippy and they include toe straps. i cant say enough about how well these work and they are decently priced for what you get and it includes mounting hardware for most SPD and Road cleats.
