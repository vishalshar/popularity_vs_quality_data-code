Great silicone case,grips onto iPad very well.The handle is great my kids grab it and run!!!Atleast I won't have to worry about it shattering.Since he has already dropped it 8 times.down the stairs, against tile/ concrete  and it still perfect case doesn't even get marked recommend this product to anyone
