These are pretty awesome.  I love the button in the ear that allows you to pause/play and change songs.  The volume could be a little louder though.  And it was a little buggy with my phone, where if I paused it for a long period of time, my music wouldn't start playing again just by using the button on the speakers.  So far, I've taken them on one 3-day ski trip and they have held up.  .
