I purchased both Mip Robot and MiPOsaur for my twin boys.  They are fun to play with as a novelty, and controlling them with a tablet / phone could not be easier.  MiP can actually carry a can of soda on it's tray and deliver it to someone - very impressive balancing.  There is a battle option between the MiP and MipOsaur - but in our scenario, the MiPOsaur never took any damage no matter what we did, and MiP Robot lost every time.  Between the two, I think the boys have more fun playing with the MiPOsaur, but I am more impressed by MiP Robot from a technical point of view.
