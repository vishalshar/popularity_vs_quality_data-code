Last year we moved to a house on a golf course.  We wanted to give our two cats access to the outdoors, but wanted them to stay off the golf course.  We installed the invisible fence several months ago and I wanted to give it time before doing a review.Our conclusion:  the invisible fence DOES work!  Our cats stay within the fence boundaries now.  We did train them as the instructions tell you.  We started by getting them used to the collars, then taking them out on leashes for short periods, establishing the boundaries by letting them get "zapped".  (They overreact the first time or two, as cats are wont to do.)  They learned quickly, and soon only needed to hear the beep to know they were going too far.  However, our one cat is smarter and much more strong-willed than the other, and also fancies herself as quite the escape artist. Once they were allowed outside "unsupervised" and off-leash, she did start jumping the barrier.  At that point we thought maybe the whole thing was going to be a failure. But as the instructions say, I turned up the "juice" on her collar to a stronger setting (#3) and increased the barrier width.  This worked and she has not escaped again.  She now seems perfectly content to stay within the boundaries. Eventually you remove the barrier flags...I left ours up for about a month, then removed them at intervals.  They remember!I am so glad that we decided to try this.  It is nice to let the cats have access to the sunshine, grass, and fresh air.  I would recommend it, but definitely don't try to cut corners with the training.  Take the time to do it right.  It may be time-consuming and a bit frustrating at first, but with consistency and follow-through, your cat(s) can be trained.I also want to mention that our cats are quite small (about 6 1/2 lbs. and 8 lbs) and I thought the collar size would be a real issue.  But they got used to them very quickly.  In fact, when I get their collars out and tell them they can go outside, they come running and stand there and let me put them on.  They associate it with going outside.Just as a side-note, we do not leave them out when we are gone, or at night.UPDATE AFTER ANOTHER FEW MONTHS:  It's still working great!  There have been a couple times when I've been lazy and not put the collar(s) on the cat(s) and, boy do they know it!  They will go past the boundaries if they don't have their collar on.  But with their collars on, they are staying where they belong.ALSO, you can get the collar batteries (CR1/3N size) in less expensive bulk packs. Just pop the little tabs off the black plastic holder that keeps the battery in and then use a needle-nose pliers to pull out the old battery.  No need to spend a lot on special batteries.
