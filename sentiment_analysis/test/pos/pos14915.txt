Yet another amazing product from Massage Track! I suffer from migraines. I have used the Neck Track at the onset of migraines and have found amazing pain relief. It works fantastically to massage the oxcipital ridge, the ridge between the neck and skull. It melts away tension and gets all the tension out of your neck! Also, the Neck Track is elevated so that you don't have to lean your head back to get your neck on the massage track balls! If you suffer from headaches and neck stiffness, I highly suggest you try this out!
