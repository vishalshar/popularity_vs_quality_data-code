Canary is a sleek and easy to use home security system. It takes 2 minutes to install, and once installed, your entire home can be seen in the palm of your hand (on your smartphone). Canary provides the security to feel safe and comfortable coming home to an empty apartment and I am able to keep an eye on my things when I am not home.  Additionally, the temperature and air quality features are important to healthy and safe living.
