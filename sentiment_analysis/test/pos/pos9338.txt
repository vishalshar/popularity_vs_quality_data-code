Great for children (with adult supervision) who use this outside. Grandchildren had to download apps for iPhone, etc. Ollie rolls on floors, grass etc -- you'd think there was a hamster inside on a treadmill carrying a flashlight!Did not try the Sphere version out of concern the plastic ball might have slipped when outside -- theoretical only.
