OVERVIEW:For every phone I have, including my current iPhone 5, I usually end up buying at least 10 cases, and I'm constantly searching the web for new ones.  This is in part becasue I'm very picky, but it's also because I like to have difference cases for different situations: sometimes I need something rugged, sometimes I need something slim, and sometimes I just want something that looks cool.  I have cases that offer more protection and others that have a sleeker form factor, but in my opinion, this the most all-rounded iPhone 5 case I have come across yet.  It is currently my main day-to-day case.FUNCTIONALITYThis is where this case shines.  The RokForm cases are designed around the concept of an entire ecosystem of accessories that allow your iPhone to be mounted for any situation, and this case fulfills that promise admirably.  There are a myriad of accessories you can purchase from Rokform, but I'll focus on the main ones.  First and foremost, this case comes with the magnet kit (it didn't in the iPhone 4S version).  The magnet sits at the back of the case inside the rubber piece and allows your phone to be mounted onto anything metal.  This is a strong magnet and will hold your phone *very* securely.  I was initially concerned that the magnet was too strong and would interfere with my phone's functioning, but this has not been the case.  This magnetic mounting functionality has been very handy in many settings in my experience (e.g I mount mine to the fridge to play music while I wash the dishes).  You can also buy magnets from Rokform that you can stick on things that aren't metal so that you can still use the magnetic mounting.  Next, the phone comes with a "Remote Mounting System" piece.  This is essentially a plastic piece that can be mounted on any flat surface (it has a strong 3M adhesive on the back), and it locks into the opening at the center of the case's back. I've found this mounting system to be very secure but less convenient than the magnetic system, because it only works with the RMS pieces from Rokform, and you only get one with the case (I put mine in my car so I could use my phone as a GPS).  Also worth mentioning, that rubber piece on the back of the case stops your phone from sliding around and also cushions some of the impact if you set your phone down a little too hard.  Last thing I want to mention is the sports clip from Rokform. It's just a very solid clip that locks into the back of the case, but I've found it very useful.  Oftentimes I don't want to put my phone in my pocket because of the bulge or because I don't have pockets (e.g. sports shorts); normally, this would call for a bulky holster, but with this case, I can just snap on the clip and nothing more.  I almost took this for granted, but I should mention that you have perfect access to all the sensors, buttons, switch, camera, and flash.  The phone fits snugly, perfectly inside the case.Grade: A+PROTECTIONThis case offers excellent protection, but it is by no means the ultimate solution in ruggedness. The front of the case has a good raised edge such that you will have no concerns laying your phone face down (yet it's not so raised that it impedes typing or use in any way). The back of the case has all those raised ridges such that the exposed portions of the back of your phone (the Apple logo and camera lens) won't come close to being scratched by any surface you lay your phone on. The inside of the case has a very thin layer of fabric that ensures your phone will not be scratched by the case itself or any sand/particles that get into the case. This phone does fall short, where protection is concerned, of cases like the Otterbox Defender (which I also own) in few ways.  It lacks a built-in screen protector, and instead comes with a standard stick-on screen protector.  Personally, I prefer not to have the built-in protectors because there's always some space between it and the actual screening thereby making typing slightly less satisfying, but it's undeniably that have a shield built into the front of a case would offer better protection against particles/liquid getting into the exposed openings/buttons/edges. Also, the Otterbox Defender has a much more extensive shock-absorbing system.  The Rokshield does come with a removable rubber bumper, but it does little to protect against impact from the back. This is, of course, why the Otterbox is so chunky, but this portion of the review is strictly about protection.Grade: A-FORM FACTORFor a phone that is trying to do so much and offer so much protection, the Rokshield is surprisingly sleek.  While not comparable to the slim snap-on/glider cases (I have the ones from Case Crown and Elago), it does feel comparable to the Speck Candyshell case, and it is certainly far slimmer than cases like the Otterbox Defender. The raised edge at the front of the case I mentioned under "protection" does not affect typing or use in any way.  The material the case is made of is itself a little slippery: not as slippery as a gloss finish but not as grippy as a matte finish; however, the ridges at the back of the case make carrying your phone easy with no real danger of it slipping out of your hand. (I should note, this assessment is for the case WITHOUT the removable rubber bumper, because I feel it doesn't add that much extra protection and yet makes the case much uglier).Grade: ASTYLEA very subjective category, obviously, so I won't assign a grade, but I think the Rokshield looks great and unique.  If you had the iPhone 4S version, you will notice that far less of the back of the phone is exposed in this version; I sort of liked the old exoskeleton-like look, but I appreciate the added protection.Grade: N/ACOST/VALUESadly, this is where the Rokshield fails. The case itself is expensive, but it is comparable to other similar cases; however, to fully utilize the case to its full potential, you need to purchase a slew of accessories which cost dearly.  I purchased the clip, a LilRok (magnetic mount), a lanyard, and a RokDock (a dock that Rokform makes that will fit this case; I didn't mention it because it is customizable and will fit almost any case).  Those few things came out to roughly 3x the price of the case itself.  Honestly, I felt like the quality of the case and the accessories were superb and worth it, but the price was certainly very steep.Grade: B-SUMMARY:All in all, I found this case to be a perfect balance of functionality, protection, and form factor.  I would highly recommend it.Grade: A
