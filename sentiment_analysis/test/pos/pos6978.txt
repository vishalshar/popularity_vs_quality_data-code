Revised my review. I'm using this thing a ton and really enjoying it.I got my Glyph almost a week ago, and I've been using it a ton. Bottom line up front: I really, really like this thing a lot, and glad I took a chance on it. It's perfect for me. There's some stuff I wish it did/did better, but overall, this thing is the real deal, and there are several situations where I'll reach for my Glyph rather than turn on my TV.First up, the unboxing. I have learned not to get excited about anything I buy online, because if the build quality seems lacking when I first unbox the thing, I immediately return it. Glyph build quality is exceptional; materials chosen and tolerances between the pieces all feel very thoughtful and solid.Setup was a snap. I guess literallyyou just snap the best fitting nosepiece in and follow the instructions to set it up. A quick view of a video beforehand and you'll have this thing dialed in seconds. Since you're basically SHOOTING A PICTURE INTO YOUR EYEBALLS it's important to get the lenses lined up and focused just right. Didn't take long to figure it out, though I would have liked the lenses to have a little play up and down to get the positioning just right on my giant, misshapen noggin.Sound quality is fantastic. All my laptops, tables, smartphones have largely ruined my aural tastes, so really experiencing the richness of a full audio track with the Glyph was a treat. I watch a lot of Amazon TV on my iPad, and these headphones on their own radically changed my viewing experience. They don't have noise canceling, but they definitely canceled the noise in my roomthese ear pads are thick and comfy. Unless you're geeking out in your mancave with 87 speakers creating a sumptuous net of pure audio perfection, I think the Glyph is gonna deliver a better audio experience than what you're used to.The picture is good. Good enough that I will often use my Glyph instead of a TV or tablet. But not so good that I want to get rid of my TV forever. I had fantasies about never taking these things off and walking around like Jordy Laforge and Lobot's lovechild. I was hoping for a wider viewing angle; something that felt a little more "in your face." This feels like someone's holding a screen the size of an index card about eight inches from my nose. So immediately and invariably better than watching anything on my iPhone or iPad mini, but not as immersive as a movie screen or a big TV. What's great about it is that the picture I described is always floating in front of your face. I wasn't expecting to love this as much as I did, but watching TV shows in bed is amazing now. I can lay around however I'm comfy and always see the show, since, again, YOU'RE SHOOTING A PICTURE INTO YOUR EYEBALLS.About that- I found the viewing experience to be much less of a strain than a TV or non-retina display. So there you go.Here's how I'm using the Glyph most often: TV in bed, as I mentioned. Any time I would have watched long content on a mobile device, the Glyph is a way better choice because of the sound and picture, but also for the ergonomics. Which brings me to air travel: I do a lot of it, and will never fly without my Glyph again. Remember how I said the picture feels like someone's holding a card about eight inches from my face? That is the exact optimal experience for watching stuff on a screen while in flight. If I watch a movie on my laptop or iPad, or the airplane's screens, I always end up with a sore neck. Glyph fixes that. And sounds great. Any time I woulda watched the hotel room TV or a movie on my laptop, I will now watch the Glyph instead. Any time I want to watch Walking Dead before my kids are in bed without exposing them to zombie gore and gunfire, out comes the Glyph. I wanted this thing to replace my work monitor, but it won't do that...it's just not great to work on. I wanted it to replace the movie theater, but that was probably an unrealistic expectation. Still, a very cool, fully-realized product that's gonna get a lot of use around here.
