I own custom built wifi camera made from RaspberyPI+WebCam, but it only works with my Android and not with wife iphone.With the spring break here we decided we need another camera immediately to monitor our and neighbor kids playing upstairs, so after initial research I settled on this one, dropcam might have few more bells and whistles, but this one whole 50 bucks cheaper and have all the features I want from it.Received this morning and configured it immediately.Setup was a breeze and build quality is rock solid, manually switched it to night mode and video quality is amazing, much better than my 1080p webcam connected to raspberyPI, tho in day mode 1080p is better but also slower to stream full quality over internet.All in all it is working for about an hour now with no problems and with wide angle I can see the whole room. App is simple to use and app design is nice.Will update the review if there will be any problems.P.S. For the one reviewer with blurry image, are you sure you removed protective plastic film that is on the lens?
