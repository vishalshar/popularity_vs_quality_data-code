We ordered a Starling for our friends as gift and they love it!!  When they first started tracking the words spoken to their baby they quickly realized how little they were actually saying prior to utilizing Starling.  They assumed they were but the data showed it trailed off throughout the day.They've steadily increased the reading times for the baby and talking her through their daily routine for association.  When we first gave them the Starling we provided them information on the research and data that went into the development; they appreciated reading the research and they committed to utilizing Starling on a daily basis.  They send us pictures of her wearing Starling and screen shots of the app, they are so proud when they exceed another milestone in the words spoken for the day as they know its all benefiting her develop.  We have a baby on the way and we've begun reading and playing music...we look forward to using Startling in the early part of his life to help with his development.
