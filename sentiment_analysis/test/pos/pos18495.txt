Works great for my home theater. I use this to control all my devices, Fios box, A/V receiver, Blue ray and projector. They are constantly making improvements to the APP and every update has made the experience better. I use this on my iPhone 6S plus, multiple iPads, Android tablet and my Apple watch. Have to admit controlling everything from my watch is pretty damn cool.
