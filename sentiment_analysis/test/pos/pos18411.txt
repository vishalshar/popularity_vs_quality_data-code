I have been helping my father a lot lately with handy man kind of stuff. Me being a programmer and a computer nerd my whole life, things that require a tape measure are foreign to me. Reading a tape measure is just a task I was not wanting to sit down and figure out. So, I decided to get one of these! It's definitely a life saver, helps me keep up with my old man. I use it on a "when required" basis, because I do not want to drop it! It's not as heavy duty as a classical tape measure. However, it does exactly what is described. Worth the purchase 100%!
