I made my first batch of flatbread last night with this product.  I am on a gluten-free diet and have tried every single solitary gluten free bread out there, plus a few mixes.  I was losing hope that I would ever actually like one.  My husband (who is NOT gluten sensitive, but who adores me enough to sacrifice with me) and I both LOVED this bread.  It's not wheat, but is definitely the next best thing that I have found.  Not only are the ingredients wholesome as opposed to so much of the processed gluten free products on the market these days full of corn starch or other equally obnoxious fillers - who wants to eat a cup of cornstarch!  Just because it's gluten free doesn't make it healthy.  Anyway, this was ridiculously easy...dump all the ingredients that you probably already have in your pantry in a bowl and spread it out on a cookie sheet for the flatbread style and bake 20 minutes.  Seriously!  What other bread could you have in that length of time - no kneading, no rising, no waiting.  We had our first organic brandywine tomato from our garden as a sandwich last night and I was fully satisfied that I had had a real sandwich.  I just ordered 4 more boxes.  I highly recommend this company's product.  I also love their gf saltines.
