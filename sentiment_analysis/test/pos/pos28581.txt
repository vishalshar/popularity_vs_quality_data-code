I bought the double chocolate happiness cookies  and the mini bags of chocolate chip love.  Both cookies are AMAZING! DELICIOUS!  That they are gluten free and organic is a huge plus, and they are far tastier than the less healthy alternatives. The chocolate chip mini-bags are the perfect portion- controlled serving for me, as they are so good I otherwise eat several at a time!
