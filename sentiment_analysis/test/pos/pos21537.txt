I have been a user of D-Link cameras for a few years, and I got this to replace a DCS-932L.  The camera installed without any issues... and this is the first HD 180 degree camera in my system...  the picture is very clear, but can sometimes appear a little distorted due to the 108 degree view... but I did not get the camera to just watch... it is to capture security images.  One thing I do like, is that there are no flashing lights on the front, unlike the DCS-932L which has a flashing light on the front... and the night lights do not appear as bright, making this camera less visible.
