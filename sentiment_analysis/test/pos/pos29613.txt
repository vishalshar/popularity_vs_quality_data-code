Really love this healthy alternative to rice cereal! Our baby is having a difficult time gaining weight so we have had to turn to rice cereal in the bottles for extra calories. I'm not a fan of the rice cereal, but I am out of options. My baby really likes this quinoa which we spoon feed to him. I tried putting it in bottles in place of the rice cereal but I have found that it is extremely difficult to get all the clumps out so it does not come out well in a bottle. My baby is 4 months and 1 week (born 3 weeks early) and he is tolerating this just fine.
