If you are looking for an economical investment I don't think this is the way to go in purchasing your mushrooms.  If you are looking for an awesome gift I highly recommend this product.  My husband got two harvest out of the box.  It was fun for the entire family to watch them sprout & grow.  When it came time to harvest the mushrooms, it was a family event.  From the box to the cooking pan. Yes, I could have bought mushrooms from the store cheaper, but the experience was fun & educational.
