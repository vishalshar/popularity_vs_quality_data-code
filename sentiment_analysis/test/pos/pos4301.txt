This is a great item if you want to be more aware of your breathing and activity. I find that I can calm down easily and quickly after I receive a notification that I am tense. The steps feature means you don't also have to wear a pedometer or additional activity monitor. This has definitely helped me become more mindful. I like it so much, I bought two more - one for my sister and one for my mother.
