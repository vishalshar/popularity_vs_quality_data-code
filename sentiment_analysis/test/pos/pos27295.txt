My previous brewing experience has been in extract brewing and with borrowed equipment. I also have made wine. When I started growing my own hops I knew I wanted to buy my own setup and after reading a bit more about what was available I knew I wanted to move to all grain. This is my first amazon rating, but I was annoyed by the guy who gave this a one star without having actually tried it or knowing how it worked, so I felt compelled to share my very positive experience.I ended up deciding to purchase the zymatic rather than a full all grain setup because I added up everything I thought I would need for all grain brewing and it didn't seem too crazy far off of the cost of the zymatic, plus I was enchanted by the connectivity and community aspect of the unit, particularly the globe that lets you see what people are brewing right now and in a previous time window. I was also interested in using it for sous vide and frankly I wanted to save time and still get to learn more about beer making!My first experiences were a little frustrating as some of the instructions are hard for the uninitiated to follow. However, when I checked in the online forums I found every single question I had was answered in the beginner section...so a word of advice: don't be too hasty (like me) when your unit arrives, check that beginner section of the forum out BEFORE you start (unlike me). Also, if picobrew folks are reading this, it would be really awesome if we could get our unit ID and create the account when the product ships so we can get all psyched reading the forums and be ready when it arrives :)Brewing with this has been awesome and I've already gotten so addicted that I bought a second keg so I can brew again while one batch is fermenting. I realize I could just use a carboy but I like that the keg is self sanitizing since it is used in the boil. I've been reading tons of recipes and information about the science behind the timing and temperature of mashing and am looking forward to playing with different settings.I just want to caution anyone who is considering this because they think they'll save money on beer and/or thinks it'll be super easy like a bread machine. It is certainly not cheap to buy the ingredients, even in bulk, and given the tiny margins you'll get it would take a long time to "pay off" the machine and all of the other items you'll need for bottling/kegging, taking measurements, controlling fermentation temp, and sanitizing. While it is less time consuming than any beer making I've done before, especially when it comes to cleaning time, it still does take a good amount of time to get everything going, the large pieces are a bit awkward to clean, there tends to be a medium to heavy amount of foam that gets in and around the machine, and the cages and screens tend to trap ingredients inside them pretty well. Once your brewing session is done the process is roughly what it would be for any beer to ferment and bottle or keg.
