I'm no expert on flying, but my first flight today was in high winds and went great! I left it in beginner mode for obvious reasons, and got used to everything (which doesn't take long if you watch any YouTube videos on it.) I even put it to the follow mode and it did perfectly. Great price, great product, and I'm very happy with it. I already ordered a second battery. I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting to upgrade from cheap toy drones.
