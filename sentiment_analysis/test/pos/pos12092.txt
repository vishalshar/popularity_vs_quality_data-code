I ordered this late Friday afternoon and said it would arrive on Tuesday, I was fine with that.  It arrived today Monday.  A day early.  After reading some of the terrible reviews I was hoping I did the right thing ordering.  I am a happy Camper right now, set it  up right out of the box and sent A couple test Alerts and all went well, it hasn't fallen off as someone said, it is comfortable to wear, don't really know I have it on.
