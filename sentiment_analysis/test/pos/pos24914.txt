I bought this and some other Anki Overdrive stuff for my grandsons birthday.once we got the tablet and the system to sync up he loved it.first item that actually gets used since the tablet. expensive setup but smiles and laughsare worth the price. anki support is GREAT they walk you through everything if you are not a digital whiz.
