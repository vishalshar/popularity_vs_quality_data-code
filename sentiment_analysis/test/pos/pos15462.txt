Very clear instructions. Arrived and 15 minutes later it was fully set up and ready to roll. Used my phone to set everything up and set off the alarm I was concerned about if it would be loud enough and it scared the heck out of me it's very loud for my 2 bed 2 bath home. However I'll be installing it in an RV so I'm plenty cover on hearing it. It immediately sends a notification to my phone. I am amazed at how user friendly it is! It also comes with window security decals and I loved that because that's 90% of what deters people. I didn't not by the camera with this because I found one cheaper with better features but all together with this package as a whole there is no buyers remorse. I feel secure and confident that I will sleep safely no matter where I go to work in my RV!
