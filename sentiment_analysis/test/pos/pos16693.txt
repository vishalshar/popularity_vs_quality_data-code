I bought some & loved the taste of the Inca seeds. The plant based protein that is sold now has hemp in it & taste terrible. Inca seed protein should be a big hit. The Omega 3 & protein Inca seeds are considered a supper food. I have cancer & am on a strict diet but can eat Inca Snacks because of the health benefits.
