This little thing is amazing! I was seriously considering ordering ANOTHER external hard drive because my MacBook Air kept telling me that my "startup disk is almost full".I was a bit wary about "pearing" but it was actually very straightforward. (make sure you have a backup of your disk!)I wasn't worried about not being able to use my SD slot since I rarely use it. (You can get a usb reader for less than $10 if you desperately need one.)Definitely worth the money. I'm pretty sure I've even convinced one of my co-workers to get one.
