Easily the most comfortable and well designed mice I've ever had. I've used a few different mice for FPS gaming such as the Razer Deathadder, Logitech G303 and the Final Mouse, but the Castor has completely blown me away. The shape of it goes perfectly with my hand, unlike the G303 for example that has a very flat shape on top. The Mionix Sargas 900 is another good buy if you need a good quality desk pad.
