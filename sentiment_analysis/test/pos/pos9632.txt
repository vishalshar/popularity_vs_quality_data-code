Quality smart suitcase for a reasonable price. I travel all over the world with my carry-on case so I do not mind spending a little more for a quality case that will last a while. For $400 I expect my case to last at least a few years, and thats a few hundred flights for me. I just purchased the case so I couldnt tell you if it will last that long but it certainly feels like the quality is high enough for it. Solid zippers, solid electronic locking mechanism, solid wheels and wheel base, solid handle.The smart part is very cool. Connected to my phone just fine and the GPS thing gives me peace of mind Ive never been able to get before this. Electronics work, battery for charging is great (and lasts a very long time). Scale works perfectly. The locking mechanism is super smooth and easy. TSA can get into it if they need.The case is definitely not a toy you would buy out of a magazine as a cool new gadget. Its a legit suitcase with legit smart technology.Pros:- Feels like quality material and a solid design- Connectivity is great- GPS is great- Other electronics are great- Battery is great- Overall solid feel- Reasonable priceCons:- I guess the battery or other electronics take up a lot of space because its got a slightly smaller capacity than a normal dumb carry-on case. Definitely enough room for a long weekend though.- Apparently you cant check the type of battery in this case, but I hardly ever check my bag, so I cannot comment on that.Overall a good purchase.
