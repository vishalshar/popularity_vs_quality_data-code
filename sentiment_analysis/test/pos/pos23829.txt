This is an amazing product. My 8 year old loves it and I think it is fantastic.My reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is due to the problem with the battery. I had the same issue as another reviewer. When charging the battery the light blinked green and red rather than just one color. The battery never charged. I took it apart and reset the battery numerous times with no success. When I called customer support they were helpful and shipped a new battery. I was a bit disappointed that the new battery took 9 days to arrive. For a known battery issue I expected a quicker turn around time.I would highly recommend this toy, but if it is a gift, I would recommend opening it up in advance and try to charge the battery before presenting it to a child who could be disappointed with a new toy that has to sit on the shelf while waiting for a new battery.  This way you could get a new battery shipped and charged before presenting the gift.I also wish I could find some tutorials for the coding/programming features. My son is experimenting with it and figuring out a few things, but I with there were some more instructions available.Overall my son and I are very excited about this toy.
