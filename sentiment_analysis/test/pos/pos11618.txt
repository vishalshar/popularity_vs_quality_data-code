I am 24 and have always wanted to learn to play guitar, so after winning my fantasy football league this year and taking home some nice prize money, I decided to buy the Jamstik+. I've had it about a week now and I am so happy I made the decision to get it. Already I have learned a few basic chords and can start to play some easier songs. The progress I have been able to make in such a short amount of time has me excited to keep going.I have had no latency issues using the jamstik with my ipad.
