Everything works great: the battery lasts all day with regular use, the screen isn't lacking (although rough on contrast) and it can hold plenty of apps. The camera is interpolated from 2.3MP up to 5 and does not focus, which is expected for the price point. (It still works well with detachable macro / wide angle lenses) 4G networking actually works on sub-AT&T GSM networks like Consumer Cellular.  Overall it is awesome considering the current price. The phone doesn't get hot from charging or use, and yet it is not slow compared to other similar phones with the same 1GHz chipset. The one and only thing that is lacking is the flashlight; it is the most dim flashlight I've ever seen on any phone, but it's still helpful in pure darkness and with video.(side note) One out of 2 ordered came with a small black half-circle on the right side of the screen and, when it was pressed just to put the phone in its case the screen cracked from the inside. The other phone is flawless.
