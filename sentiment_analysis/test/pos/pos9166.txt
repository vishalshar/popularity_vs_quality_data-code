As a longtime Minecraft player, this band is something neat that caught my eye one day so I picked it up to keep in my daily bag in case I wanted to play.  Overall the software is neat, you can add your own custom animations to the LED display, they offer a free year of cloud backups for your worlds that you save on the band so that is something good to have in case you either lose it or it suddenly breaks.  Loading times are a bit slower than a laptop, but not much.  Transfer speeds are typical for USB 3.0.Only issues are that the max capacity of this band is 8GB, which for the most part won't be a problem, but I have large worlds from servers I used to play on that I would have liked to carry, but they are around 4GB each so I can only have one with me at a time.  Also there is some inconsistencies with how long the band holds a charge, I've had it go dead after a week with only sitting in my bag, and other times I left it in there for a couple months and it lights right up when hitting the button.
