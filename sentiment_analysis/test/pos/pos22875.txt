My nephew was very jealous of his sister having a bell on her new bike so I grabbed this one for his bike.  It works great,  At first it was hard for him to press the button to make the sound but after putting some WD 40 on it, he has no problems getting it to ring now!  I think you could hear the two of them coming several blocks away!
