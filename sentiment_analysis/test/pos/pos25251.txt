Sill have coworkers trying to trip my drink....unsuccessfully! I dont use a straw with it, but it has a close lid for safety. Havent need it though. I will say...one time I put it on top of my car before getting in and forgot it there....luckily I live in a cul de sac so when I was driving out I saw it fly off( not a flat surface!) and it still survived that! highly recommend it.
