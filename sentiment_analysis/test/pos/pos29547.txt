We purchased this product as a family Christmas gift. I was looking forward to seeing everyone rock out. I downloaded the app on iOS and again on Android because at first I thought I was doing something wrong. It eventually occurred to me that we received an Air Jamz with a dead battery. So, here it is January 5th and we still haven't had the chance to try this out ?.********UPDATE********Zivix company reached out to me immediately after I posted the above. They apologized for the unfortunate dead battery issues and they rectified this immediately with us! With no time at all we received battery replacements and we're rocking out!!My 16 year old son loves this app and I feel this is considered an early release product, as further feedback will assist the company and the software applications in their growth in their products, software applications, and company as a whole. So far, a great company made up of wonderful people to work with.
