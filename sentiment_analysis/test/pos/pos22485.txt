I got this sheet for the top bunk bed. I thought it was so clever to not have to pull the mattress off the top bunk to yank the fitted sheet off. I also wanted a fitted sheet that wasn't very deep since I got about a 7 inch deep mattress, and this fits snugly, so I wouldn't recommend it for pillow tops or deep mattresses.  So far the product is as promised. I find it a little frustrating that it doesn't come with a flat sheet in the set so you have to search to buy one separately, which is annoying (but it's not like they advertised a set so im not saying anything is "wrong" with the product in that regard). It's also a bit difficult to find a good mattress protector that you can also wash without having to take the whole thing off. So I ended up getting just a flat pad about crib sized to put under the zip portion, and that can just be taken off with the zip part for easy washing. I'll update if something gets worn out or changes.
