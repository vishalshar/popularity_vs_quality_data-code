Fast shipping, received in a few days after ordering.First time assembling will take you about 30-40 minutes.  After that, about 10-15 minutes.  Very easy to setup.  Constantly getting questions anytime people are around.Very lightweight, sturdy.  At times, I do feel like I could tip over, moreso than a regular kayak when making an aggressive turn.  This would be the only con.This kayak easily fits into my coupe along with another inflatable (AdvancedFrame, which I also recommend).Overall I would recommend this product.  I think the AdvancedFrame is probably better suited for me but for someone experienced in Kayaks, they would take more joy and appreciate the Oru Kayak.
