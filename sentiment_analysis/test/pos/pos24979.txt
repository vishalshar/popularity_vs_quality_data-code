Really enjoying the phone. Its a head turner for sure and the clean operating system runs smooth most of the time. As a new company it seems Nexbit is working through some bugs and its more than I would tolerate with a more costly more well established brand, but I see what they are doing and I think this phone will get better and better as time goes.
