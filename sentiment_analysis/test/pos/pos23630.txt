Fantastic. It is exactly as promised. Vegetable tanned leather from Horween!I had the Apple leather case and I liked it, but this Nomad one feels noticeably better in the hand. It is slightly thicker than the Apple one and it has full wrap around coverage on the bottom (around the speaker and audio jack).It is vegetable tanned leather so it scratches easily but it's an analine leather so it's that oily type and the scratches rub out. The appeal if a real leather case is that dents and scratches are beautiful.I had it for a week so far and I dropped my phone and it landed right against the sharp edge of a wood table. It dented and had scratches all over it. By the end of the day, scratches were gone. Dents are still there but they look awesome. The wood table edge being sharp and the angle it hit actually cut the leather down to the polycarbonate shell in one spot. I just pushed the leather back and rubbed it for a bit. Problem solved.Check the picture.That's the power of quality leather. That picture is one week of wear.Only negative I can think of is lack of color choices. It comes in a burnished brown finish and I'd live to see something like a Horween Natural Essex version.I paid full price happily. I didn't get it for free or nothing. Hope this helps you decide!
