Let me start out by saying that I am a VFX Industry professional (and a cinephile) so I have high expectations for any product that deals with media display. I bought the RIF6 Cube for myself and my family and I can honestly say Im blown away. The unit is extremely compact, well designed, and feels very durable. From the cube itself to the mount and stand - it's all solidly crafted without any cheap flimsy parts or loose connections. One of the features I have already found to be very useful is the tripod; with it's flexible "prehensile" legs, it can wrap around and grab onto just about anything.So far we've connected it to our laptops and phones (via the provided cables) and were amazed at the clarity and brightness of the image projected from such a small device. It IS best in a dark room but thats how we plan to use the Cube anyway so I really don't see that as any sort of negative (Ive read a few reviews where the authors complained that it doesn't work well in bright light). The focus works well and we had no problem getting a stellar image to display on a nearby wall.The speakers are not very loud but they do produce good sound and there in a output jack for headphones or external speakers (which I will be testing this weekend). I've also read a few reviews that complain that you cannot watch an entire movie due to the battery needing to be recharged after 90 minutes, but if the device is plugged into a laptop (or anything with an electric current) it overrides the battery and you can pretty much watch indefinitely. Again, that's how we plan to use the Cube so I really don't see that as an issue. The remote is also very compact and simple and works as advertised. But for me its all about the display and (so far) I'm very impressed.In all, I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a small, quality projector that is an amazing value for the price. We plan to get some serious usage out of this little beast and I will be updating my review as we test it out in a various situations. My sons have already planned some outdoor movie viewing with friends and I personally can't wait to watch some of my favorite movies on the largest wall of our living room!
