I was skeptical about these at first, thinking they were expensive wax paper, but they work amazingly well.  I have kept both soft and hard cheeses fresh and tasty for well over a month with these bags.  While wax paper works okay, these bags are head and shoulders above that.  The great thing is you can reuse the bags multiple times (I put the same kind of cheese in each bag when I reuse it - not sure if that matters though).
