I bought a pair of shoes and the laces just wouldn't stay laced. I was having to re tie them 3 or more times a day. These hickies are AMAZING, I have them on every set of holes except the very top ones by my ankles. They do not come undone very often. It probably happens to me more than most because I like to sit on my feet or prop my foot under my leg while I'm sitting down. A rubber strap may come undone twice a week at best, and even if it comes undone it WILL NOT FALL OUT. You'll just have the slight sensation that your laces aren't as tight. The loop and hook is a simple process and doesn't take forever. The overall look, brings a uniqueness to your shoes and your overall look.
