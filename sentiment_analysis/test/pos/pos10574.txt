I needed to replace my Classic iPod - as it was dying. I had the 80 GIG from years gone by. So I wanted something with the same storage capabilities. And I wanted a music player NOT a mutl-purpose phone. Call me old fashion - but I like having a dedicated portable music player - keeping the phone for apps and internet and phone calls. I just enjoy music too much, and wanted to get the most out of it. I started to research various players as Apple no longer offers a portable music player with the large storage capacity. And I started investigating Hi Res music downloads and decided I wanted to pursue that route and needed a player that would play hi res DSD and FLAC files. iTunes does not currently support that. I looked at the SONY and the other various portables out there - but they were more than I wanted to pay as I was just experimenting with the hi res download community. The more I read about the PONO - and boy there's alot of positive and negative out there about this player and Neils venture - I really liked what went into it in terms of tech and philosophy. The DAC is high quality and the whole balanced listening capability intrigued me. At the time, Amazon reduced the price so I went for it. And I love it! For all the negative comments about the design - I find it to be easy to handle. I like how it "fits" my hand if I want to hold it. And I have no problems when I put it in my pocket. The Classic iPod was no winner when it came to sticking in your pocket - it was bulky. So not sure why people didn't like the shape of the PONO. And the sound is incredible. What I like is the ability to listen to hi res music where I can appreciate the depth of the music and the separation between the instruments and the vocals. I did try to listen to some ALAC files from my iTunes library - but find the sound to be dense and thick. In all fairness - these are RIP's from my 44kHz/16Bit CD's into Apple Lossless - but I find the hi res downloads to be much more "open" and less headache inducing. Just a personal preference. And I find the PONO community to be a big asset - specially after I first purchased it. Got lots of tips and help from mutual users. For a little music player - this PONO has big output and pristine sound.
