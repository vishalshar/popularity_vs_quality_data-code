This is my first time using a tracking product. I had been wanting to try Tile but liked what I was reading about the Trackr's capabilities and that it works with Alexa. I only bought one and thought I'd test it as an add-on to my keyring. I change bags a lot each week (between work, biking, errands, hikes) and kept leaving my keys in random pockets (enough so that I couldn't lock up the house and was glad we had a spare hidden). It's thin and discreet, and the response time is speedy. Worth the $30 to save me frustration. The app is super basic and feels a little beta in appearance, but not that big of a deal.
