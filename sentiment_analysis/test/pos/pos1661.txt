So I love the concept, and I've been wearing it every day since I purchased it some months ago. It has definitely helped my posture, I'll certainly give it that! I have three main issues with it, though.1) The app is buggy and often doesn't display the updated data properly. I have to go to "Trends" to see what the current numbers are, and even then it sometimes doesn't show up.2) I was unaware that it also functions as a pedometer. I thought that was a nice bonus when I opened the box, as I'd not purchased it for that purpose. I'm very glad now that I did not expect that feature, as it is wildly erroneous. The steps never record properly. Ever.3) As a female, I was grateful for the option to connect it to a bra strap. Problem is, once you do so, it becomes much more challenging to re-align it, which they recommend (as do I) you do often. When you have the basic magnetic snap on, it's a quick double-tap to re-align and you're good to go. With the multiple layers of fabric and thicker plastic between the device and the pressure, it's hard and often takes multiple tries to get it to re-align - half the time I actually slide my hand underneath it and pinch it between my fingers to get it to re-align. Perhaps a wrap-around connector where the strap could be inserted through an opening on the backside, and the back side of the connector would be magnetic so there is more direct contact with the device would make it easier.It can be challenging to wear professionally since tank tops set the device too far from the midline to be completely accurate. One of my shoulders is set too far forward and if I have to wear it on that side, my readings are all over the place. Spaghetti straps fail to secure the device properly either. Likewise, if you wear looser clothing as I have to do for physical/medical reasons, the readings can also be inaccurate. These issues are mainly the only reasons I gave it a four star rating instead of a five star. I really do love this gizmo. :)However, with all that said, I really like this little gadget. The battery life is astounding - I've gone three days between recharging and it barely dipped below 70%. You can turn the vibration alert off and on as your situation dictates, and you can adjust the intervals. They have three "profiles" - unofficially, but mentioned on their website - the "Drill Sergeant" in which you have it set to vibrate if your posture slumps after as little as a few seconds. That range (again, you can customize it) goes up to 2 minutes. Two minutes to about 5-7 minutes is "Mom mode" which is akin to your mom watching you and after a little while, giving you a gentle reminder. I usually use the two minutes that is recommended, but when I started, I utilized a one minute just to see how effective it would be. Wow, was my upper back sore at the end of the day from sitting and standing straighter than I had done in years! My physical therapist was really impressed with it, and had remarked that he was starting to see the musculature change and build properly (the very reason I was in PT was for left shoulder issues and scapular winging). The third mode is "Grandma mode" which is roughly 5-10 minutes or so. It's like "Mom mode" only you know Grandma is waiting to see if Mom says anything before she steps in.The device communicates with the phone app (there isn't a web interface at the moment) via Bluetooth, so as long as you have a Bluetooth-enabled phone, you should be fine.On the website, they're also selling what I hope is the start of a line of decorative magnetic clasps. The kit comes with a white under-the-clothing bra connector (magnetic) and two square magnet connectors, one brushed silver and one matte black. They're fine and hold well, but they're a bit nondescript and people keep asking me if I've lost a name badge or something. I'm fortunate to be at a desk job where my loose clothing doesn't interfere with the proper readings, but if I were in an active job and wore the same clothing, it would be questionable as to how useful the device would be unless you used the square magnets on a sports bra (one of the best, easiest, and most reliable ways to keep it in contact with your skin that I've found for women, but not always practical for the business environment).I think once more connectors are added and some refinements made to the app, it would be amazing. Regardless of the current challenges with it (the app bugs and the bra connector difficulty with re-alignments are my two biggest issues with this), I have already had a tremendous amount of progress in improving my posture as documented by my physical therapist and primary care physician. It seems not slouching has increased my height by half an inch. Who knew? ;)I purchased this because it was the only device for this purpose I could find that did not involve the use of adhesives. I have an adhesive allergy and was looking as posture braces until I found this. I already wear a number of braces and I wanted to build my muscle in this are on my own rather than using a brace to passively hold my posture in place. This has far surpassed my expectations in that regard, and I absolutely love it. I've worn it during physical therapy sessions, at work, at home, outside doing yardwork, inside doing cooking and crafts, watching tv, just about everywhere except while in that MRI tube last week and while sleeping.If they could only get the pedometer to read accurately or allow adjustments like regular ones do for stride length and all, that would be great too. But I'm overall a happy camper, and I can only imagine it will continue to improve as things are tweaked more moving forward. I definitely recommend it, provided you're okay with having to futz around with the app a little bit and you don't care about the pedometer function too much. Guys will likely have an easier time of it than the ladies - wear an undershirt beneath work shirts and you are good to go!Apparently I've slumped a few times while typing this, as I've been buzzed three times to remind me to straighten up. :)(It's a gentle vibration, don't worry - I have fibromyalgia among other things with allodynia and it's not bothersome at all.)
