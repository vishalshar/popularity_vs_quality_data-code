It's really great, but not quite perfect. I love the fact that it helps me notice when I am tense and need to relax. So it does the job that I need it to do.However, I'd like the ability to select the vibration pattern that gets used for each signal, so that I can determine what it's telling me without looking at my Phone. It would also be nice if the device would detect when I am leaning forward when sitting, and not mistake that posture for a lack of deep breaths. Finally, the 6 hour memory on the device is not enough. It keeps losing data because it isn't syncing with my phone often enough.
