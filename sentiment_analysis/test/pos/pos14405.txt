My girlfriend is notorious for having her phone running out of battery before the day is over. I've gotten her portable batteries before as a gift to help solve this issue. Except her portable battery is always out of battery or she forgets to bring it (surprise, surprise).While the NomadKey can't actually charge your Apple device, it's usually never an issue because it's not hard to find a USB power source. For me, the best feature of this product is that it's very easy to always have it with you. The overall build quality is good on the updated versions.I also liked the simple packaging it came in, no infuriating sealed plastic case to wrestle open.The only slight complaint I can think of is that the amount you can twist or bend the connector is very limited.
