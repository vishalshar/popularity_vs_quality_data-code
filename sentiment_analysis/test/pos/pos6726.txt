Let me start by saying I paid $299 for this radio, no discounts.  That said, this radio/speaker has something for just about everyone.  It is a rational combination of technology and versatility that will serve all ages and myriads of interests.  Glad we waited for this one to come along!You can still listen to the FM radio band if you lose WiFi.  But, as long as you have WiFi, the world is at your fingertips.  I don't want to spend the reader's time on each of this radio's features, because the videos produced by Como Audio already do a great job of that.  But I do have a few impressions to share that may be useful to a prospective buyer.I have enjoyed this radio so much it has been used in three rooms of the house already, but it is primarily our bedside radio.  I see a portable Como Radio in the future, I want to take it with me on trips, family visits, etc..  It was pure joy to listen to a podcast from New Zealand about beekeeping while in my shop assembling beekeeping equipment!Using your smartphone App to control the radio and search for, lets say, podcasts, has the feel of using a bona fide web browser.  While the smartphone Internet interface is a key to the door of the future, it is here today!The genius of this radio:-  Elegance of a small package fits anywhere-  After initial (read easy) setup, you can have programming in a few seconds-  Great effort was spent on user based inputs (bluetooth, USB, input jacks)-  I love Podcasts and they are available on demand-  Controlling the radio via the excellent smartphone APP is easy (doesn't need line of sight)-  Online software upgrades are built into this platform, promising a flexible future for the system-  The sound is rich & clean with more than adequate volume in our 16' x 25' bedroom-  This Como Audio radio sounds as good as our Bose radiosPoints to consider in a future redesign:-  The Volume, Menu and Source knobs are small and need to extend away from the display  panel rim for better grip - -  This is a BIG DEAL for our fat & arthritic fingers!  ;) - -  I'm shopping for longer potentiometer knobs on Amazon now-  The remote cries for a button with direct access to the 'sleep' functionPoints to consider in a software upgrade:-  The 'display off' function needs to work while radio is on, not just in standby-  Display brightness needs a fourth, even dimmer, brightness levelSometimes you get what you pay for.  I feel strongly this is one of those times.  Buy with confidence, this unit is something that will be around for a long time...and still be useful.
