This product works perfectly! I tried the POD tracker first but returned it. The POD runs off of the AT&T network but their signal is weak at my property. I purchase the Whistle second after finding out that they use the Verizon towers. The product does what it says it does. My coonhound as allowed to roam all 200 acres of our property. Most of the time she stays close to us but when she catches a scent in the air she's off and running. The app tells you exactly where I am as well as her location. The app allows you to add her id number to other users so friend and family can monitor her location. The app also tells you when to recharge the unit when the battery is low. Recharging only takes a couple hours. If the whistle is within the designated zone, the battery should last about 7 days. If it goes outside of the zone frequently it eats the battery up quicker but will still last a couple days
