Tried three different miscellaneous USB chargers, all of which failed to charge the camera.  Charging  camera though computer is very slow (nearly 6 hours for initial charge).  I did not get charging through a USB hub to work either, so camera must be connected straight to computer to get the power it needs.  So this charger is a must.
