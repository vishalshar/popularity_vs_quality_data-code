I'm a Android developer who had been using a Nexus 5 until the screen recently broke. I decided to wait on picking up a Pixel until the price dropped a bit or maybe even the next iteration. I didn't want to pick up "flagship" level device while waiting, but something that was quality and very close to stock Android like the Nexus line is/was. The Nextbit Robin meets or exceeds almost every expectation in what I was looking for. Very quality device. Very close to "stock Android".That said, my only two issues are: Holding this phone is like holding a wet bar of soap. It very easily slips out of my pockets and my hands. It's also a bit difficult to blindly figure you the orientation of the phone and find the power button. Quality protective cases are scarce at best.Overall, no regrets in getting this phone. No hesitation in recommending it to others. And people who see me using it are always asking about it since it's not your typical "black rectangle" phone. Love it!
