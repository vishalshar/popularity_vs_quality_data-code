This is the absolute best iOttie or any brand of car mount made so far.I initially bought my first iOttie car mount because I really didn't like the my phone stuck to the windshield for 2 reasons. First it hinders a portion of my view and second it is illegal in NJ to stick things you your windwhield (probably because of reason 1). So with that in mind I purchased my first iOttie car mount in 2013, since it was a dash mount it solved both problems. I finally accidently broke it a few months ago so I needed to buy a new one. I tried a few cheaper brands that were spuuosed to stick to the dash but none of them held up in the heat of summer and my phone kept falling off. So I came back to Amazon and bought a new iOttie car mount, the One Touch 3 (v 2.0), and wow what a great piece of equiptment it is.Sticking it to dash proved to provide a very secure mount. Even with my the textured dash It stayed secure, even in 105 degree  heat and direct sunlight. What I like about it more is the fact that it telescopes allowing me to get my Samsung 6 edge closer to me. I no longer have to stretch my arm and lean forward to reach the mounted phone to change map or other settings. I have it positioned just beyond my stearing wheel and can reach it with my fingers without taking my hands off the wheel. It's great and adds to my driving comfort.Since I haven't had need to remove the mount I don't know anything about ripping or marring of the dashboard but if I do have to remove it I will try a mild soap and water before ripping the sticky pad off.I'm including some pictures of the placement and the position of the phone for it's ease of use.
