This thing is indestructible. I work on a machine shop and I use my Fugoo to listen to some music. One day I put my speaker inside one of the machines to hear some music while I do some work inside the machine and forgot to take out the speaker and put the machine to run and go home. For the next days I was unavailable to find my speaker and I even think that somebody took it. For my surprise I found it in the chips container three days later and after three days of the machine running 24/7 and being with chips and coolant I just cleaned with water and keep working like nothing happened. After my co-workers saw this more than one says to me that they want one.
