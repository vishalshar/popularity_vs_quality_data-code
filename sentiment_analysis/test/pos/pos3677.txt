Like with all their stuff, setup can be fickle(and frustrating).  I had to work with their Support to get this working and eventually needed to do some kind of firmware update or hard reset...which was pretty easy, once they gave me direction.  Had they simply put those instructions in the Support section of their website, it would have saved me some heartache!  But, now that it's set up, it seems to consistently work well.
