I bought the Black Pearl mask. When you open the pouch, the aware there it alot of excess serum. This sheet mask is perfect to hydrate your skin and improved the texture of your skin. With the excess serum that comes with it, I use it on my neck, arms or store it to use for day I dont use the mask. The amount of serum left over, I can use it up to 4 times after for my face. Pop this into the fridge for extra cooling. I will repurchase this again.
