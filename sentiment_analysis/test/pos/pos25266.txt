This is a amazing product! Its a awesome example of bioluminecence. Everyone I show it to loves it! After having it for 2 months when I gently turn it the dino glow really bright! I have them on a schedule 8am to 8pm. I hooked up a plant grow light to a timer so they will get the UV rays they need but it's not hot. You can't keep them in direct sunlight or they will die. I feed my little guys once a month. They say to dump some of the water in it down the drain which I don't do. I have a mason jar I use to put the ones I pour out. Its not a lot but I feed those as well and they glow pretty bright now to. The Dinofagellates are low maintenance pets the glow at night when they're disturbed! The longer you take care of them the more they multiply and get brighter and brighter.
