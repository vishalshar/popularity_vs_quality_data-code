FABULOUS!  My 10 year old LOVED this. Bought it for him for Christmas. It kept him engaged and when he completed the MuttBott, he was very proud of himself and his accomplishment. Very "easy" to put together if you (your child) has patience and likes this type of thing. Has just the right amount of challenge base, too!  Download the app and it has picture directions that are clear and animated. Hope they come out with many more of these.
