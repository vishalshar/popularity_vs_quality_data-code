Had the original OnePlus 1 and was quite satisfied with it. It lasted a long time for the price. They've done even better with this one, the price was extremely reasonable and so far the phone has excellent performance. I especially like the improvements to the camera and the addition of the fingerprint reader, which works with near 100% consistency.
