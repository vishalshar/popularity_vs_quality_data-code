I know this is made for kids but I use it at work and am very impressed. Sometimes I work at heights and the handle is very "handy" (pun intended).  It's the only case ive found with a handle and now I want one for my other devices. The cushioning is very soft. The only tradeoff is the rubber attracts hair and particles from anything it touches. I think it might be static or something but I gladdly deal with it.
