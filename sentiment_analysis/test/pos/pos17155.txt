I heard about these on America's Test Kitchen and decided to give them a try.  It is very difficult to keep cheese fresh after you have opened it.  I love this product!  They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  They are an absolute  must have in any kitchen!  They keep my cheeses just as fresh as the day they were opened.  Can't say enough good things about them.
