Extremely happy with this phone given the sub-$200 price tag.  My LG G3 doesn't work on the newer T-Mobile extended network, so I was looking for a phone that has band 12, Volte and, preferably, wifi calling too.  I wasn't yet ready to invest in another, expensive "flagship" phone, so I started looking at options (Axon 7, Honor 8, Moto X Pure).  When I stumbled across the Robin at the $150 price point, I took the leap.  Now, although my G3 struggles with GPS sometimes, it works well in every other sense (excellent camera, solid feel, split screen function, decent speaker).  I would still use it but for the lack of Band 12.  I've had the Robin for about a week now and here are my general impressions:SPEAKERSs:  great.  The sound is not necessarily robust, but for a phone, they are loud, clear and sound good with no crackling.  They're better than my other phones' speakers.SIZE:  It's slightly narrower than my G3 which makes it easier to hold and use it with one hand.  It also feels a little heavier than the G3.  I like how the G3 maximizes screen size relative to the total device size.  Not so much with the Robin.BUILD QUALITY:  Some say it is easily bendable (search YouTube) and the weakest phone on the market.  It feels solid to me and even more so with a Tudia case on it.  Perhaps it won't stand up to sitting with it in my back pocket, but that's only a very minor worry for me.  Don't intentionally bend your phone and you should be fine.HEAT:  Don't notice anything above what my G3 does.  I don't game, but I have played extended videos and nothing is too uncomfortable.ACCESSORIES:  Very limited case options and nothing, in my opinion, available to really handle drops well.  Yes, the Robin doesn't come with a quick charger.  Oh well.CAMERA:  Nothing to be too excited about.  No OIS, no laser focus.  If camera is really important to you (or you main/only digital camera), you may want to reconsider.  For the price I paid, I don't care so much.  BUT I can see getting frustrated eventually if I'm constantly getting blurry shots of the kids.UI:  Again, nothing to be thrilled about.  But you can install your own launcher and be fine.STORAGE:  Just 32 GB with no expandable storage.  100 GB of cloud storage, but there is no easy way to access files online on the cloud if you lose/break you phone.  I hear that is coming. We'll see.  I don't like the lack of an SD card at all.  If I switch phones, I want to take my docs/photos with me.FINGERPRINT SENSOR: first time I've had one and I'll never get another phone without one.  It works most of the time, but I'm learning how to increase my success rate with it.  Still, it's not perfect.  Also, wish it allowed 6 (instead 5 fingers). Can't really compare the sensor to ones on other phones, but according to other reviewers, it seems to be one of the better sensors.NOTIFICATION LIGHT:  It's on the bottom.  Hard to notice, especially with a case on it.  I use the No-Led app which I love for it's icon  notifications, despite some battery impact it has.BATTERY:  Non-replaceable and small.  Definitely on the shorter end of battery life right now.  But it charges fast and I carry a power pack with me in my car.  If you forget to charge it before going somewhere, you might find yourself quickly out of juice.  Definitely needs to be improved in the next version.OVERALL:  I really enjoy this phone.  I like that it's slightly narrower than my G3, love the dual front speakers, Band 12/Volte/Wifi Calling for T-mobile (yes, all three work), and while I'm first function over form, the Robin is a good looking phone.  The camera and battery life are, to me, the real shortcomings of the phone.  But given the price, I can live with the shortcomings. I hope Robin makes it to developing the next version of the phone, with a better camera and expandable storage.
