I have tried almost every POGO printer made and they all suck.  This is the first printer that works effortlessly with the iPhone and the photos look really good.  Not like barely recognizable prints... really nice prints.  I LOVE THIS.I HAVE TRIED EVERY PRINTER MADE AND NONE OF THEM ARE CLOSE TO THIS ONE.  THE QUALITY IS FINALLY THERE AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS.I use this mainly to show what is in a case packed with equipment so it can be repacked.  I also bring it to parties where people LOVE THESE AND THEY ARE A BIG HIT AT ANY EVENT
