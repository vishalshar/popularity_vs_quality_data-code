Been wanting a thermal imaging camera for some time and was considering the FLIROne, but not interested in a product that works ONLY for a single phone (what were they thinking?) so held off.  I know FLIR is making a model similar to the Seek's design, but as we were getting new windows in our house, I had the perfect rationalization to buy one!  :)First, this thing is small and sturdy, and the case is likely bulletproof.  Once I started inspecting things around the house, I just ended up keeping it in my pocket (in the case) pretty much all the time.  It's not much bigger than some of the "smart" car keys, and a camera isn't any good if you don't have it with you.  My wife and friends have commented on the geekiness of having a thermal camera with me at all times, but I think they're just jealous.Image quality is very good, though you can clearly see how low the actual resolution of the sensor is, and you can see small details well.  Checking the insulation around a newly installed large, double window from about 10 ft away, I could easily see where they missed the foam insulation in a thin layer about 1 inch long.  That's not a big deal as far as the windows go, but I may as well seal it up completely as long as we've got things apart.  On a cold night, I've scanned the new windows and the old single-pane windows and the inside of the glass is about 5 degrees colder on the old panes.Useful for checking electrical systems.  See the photos of an extension cord I was using with my electric car charger.  During charging, the plug was heating up to 161 degrees, even though it was rated for the load it was using.  Removing it from the chain, the charger plug only heated to 89 degrees.  I also found two circuit breakers that run hotter than the others in the box - not scary hot, but just hotter - so I'll be investigating the load on them.At a commercial building, I was able to see the steel studs through the drywall in an uninsulated interior wall.  Can't see the wooden studs in my house though.Software isn't perfect, but has been reliable (has crashed the phone once, and I've got to restart occasionally, but only when I've been putting the camera on and off many times in the day).  The split-screen mode that uses the regular camera at the same time as the thermal also captures both images when you take a shot and you can use the split-screen capability when viewing later too, not just in the live mode.  The high/low temperature boxes are a little bit large and it would be nice for them to be off to the side of the actual hot/cold spot with a connecting arrow or line, but that's a nit-picky detail.One thing I'd like to use this for is locating owls that we hear in our back yard woods.  Technically, I think it would work, but the lens is a little too wide angle for this to be realistic for the distance and even a big owl is going to be pretty small and hard to see.  It would probably work with larger wildlife though.The refresh rate for video is not very fast though, so something moving fairly rapidly across the image will display multiple ghosts.  The only time this was really glaringly obvious was when I was taking video of a train out the window of a slowly moving car - people on the sidewalk showed up as 4 or 5 ghosts of themselves - not exactly a major limitation.Overall, I haven't regretted buying this for a second.  It works well, is a terrific design, and lets me see a view of the world I can't get otherwise.  As silly as it sounds, the well designed case makes this a massively more useful/enjoyable camera since I can comfortably and easily have it with me all the time.
