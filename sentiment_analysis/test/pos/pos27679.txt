Someone attempted to break into my apartment- so I bought this switch in an effort to deter any break in. I love the Away Mode, which randomizes the on/off feature. I also love that I can turn it on from anywhere- it's nice to turn it on in advance when I'm carrying a lot of stuff in from the car. And it works with Alexa!
