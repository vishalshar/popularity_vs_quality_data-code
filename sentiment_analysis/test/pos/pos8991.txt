It works if you let it cycle for a bit. I highly recommend getting an ammonia, nitrite and nitrate tester so you know exactly what conditions your fish are going through. When I first put the fish in, they died but after letting the radish sprouts go I got a snail and some shrimp and everything is going okay right now. I haven't grown the wheatgrass but the radish sprouts are huge! They taste nasty to me though but I've never had radish sprouts before so I wouldn't know better. I threw in some tomato seeds and they sprouted so I'm very excited about that!
