We love our talkie!  However, I do feel like it's a bit misleading.  I can not get our talkie to notify us of messages without forcing the talkie to check for messages.  We have sent dozens of messages and it has never notified us once when one comes through.  For that reason, messaging back and forth requires that you continuously press the talkie to check for messages if you are trying to engage in conversation. While it does do everything it says it will do, it isn't like I can message my daughter from the store and ask if she needs anything as the advertisements indicate, because she would have to know a message is coming and know to be checking for messages to get it.I have spoken with tech support and they are very nice.  This is a very busy time for them so they weren't exactly super helpful.
