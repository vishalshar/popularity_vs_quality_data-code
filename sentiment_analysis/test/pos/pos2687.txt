So far so good!I selected this smart lock for three main reasons: 1. I did not have to replace the whole lock (less work) and I could keep my existing keys (convenience) 2. The ability to send electronic keys valid for specific dates / times to anybody. Super convenient if you are renting your place or have contractors of any sort coming. 3. It looks cool (actually really great if you picked the red one :) )The installation was overall really easy as long as you are willing to read a few simple steps by steps.I would have put 5 stars if it had a Windows Phone compatible app.
