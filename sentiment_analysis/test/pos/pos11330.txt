This is a great product for protecting an ipad! Our son does enjoy to use the ipad to play his games every now and then, but he can get frustrated, which at this point in time results in him throwing items ... such as the ipad itself! So, this has protected the ipad from receiving any damage when being thrown onto tile, toys, tables and other objects! Even with that abuse the ipad is fine and the case looks undamaged. The only consideration to make before you purchase this is whether you need a screen protector or not. If not, then you are good to go. If you do, then you should consider purchasing a protective screen that you stick on, or a different case with a screen protector included!
