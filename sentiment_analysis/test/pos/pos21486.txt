Bought for my roommate to try.  He has a very thick, fast-growing beard that would make vikings weep tears of joy did he not have to constantly shave it for work.  Within one week of using this his razor burn diminished noticeably.  After two weeks, it's almost gone entirely and the rest of his skin is soft and clear.
