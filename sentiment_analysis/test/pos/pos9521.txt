I just finished having Maria, AR004406, she help me set up my 3 935Ls, and she did a fantastic job, If you need to call customer support, hopefully you get her, she was the best customer support I have talked to at D Link (and I talked to many between my 8 cameras and 3 routers).  I am old and computer illiterate so I really appreciated her knowledge.  The 935 is a great upgrade from the 932.
