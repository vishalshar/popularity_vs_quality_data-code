My Grandson loves this case. It's easy to put on and stay's on. Nice and soft silicone not hard at all. The handle is great for him so he can carry his i-pad mini around with less fear of it being dropped. Everyone complements us on it when he takes it with him when we go out with it.You will not be disappointed with this case. We have the blue swirl and it is a great color.
