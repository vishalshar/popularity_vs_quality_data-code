I had a particularly complex installation. I needed to mount it sideways so that my phone will be next to the shifter on my Subaru, kept thinking I was going to need to glue it or screw it but the sticky pad was fantastic. It stuck instantly and in the exact spot I wanted today.I love the new back pad that allows you to snap your phone and without any heavy lifting.Wonderful job
