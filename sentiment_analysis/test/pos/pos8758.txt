I bought these on a whim for a friend who has trouble bathing on days when her helper doesn't visit, and she loves them. She says the cloths are very soft, but have enough of an exfoliation surface to clean well, and the cleaning solution isn't drying to the skin. She said it actually felt more refreshing than a shower.
