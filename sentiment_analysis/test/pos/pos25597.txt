Great toy. One problem is the Bluetooth le modules and the little bits app for Android which is not full features. If you have an iPhone this is not a problem. (So you are dependent on a smartphone to get the most out of the kit.)On a general note this toy is perfect for the tinker-parent. Lots of possibilities a d highly addictive--be prepared to order more bits:)
