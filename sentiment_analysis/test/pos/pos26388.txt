Pretty great mug and good conversation piece. I do get lots of attention for it. Doesn't insulate beverage for more than 30 min and I fully expected the straps to be leather (They are synthetic).  If you buy a leather version, the sleeve is the only leather part. Other than that, airtight as advertised, and all around fun to tote.As a note I did order 4 of these as Christmas gifts and one came in as the wrong color. The correct color label was on box, but good thing I checked for myself.
