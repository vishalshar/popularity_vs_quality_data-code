This is a fantastic game! Just the right combination of luck and skill so that everyone can play. I bought this game so that my son could practice his math facts in a fun way. It's turned into a family favorite, even my 18 yo likes to play.The game includes a board with all the numbers between 0 and 101 in a spiral. The goal of the game is to land your piece on the 101 spot. You get there by rolling dice and using math to chose how many spaces to move. The basic strategy becomes clear very quickly for new players. The board itself is beautifully designed and the pretty colors aren't just pretty colors, they are coded to indicate multiplication factors. There is a metaphor here about women and their pretty little heads, but I can't quite pull it together. :)The game moves quickly, adding and subtracting is easily supported by counting circles and there is a multiplication table included that uses the same fantastic color-coding as the board for anyone who needs a little help with multiplication and division. Game variations are also included in the instructions, like faster game play using one token per player.Really, all-around this is an excellent game. My only criticism, and it is so minor I did not take any stars off for it, is the dice. Instead of a 10, they have a 0 and we find that we often forget this fact. And the shape of the dice is a little wobbly so sometimes we lose the numbers for the roll.
