This is my 4th roost battery.  I've put them in various detectors throughout my home.  Two upstairs and two down stairs.  When I hit the test button on each detector it sends a message to my phone that the alarm has gone off.  3 detectors are wired separately and the forth is wired in series with 5 others.  If the alarm goes off on the individual one I get a specific location and message which one went off.  It's nice to know that if there is a gas leak, smoke, or carbon monoxide  in my home I'll get a notification on my phone.  Gives me a great piece of mind. I would recommend this to everyone.  So far everything is working perfectly.
