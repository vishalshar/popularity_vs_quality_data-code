I love this case. I originally bought it through their Kickstarter campaign and received the original version promptly. It's really well built and the original case lasted as long as you can expect a case to last (I'm pretty hard on my phone). I came to Amazon to buy a replacement to discover that they have made it even better by including a cover for the back of the case. This will help the suction cups last even longer. These mini suctions are amazing because the really do not collect dust or small particles but when laid flat (vertical or horizontal) they stick to the surface it is on super well. My favorite use is to stick it to the front of my dashboard when driving and using my navigation app.  It stays in place and I don't have to keep looking down to see the app. Safety first!
