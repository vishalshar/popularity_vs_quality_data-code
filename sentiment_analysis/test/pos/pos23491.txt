So, like a few others, I bought this little guy to use on my Wii U. It is tiny, stays out of the way, looks cool, has an insane low power draw (as seen measured in my photo's) and only uses 1 USB port! I will definitely add to this review once I have spent some time running games from it. But the 128GB version formats to 111GB free on the Wii U. No plugging an external HDD enclosure into the wall, no more using a Y cable and 2 USB ports, no fear of a disk platter based HDD failing and me losing save data. Color me happy.
