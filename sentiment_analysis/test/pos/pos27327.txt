I have tried other more expensive dog foods but this is by far the best. It keeps some meat on my very active GSP, other foods no matter how much I feed her she looked a little puny. She also never gets tired of this food as she has with others. Well worth the money can't beat free 2 day shipping with prime and have it delivered to your door. Just wish that it was a subscribable item, she goes through about a bag a month (other foods she went through much quicker). The breeder did recommend it and I'm glad I got it.
