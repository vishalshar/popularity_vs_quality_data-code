My distance vision is good, since I had lasik in my 30's. Now in my 50's, still great. But the farsightedness thing... it's actually worse. At home, I have a zillion pairs of readers. Fine. But out and about, although I had some pretty compact folding specs, I still wouldn't bring them. Or forgot them. And so I spend most of my interactions with my phone squinting and guessing.I was looking at these on Amazon, but because I'm a freak about my tech gear, the thought of sticking these on my beautifully engineered iPhone was abhorrent, so I hesitated. In the meantime, I went to a show with a wonderful friend of mine who, because of a disability, needs to use a wheelchair and a carry a fairly heavy machine everywhere just to breathe. She deals with all that equipment and doesn't let her stop her from doing anything she wants to.So, I bought these, realizing I have a disability too. And this is like a zillionth of the hassle she has. And so I stuck them to my pristine phone. It made the phone a little thicker. And now I actually LIKE to use my phone again! I can actually see what they mean by "retina" display! And I can always read labels at the store! Because the phone is the new wallet I never forget to have glasses, and they are SO easy to pull out and put back. The benefit of having these always handy so far outweighs the compromise on the sleekness of a nude iPhone.They are well made, the company stands behind them, and they look like a quality accessory. If you are farsighted, you don't have to live with squinting and straining anymore. And thank your lucky stars that folks are coming up with assistive devices like this that are attractive, convenient, well designed, and easy to live with. Accept the help, you're getting older.
