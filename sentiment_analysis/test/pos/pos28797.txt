I've had the Dripo for a little while now - as an original backer of the Kickstart campaign and a lover of cold drip coffee, I was very excited when the Dripo arrived. Solid feeling product, and quite stylish packaging. First attempt produced a relatively weak coffee, but with some tweaking of the ammount of coffee used and how tightly the Dripo was assembled we were able to produce a really nice coffee. I regularly drink with milk and ice; my partner prefers it black. It tastes great both ways.Only issue was that my partner and I wanted to try different roasts - so naturally I just had to buy another one.Pleasantly surprised to see the different metal filter on the retail unit v the Kickstarter unit. Made it much easier to clean and produced a nicer brew with less fiddling around the first time.At the price, it's a no-brainer. If you like iced coffee, or cold drip / brew coffee this is a product you need to try at least once.
