Great battery life... lasted most of the day. Works like a charm in Seoul and Japan... but a bit spotty in China (specifically Guangzhou) where I used it. Like the fact that it has two sim card slots, so I can use at "home" as a wifi hotspot with my own sim card (great when I'm using my laptop out and about). Touchscreen is responsive. You can easily see how data you have left at a glance. The unit does get a warm when accessing the network quite a bit, but nothing too hot to handle. When travelling, I just turn it on in the morning and tossed it in my backpack... and off I when. Reloading is easy and especially with their "promotional sale" makes it a worthwhile buy. Just make sure that you buy the right data plan for the areas that you'll be travelling in. For example Hong Kong is NOT China, otherwise if you're a frequent international traveler I think this is worth getting. Once a data packet has been activated (used), then it's only good for the next 30 days or until you the purchased amount of data, which ever comes first.
