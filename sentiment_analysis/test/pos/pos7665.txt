I had my doubts- it took me forever to find a dry cat food with no wheat (allergies) that my cats (all 3 of them) would eat and that I didn't have to worry about melamine poisoning etc.I won't go on about my desperate search to purchase the 'old' Indigo Moon.  I bought a small bag of the new formula and the cats loved it.  I was also relieved to see the bag is still made of the same type of material- best for storage.  It looks like regular paper online but it's the shiny airproof stuff.  So I will be getting another small bag.  Once they eat it regularly I'll purchase larger bags.  Sometimes cats like the novelty of a thing but the minute you buy a lot they decide not to eat it. I'm only giving it four stars because of the way Diamond handled the change-over. 'Recall' is an alarming word when it's my cat's food I'm buying.  I didn't notice them advertising the change.  That's why the four stars.  It's been a month & cats are still okay with it.
