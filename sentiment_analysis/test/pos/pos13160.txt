I am pretty much of an analogue person, so I have refused to get the benefit of technology to regularly check my daily physicals until I got Leaf. I was introduced to Leaf by a friend, and at first I said yes to Leaf only because it looked like a decent accessory to carry with me and it didnt much look like an app I had to update constantly. It was actually a compilation of many different apps I knew of, such as a pedometer, womens cycle analyzer, weather app, etc.My favorite function of Leaf is the pedometer and breathing exercise introduction. I like the overall color and design Leaf app, and it helps me to be aware of how much active time I had for the day, along with calories I burned with walking. Also, the breathing exercise gives you an instruction to each inhale and exhale as if youre in a yoga class. I know this sounds cheesy, but this exercise is something you dont get to do on your own. And watching the circle on your app to monitor how your breath is progressing is very simulative and inspiring. I strongly recommend those who have anxiety or panic attack to use this function. A few minutes of guided breath will calm you down and I think this is the benefit we can definitely take from technology.Leaf has a few downsides, one of which is that you have to update the data twice a day. You should download the app on your phone, open it, and lightly tab Leaf twice to sync the data on Leaf to the app. Being an analogue person, I kinda like this daily ritual but I can see it also can be a bit of work to others.I normally check the pedometer on my iphone and thats almost all I used to do for my daily physical checkup. Leaf let me record my moon cycle, number of steps I take, sleeping cycle among many others, so I felt I only needed to not forget to wear Leaf every morning to record all my daily physical activities. I never knew my sleep cycle wasnt ideal, and that I dont have sound sleep. Thanks to Leaf now, I know I can maybe consult a health professional to have a better sleep cycle.
