Wow. I am not usually compelled to take the time to write reviews but I had to this time. I spend money carefully so I was really on the fence about whether I wanted this system or not. It was in my cart for months then one day they ran a sale and I went for it. Then I considered returning it. I am SO glad I didn't. My kids LOVE Osmo. Usually their attention span with things isn't terribly long but they stay engaged with Osmo for long periods of time and actually ask to play it. They are 5 and 7. I love watching them play with numbers game, I can see them learning but they can't because they're just laughing and having a great time. I highly recommend this system. We have everything but the pizza now but we will be adding that soon.
