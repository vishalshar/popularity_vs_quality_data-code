got 2 of these for christmas this year. They look kind of silly but, as chief cook and bottle washer of the family, I can highly recommend this product. They really do work, and I feel much better about my kids taking the occassional juice or drink in their water bottle knowing I can get the whole thing clean. Plus, they are nicely sized and have a good grip radius.
