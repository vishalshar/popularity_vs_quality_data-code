Really nice product if you want a super small charger. Charges quickly and has built in apple and android chargers. I wish the USB plug for charging the device was built in too, but of course that would come at a cost of size so I accept the trade-off.it's plasticky but strong. It's still pretty slick looking and I appreciate the light weight. I would definitely buy again.  You won't even notice it in your pocket.
