I bought this bag in July 2014 (6 months ago). I love it! It has tons of pockets and loops to attach locks and keys. I can even carry my yoga mat easily - which is why I purchased this model.The bag is sturdy and well constructed. I have not even found a thread out of place in 6 months (3-4 gym trips a week on average). Also, there is no smell. Zero! Nada! I use the, included, laundry bag which they say is also anti-microbial for my dirty gym clothes and it has not picked up any odor.The bag is roomy and like I said above, loaded with pockets. I hold: swim goggles, ear plugs, racquetball glasses and balls, huaraches for the locker room, two swimsuits, water bottle, and headphones - and that is just in the outside pockets!! This leaves me room for a pair of shoes and clothes to change in to after gym. There are also additional pockets inside for holding glasses, phone, wallet, etc.It is not a cheap bag but I will say it is well worth the price - will likely be the last gym bag you buy.
