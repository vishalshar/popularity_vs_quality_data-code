Excellent, well-priced thermal imaging camera that is perfect for examining the condition of insulation behind walls and identifying areas of your home that require additional insulation.  In our case, we found that some of the insulation behind an exterior wall in the family room had slid to the bottom of the wall cavity.  We also discovered some major problem areas where insulation was altogether missing.  I subsequently addressed these areas and greatly improved temperature conditions in the home and successfully lowered our gas bills in the winter and electric bills in the summer.
