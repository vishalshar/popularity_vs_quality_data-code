I've been using it for about a month and it's the best one I've had so far. I've tried the kind that fits in the CD player and that didn't work so well for me although I gave that one to my nephew and he likes it. I gave another smaller one that sticks to the dashboard to my cousin and she loves it. Anyway, I've had to peel this one off of the dashboard of one car and put it on the dashboard of another and it still works well. I like that the arm adjusts and brings it closer to me in the driver's seat. If it breaks too soon or malfunctions for any reason I will update this review but so far I'm loving it.
