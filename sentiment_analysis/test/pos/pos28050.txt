I ordered red color, cool gift choice for holiday season. The design looks edgy. It arrived with a leather case (looks like a hatbox), which is very cute and convenient to carry.  Its resolution and sound were both excellent.  It is also adjustable for people who are shortsighted, so that you don't have to wear glasses while watching.  The screen can be a bit bigger. However, it's designed for people to watch 2 movies in a row, so that you won't feel dizzy after wearing it for hours.  Great entertainment tool to kill some time on the road.
