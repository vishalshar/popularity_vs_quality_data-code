I LOVE THIS THING... sorry had to put all caps. I be rolling round town with my head up high lol.Only problem is I had to change the seat bolt (boy was it tight), had to retie the usb charging cord, & had to replace screws on the wheel. Besides that stuff I absolutely love it.Well worth the price. Hope they stay around and support this as long as I am round.
