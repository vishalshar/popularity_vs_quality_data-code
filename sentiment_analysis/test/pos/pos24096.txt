Oh man, this little thing is awesome! I have been eyeing them since it was announced and missed out being a kickstart supporter on it. Suffice to say, when it hit Amazon and actually came out, I was stoked. I was even more stoked when I saw the reviews for it on various outlets. It works very, very well. It's not the most amazing piece of hardware, but it is very solid and performs respectfully.It can play pretty much any modern Android game and run every single app - including Photoshop. Photoshop for some reason seems to be one of the most intensive apps on Android and even my Nexus 6p has had it crash. But it seems to truck right along on the Jide and I can't complain about that.16GB is pretty small, but you can extend it with a decent class10 SDHC card and it will run great. Just make sure you don't buy chinese knockoff SDHC's, because they will underform and not give you nearly as high read/write speeds as a premium class 10 will.The apps supported by this on Android continue to grow on a daily basis and it has been rock solid. I've left it on for WEEKS now and it has not crashed and turned off on it's own.
