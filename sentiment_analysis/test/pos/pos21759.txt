After going to the park with several of his friends, my son (5 years old) was in tears because all his friends had bigger bikes and could ride faster.  His birthday was a week away so perfect time to trade up to a big boy bike.  I did a ton of research and landed on this one.  I liked that the wheels were a bit larger, I'm hoping that will help his balance when we take the training wheels off.  Best part (for him) is the water bottle attached to the back.  Kids love little extras like that ;).  I also like that the brakes are in the handle and not by pressing the pedal back.  He has so much more control and he loves that he can go really fast now!!
