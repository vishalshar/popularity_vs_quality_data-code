Get a lot of compliments on it, and it is an excellent filter, a glorified Brita, but better looking nonetheless. Water tastes great.  I keep this carafe outside since I like my water to be room temp, and I like that the carafe itself isn't super large,  because then I don't have large amounts of water sitting around forever, and drink freshly filtered water and refill as I need, I think it holds 5-ish cups.
