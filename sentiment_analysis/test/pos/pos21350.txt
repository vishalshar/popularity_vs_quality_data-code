I am trying to develop a new storage product, and have the need to create 3D printed prototypes to vet my designs.  I have tried other printers (see gCreate) and have had nothing but trouble.  Leveling the print bed, in particular, has been an incredible problem, and even then, sometimes it's hard to get the plastic to adhere to the bed without some sort of voodoo.  After months of trying to get this printer to work, and failing, I decided to try another printer.Enter the Robo 3D R1 Plus.  It had both an auto-leveling feature and heated bed platform, which theoretically should have resolved the two major problems I had with my previous printer.  It also had an $800 price point, less than half of what I paid for my gCreate.  Granted, my gCreate printer has a huge print volume - except it is completely unusable, due to bed warping and leveling issues.  Anyway, for $800, I was willing to try my hand at a second printer.I got the Robo 3D quickly, as it was shipped from Amazon through FBA.  There was a huge hole in the box, but nothing inside was damaged.  The printed instructions were helpful, as were the instructional videos that came on the included memory card.  Having a bit of experience with FDM printers, it was mostly just showing me how this printer compared to the printer I was already familiar with.  It instructed me to either install the included software, or download the latest software from their website.  I did the latter, and was really impressed with the included software.The software included is from a group called MatterHackers, and I have really learned to like it.  It provides an easy-to-use, but full-featured shell around three popular slicer programs (slic3r, cura, and something called MatterSlice).  It can also drive your printer, assuming it's attached via the included USB cable, or it can help you prepare a print to be loaded via USB.  So far I have only printed right from the MatterHackers software, and it has worked wonderfully.  It has some nice touches, including retaining a history of your print jobs, including whether they were successfully completed or failed for some reason, and it allows you to set email notifications that tell you, for example, when your print has finished.I printed the suggested first print - a calibrating circle - without issues.  The bed leveling seemed to work great.  They did suggest using a bunch of hairspray on the bed, and showed you (in the training video) how to apply it and how to clean it off.  That sort of thing is super helpful, as it answers so many questions, and gives you confidence right out of the shoot that you are using the printer correctly.  My second print was a prototype I had been working on, and it took some fiddling to get it right.  The software makes it obvious that my model is too big for the printer, but it provides easy-to-use controls to scale and rotate the model.  One problem I had was that after making the adjustments, and seeing them in the preview window, I didn't realize right away that I had to click the save button at the bottom of the screen in order for my scaling and rotating to take effect.  So, while my model looked right on the screen, it tried to print the too-large version, which the printer was more than happy to try to print, despite the fact that it was impossible...lots of grinding and screeching ensued.  I was able to quickly stop the print job, and with a little observation was able to find the save button, and all was good.Other issues I ran into included PVA warping when printing a large flat surface on the bed.  Upping the bed temperature seemed to resolve that for the most part, and using better-quality plastic helped too (the PVA included with the printer is fine, but not as good as the ColorFab PVA I had purchased for my previous printer.)  But every issue I run into seems to have a solution readily available.  I have confidence I can print with this printer, whereas with my previous printer, I would have to endure a multi-hour leveling ordeal, and still not be able to print anything.In summary, the Robo 3D R1 Plus works.  It works well, and Robo 3D has done a great job of eliminating the pain points of the current generation of FDM 3D printing.  With my previous printer, I was about to lose hope in the current generation of FDM printers, but this printer restored my faith.  If you want to actually print 3D things, and not pull your hair out trying to level your bed or get your prints to adhere to the bed, this $800 wonder is exactly what you're looking for.
