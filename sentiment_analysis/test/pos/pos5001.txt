I ordered 2 of these feeders for my kittens. I had an issue with my particular router so I emailed Feed and Go. Alex, the founder emailed me back very quickly to get some information about my router type. In less than an hour after that, Alex called me. This generous man, who is very patient, kind, humorous and knowledgeable spent an hour on the phone with me until both feeders were up and running.  I'll be bringing my fur-babies home in a few days and I can't wait to be able to check in on them when I'm at work. These feeders are the best thing since sliced bread. They are worth every penny!UPDATED REVIEW:  It is now December 2016. After several months without any hiccups, these feeders somehow mysteriously end uwith the wrong time in the 'Scheduled' feeding section. I notice it every time they're set to turn for a feeding time.  I should say, I can tell whenonly one turns.  One cat looks around the room wondering why I left him out for meal time. These feeders are still handy, but if you set upscheduled feeding times when you'll be away from home, be sure to check often that the feeder time is set correctly for your time zone, etc.SECOND UPDATED REVIEW:  One of my naughty cats chewed through the power cord of the feed and go.  I contacted Alex and he will be sending me extra power cords - FREE of charge.  You can't get better care and service than that!!
