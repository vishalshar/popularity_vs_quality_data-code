Since surprising the family at Xmas (3 yrs ago, now) with some as stocking-stuffers, we all have been fans of Hickies. They are one of the few things in this life that are "all they're cracked up to be". Hickies are simply great; in utility, in material, in workmanship, in selection, in flexibility of applications. So, QUIT READING THIS AND ORDER SOME / A BUNCH.  ;o)
