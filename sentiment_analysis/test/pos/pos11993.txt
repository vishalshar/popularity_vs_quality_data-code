I like the product now that it is functioning, but found customer service really poor. (More about the product below) Two of the sensors shipped were not correct (trying to measure 500 amp circuits rather than 100 amp as needed) which resulted in the system showing only 20% of the actual power used. I knew there was a problem because of the very low power usage shown. Every time I emailed or spoke to customer support the answer was "you must have hooked something up wrong, check it again."  When we finally determined that I had the wrong parts, I was asked where I purchased the unit, and the support person claimed that either I, or someone at Amazon, had switched the parts, because he was certain it was not supplied by Curb. (Later they did confirm that they had supplied the wrong part.) They did ship the correct part by next day air when they accepted responsibility. I do believe them that the Chinese supplier provided them the wrong part.The product provides amazing information, updated every couple of seconds, on electrical use of the circuits you can monitor. But you can only monitor 16 circuits (and I have more than 40). All the rest get lumped together as "other". The updated installation instructions explain that you can combine more than one circuit within a single sensor.You can watch how things change second by second on your computer or phone. On the computer, you can get a graph of the most recent 3 hours, day or week, showing all the circuits. There does not appear to be any printing capability for the information you see.Installation is time consuming, and requires very exacting attention to detail for both the physical and data input/programming aspects of the install. They recommend professional installation. I have a lot of experience doing electrical work, and did this myself. Except for the wrong product being shipped (notes above) the install would have gone OK. It takes several hours, and requires a good connection to the internet, since all of the information is stored at CURB's server. Some of the functions did not work on the phone, but would work accessing their computer (like changing plus to minus for wattage). You need to have a hard wired network. The box in the electrical panel uses the house wire as its network cable, and you plug an adapter into a wall plug which needs a cable directly to your network router.The equipment takes up a lot of space, which you may not have in your panel. It adds a lot of wires and clamps around wires. Installation instructions were poor. The online video was helpful. The first time I wrote in for help, I was referred to an updated installation manual, which is not referenced anywhere else.The system is very dependent on CURB's server. From what I can tell, the device you have in the electrical panel just sends information to their server, which is processed for display on your phone or computer. Internet connection is critical. I had multiple times during install when the server connection just stopped. I could not tell why, and there is no way to "reset" the connection. I just had to wait. Now that it is all installed, I do appear to have very consistent connection between the house and CURB's server, and can read the power usage on my phone almost all the time.I have not had long enough to compare its tracking to my electrical bill.
