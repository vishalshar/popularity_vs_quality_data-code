Awesome guitar!  My only complaint, when it showed up it had a massive crack/chunk taken out of the bottom of the body. The box was not damaged, so I assume Amazon sent it to me in that condition.  I had it replaced and had to pay return shipping cost from Vancouver B.C. to Amazon which they did refund fully. The price dropped by $50 after I purchased the guitar which they also refunded me after I called to ask for the difference.  A month later I also received a small refund on the duty I originally payed as a result of the price drop. Good customer service policies by Amazon although dealing with the people over the phone and on-line chat was difficult as their English was very poor until I spoke to a manager.  As for the replacement guitar, I love it! The satin finish on the neck is great, no more sweaty hand sticking to a glossy neck. Thin neck is new to me but I like it a lot (normally I play a Les Paul). My first guitar with a Floyd Rose as well, looks good quality, fine tune adjustment screws go all the way in and out, stays in tune great! It was actually in tune when I got it, intonation was fine.  A bit of fret buzz, nothing serious. Definitely metal pickups. Great quality, the flat black hardware with flat black finish looks awesome!
