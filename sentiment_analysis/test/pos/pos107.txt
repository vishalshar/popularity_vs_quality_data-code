We've been looking for a compact white noise machine for years. We have a Brookstone sound machine that's 15 years old.  While it's great for home, the Brookstone is too bulky for travel.  Other sound machines made for travel use sounds that use obvious and annoying loops.  The LectroFan has a great, non-looped white noise sound.  It's also a pretty good Bluetooth speaker. On top of that, it is compact.  Well Done!
