I just bought a tube of grip boost to try it out as a pine tar alternative. I applied it as recommended to my batting gloves, slippage was reduced significantly...and no mess. I have yet to really put it to the test, but my initial impression is that it is a viable replacement to messy sticks, cans of pine tar, and rags.
