I've had this printer since October (so 8 months) and printed quite a bit on it.  I have another brand 3d printer as well that I have had to send back and forth to be fixed about 5 times (blown heads, a problem with the Z-axis controls, a problem with the extruder).  This printer has had a few minor issues, but nothing I couldn't easily fix and be up and running again.  I haven't had to replace any parts.  It also can use a wide variety of materials. I haven't tried ABS, because my other printer is enclosed ABS, but I have tried T-Glase, Ninjaflex (with a few mods), lots of PLA, Woodfill, a thermochanging filament and Glowfill.  They've all worked well with the right settings and modifcations.  My other printer head exploded when I used Glowfill (and this printer cost 3 times as much as the Robo3d).One positive thing about this one compared to other printers is that you can easily access the parts and fix minor issues. You can also easily make upgrades (I installed the Smart LCD Controller and a PEI sheet on the bed, but mine is mostly stock.  When I print ninjaflex, I have to do a temp mod).  It seems like most of the bugs from earlier versions have been worked out.I actually still use MatterControl, though you'll find all kinds of recommendations for what else you can use.  MatterControl works fine for my purposes.I think this printer is an excellent value.  The large print bed, cheap price and quality make it a no-brainer.
