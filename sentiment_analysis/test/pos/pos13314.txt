Great simple device! Has all the features I wanted out of a basic fitness tracker to help me get moving!Pros:Beautiful Design (have had many compliments!)Easy setupFeatures (sleep/steps/time/swim)The app is easy to use once you get used to the navigationCons:The silicon strap (broke already and I've only owned it for 2 weeks)Def would be 5 stars if the strap was little sturdier or if the watch came with an additional strap.
