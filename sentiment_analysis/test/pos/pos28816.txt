Really fun and easy growing kit.  I kept it in my kitchen and the mushrooms were ready to be used within 2 weeks.  Unfortunately I went on vacation before using them and they were mostly dead by the time I got back.  Great gift for a gardener of any age.UPDATE:  I got another mushroom farm thanks to  Back to the Roots. It was a resounding success this time and I'm currently working on growing a second batch. Here are some of the things I did differently that helped:1.  Using the mister.  This new farm is the "original" size and included a mister spray bottle that the mini version didn't have.  If you get the mini farm I would recommend getting a spray bottle to make watering the mushrooms easier/better.2.  Water more often.  I kept the farm and the mister bottle with it in the kitchen.  Every time me or my husband walked by we would spray the block to keep it moist.3. Scrape the block better and cut the hole bigger.  I used a knife to scrape the block, I left some white/unscrapped spots though and it seems that the mushrooms sprouted from these sections (the scrapped areas seemed to allow water to penetrate better and is probably what triggers the shrooms to sprout).  Also, I cut the X bigger then I did last time because more surface area is better.4. Harvest at the right time.  I followed the recommendations and harvested the mushrooms when the tops started turning white and the edges are brown. I put them in the frig until I was ready to use them.5. Save the block to get a second (and hopefully a third?) harvest.Also, the mushrooms tasted really good.  I marinated them in teriyaki sauce for a couple minutes and then sauteed them.  I ate them by itself and the rest was added to the top of a burger.  YUM!  :)
