If you have eczema or psoriasis, then you must have tried countless rx and OTC products before finding something that actually works. For me, my search ended with this product. The psoriasis on my elbows responded to nothing, not steroids or Protopic or any other cream. I've been using Metaderm for at least 3 months and my psoriasis is gone! No scaling, no redness. It's nothing short of a miracle.
