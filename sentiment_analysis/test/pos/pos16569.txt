I am so happy I ordered this Pencil by 53 because it's a great alternative to the Apple Pencil at a fraction of the cost. I like it because it is Bluetooth ready and its compatible to a few of the drawing iPad programs. I use SketchClub and it can be paired to it, and it is easy to use.The pros of this pencil* has a lithium rechargeable battery that can be connected to an USB port or the apple charger sans the cord* easy to use* comes with an extra tip and eraser* it's light and durable* has the feel of using a carpenter pencil* the eraser is awesome* easy to draw ( see pic)* has instructions and technical support via you tube or the 53 websiteThe cons of this pencil*after a few uses I noticed the tip to crack toward the end, and that's without putting much pressure while drawing.Overal: I'm happy with this pencil, but I wish and I hope they can improve the life of the tips.
