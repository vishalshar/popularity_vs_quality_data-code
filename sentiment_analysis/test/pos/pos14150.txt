Awesome product. Have recommended this product to a couple friends & they love it as well. It does tend to get warm has no problem keeping you warm at all. It's a good conversation piece & wonderful to wear at nite. The only real complaint is it's too bright. Solid coat would recommend it to anyone cycling!!
