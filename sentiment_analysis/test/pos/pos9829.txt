I have 4 dogs and accidents have been common place. I have purchased  2 other similar products but this one was the best. The clean-up is very easy and the dogs really use it. One of my dogs doesn't use it all the time, but not all dogs are as easy to learn as others. Please note that I have never trained my dogs to use them. No time. I have simply put this out. It is the only one I have purchased  2 of. It is sturdy, not too low to the ground and well designed. Clean-up is even better than the one which uses washable pads as there is no intermediate grate for the urine to linger on.
