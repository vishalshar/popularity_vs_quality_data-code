I rarely review products I buy on Amazon, but this oil is so exceptional I felt compelled to do so.  I have been using this oil for over 6 months and have used it in foods ranging from triple chocolate fudge brownies to pan fried pot stickers.  Every trial I have put this oil through as left me even more impressed, so much so that I now have this oil on a monthly subscription as I use it in practically everything.  My top two highlights for the oil are its high smoke point (485 deg F) and it's pleasingly low levels of saturated fats (0.5 g/tbsp vs olive oil 2.0 g/tbsp).  The smoke point in particular has been great when working with searing foods.  Ultimately if you are considering trying this oil, go for it!  I love it and I am believe you will too.
