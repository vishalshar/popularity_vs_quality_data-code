Even though I have only used this tracker twice since I purchased it, it did a very good job of tracking.  I purchased it after losing my dog twice, but was lucky enough to get him back.  I put the tracker on him for his first walk after escaping.  He did ok but the walk brought back memories of his escape and he has since defied going on any more walks.  He has always been skittish and shy, so I have a very hard time catching him to go for walks.  As time heals his fears, I will hopefully get him outside for walks knowing that I can be at ease with his tracker in place.
