I have these GIR Silicone lids in every size and multiple colors and they are all put to very good use.I love the 12.5" size lid in particular as it's perfect for covering my largest stock pot, dutch oven, cast iron skillet, and an extra large glass Pyrex bowl. I use these lids more often than I use the actual lids that came with these cooking utensils as they are so easy to use, work well, take up very little room, and I don't have to worry about where to set a hot cover when I remove it. They are also very easy to clean which is bonus. Knowing they are BPA and BPS free gives me peace of mind as I cook for my family.I also love the little two pack 4 inch size lids and had to purchase extras as they are so often in use. They are perfect for covering up my ceramic prep bowls of various ingredients/spices until I am ready to use them when cooking, and for covering up small amounts of food in custard cups so they don't dry out. An almost daily usage in our house is to cover up a freshly made smoothie while it's in the refrigerator  until that individual gets up and is ready to drink it, These lids are also perfect for keeping our cat from trying to taste test my coffee or play in my water glass while I sit at my desk working.GIR has really impressed me with their products. There is no odor with this silicone, no residue, no stickiness or breakdown of the materials though they get heavy usage in my home. These are industrial quality materials and very well made. I've given several as hostess gifts to friends and family members who also love cooking and I have only heard good reviews from them as well. Add to that a very professional group of people who deliver what they promise and provide excellent customer service with a lifetime warranty on their products and you have a company with whom it is a true pleasure doing business. I don't know that I've ever been this impressed by a company and product. I highly recommend them both.
