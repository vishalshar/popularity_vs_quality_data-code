I used this only for cooking, so this review does not cover hair and skin care.  I was hesitant on avocado oil as it is rather pricey and I was unsure if I would like it, so when I saw this product on a lightning deal I jumped on it.I do not like olives and really do not like the taste of olive oil, and for health reasons wanted to use a whole food oil not a hydrogenated oil.  Because I do like avocados I was optimistic that this would be a better tasting option.  It was.  I really enjoyed this product and used it daily.  It lasted me right at one month.  The taste is very mild, as is the smell.  The color is a light green which made me hesitant the first time I cooked chicken in it, but I enjoyed the product enough that the light green color soon made absolutely no difference to me.  I will be purchasing more!
