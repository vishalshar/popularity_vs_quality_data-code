Where to begin... It's an absolutely cool watch.  I love that I can track my running and weight lifting calories burned in the same workout with just one watch.  Been using it for a little more than a week and I've had no problems with the watch's functionality at all.  Yes it does miss a rep here and there if your form isn't proper, all you have to do is add it manually.  And yes, you have to add the amount of weight you lift, not a biggie.  And yes, there are only 50 exercises to choose from but so what...  Atlas is adding more exercises based on user feedback.  I like this watch very much and think it's only going to get better with time.
