My puppy loves to fetch balls, so I thought this would be a great item to have.  It works fine, tossing the ball at three different intervals which you select.  I have it tossing at 10 feet, which is perfect for inside my kitchen area.  And while my pup figured out quickly how to drop the ball into the unit, she preferred to hold on to the ball and wait for me to insist she drop it.  Damn that human interaction thing!  The size of the ball is perfect for my dog to run around with, so she often ignores the iFetch completely once she has the ball in her mouth.  Overall, I do recommend this item for anyone who has a dog that enjoys fetching.  There are times that the ball will get stuck, or the unit will not toss correctly; however, I can always unstick it or get it working again without a problem.
