Wonderful for my daughter who loves Alexa and loves music.  I am a huge Echo fan and have one echo and one dot.  i liked the idea of alexa for my daughter.  One fantastic feature is the programmable call buttons.  Simply install the App on your phone and with one button touch your kids can call your cell phone, no matter where you are.  You can also call them.  My daughter uses it now instead of asking her mom to call me on the cell, she just pushes the button.  It's in our kitchen and is now our source of music and alexa.  The battery life is not great so we leave it plugged in all the time.  I am planning on using it outside at next summers BBQ's.  I had a few issues with the first unit, but the customer support was AMAZING, the simply shipped me a new unit and I shipped back the other one... all the way to France.  They were very helpful and after a few emails with Nate :) I was up and running again.  If your looking for a great way to let your little ones start using Alexa, and believe me they love it, this is the product.  Great build quality, simple to use and fantastic customer support gives it 5 stars.
