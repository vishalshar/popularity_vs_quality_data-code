Purchased for my daughter who plays high school basketball , she loves it , it lets her know where she needs a bit of help shooting and what area she is shooting well from. By all accounts it works every bit as well as advertised , anyone thinking about purchasing one , should. If it helps your basketball star improve their game , that alone makes it worth the money.
