I did a lot of research on these devices and this is the best one and heres why:* It is completely mobile and runs on a cellular system*because it is cellular it works inside the house as well as out and about* you just need the personal device and nothing else installed in your home* fall detection capability*Good price for a lot of things that cost extra or arent offered with other systems*mobile app for loved ones to keep track of their elderly relativethe only con for me was the size. It is slightly bigger than a lot of devices on the market and I wasnt sure if wed be able to talk my Mom into wearing it. She does wear it, however, and it offers a great piece of mind to our family.
