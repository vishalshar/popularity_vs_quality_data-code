I have used Lamas Lash Masque for a couple of years.  Virtually every mascara I have tried, whether drugstore variety or premium brand, flakes and eventually leaves dark circles under my eyes.  Lamas Lash Masque does not flake or leave dark circles under my eyes!  While it seems to have a conditioning effect, it DOES NOT tint my lashes, which are fairly dark with light tips.  I had hoped Lamas Lash Masque would eliminate the need to have my lashes tinted, but no.  Despite that, it is still a good product for me.The consistency is thin, but I immediately use a lash brush and Q-tip to remove excess and better separate the lashes (one must act quickly, because it dries VERY rapidly!).  I recommend that you remove it nightly with a waterproof eye make up remover.In short:  Lash Masque stays on all day, does not flake and does not leave dark circles under my eyes.  While I wish it did tint my lashes, IMO, it is so much better than regular mascara.
