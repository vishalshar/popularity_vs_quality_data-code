I have been using Rokform cases for years now.  The magnet is awesome when you need a place to set your phone.  I stick mine to my fridge when I'm cooking to keep it out of the way.  The magnet is strong enough to stay stuck to the tank on my motorcycle at 75mph!  Once you try Rokform, you will never buy another case!
