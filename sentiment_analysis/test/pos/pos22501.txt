I passed on Anki Drive, and though Overdrive looked like what a 8-year-old Dave would have walked through the very fires of Hell to play, there was still a part of 40-year-old Dave who worried it might be a gimmick.  After all, the commercials show lasers shooting from the cars (when you know they won't), pulses erupting and shaking the track (when that's not possible), and Burt Reynolds waving his cowboy hat out the window as he drives donuts around a tree (I made this one up).It all looked far too good to be true.We went ahead and bought one for my son in any case (8-year-old Sebastian), as well as the crash intersection piece, a couple of additional straights and corners, and two additional cars.  Our first track was the basic starter track, and to be honest upon setting it up I thought, "Huh... looks kind of boring."We downloaded the apps to our various devices, and placed our cars on the track.  While there was a brief tutorial to work through, I have to say that we were absolutely hooked from the first moment we saw the cars light up and scan the track on their initial lap.  The way they hugged the corners, perfectly in line, then spread out to take their positions at the starting line with break lights on was a thing of beauty.Frankly we could have stopped there.  My kid was sold.  He just started vibrating and muttering, "Anki Overdrive."  Actually he held the "eye" part of "Overdriiiiiiiiive," because it sounds cool.  It is cool.Seeing the cars change lanes, watching the AI adjust to strategies, leveling up your cars, unlocking new weapons... it's all awesome.  It is exactly the type of update to this type of toy I was hoping for, and both my son and 5-year-old daughter can't get enough.  They sit and watch the cars charge, and the moment the lights go solid to indicate a full charge, they are throwing them back on the track.My one beef is that said charge only lasts about 5 races, especially on big tracks.  However that's a good 15-20 minutes of play time, and plenty of screaming and yelling for Dad before it's time to take a break.  Charging is fast too.  I know, because I barely have time to let my backside hit the couch before they're yelling, "DAD!  Anki Overdriiiiiive is ready!"Don't regret the purchase at all, and look forward to picking up the remaining cars.  If my son stops playing it at any point, I'll hang on to it anyway.  I'll need something to do in the retirement village.
