Great speaker! Got this to replace my ancient Logitech speaker dock and it exceeded my expectations. Superior sound and I love convenience of putting it anywhere. I used leave it plugged in but I found that I could leave it unplugged for more than a week before I got a helpful low battery warning. With the surround sound, the Fugoo provides beautiful music to both my kitchen and living room.  My wife likes it because it matches living room decor!
