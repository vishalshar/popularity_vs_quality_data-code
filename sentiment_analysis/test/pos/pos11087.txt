Spent a few days with the device.. between the other reviews and the product video, I can confirm it works as advertized. It could definitely use a few tweaks.Out of the blue, the CEO emails me and asks me what I think of the product. I email him back with several suggestions for improvement including video quality and he informed me they will have an OTA update that will improve things. The company is clearly trying their best to keep customers happy and deliver a useful product.
