I've had many portable Bluetooth speakers over the years and this is by far the best.  Until I purchased this speaker a few weeks ago, my favorite speaker was UE Boom which I enjoyed for 3 years.  Here's a summary of my experience:Sound qualityI thought the sound quality of the Boom was awesome.  Then I listened to the Libratone ONE click and discovered the UE Boom sound is loud but not pure at all.  The first thing I noticed was ONE click has much more bass.  But it is not just a speaker with heavy bass, it also sounds superior at the high treble sounds.  It has a full range sound that is better than Bose, Beats or UE Boom .  It also has the same 360 degree sound that I loved from my old UE Boom, which means you can hear the music clearly from any direction and don't need to be standing immediately in front of it (which is what I hate about Bose speakers).Splash proofI bought this before going on vacation a few weeks ago and it is listed as splash proof.  So I decided to give it a try one day at the pool.  I placed it on the side of the pool, and challenged my daughters to splash it.  They went crazy!  The ONE cLick withstood a deluge of splashes and finally the last splash knocked it over.  I picked up by its handle, dried it with a towel and turned it on.  It worked perfectly and sounded like normal.  I can attest that so far Libratone's marketing claim seems to be valid.HangingThis speaker rocks when it comes to flexibility.  It is rectangular and stands fine in a variety of compact locations like a window sill.  It also comes with two attachments--a short rubber handle that can attach and detach easily so you can loop it over something and then reattach it, and what they call a lock.  The lock is the size of a coat hanger hook but it locks securely in place after you hook it over something.  I have until it from the bathroom door handle, a kitchen cabinet knob so it was off the counter, the headrest on the passenger car seat so the kids can listen to tunes, and even a tree limb when we were roasting s'mores at a campsite.  It is so practical.Overall this is the best Bluetooth speaker I have owned and I highly recommend it.
