Have had a for a week and bought it together with the keypad. Very easy to install and set up. The only pain was to get Siri to work with multiple owner iPhones through Apple TV 3rd Gen. The August App has some quirks that further confused how things should work with homekit, but I was able to work through the confusion and now it is working without fail.Setting up HomeKit/Siri with multiple owners and a 3rd Gen Apple TV:1. Set up everything to work with one iPhone first as per instructions from August including Siri; Yes, make sure the iCloud account on the iPhone is the same as the Apple TV; Test to make sure does work (both bluetooth locally, as well as remotely through AppleTV, without bluetooth) before proceeding.2. Set up August App to work on the 2nd phone, but don't touch Siri set up.3. On the first phone, go into August App and invite another owner. The other owner should also have his/her own iCloud account, with his/her EMAIL address. At this step, make sure it is the EMAIL address that you type in, not the iCloud account name. This step tripped me up initially.4. If you type the email address correctly, the other device will get a banner notification on his/her phone to share the 'accessory'. Navigate to Accept the invitation.5. It was at this stage that it got really confusing. I tried many times but the accept was either not registered by the first phone, or it registered but the 2nd phone still couldn't use Siri. It keep saying "I don't find anything connected..." or "I don't hear back from the device". Finally what made it all work was using the 2nd phone's August, cycle through the taps onto Invites, Activities, and finally back to the lock/unlock red/green circle page - It pops up a dialog confirming that you can now use Siri. - Voila - everything works. The 2nd phone can even control the door remotely as well as the first phone.UPDATE: Turns out my Step 5 was a nothing other than a iCloud delay. No need to cycle through menus, as I tried it once again and it made zero difference. It was iCloud that was returning the acceptance to the first phone and it could have variable amount of delay... nothing you can control unfortunately, if after several hours the first phone still didn't get the acceptance notification perhaps you need to retry... definitely needs improvement.
