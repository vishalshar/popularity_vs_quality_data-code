works better on wet hair, otherwise the ends get a bit frizzy.  Have trouble with hold arm up because of numbness, so this works instead of using my regular bush.  Just wish the roller part has Boar bristles too for the shine.  Maybe they will improve them down the road.  At least I can style my hair and not have my entire arm go numb before I'm done.
