PLEASE READ UPDATE TOO***This is the worst experience of any tech product i've had! August owes me 2 hours of my life back, i couldn't;t for the life of me get this thing to work, it installed perfect, it took me 4 minutes to mount it to the door and it looked beautiful! then the software nightmare came! the app is crap i have ios10 on an iPhone 6Splus and the reset and reconfiguring the lock is so bad that it locked me out and had to call August customer support, now here is the best part, i called at 540pm Pacific and waited 20 minutes to hear a machine telling me that now August offices are closed and i have to call another time! what a bunch of bad support! wow! they want Apple HomeKit, learn maybe form apple's support first! August owes me a Lock and 2 hours! I will be updating this review if anything changes and  if I hear back from the company but of course i doubt it! I really wanted this to work! what a failure! and don't get me started on home kit! it kept telling me go to the August app to update device firmware! now how on earth do you do that? the website says, you have to put your phone next to the lock and wait a minute and it does it automatically! well guess what August, i waited 17 minutes!!!!! anyways! writing them a review is wasting more time on this! bottom line, save your money!UPDATE*********After my initial misfortune with the lock, I had August's customer support following up with me and calling me to rectify the situation and I have to be perfectly honest they are awesome! they have apparently been overwhelmed by the fact that they have been delayed into HomeKit and apple software support because of Apple's HomeKit approval (typical bureaucracy of large corporations), i will take back what I said above about my experience with customer support with August, because they are truly awesome and you know a company is great when they call back to make sure to make things right! this is pure care and passion and I have nothing but respect for this, and they have won me as a client! there product is wonderful but unfortunately for the company they have to play with the bigger boys such as Google and Apple and this doesn't always goes as you like and you have to wait and be patient! I have no ordered few of their products again and can't be more excited!Don't hesitate buying their products because you are buying into a company that cares and will be there when you need them, I happen to fall on them at a time of a "glitch" and we all go through these sometimes!
