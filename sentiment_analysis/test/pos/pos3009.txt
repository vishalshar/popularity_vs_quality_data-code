My Seal SwimSafe system arrived recently and I am very pleased. I have 3 very active boys under age 7 and we love the pool. Keeping a constant eye on all 3 is challenging! While not a substitute for parental vigilance, this system gives us an added peace of mind when we are around the water.The first thing that struck me upon opening the box was the quality construction of the band, hub, and charger. After fully charging the devices, I ran it though several tests.The band easily syncs with the hub. Selecting the "swim level" is also easy. The green setting is for people who should not be in the water. As soon as the band gets wet, the hub and band alarm with noise and bright flashing LED lights. It gets your attention immediately!The other settings are for more advanced swimmers and the alarm is triggered based on the time the band is submerged. This is great for 3 kids with varying water skills.Also, the band/hub alarm if the distance between the two becomes too far--a great feature for wandering kids. It can be used to track a lost child very quickly.The kids like the bands and have no problem wearing them. They forget they are on almost immediately. The charge lasts a long time as well--longer than my kids can stay in the pool.The portability/compactness of the hub is very nice. Charge at home and throw the bands/hub in a bag on your way to the pool/lake.I think that this product is going to become very popular and, most importantly, save lives!! Nice work, Seal!!I just bought another system as a gift for my brother's family in CA.Ben G.
