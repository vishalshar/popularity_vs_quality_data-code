I very rarely post any 5 star reviews; a product must be superior to rate more than 4.Starting from the cooking and nutrition end, this is about the best oil on the market from either viewpoint.  That wouldn't matter if it tasted bad or had poor mouth-feel.There is nearly no flavor at all, it's an extremely light oil.  It would probably work great for herb-infusion.  I have used this for salad dressing, in a pump for use with the BBQ, in the fry-pan, and in recipes in place of olive oil (etc.).I lives up to it's advertised qualities, and in my opinion, is excellent for every day use.  If you want flavor from your oil, stick with a high quality virgin olive oil, but if you want an excellent all-around use oil - this is the one.  I've been using this oil for over 6 months now.  It is excellent.
