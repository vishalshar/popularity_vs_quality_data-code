We've been giving these to our cats for about 3 years now. They absolutely LOVE them. There's not a lot of consistency to the size of the pieces, but that's no issue. They break apart fairly easily. Since they're freeze dried they will produce powder when broken and when you're down to just a few bits left there's a lot of powder left in the bottom of the bag. That's no problem either, since you can put the powder into a little bowl, add some hot water, stir and TADA. Chicken gravy!The only Con is that it is expensive compared to processed treats, but you get what you pay for.
