Love the dual layout with different paper type on each page- dots on the left and lines on the right. One star off for the red logo on the front - it is not stitched, but stuck on with adhesive, and was already lifting when I received it. If I remove it, there will be adhesive residue, so I'll leave it for now. Perhaps they could emboss the logo on the notebook instead of the sticker? Just a suggestion...
