Great product. It's only been a few days but so far so good. I love that it does so much more than monitor my sleep (though it does that quite well it seems). I am using both the night time sleep sounds and alarm features. The calming sounds really help me fall asleep faster and the alarm feature is great -- I wake up much more refreshed since it knows the best time to wake me up. So far the tracking has been pretty accurate and it's been cool to see how I sleep each night. The sleep questions / recommendations are pretty useful too. Oh and it's awesome that I don't have to do anything after I set it up -- it just works. Definitely glad to have purchased this.
