I read the Clean Mama blog and the blogger, Becky, has a recipe for a Nightly Sink Scrub.  This cap, plus a separate insert that I bought from the same company that has round holes in it, make the perfect combination for dispensing the Nightly Sink Scrub.  I am happy to be making my own cleaning products and using less products packaged in plastic.  Although this is made of plastic, it will be used for years to come as it seems to be of decent quality.
