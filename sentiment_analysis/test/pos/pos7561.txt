All my friends think it's a pretty watch, unlike most of the smart watch (fitbit, jawbone, or even apple watch, no offense, but they are ugly). It is waterproof with the origin watch band, but I change it with a leather one because it looks cool. It doesn't have a screw on it, the time is set and calibrate on your phone. One problem, a serious one if a precise time is important for you, the time is not precise. For two weeks the watch can be fast or slow five minutes, it happens, so just don't forget to calibrate it.
