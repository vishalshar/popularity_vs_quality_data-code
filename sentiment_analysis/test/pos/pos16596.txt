The perfect little case for my I-pad mini 2.  I recently purchased my first I-pad product to be able to facetime my grandbabies. I purchased this case knowing that as soon as those little guys saw my new toy they would want to be playing with it.  I picked this particular one because of the color and the handle.  The handle is perfect. Fits in their little hands. The case is a soft silicone and easy to wipe if necessary.update 3/5:  after using this case many times with facetime, I have found that I have to take it off to be heard from the party that I am facetiming.  Apparently this is a common issue with cases. Using this case for the grandboys to carry around and play a few games is perfect
