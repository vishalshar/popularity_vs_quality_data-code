Love this lunch box. It is well insulate and does have some ugly design that most lunch bags have. I like the fact that it is a rectangular shape and not some weird pyramid type system that most lunch bags insist on having for whatever reason. I am a nurse and work 12 hour shifts so I bring as much food as I can and this bag works great. I do wish they had a slightly bigger size.
