Honestly I was skeptical about these but for the price I figured it was worth a shot. Thankfully, both the AI single player and 2 player options worked great and I had no problems linking them to Galaxy S3 phones. They respond well to input, are easy to link and drive, and so far plenty of fun for my boys. The only con in my opinion is getting use to touchscreen controls instead of the usual sticks on a transmitter.
