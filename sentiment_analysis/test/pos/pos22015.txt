I bought 2 of the Peanut Smart Plugs to work with my SmartThings home. They were the first items that I had ever attempted to pair with SmartThings so I had trouble getting the first one to pair. After about a day of scratching my head I got it to work and then the second Peanut paired right away. They are not "built" just to work with SmartThings so I took me a while to figure out how to get the right "smart app" set up to work with them. This problem was only due to my inexperience with SmartThings and my Peanuts have worked flawlessly since then. The Peanut is much cheaper than the SmartThings brand plug and I have yet to have an issue with them not turning on or off as I want them to. I now have and Amazon Echo so I can tell Alexa to turn on the lights and BOOM! It happens.
