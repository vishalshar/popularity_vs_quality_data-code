I got one of these as a gift. It's expensive. It's a little frou frou. But dang it, we did taste a difference in several blind tests against our other filtered pitcher. We've put other friends through a taste test and they're not as convinced but we're happy. The glass pitcher does pick up finger prints more than our plastic competitor. But if you're buying this, you're also happier about it actually being made out of glass and not plastic. And compostible filters? What a hippie dream! Cut down on the bottled water and plastic bits.
