I can't seem to train my dog to drop the ball in the machine on her own. Mostly because she's a crazy mini Aussie who gets SUPER excited over this thing and can't seem to concentrate on anything other than where the ball is going to launch. She can fetch for HOURS which means that even when I'm reading on the couch, I can play fetch with her for a long time with minimal effort or distraction. It's a win-win!
