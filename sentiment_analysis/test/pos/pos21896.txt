This is a wonderful toy!!!  It really makes learning FUN.  My grand-dgtr loves playing with it and helping her with letter recognition and sounds.  It was simple to download the apps (be sure you follow the directions to download the free ones) and their cusromer service replied timely to my emailed question.  Though technologically loaded -it is child (& Grandmother) friendly.  I've worked with an early intervention program that continues to emphasize the importance of learning being child's PLAY, and this product truly does just that!
