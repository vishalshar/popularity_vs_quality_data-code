I bought this product for my father who had battled Psoriasis most of his life.  The staff at his assisted living facility applied this to the affected areas of his body on a daily basis.  Within 2 months many of the persistent psoriasis areas on his hands, arms, back and upper legs were almost completely gone and his skin was extremely soft.  Many in our family knew of our dad's constant itching and raw skin, we are amazed and so grateful that our dad was able to spend his last days almost free of the psoriasis irritations.  Sadly our dad passed away from a completely unrelated physical condition at the age of 91.  But we know during his last months of his life we found him relief from psoriasis through this MetaDerm product.  I highly recommend trying this product as I know what my father battled the majority of his adult life. It may not work for all but I took a chance and it worked wonders for my dad.  Very satisfied!!!!!
