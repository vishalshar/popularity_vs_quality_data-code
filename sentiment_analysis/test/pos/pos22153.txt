I have 2 Labs, one about 90 lbs and the other about 70lbs.  So far I'm loving the coupler; it has made walking the two of them so much easier and has turned walks from not fun to actually a pleasant experience.  I've only used it 5 times so far so I can't comment on how long the coupler will hold up but it seems very sturdy and I've been using a Sporn harness for over two years that's still in great condition so the Sporn products are built to last.Something to keep in mind is that the bigger stronger dog will control how the walk goes and will be able to drag the smaller dog around.  This coupler will definitely work best with the following combinations:  (1) two dogs of similar size (2) two dogs of varying sizes if both are well-behaved walkers and (3) or if the stronger dog is both well-behaved and willing to keep the smaller one in line.Positives:1) Very minimal tangling, even with the dogs crossing paths constantly.  The first walk my younger one got a bit wrapped up but as they get used to it the tangling issue is almost gone.2) Works just fine with the Sporn harnesses although I think it makes the dogs slightly more prone to tangling than if you just used it with normal collars.3) Sturdy construction; no issues even with two strong dogs pulling on it.  Can't comment on whether the adjustable latch stays put since I always use it on the widest setting.4) Dogs keep each other moving since they are pulling on each other.  If one starts to sniff in one spot for too long the other one will get bored and pull hard enough to get the slow one moving again.Negatives:1) I walk the dogs in places with wide spaces so I actually wouldn't mind if it could be made to allow even more space between the dogs.  With the sporn harnesses on, the furthest they can get apart is about 8 feet.2) Not for walking drastically different sized dogs unless both are well-behaved or if the stronger one is calm enough to not drag the smaller one.Overall I highly recommend this for the right combination of dogs.  I also highly recommend the Sporn harness if you have a puller; it really cuts down on how hard the dog will pull.  The Sporn products are high-quality; built much better than comparable products purchased at the national pet store chains.
