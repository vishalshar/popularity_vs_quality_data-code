I used to own a foscam and after doing some research on cameras decided that the Netatmo Welcome was the best option on what I'm looking for. After using it for a few days I've been very happy with how it is working.I bought a foscam a few years ago and was not happy with it. Right out of the box it was much more complicated to setup than I was expecting and really frustrating. The picture quality was poor and the app was not user friendly. I also wanted to be able to record videos but it would only live stream. I looked at buying the Canary but at $249 it was more expensive than what I wanted to spend. From the reviews I read people were having issues and it seemed there were too many bugs that needed to be fixed. I also looked at Dropcam and while the price was in my range at $199, I didn't want to have to spend an additional $99 each year to be able to watch videos.I read about Netatmo on Wired and decided to give it a try since it checked off many of the things I was looking for. The $199 price was what I was looking to spend and since all the videos are stored in an SD card in the device there is no additional fees to be able to go back and watch them! Right from the start I was much more impressed than my experience with Foscam. The setup was easy and literally within a few minutes I had it working and was getting live video of my living room. The picture quality is great and I have not had any issues when I go to watch videos of any events or view live streaming. I found the app very clean and easy to use.When reading about the product they called out how it has face recognition technology which I didn't think I would need at first but actually found it very cool. I like the fact that I can set preferences for when the camera recognizes me so I can have all notifications turned off when Im home and then the camera knows when I left and defaults back to sending me notifications of anything that happens while Im away. It will keep pulling you up as an unknown person for a few days while its learning your face and requires numerous pictures to be taken but once the app shows your profile at full strength it works seamlessly.For anyone looking for an easy to use camera with good quality I would definitely recommend Netatmo.
