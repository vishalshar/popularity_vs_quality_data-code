I have used kayaks for 30 years and bought the Oru to have stored in the back of my Vibe for occasional use. After using it for the first time, I fell in love with it.  It is now my primary kayak and I live on a lake, so, I use it almost every day.My expectations have been far exceeded, the only question left is the fold strength after many years.
