UPDATE 3/28/16:  I liked this device so much that I bought a second one for a friend.  Additional photos attached.This little hub is a nice addition to the Macbook, both cosmetically and functionally.  I bought the silver to match my silver Macbook per the attached photos.PROS:-I like the small size-Good fit when connecting to the computer-Includes a port to charge while using other connections-Light weight (but not overly cheap-feeling)-Price is good compared to other manufacturers and certainly less expensive than Apple donglesCONS:-None at this time (but I'll add comments later if necessary)SUMMARYFor those who use the Macbook, this is a nice option if you need memory card slots and additional USB ports while still being able to charge your computer.  The fit/connection to the Macbook feels reliable.  If you need video connections like HDMI or VGA, you'll have to still with the Apple dongles.  Juiced makes another version of this hub that does NOT include charge port so be careful when ordering so you get the model you wanted.  Competitor models seem to have user feedback about poor connectivity with the computer so I'm happy in my early days of use.
