I set this siren up as a DIY home security system.  I have the motion detectors setup on a schedule and if it detects motion it sets the siren off.  I've tested it and accidentally set it off quit a few times.  I've had it for many months and it has never gone off on it's own.  It is my worst nightmare (right after buried alive), that I am awakened by someone in my bedroom, so I sleep better knowing this siren will let everyone know an intruder is moving around.  Bonus:  This gives me a chance to grab my weapon.
