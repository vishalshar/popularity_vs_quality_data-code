I LOVE the Cubii. I'm recently retired and have bad arthritis in my knees to the point I have to walk slowly with a cane. I've been in physical therapy as strength prep for knee replacement surgery and for weight loss. Of all the leg exercise machines I tried, the Cubii is the easiest on the knees as it has a smaller angle of flexion. Also, I need to lose weight before I can get the surgery. Since I got the Cubii I've been burning 500 calories per day toward the weight loss (equals one additional pound lost per week) and also provides strength gain.  My knees keep me sitting at home most of the time so I just use the Cubii for 2-3 hours per day while I do what I would have been doing anyway.  The Bluetooth communications to the app gives great tracking on my iPhone.
