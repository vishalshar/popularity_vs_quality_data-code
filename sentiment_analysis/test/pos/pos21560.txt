My corgi/Pom just loves this!  We found that no matter how slobbery the ball got it never got stuck. The different distances is really helpful since it alows us to play inside and outside. Now we just need to teach her to drop the ball in herself. She's great about bringing it back and dropping it next to your feet so no issues there. She had us laughing because she gets so excited waiting for the ball to launch that she taps all 4 feet on the ground in anticipation.Update!! As of today, our Corgi/Pom figured out how to load the launcher!  I will say I squealed with delight from the excitement and joy that our little furball figured it out on her own. Lol. She has been playing for the last 1/2 hr and has now figured out that if she stands close enough she can catch it mid air before the other pups chase it.
