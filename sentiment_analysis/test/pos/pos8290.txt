This watch is an elegant and useful for tracking steps throughout the day. It works well with the Withings app and that is the main reason for my purchase since I have other products by that company and been very pleased by them. The watch though does not start tracking as soon as it is placed on the wrist. It takes a moment to kick in. Otherwise another great Withings product in my opinion.
