I'm really pleased with these glasses.  Always had Slimfolds previously and if you know Slimfolds you know the price difference is dramatic.  These fit well on my lower nose where I like them but also up above if I want.  The attachment to my phone is a great idea and they don't fall out of the case.  They will fall off your nose with a sudden movement...so guys beware...don't take a pee while wearing the glasses or guess what, you may have to go fishing, like I did.  What's not to like...they fit, they're inexpensive with a lifetime replacement and they are convenient to carry.  GREAT PRODUCT.
