It's a good product, does what we need it to. We have a cat that's getting older (mainecoon, 15+) and likes to still have his roams around the neighborhood. We wanted to get something to see where he is if he gets lots (or worse). A neighbor mentioned they used to have a Tagg for their dog that worked so we decided to try it out. It gets the job done, let's us know where the cat is when we're looking for him.See in previous comments some frustration around social aspects. While they don't resonate for me it I can see how maybe they do for others - at least they don't get in the way.
