Works well but can be a little slow in updates and slow to sound the initial alarm.  Once an alarm is raised it has helped me quickly retrieve my pet every time.  Because of the non-real time updates this product will get you in the general vicinity of your pet quickly but once there you will need to rely on your eyesight to spot the pet directly.  During the day this is easy but at night it can be a big challenge.  I found that an LED collar in addition to the Whistle made this problem go away.  The whistle would get me in the area but the LED collar would make spotting his exact location quick and easy.One change I would like to see is the ability to pair the Whistle tracker with multiple base units.  I have a second home.  It would be convenient to buy a second base for that home and leave it there all the time.  As it stands I must remember to transport the base with me each time I go to the other home.  Not a huge issue but if you forget the Whistle will remain in GPS mode and the batteries will drain quickly.  And if you don't have the base then you can't re-charge it.  You can buy a second base but then you would need to continuouslly re-pair the Whistle with the base each time you changed to the other location.  Seems to me that the ability to pair with a limited number of base units (I would suggest 4) should be a relatively simple software change.
