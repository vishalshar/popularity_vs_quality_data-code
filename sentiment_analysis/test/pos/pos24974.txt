I love this device!  Excellent phone, beautiful tough screen, very pleasing design, NFC for transferring old phone set up to the Robin works really well, fingerprint recognition is fast, lots of memory (RAM) and 32GB of ROM and 100 GB of internet storage.  Fast enough for games etc.  Camera is a bit slow but takes good photographs in good light, slow to focus in low light.This phone is excellent value for money - built for people who are careful with their phones (did not pass the bend test).
