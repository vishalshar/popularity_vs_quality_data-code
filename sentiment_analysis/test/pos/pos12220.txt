I received my set about 2 weeks ago and I am very impressed with the amount of detail that has gone into these die. The intricate white designs on the sleek black back really make them pop. The only problem I have with them IS the detail. While the details are fantastic, the patterns almost blend into the numbers too well, making reading the numbers a little hard to read. Easily rectified, however, by leaning forward ever-so-slightly from the abdominal region and tilting the head a little closer to the die ;) All in all, a phenomenal die set. I use them the most now and am very happy with them!
