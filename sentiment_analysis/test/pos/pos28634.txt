I saw this advertised on Facebook and bought it for my then 8mo old that was just learning how to move around. I love this mat. It works great to keep my little one safe (if only she would stay on the mat). I wish that there was a more neutral color, as we have this down in the living room. My only complaint is that I can't cover all my floors with this mat!
