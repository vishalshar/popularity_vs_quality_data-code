My two teen daughters tried this out and loved it,  not only is it all natural but has a pleasing taste which gets them wanting to brush without the fuss. It can be frustrating at times for parents to get their children into a good oral hygiene routine let alone deal with teens who think they know it all. I received three flavors but this one was my youngest daughters favorite because to her it tasted like blue cotton candy even though it is an all natural toothpaste. It comes in a recycled box and you can recycle the box as well since the writing is done with soy inks. The Hello Toothpaste is bpa free and does not contain any phthalates also Globally sourced but MADE IN THE USA!! These are all the reasons why I give it five stars. I received Hello Kids Toothpaste in Blue Raspberry free to test with my children as a mission and these are my 100% unbiased opinions and will not received any form of payment for giving my unbiased opinion.
