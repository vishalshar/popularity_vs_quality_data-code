I purchased this because I liked the size and the matching color to the case.It connects easily but does stick out a bit if you have a thin case on.  It does get warm.  I got 103 degrees with an IR thermometer when no power was on, and 104 degrees when the power cord was connected.  I took the temp 15 minutes after the device was plugged in either to usb-c only or usb-c with power.I can see how people would worry about it snapping the USB-C port when it is plugged in and a separate device is being used.  A clamp or latch that would hook to the computer lip by the caps lock key would help prevent that from happening.
