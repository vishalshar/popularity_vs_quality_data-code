I am a proud owner of the LG 320G phone since 2008ish. I like that it's not smart, lasts ages on a charge, and is very small. But everyone I know (all two or three of them) is like "you need to respond to texts or else", and on top of that it has started to malfunction.I caved recently and got this Posh Micro thing. I love it. It's even smaller, does everything a smartphone does, but is also too small for anyone to want to be glued to its screen. It's plasticky, but eh, it's also pretty inexpensive. Lasts longer than wife's iPhone on a charge, though not as long as my last phone.Kingroot worked no prob, though GravityBox took some trial and error, seems fine once I put it on the internal memory instead of SD card. The hardware seems sound. No interference in the audio jack. Fast enough.The Android install on it seems a little weird. It's the first I've used so I don't have anything to compare to, but a lot of things don't jive well with instructions on the internet. For example, the only way I can find to change the horrible default lock screen wallpaper (GravityBox doesn't work on this) is to press menu key on home screen and then desktop: not at all obvious. But the quirks are quickly learned, I guess.Edit: just want to report that I'm still very happy after a week. Sound quality is good, switching to small font was beneficial, and I got used to typing into the Google keyboard with my big hands. Battery lasts long if you don't play with it constantly, playing music doesn't affect batter much either. I realized it fits in that little mini pocket (for old fashioned watches) that jeans usually have within the normal right side pocket, nice! The hilariously small size of this thing seems more ideal the more I get used to it.I agree with the folks saying it's too bright; I used GravityBox to take minimum brightness down from default 20 to 4 (lower than 4 shuts of the screen), much more reasonable.Edit after a couple months: I'm sorry but as issues have turned up I'm singing a bit of a different tune, and lowering five stars to four. Like, don't love. I still have no interest in any other phone, but only because this is my only option in this size.One day the screen decided to have horizontal globs of dead pixels. Seems like a hardware problem as they're faintly visible with the screen off, however they change slightly every day, so I'm stumped.The vibration is damn near imperceptible through any clothing. Have this in your pocket for a while and you'll be more in touch with your otherwise ignorable spasms, because you'll be confusing them with the phone.USB connection is very flimsy at the phone side. It doesn't stay put, you have to really push and cram it in there till it starts charging, and then set it down carefully so that it stays connected.USB charger plug thingy emits a high pitched whine, just like most laptops of a decade ago. It's not severe, but enough that I keep it unplugged.OS issues: lots of small things. Can't change lock screen to anything beyond system defaults. Google keyboard reverts to Android keyboard on every boot, and sometimes on its own without boot. Sometimes when an app auto-updates, you get two icons for it, which show as the same in every other way, and uninstalling one uninstalls both.Like I said, I like it, but bummer about the problems. If this costed any more than fifty bucks these issues would earn it three stars.
