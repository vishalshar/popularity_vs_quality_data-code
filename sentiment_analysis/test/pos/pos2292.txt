I bought 2 one small sized in Navy and one in the larger size. The Navy one was Perfect!! My son is Very happy with the way it works to hold up his pants without getting in the way. I returned the 2nd one of the larger size in black. It had a strange odor and my other son didn't like it. So one major thumbs up and a thumbs down.
