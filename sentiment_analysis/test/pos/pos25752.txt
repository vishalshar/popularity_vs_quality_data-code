I bought two of the Jitterbug Flips for my parents.  My mom has vision issues so the big screen is a huge help for her.  My dad loves the fact that it is so easy to use.  They aren't hard on their phones and my dad has already procured phone holders  to protect them (local swap meet).Instead of setting up an account online I placed a call to their customer service so that I could get both phones on one account (I didn't know if that would be an issue online).  I almost fell off the couch when a real live person answered the phone!  I am very  impressed with GreatCall and their customer service. Their call centers are based in the US,  with calls answered quickly by knowledgeable reps.She walked me through the account process, answered all my questions and had every thing set up in about 15 minutes.  I love the idea of the 5 star service (they can press a button and have emergency services called, or even a family member contacted) phones have gps and you can ping the phones location from their website. We'll see how the phones hold up, but the customer service is amazing and you can't put a price on that.
