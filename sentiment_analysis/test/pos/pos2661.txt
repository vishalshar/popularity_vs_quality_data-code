A very nice pencil holder.  It came with a shorter pencil than usual and the refills that I purchased also are shorter but it all works very nicely with this holder.  You just pop the chrome tip out with the pencil in it and then turn it around to fit back into the holder so that the point doesn't get broken when you carry it around. Handy little gadget!  Will work with other shorter pencils too.
