I bought this phone holder specifically for a cross country trip I made to pick up my daughter.  I flew out to San Francisco, and drove her car back to Indiana.  I was not familiar with her car at all, so I didn't know whether I could mount to the windshield, or the dashboard.  Reading about the sticky gel pad, plus the suction feature, made me feel confident that this holder could be counted on to mount to virtually any surface, and I was not disappointed.The windshield of my daughter's car was not suitable in my opinion.  It was too far away to easily reach while driving.  The dashboard was textured, and irregularly shaped.  It wasn't just a smooth flat surface, but this phone holder worked perfectly.  I had read some reviews about people actually breaking the windshield, or tearing holes in the dashboard when removing this holder.  I do not think they were exaggerating or being untruthful.  This puppy is on tightly when you mount it.  The gel just doesn't want to let loose.  I really think that the sticky gel itself, would hold the phone very securely, and when the suction action was added, we had absolutely no issues with the phone (Samsung Note 4) coming loose.To remove, it merely took a bit of patience. . . applying pressure in one spot, and then just giving it a little time for the gel to release.  I am quite sure that I could have easily damaged her dashboard (Toyota Scion), if I had just jerked it off with some force.This is probably the 5th or 6th phone holder I've had over the years, and in my opinion it is by far the best one I've ever had.  I have no complaints at all with this phone holder.  I am a design engineer, and a great deal of thought has gone into this holder.  They have really done a great job with both the design, and execution of this product. . .
