Have had posh microx for a day now. It is not going to replace your full size android phone. No app drawer, cannot uninstall some apps. No weather widget available except native, closest city 50miles away. That being said, amazing for the 30$ I paid. I have lots of smartphones. Doesn't compare with my note or fire phone. Would say it is about as good as my Alcatel c1. Other than the pros or cons of being super small. I would say its a solid low end android phone.
