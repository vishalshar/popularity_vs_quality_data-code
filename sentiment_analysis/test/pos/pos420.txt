I never regretted my decision to buy Spire a few months ago. Admittedly I was a little bit sceptical at first, but the idea was convincing enough for me to try it. I bought Spire primarily with the idea of attempting to change my situation with a permanent stress and tension. My work and family lives have been pretty taxing through the past few years up to the point where it became already 'much too much'.I've been using Spire throughout the day ever since, and I really noticed some great improvements over how I can deal with stressful situations. I set up an immediate alarm to notify me of my 'Tense' streaks, and that really helps me to become instantly aware of the fact I have to get calmer. I'm also using Spire through my occasional mindful meditation sessions - and it registers the 'calmness' state pretty accurately!Frankly, I really really appreciate that someone came up with this idea :) Spire is that type of a wearable device that will be truly helping people in the future - sort of a pioneering, and a breakthrough device. Previously I tried a few wearable solutions for 'fitness' and 'health' - but it is Spire that's really helping me with the most challenging things in my life - getting me out of that state of being permanently stressed, worrying a lot, and suffering.Since my stress levels have actually affected things like digestion, I've also started to follow the idea of a 'mindful eating'. Basically, I'd typically have my iPhone next to me prior to a meal - not for emails or Instagram, though! Instead I'd try to calm down, and spend a few minutes in a calm streak registered by Spire, before I start eating.I've also noticed that I'd often become tense when speaking about my work projects, or discussing things with my team members. Spire helps me there as well, notifying me of a tense streak. I'd then consciously catch up with my breath and continue more easily.Overall, I've become pretty fond of this little attractive device - it's absolutely worth it's price tag compared to the benefits I'm getting :) Thanks again to the people who've started it.A couple of things I'd wish would get improved even more are iPhone battery usage (Spire app is kinda noticeable there), and it would be really cool if the device itself could register things like 'Tense' streaks without the app permanently running.
