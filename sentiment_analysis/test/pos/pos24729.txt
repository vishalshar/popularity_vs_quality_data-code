We are obsessed with these chewy bites. They are a great healthy snack to keep in the car, desk drawer, or use to fuel workouts. My three-year old niece loves them too! Don't expect them to look like bananas; they are a bit similar to dates in their color and consistency. They are delicious and a great alternative when you don't have fresh produce handy!
