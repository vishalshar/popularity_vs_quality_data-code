This is very good for a guitar player. It can't be used to tune a bass. We had an easy time pairing it with an iPhone. Simple to calibrate with each guitar. Not much of a learning curve.  I don't know if it is really any easier than tuning it by hand but it's kind of fun. It isn't a necessary item but it is a cool little gadget. Good gift.
