I got this watch because I wanted an activity tracker that wasnt digital.  Its a really cool concept, and I am sure it will get better as technology progresses.  Ive had it for 2 months now.  The walking tracker does good.  It says it tracks swimming and running, but I never see a different status on the graph for those different moves.  It is waterproof, so I dont have to worry about getting it wet.  And its a really awesome alarm, no snooze on this though.  Im hearing impaired so Im used to waking up to vibrations.  The alarm just vibrates the watch 8 times (cant shut it off).  And I havent missed it yet...my wife loves it because she doesnt feel or hear this one.  The only negative I have, is the band is silicon and I wish there were options by withings for different bands.  They have a leather option, but I would like a link or cloth option.  Leaving the watch on 24/7 gives my wrist a little rash (im assuming because it doesnt breathe).  So I just swap wrist every few days
