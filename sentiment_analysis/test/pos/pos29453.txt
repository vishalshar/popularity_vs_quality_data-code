They are totally adjustable depending on how you lace them.  Perfectly snug, not too tight, not too loose.  No longer have to tie and untie my shoes.  Just slip them on, slip them off.  Perfect!  I ordered another pair in Turquoise but the color shown in the picture is not the color they come in . . a very drab turquoise, not bright.  Had to return them.
