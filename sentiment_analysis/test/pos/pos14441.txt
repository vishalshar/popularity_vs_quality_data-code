I like the cap, I use it for making a mason jar shaker bottle for the gym. The only 2 issues I can say might be negative are: to get it tight enough to seal without any leaking, makes it almost impossible to get off since there isn't much to grip on it when trying to twist it off; and lid for the pour cap snaps in, but the part it snaps in to seems weak, and probably won't take too long for it to break with daily use. These issues for me have been minor, overall a great product I use daily.
