I'm a side-sleeper with neck problems.  A bad pillow can give me persistent headaches.  In the past, I've found pillow with air bladders or water bladders that have worked fine - until I've had to replace them.  The same model just didn't work as well, perhaps because of changes in their memory foam.  None were as good as this pillow.  This pillow is firm enough to keep my neck supported.  It is the only one I've tried that also feels this luxurious.  Maybe I'll stock up for when this one wears out.
