Very smooth cream and makes your face feel good.  It doesn't leave your skin with a sticky residue like a few creams that I've used.  I like using it as a night cream as well and have used it for about a week now.  My facial skin feels smoother and a little tighter already. It also helps to make my skin more healthy looking and rejuvenated. I'm very happy with the results and would recommend it!
