I have had it for a week and I find it limited because I have to have a 3mbps upload speed or the quality is dropped to 480 or 360 dpi.  Also  the documentation is poor and the connection set up is poor.  Trying to change FB live accounts is difficult.  I have been trying for 3 days with no success.  It only streams with Facebook live and the livestream service.  LiveStream is real expensive cheapest is $42 a month and you can pay up to $2000 a month.  The battery life is very poor(45 minutes is the best I have gotten so far)  so you will need to have it plugged in for recitals, plays, or concerts.  You need to be 5-10 feet away from your subject to get the best results.  A tight zoom gets a little grainy and pixelated. But it is much cheaper than 3 cameras and a switcher!
