Just bought a Thync -- my life is so hectic, I need help calming down.  I have used it 5+ times and like it.  You put the module on, and then it goes through a series of pulses that don't hurt, you feel a slight tingling on your forehead and you can adjust it up or down.  After running through the program, I do feel a difference.  It really helps me sleep restfully.  I am a fan.  Try it!
