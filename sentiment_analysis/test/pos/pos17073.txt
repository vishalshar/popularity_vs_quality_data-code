My nine year old is really enjoying.  I have nothing really negative to say.  Only to highlight to other potential buyers the need for Smart Bluetooth technology.  Older tablets/ cell phones may not be able to run MiP. Before buying, try to download the MiP app from the Play Store.  If the device allows you to load the app and does not tell you your device in not compatible, you should be fine.  You can still use MiP without the app but the app opens up so much more fun.  Just something others need to know.
