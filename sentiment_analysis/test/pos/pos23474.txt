This is such a great product! My friends had bought it earlier than me and finally I gifted myself the BlueSmart for a city trip I had planned for a while. Off I went. First step is to charge the battery so then you can charge your phone on the go. My Iphone 5S is an old lady so this comes in really handy when traveling, I used to always run out of juice. Second, connecting with your phone is easy, download the app and pusha button and voila.  Last, I packed 3 days worth of clothes in there and it fit! I love traveling light so I don't have to check luggage, it's like that movie I don't remember the name with George Clooney...Anyway, great product, highly recommend.
