I have a difficult time sleeping throughout the entire night - that is until I tried this product.  I was introduced to it after receiving a swag bag from a 5K I did one weekend.  Most sleep aids do not work for me.  I decided to try Dream Water on a Friday night, just in case.  Well, I slept the entire night, and didn't wake up until later than usual - probably because I drank the whole bottle!  After I received my order I drank 1/2 a bottle and that worked perfectly.  I slept thru the night and woke up fine - no grogginess or any weird dreams or any crazy side effects you hear about for sleep aids.I recommend this product, but I say start off slow - maybe 1/4 bottle the 1st time and work your way up.
