My husband is going overseas and stopping at different port on his way to the Panama Canal. A friend from work that also travels suggested these so he could put his credit cards and ID when he is walking around in those towns. They fit perfectly and he loved them. Very useful. He has enough room to fit quite a few things without looking bulky.
