If you're a musician like myself, you own many stringed instruments, and alternate your tunings depending on the style.I am capable of tuning a guitar without help, by 'ear.'  Though sometimes, having to know so many different tunings can become tedious, especially when playing 12 string guitars; Which is what got me to buy this tuner.  I had to grease my pegs a little bit before it had the strength to turn some of them, but after that it worked like a charm.Very rarely it picks up a note off pitch, or doesn't register it correctly, but 95% of the time it's accurate.  I find that when changing strings, if you try to tune the string before winding it tight enough, it can't register how out of tune it is, and will give up, asking to re-calibrate the string, just make sure your strings are fairly tight before trying to tune them after a restring.When I first got it, the auto-detect feature was extremely faulty, picking up the wrong strings over and over and nearly breaking my strings due to this, however they have patched the app, and the last 2 times I used that feature, it worked very well.The app holding any custom tuning you wish is truly a great thing,  I have a guitar with Tronical Tune(Which is really a pain to use compared to this), but I'd prefer this tuner any day, keeping the guitar more natural feeling, while also doing away with the inconsistencies of the human ear, and simplifying the process of achieving complicated, or unknown tunings that you might not have not tried before.I also used to dread having to change strings, this makes it much simpler, albeit I do wish the head would rotate a little faster to speed up the process, I still cant complain, it's easier than doing it by hand.Each instrument you have can be programmed into the App.  Overall, this is probably one of the best 100 dollars I have spent on musical equipment in a while, and that's saying a lot.
