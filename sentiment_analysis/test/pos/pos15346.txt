Almost every single Generation 1 Controller we installed in 2015 used a hacked togetherÂ Orbit 57095 Sprinkler System Weather-Resistant Outdoor-Mounted Controller Timer Box Cover, which required our technicians to cut, drill, and otherwise modify for our purposes.This is so much better. I'd like to see an actual keyed lock, since the Generation 2 allows manual operation, which we need to avoid on some sites. Padlocks are fine for now.
