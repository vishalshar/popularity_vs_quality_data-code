Do you want to fly a super smooth, reliable, fun quad? Then don't buy this one. I have had Hubsan's quads before and I thought the altitude hold would be a great addition to this. Boy was I wrong! It's horrible it jumps up and down for no reason at all and makes it really hard to control. Its just not fun ;-( good thing it was cheep.UPDATE: After playing around with this outside I will upgrade this to a 4 star only for outdoor use. indoors it still is horrible.. But its easy to fly and in expert mode very responsive. It still jumps up and down for no reason but outside its manageable
