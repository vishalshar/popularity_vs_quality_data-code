Love this product, and even better, my 2.5 year old LOVES this product. I tried it to make sure it was actually good and it is! It has a good flavor without being too sugary. There are no little bits in it like crest, which is great for me. It is a very smooth white paste that foams really well and is so easy for brushing. I love this product and will definitely purchase again. It's also a great deal for the amount you get compared to other "safe" toothpastes. It's comparable to the price per oz of sensodyne, which is what we adults use in our house. Very happy with this purchase!
