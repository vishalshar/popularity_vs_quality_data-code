I bought this in hopes of having it light up when an email arrives in Outlook - two hours after opening the box I got my wish (and most ofthat time was spent googling).  I used a combination of four pieces of free software as follows:1.  AutoIt:  A freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.2.  OutlookEX User Defined Functions (UDF):  A user-contributed library that allows AutoIt scripts to communicate with MS Outlook.3.  OutlookEX UDF Example Script for New Mail Event (_OL_Example_NewMail_Event):  An example script that uses OutlookEX UDF that activates when a new email arrives in Outlook.4.  Blink1Control v1.93:  Blink(1)'s command line tool 'blink1-tool'.I know all of that looks complicated but I simply installed AutoIt and OutlookEX UDF (I have no idea how they work) then I simply added two lines to the _OL_Example_NewMail_Event script; one line runs blink1-tool to turn the LED on when the new mail arrives, and the other line runs blink1-tool to turn the LED off when you acknowledge the message.  See the two 'Run' lines below:  Func oOApp_NewMailEx($sOL_EntryId)  Local $oOL_Item = $oOApp.Session.GetItemFromID($sOL_EntryId, Default)  Run('"c:\Users\<user>\Downloads\Blink(1)\blink1-tool.exe" --rgb 255,153,0')  MsgBox(64, "OutlookEX UDF Example Script", "New mail has arrived!" & @CRLF & @CRLF & _  "From:  " & $oOL_Item.SenderName & @CRLF & _  "Subject: " & $oOL_Item.Subject)  Run('"c:\Users\<user>\Downloads\Blink(1)\blink1-tool.exe" --off')Simple as that.  Works like a charm.I'll be buying more of these, they're slick.H.C.E.
