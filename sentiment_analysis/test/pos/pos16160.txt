Just got this yesterday, and my initial thoughts are it's money well spent. The mount itself has a nice feel to it, not too heavy but definitely not overly lightweight. My car (Hyundai Veloster) is currently in the body shop so I'll update when I have it back, but have no blockage problems in the wife's Scion xB. The blades going into the CD slot are the perfect length and cause no issues with the CD player as far as making it think you are constantly holding a disc at the edge. Not sure if the mount would cause issues with trying to listen to a CD, I haven't used a CD for 10 years or more; at the moment, I do not believe it would cause an issue testing would confirm.The only problem I have with it is the steel badges, hence the four stars. I personally don't know many people at all without some sort of case on their smartphone which all but renders the smaller badge useless. The thickness of both the large and small badge is perfect, however, while using the smaller badge on my Galaxy S5 with Urban Armor Gear case (badge is on the inside of the case between it and the phone), it bonds to the mount well but when driving the phone begins to slip ever-so-slightly downward off the magnet with every small bump in the road. The small badge would probably be great for those who opt for their phone's to go in the nude, but even the thinnest of cases may still be too thick for the small badge. I've switched to the larger badge and have zero complaints. The hold is much more of what I expect. I had absolutely no slippage issues using the large badge even while on the way to work this morning and the commute definitely isn't the smoothest in town.Overall I really like this mount and definitely recommend it to anyone who thing the CD slot is completely useless. I think I will be buying my wife her own mount so both vehicles have one. If you share a vehicle, you may want to also purchase some extra Mountek badges to have multiple large badges.
