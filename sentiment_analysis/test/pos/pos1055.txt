I find myself reaching for the middle spatula a lot more than the other two, but it'll depend on what you cook! All three are well-made and could potentially be useful for different purposes. They are incredibly easy to clean and don't require a lot of scrubbing. A key chain comes attached to the ends, so they can be hung, but I just keep them propped up in a glass jar. As a note, teal means teal... it's not blue, it's not green, and it's a fairly light and bright color.The small spatula is very small and could easily reach into bottles. I've yet to find any need for it, however. While it's small and thin, it's also quite rigid so it should hold up nicely. The large spatula is perfect for cooking eggs or pancakes. I wish the flat head was just a bit more rigid. The medium spatula is the workhorse that's useful from saut√©s to batters to soups. It's flexible but not too flexible. It's large enough to make mixing easy, but not too large that using it is clumsy.
