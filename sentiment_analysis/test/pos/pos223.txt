This stuff is awesome.First let me start this review out with the fact that I am a sweaty girl. If I'm just sitting around, I would most likely have a small pit stain. This led me to buy the clinical strength antiperspirants at the drugstore. (which is expensive for barely any product, btw!) I didn't really see any improvement  with that, so sometimes I used men's deodorant because some of the scents of certain brands are fairly unisex. This worked a little better, but I have very sensitive skin, and using products with high amounts of aluminum would leave a film on my skin that was hard to remove in the shower, scrubbing really hard with a loofa, and hurt if I tried to shave before getting it all off.Anyway now that you get the picture of how sweaty I am and how sensitive my skin is we can move on to this product. I was researching natural deodorants after my push to go fully cruelty free with the products that I'm using, which led me to learn how bad aluminum is! I watched a bunch of youtube videos and read tons of blog posts, tons of amazon reviews, and chose Primal Pit Paste because people had tons of nice things to say! The main bad thing people said was that it was too harsh on their skin, which almost deterred me but I figured if i had been using the clinical strength stuff from the drugstore, this probably wouldn't be too much worse.I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! Honestly I was worried at first, being the sweaty girl that I am, but honestly it works so well. A little really goes a long way, it melts into the skin so nicely, and I find it doesn't leave any type of weird film thats hard to remove in the shower. It smells really nice, I love lavender scents, however its not overpowering and doesn't last all day. When the lavender fades, I at first thought it would give way to bodyoder, but I was totally wrong. The only time I felt like I smelled after wearing this deodorant was when I jumped into a pool maybe 3 minutes after applying it, and then sitting around in the sun for a few hours. I'm guessing it just came off in the pool honestly.I will say it doesn't keep you TOTALLY dry, but it definitely has me drier than ever before. I would definitely repurchase and I've told my whole family about it! (You should have seen my Dad's face when I told him it was in a tub and you rub it on with your hands LOL) Anyway this is practically a novel but I wanted to write this because I read so many reviews so I thought it might to helpful to any other sweaty girls with sensitive skin out there.
