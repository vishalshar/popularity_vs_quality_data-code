I love this.  It definitely keeps accurate count of my steps, plus tracking my steps.  I have an apple watch but wasn't sure it was tracking correctly, so I purchased this (as i have their scale and their blood pressure cuff - fabulous products BTW and I love this company).  It's light weight, can wear on wrist or put in pocket or use holder to clip to belt or bra, whatever.Very high quality, love it and highly recommend!!!Anyway, loved this so much I bought one for my oldest daughter to use, as well as their scale scale.
