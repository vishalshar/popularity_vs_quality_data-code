A few days in and it's a huge upgrade over the PS Gold Wireless Headset I'd been using.Build quality is spot on, configuration was simple (albeit I forgot to remove the optical cable covers at first, lol) on PS4. I have a big head and haven't had any of the ear fatigue I get with heavier headsets in the past. The mic is super malleable so you can move it to just about any angle you prefer in front of your mouth. Large buttons for muting mic and game sounds is great and one thing I always hated about my PS ones. I've had some marathon late night Battlefield 1 sessions and they have yet to die on me. Range is far superior to my original PS headphones as well, I am not expecting to sit 30' away but I occasionally get up to let my dogs in and outside and they don't break up.For a set of headphones I saw randomly on the Amazon curated gadgets, they feel like a winner!
