SO MUCH FAMILY FUN!My sister bought the original game pack with extra mouth pieces and had it mailed to my house for Thanksgiving with the family. We had so much fun, we were crying from laughing so hard. The whole family/extended family got along for HOURS and we played this so long that by the second day of playing we had started knowing what people were saying because we could remember the cards.So, I looked for the expansion packs for Christmas game time. I checked their actual website and they wanted to charge me a CRAZY amount for shipping, so I checked here on Amazon and found a better deal.I bought family expansion pack #1 and #2 so we would have a variety of cards to go through and we wouldn't remember cards so easily. (I also bought expansion packs from other games with different brand names.) Again, we played for hours and had so much fun!Cards are easy to read, we have ages from 10-65, and when the younger kids couldn't understand a word or didn't know it we allowed them to grab another card and move along.If you are looking for a family game BUY THIS GAME AND THE EXPANSION PACKS! I promise you won't be disappointed! When we have a lot of people and play games there always seems to be fighting amongst us. Especially the younger members. There were no fights for this game! Just keep the tissues ready for the tears of laughing/joy and the bathroom clear so you don't pee your pants laughing too hard!!** The plastic pieces that come with the ACTUAL game (they're not included in this expansion pack, there are only cards) can be uncomfortable or drying to your lips after awhile, I recommend keeping chapstick on hand so your lips don't dry out. I also recommend clearing food from your mouth before playing so your partner doesn't get distracted by food particles stuck randomly in your teeth :) Order extra plastic mouth pieces to have on hand so there is always enough for everyone at all times! These also sanatize very easily.You guys, I was reading other reviews and I was interested to read that people didn't realize this came with just the cards. I guess I did research and realized what I was ordering, because I specifically was looking for just the cards. This is only cards to add to the game you hopefully already have, or to buy WITH the original game that comes with mouth pieces. These cards will work for any game of this type, not just this brand.  Again, order extra of these mouth pieces too so everyone can have their own!
