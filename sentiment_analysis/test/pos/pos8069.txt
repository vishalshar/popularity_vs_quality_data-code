Worked exactly as advertised and does what we want. Good quality video, no problems streaming to Facebook, controlling it from a phone was a breeze. The only minor grumble was with the sound quality which wasn't quite as good as we expected, but it was certainly fit for purpose. We're looking forward to seeing how it goes. It is very unobtrusive on-stage or near the stage during live events - we used a black lighting stand to put it on (taller less imposing and less costly than a tripod).It would need improved sound quality from the built in mics for 5 stars.I would love to see Android support - please, please, please!
