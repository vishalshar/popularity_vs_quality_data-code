I bought these lights less than two months ago. They work beautifully and random people always give me compliments on them, which means people notice them and won't hit me. Almost 2 months in, the batteries stopped working and I was very upset. The guys at Revolights personally reached out to me and helped me troubleshoot - after a few back and forths we figured out that both my batteries were from their old, defective batch and we later found that one of the rims was also defective. They were so helpful throughout the process and actually sent me replacements for all three free of charge! This is why I'm not updating this review from 3 stars to 5 stars because it's a great team with a great product and great customer support. :D
