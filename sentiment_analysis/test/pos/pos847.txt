WE ARE VERY HAPPY with our new GhostBed. The mattress unfolded and puffed up in less than 15 minutes after we opened it. I Love the fact that it is completely enclosed in a mattress cover. Some mattresses that are vacuum packed are just the foam, no covering.  We slept on it on the floor for a few days until the Bed Frame we ordered arrived. It wasn't too bad directly on the floor except at our age, it's hard to get up off the floor. The Frame makes it so much more comfy.  I am so happy we ordered this bed. It's easy to move around too.
