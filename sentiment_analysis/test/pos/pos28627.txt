After looking at a number of play mat options, I ended up purchasing the Lollaland Play Mat.  A few weeks later, I purchased a second mat!  The non-toxic, environmentally-safe aspect was important to me given how much time the baby would spend on the mat and how close he would be to it.  There was no weird smell opening the package and the mat is nice and cushiony - but still firm enough that the baby can practice walking on it.If the mat was available in a larger size, I would have given this 6 out of 5 stars!
