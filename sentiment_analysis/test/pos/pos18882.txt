A friend told me about these and I was a bit skeptical.  I've been using them for a couple of months now and I'm completely sold!  Easier than ziplocks and cheese of all sorts stays much fresher and retains texture and flavor way better.  Just drop left over cheese in the bag, fold the top and keep it in the cooler part of your fridge.  You won't be disappointed.  A little pricey but I find I can resuse each bag several times
