I heard a lot about these so decided to try it out myself. I was in a group running a Ragnar Relay which is a relay run of around 200 miles. We were going to be in a van for a long time and to not be smelly, we bought these miracle workers. 1 towel cleans up the body and keeped the car from smelling worst than it should. Great for these kinds of event or outdoor camping or anything were a shower isn't available. Recommend to everyone.
