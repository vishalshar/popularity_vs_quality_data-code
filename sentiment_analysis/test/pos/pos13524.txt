Do not waste your money on the automatic fall detection package.  I found out the hard way that it doesn't work as expected.  I slipped on some wet grass out in the yard.  It was a "legs flip up in the air, land on your butt" fall, and the device didn't recognize it as a fall.  I had to push the button to get help.  Yet it recognized a quick "yank it off the charger and put it around my neck" as a fall.  When I called to say the automatic fall detection wasn't working and I wanted a refund, I was advised that the terms and conditions (apparently in the fine print) say that it doesn't always recognize falls.  Well, if it doesn't always recognize falls, what good is the automatic fall detection plan?
