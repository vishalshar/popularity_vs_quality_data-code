Excellent purchase! I was a little apprehensive bc of the cost - but have no regrets nor buyer's remorse.The URB-E is easy and comfortable to ride. I took it out for a spin the first day I got it and have not looked back!I feel like the cool kid on the block (and I'm in my mid-fifties!!). My 10 y/o grandson even said my hair looks cool when I'm riding! I took him and his bike helmet to a large parking lot and let him ride it too!the scooter is a little heavy but it does fold up simply and can be pushed like a shopping cart. I herc mine into my trunk often, but could see where is may be a little heavy for a person not as strong as myself.Folding and unfolding is so simple - just pick up the seat. The whole thing is so well engineered and solid.The scooter needs a little assembly when you first get it. It was fairly easy, and would be much easier for someone with better vision than me.Also, UPS won't leave this on the porch - they need to have a signature, which is okay as I'd cry is someone stole it!Keep riding!
