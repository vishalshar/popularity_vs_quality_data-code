I bought this to link with my IPhone 6 and take movies of presentations that I was giving at Toastmasters. I was looking at alternatives other than the IPhone's microphone. Presentations are often given in less than perfect conditions. Room acoustics can often ruin the filming of the presentation. Portable lavalier microphones are the best option to minimize room noise but then you have to deal with the cord. On speculation, I tried the Ampridge MightyMic Bluetooth mike. I've used it several times under different conditions. Well enough to render an opinion here.It works under less than optimal conditions, The audio on my video was more than acceptable. Not ideal, but the best solution I've tried so far. The mike has no latency through Bluetooth. The range seems adequate. I've experienced no dropouts or no noticeable audio artifacts due to packet loss, etc. The DSP adapts to the room if I'm not talking. The mike can pick up people talking 15-20 feet away with no issues. It tales several seconds to adapt to a room's ambient noise. The first 1/3 second of talking (after it has adjusted to the room's conversations) is loud but the mike adapts quickly. I've posted a YouTube video that demonstrates how well the mike works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd8T629XOVcIt is easy to use and doesn't show a temperamental personality. The IPhone App for it costs $5 and also works well with IOS 9. Do I regret buying this? No.
