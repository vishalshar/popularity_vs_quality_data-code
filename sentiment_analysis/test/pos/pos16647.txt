I bought this because the older version kept falling off. This one does not seem to have that problem... although, the older version didn't have a problem until about 6 months of wear.It does HOWEVER not notify me as quickly as the old collar device used to when the dog leaves the "Home" zone...we went for a walk last night and it didn't notify me until we were a quarter mile from the house.
