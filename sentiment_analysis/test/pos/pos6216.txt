This was a really cool and unusual item I purchased as a gift. I would give it 5 stars, except the box it was packaged in had a big chunk out of the corner--not really an attractive thing for gift giving.  However, the product itself was not damaged in any way.  It got a rave review for "coolness" from its recipient.
