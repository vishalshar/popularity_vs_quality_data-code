I am really happy with this product and still am for the wallet functionality. It allowed me to literally loose my wallet since everything can be loaded in the phone.The bad: a little over a month of owning this product the case itself broke. I emailed the company and they sent me a replacement no questions asked. While I wished the original had not broken, the company took care of me which makes me happy. I would recommend this case to any and everyone.
