The Petzi is an awesome TreatCam. I use it for one cat. Everyone I show wants one. So far it has worked flawlessly. My cat comes running often to the chime it makes at Camera activation, if not he comes when I talk or when he hears the unit loading to fire treats...he always shows up! I love the social network of pet lovers where you can share your favorite pet pics from the cam or your other devices.Pros:Very good video.Speaker gets loud and is natural sounding.Holds a good amount of treats.Very good cable management for the plug.Reliable.Not going to call these cons, but a couple things a potential buyer might want to know:Does not have night visionDoes not have 2 way audio, just you-to-pet.Gives about 10 little treats. (Cat Greenies)All in all I would buy again and recommend to anyone. I give it 5 stars. Have fun and remember to adoption is the only option!When you get one look up my cat Wily! ;)
