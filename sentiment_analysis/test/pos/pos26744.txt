I ordered this as a safety precaution for my wife. I had to promise her it wasn't so that I could stalk her. The ability for it to automatically call 911 and 3 different people that you manually set on the app is awesome. With all the driving she does for work, I never know where she is, and with past history of car issues, its a nice quiet peace of mind. We don't have a new car, its in good condition, and I try to keep it check up and oiled changed. I don't get the feature that tells me that the gas is low, but It does tell me when she has any error messages(dumb lights). It informed me last week that her tire had low pressure while I was at work and she was home about to leave for work. I was able to call her and have her check and call AAA to fix it for her since I was stuck at work. If I ever get a newer car, I could find better uses for it, and I am a smarthome user, but apart from miles driven per a tank, I have not utilized it to connect to my house for any reason. I simply have IFTTT send the info to a google spreadsheet. She could be using it to document automatically how much driving she does for work, but she is old fashion and prefers to do it all by hand. maybe someday I'll get to prove my techie crap is useful for her. I've used this since August and have had no issues with it, I actually forget that its there until it tells me when something may be wrong wit the car. I'll probably play around with it a little more one of these days and see what new cool things I could automate with it. In the meantime, it does its job very well and has already proven to be a valuable asset in helping discover issues with the car before it's too late.
