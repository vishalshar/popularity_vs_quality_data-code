I have only found one other conditioner that makes my hair as smooth, soft and cooperative as this. I randomly found this in a healthy living shop while I was visiting Boulder, CO because I forgot to make shampoo/conditioner. This is like CRACK. It's so hard not to overuse it--but try to void it because it's so rich and thick that it will cause major buildup if you get carried away like I did. Smells wonderful, feels wonderful, makes me hair look amazing....I'll be re-ordering this until the end of time. THEY HAD BETTER NOT STOP MAKING IT, EVER.
