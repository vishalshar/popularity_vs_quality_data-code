I have a Gibson Les Paul X which has the built-in robo tuners that do auto tuning and it's built into the guitar. I absolutely love this feature as I play in many different guitar tunings. I've been looking for something that would provide the same ability on normally hand tuned guitars, especially 12 string guitars! After installing the app on my phone, I started using the device and within minutes I had programmed all of my different tunings. It works as promised! Highly recommended!!! Love it!
