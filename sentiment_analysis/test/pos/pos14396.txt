I recently purchased this Bluesmart suitcase for my husband and I to use. We both love it and plan on using it for short trips as a carry-on suitcase.My husband wrote this review from his experience:"We bought this luggage to primarily use for my business travel and short trips. I will probably be using it more often then my wife since she usually packs a lot more when we travel. It is a sleek and well-designed carry-on suitcase designed for a short 2-3 day trip. At first glance, I was impressed with the design and overall look and quality of the materials. I also really like the ability to store my laptop and other items in the main compartment that is protected by a zippable flap that contains a mesh compartment in the lid to protect the computer. When I traveled in the past, I always used my Samsonite Winfield 2 Fashion 20-Inch, as well as my laptop leather bag. Now that I have a Bluesmart, I am really excited to just take one piece of luggage that fits all of my clothes, shoes, laptop, tablet, and toiletries. As you can tell in the pictures, I was able to fit a pair of jeans, slacks, t-shirts, dress shirts, polo, gym shorts, couple pairs of socks, underwear, dress shoes and a toiletry kit. There is even extra room at the bottom of the top compartment where the laptop fits to store smaller items such as socks, your airplane ticket or a thin book/magazine.I also really like the technology features which are a great bonus compared to my other carry-on suitcases. First you have to charge the battery in the luggage before using it. There are 2 USB ports to charge your smart phone (website states that you can charge an iPhone 6x) therefore; you donÂ’t need to find a seat near an outlet which makes this a great work station. You can even charge your computer while in the bag as there is a USB port in the same location! This is one of the best features as I sometimes forget to charge my phone and am always looking for an outlet. In addition, the app was very easy to dowload and use as it contains a location tracking option via GPS in case you happen to lose your bag, you have the ability to weigh your luggage using scale in the handle, and the best part is that you can lock and unlock your bag from your phone. The bag actually locks when you walk away which is a nice security feature.Overall, this piece of luggage contains some innovative features that allow for a more efficient travel experience. Given that Bluesmart is still relatively new in the market place, I am really excited to see what the company does next especially with enhancements to their app and other technology! I would definitely recommend this product to our friends, families and business travelers who travel light and are looking for a cool high-tech carry-on luggage! I hope they will also offer a larger version for check-in luggage in the near future!" - JS
