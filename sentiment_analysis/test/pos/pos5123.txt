This is a fantastic product, I also have a Miracle Grow Garden that is three pods and this is significantly better than it, the LED lights are very bright and the plants seem to be growing much faster than the Miracle Grow Garden.  I also like how everything is contained in the Pod, every two weeks I need to add a liquid to my Miracle Grow Garden and its annoying, plus this doesn't have a water pump so its silent.I planted Basil in this Click and Grow and also in my Miracle Grow System, the click and grow basil is much bigger already and looks greener.
