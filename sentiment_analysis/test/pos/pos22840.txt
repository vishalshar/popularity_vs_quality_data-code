Bought this for a Relative with Disability. He loves the Phone and it is easy to Use.  One improvement would be if it was easier to open.. If it has push button flip.. then it would be close to ideal.The Charging Cradle is great for people who would have trouble to plug in a cable.. ( People with only one working hand )This is a good idea and good for people with disabilities.
