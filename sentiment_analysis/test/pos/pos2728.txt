Sound quality is good, considering the size of this speaker.  You don't expect the best bass response in a speaker this size, and it does go to 60hz per specs.  Construction is nice and solid.  Pairing over bluetooth was simple; the cues are all verbal.I'm not planning to dunk this underwater, but if claims are true - I'm not scared to set this next to the tub. Over bluetooth, the controls on the unit will pause, start, and change music tracks forward and back.  Perfect when the speaker is next to you and the phone is sitting farther away where it's dry.  Big button on the top controls Siri too - nice.I find that I need to leave the unit at the highest volume settings, even in a room that's quiet.I've used the call as a speaker for phone calls; testing while sitting in a room that was dead quiet.  I had no problem hearing them on the speakers - but those on the other end complained about background noise - and that I was not easy to hear.Perfect by the hot tub - but probably not the best if you're looking to use this for a lot of conference calls.  Too bad - the form factor is ideal for that use case!
