Wow, spectacular speakers.  When my speakers arrived, I had it out of the box, turned on and with a push of a few buttons; I was streaming music via Android on my tablet and my phone. I have a tendency to test everything to its limits so I started with what I normally listen to, which is mainly bluegrass, folk and early baroque on period instruments.  I was amazed with the full sound that the Libratone Zipp delivers.  For a portable speaker the Zipp performs with great clarity and dimensional separation of the different voices; one feels the space between the performers.  In some of Handel operas, Chet Baker recordings, and the songs by Mandolin Orange, I am pulled into the performance, and I hear  them as fresh again.  The Libratone Zipp make you want to hear to the music again, but not as sounds to fill the background.  I would recommend the Libratone Zipp to friends.
