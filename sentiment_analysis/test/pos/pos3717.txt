The original process worked just fine.  It yielded some delicious mushrooms, and they grew very quickly.  However, I'm disappointed because I was expecting two crops of mushrooms from the box, and the back side didn't grow.  Cool product, but overall not worth the money.[EDIT:  I increased my rating to 4 stars because of the prompt response from customer care.]
