I tried the powder but like the crystal better because it is sweeter.  However, it must be completely dissolved or else you will add more than needed and end up with sugar in the bottom of your cup or glass. I love the taste it has no after taste. I use it in and on everything. I wish there was a larger economical size. I highly recommend it. Just be aware when traveling do not put it in your carry on. Make sure it is out to prevent being held up going through security plus your bag hopefully will not be cut up like mines was.
