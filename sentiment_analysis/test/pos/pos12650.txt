Bought them for my girlfriend. We get them at Whole Foods sometimes, so I surprised her with a box of 6. The variety is nice, but for what I payed it would have been cheaper to buy the six bags at the store (of course, I went too fast and didn't realize at the time). Nonetheless, the products arrived safely and weren't pulverized like an old bag of doritos from the back of the vending machine--full chips!
