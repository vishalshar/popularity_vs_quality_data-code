The Whistle GPS Pet Tracker and technical support is truly outstanding!  The Whistle tracker works great out in the country at our Farm, 10 miles north of Ocean Springs.The yearly monitoring fee is less than $100 - you can't beat that for what you get. I receive instant Text Alerts, Email alerts and even a weekly summary!
