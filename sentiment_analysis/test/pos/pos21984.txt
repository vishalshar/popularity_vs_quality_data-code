We had really bad mosquitoes this year, and I wanted to try out a less toxic repellent. Unfortunately, I am not able to just hide indoors, because I have a dog, who is an Olympic level fetch fanatic, and he demands satisfaction several times a day.Kite Shield lets me go out and play with him without getting bit. The last time I mowed the lawn, I saw many mosquitoes, but got only one bite on my back, where I must have missed a spot with the spray.I only have two notes of caution:1) if you have sensitive skin, it might be slightly irritating if applied to wet skin.2) you will smell like Valentine's Day conversation hearts. The fragrance from the oils persists, but is not unpleasant.I saw the review from the guy in Maine. That experience may have been less positive than mine because of having a slightly different breed of mosquito there, if I had to guess; I am in Wisconsin. Also, I don't generally spend more than an hour outdoors at a time, so I haven't personally experienced a loss of protection as it wears off.For my situation, Kite Shield is the best option, and I am glad to see that it is available for purchase on Amazon!
