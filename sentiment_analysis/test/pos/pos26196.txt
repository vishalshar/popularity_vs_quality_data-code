Does the job of seemlessly increasing storage. Performance is slightly impacted when accessing things you dont regularly access (e.g., loading a Fusion VM you dont often use). This isn't too bad considering that I no longer need to plug in an external drive to run VMs, or access data that doesnt fit on the hard drive that my employer dictates is "adequate". So far a very good product, does what it says, is simple, it supports file vault, time machine, and all of the functionality you'd expect out of OS X.
