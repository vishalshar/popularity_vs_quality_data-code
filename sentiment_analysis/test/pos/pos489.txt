Initial installation resulted in many false alarms.  In February, they updated the software that was sent over Wi-Fi.  I have since reinstalled the batteries and after a couple weeks have not had false alarms.  One of the batteries would not initialize (the process needed to be retied several times on the other one).  Roost quickly replaced it for free and the new one initialized fine.
