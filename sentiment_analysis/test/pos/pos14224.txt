I started to assemble the kit only some time after I received it, but then it was all completed within a couple of hours. It took me a few contacts to get used to soldering again after more than 20 years, but it wasn't such a big deal when following the instructions and using some common sense. The unit worked right away, and now I'm able to collect information for SafeCast as well.
