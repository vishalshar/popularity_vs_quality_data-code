Excellent way to keep cheese edible for an extended period of time. While the bags work with just folding the open end, I do wish the company would market them with some type of tape closure. I don't normally keep tape in the kitchen and have to go grab a piece from the roll in the office. Uggh. I've seen these bags at Williams-Sonoma with tape closures included and wish all of the products included this convenience.
