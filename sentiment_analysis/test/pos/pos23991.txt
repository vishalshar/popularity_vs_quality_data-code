All I have to say is --FINALLY!!!! I cannot rave enough about this product - where has it been (for me) all these years???!!  I've kept my eyes peeled & trialled countless other 'natural'/non-GMO/non-aluminum based deodorants and/or antiperspirants over the past decade+ (all of which have failed miserably, especially Tom's- I'd have thought I had rather poured 20% salicylic acid on my underarms). SO, I only decided to try out Primal Pit Paste (lovely name) b/c I figured I hardly had much else to lose (every other (no doubt) carcinogenic, chemical-ridden option out there never even seemed to provide sufficiently effective results, including the 'clinical protection' lines. THIS STUFF IS THE ONLY DEODORANT I PLAN TO USE FROM HERE ON OUT. The ingredients do not contain a single surprise - down to the very basics - & nothing else has been more effective for me (no exaggeration), not to mention for the first time, I am glad to use a product on my under arm area sans fear of long-term harmful effects. I was skeptical about the jar set-up, but it's actually not a big deal as I suspected it might be, much less any kind of deal-breaker. I ordered lavender, even though I was concerned (I have asthma & really struggle with many perfumes/scents), but it's a winner!! Since the source is essential oils, it isn't harsh at all & really just provides a boost of freshness! Mine arrived completely melted (AZ :(( ) but since this isn't a protein-based product, there really isn't any worry re: denaturing (unlike so many facial/beauty products). I just left it sealed and threw it in the fridge for a good hour before use. The viscosity or better yet texture of this stuff is nice - perfect for intended it is a bit reminiscent of shea butter skin care concoctions - makes sense. Unlike traditional harmful deodorants, this one doesn't leave that intolerable residue (a bit of a crucial detail since you have to apply it from a jar). It absorbs quickly, feels nice & has not stained any clothing or left any marks. I have found a little goes a long way, and I have been so impressed with the life of each application. It would not be an exaggeration to say it lasts noticeably longer than even all the clinical strength ones I've tried (all of them) or otherwise. All day & still no odor- on myself or clothing. I am not a fan of writing reviews, but I had to write one for this. I'm won over & plan to tell everyone (men & women) I know that this stuff is definitely worth a go!! Naturally, everyone is a bit different & may experience better or worse results or have worse or better days w/ it, but given the ingredients, if someone tries this without very good results, increasing quantity first would be the best bet --I'd be willing to bet. -from a now most loyal & thrilled customer who begrudgingly ordered w/ lower than low expectations!!
