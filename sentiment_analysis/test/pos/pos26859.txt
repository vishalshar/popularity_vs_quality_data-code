Love these wrist weights so much I bought them in small first for my wrists and I could JUST fit them on my ankles as well so I just bought another pair in large which fit my ankles better.  I also bought weighted gloves to add some bulk since these aren't that heavy.  Will be trying these by themselves in Zumba tonight as I think less weight will be good when working out but the heavier ones are good to just leave on while going about your daily activities. They really do tone you up effortlessly.  I have read some reviews complaining about the price but honestly they are very well made, they are odor free, waterproof (for swimming), and washable.  Plus they look stylish and they are not filled with sand that will eventually leak out like many other weights.  Unless you lose them you will have them for life so it's a one-time investment and in my opinion definitely worth it!  By the way I am a petite 5'2" woman, 110 lbs.  who does like "wider" looking bracelets but the small fits my wrist fine (and as I stated above the small even fit my ankles).
