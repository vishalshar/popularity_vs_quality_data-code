Another nice gadget for a smart home.We are participating in a project where you can get paid for energy you are not using during hours where so called peaker plants are active to supplement the electricity in a particular area. Those plants might not be the cleanest CO2 wise, and that is why there is an initiative on ohmconnect [dot] com where they monitor your smart meter and using this power genius, are able to switch off certain utilities during such peak events.I have been able to earn back the costs of this device within a couple of months.You hook this unit to your wifi, but the configuration is done through the wink app that actually flashes the screen of your phone/tablet and a light sensor on the power genius. *brilliant* (imho)
