I just want to say thank you Amazon for carrying and Bare Fruit for creating such an awesome product! We learned about Bare Fruit at Subway and thought it was fabulous we could purchase a healthy chip alternative for our children. The best part is our entire family fell in love! Our older children (6 & 7) enjoy them as much as our 11 month old. Bare Fruit has become a staple in our diaper bag. I'm pregnant and sometimes need a pick me up so it's great to have something healthy to grab on the go - and of course the children are ALL quite happy when I share!
