This appears to be the digital / 2016 upgrade to their original egg-timer pet feeder.It's easy to set up and use -- just set the delay (in hours) for each tray, then wait, and each tray will pop open as expected.The food trays seem sturdy and are removable for easy cleaning. I haven't tried yet, but based on how durable they feel I expect that it'll be okay to clean them on the top rack of the dishwasher. The lids seal neatly, but they're definitely not air- or watertight, and the instructions warn against putting wet food or water into the trays (if you take the trays out, there's not much inside, but you wouldn't want to risk getting the electronics wet, or getting the insides gummed up with wet food).The trays are a good size, too. They're more than big enough for my 10 lb. cat, but if you have a big dog (I have a 100 lb. golden retriever) they won't be big enough (the two trays together would probably be enough, though).It's definitely secure. There's not really a good edge of the lid for your pet to grab on to, and I wasn't able to figure out any way to open the lids without pressing a button on the control panel. It also has little rubber feet, so your pet won't push it around while eating his lunch.Unfortunately, this requires four AA batteries (not included). I'm sure they'll last for a good, long while (not sure why it takes four of them), and I suppose it's possible that they'll fail and my cat will go hungry that day, but at least they're just AA batteries, which are cheap and plentiful.
