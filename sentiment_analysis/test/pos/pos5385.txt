without question, Dream Water works well and as such, should get 5 stars.But the bottles are nearly impossible to open.  I have no idea what they were thinking when they sealed these bottles, but it takes a person far stronger than myself (even with pliers) to open the bottles.  By the time you get the bottles open, you're wide awake with frustration.I seriously doubt I will be using all that I purchased, I'm too fed up the with fight to open the bottles to continue the battle.
