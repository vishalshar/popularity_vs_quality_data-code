I will try to upload some photos, although they were done with a not-so-good webcam. I got this phone, through Amazon, at a sale price of $68.99. For that price it is amazing, and a great bargain. It is not as fast as the Samsung Note 3, which I paid $300 for unlocked (which was a cheap price at that time), but I didn't expect it to be. It also feels much more light weight and less sturdy than the Note 3. In terms of "feel", the biggest differences are weight (Posh L500a is very light weight) and screen material (Posh screen is plastic overlay, and Samsung is Gorilla Glass). I haven't applied the included screen protector, because the feel of the plastic screen is already noticeable to me, but it works quite well, and is pretty responsive to touch. I bought this phone to be a backup when the fancy ones are out for repair, or to use when traveling abroad, to leave my "fancy" phone at home.The Good: Good size, just a bit smaller than the Samsung Note series, and light weight in the pocket. Runs all of my favorite apps just fine. Connects to AT&T's LTE coverage with my GoPhone SIM card just fine, right out of the box.No problems with Wifi, Bluetooth, or call quality. Screen is surprisingly decent if you turn up brightness. 8 gigs of internal space leaves you around 5 gigs to install apps on, since the Android OS uses some of that. Micro SD card slot for storing photos, music, books, whatever. So far, web surfing, cloud apps, alarm, bluetooth, speakerphone, calls, wifi, and LTE all work. *UPDATE* Finally tried the GPS, and it works just fine. Takes around 10 seconds to get a satellite lock, and then I'm able to track my movements with My Tracks normally.* Has Proximity sensor to turn off screen when you hold the phone to your ear to talk, like the fancy phones. Has 2 SIM slots, if you live in a place where that can help you. You can specify which one is to be used for cellular data, and you can specify separate ringtones for each SIM. Comes with snug TPU fitted case (clear/frosted).Very little bloatware. Phone is almost stock android. It has the Google Play apps (Store, Newsstand, Hangouts, GMail, Inbox, Books, Music, etc.) installed, and an app named "Posh Apps". Posh Apps appears to be a premium points reward club that gives you points for trying new apps, and then you can cash those in to buy apps. I think. I haven't used it yet.The Weird: The capacitive buttons at the bottom for menu/recent apps, home, and back do not light up. You can see them in bright light, and they are in the same position as my Note 3, but they do not backlight, and there are no settings for this in the OS. They function just fine, though. The micro usb charging port is located at the top of the phone. It works fine, although a bit snug to plug into, but the positioning will take me time to get accustomed to. Phone comes with Android 4.4.2, not the newer 5.0. It boots up a little more slowly than my Note 3, and the very first boot takes a long time, although this isn't so unusual for an Android phone on first boot.Meh: The camera is mediocre, but that's what I expected. It does have an led flash, which many low end phones lack, and the camera software is decent, with some built in filters. You cannot use the camera app and play audio or make a phone call at the same time. If audio is playing, and you start the camera app, the audio will stop. If you are on the phone and start the camera app, the camera app will crash. This appears to be a problem with the default app, and not the camera itself. I installed the app named "Open Camera" by Mark Harman from the Play Store, and it works just fine when making calls or playing audio, with no issues at all. I have no association with this app or developer, but I recommend it. Also, it can't handle high end games.Attached photos include a size comparison with Samsung Galaxy Note 3, a view of the included clear TPU case, and several angles showing the edges. Sorry they are a little blurred.Second update: Just received an over the air update on the phone. No real details were given on the update's function, but after update, I'm on Android 4.4.4, so it wasn't a lollipop update, just bugfixes.
