There is always room for improvement. Let's make it perfect!1. Outdoor compatibility is GOOD. I don't have to buy a weatherproof box for it BUT the solid or pulsating blue light is too attractive and the controller is too easy to be stolen by just a simple yank. Please at least add a security screw so that it is not easily yanked out. Please allow the light to be turned off via configuration also.2. I don't see any logging for watering history. I would love to see how much watering was done. I also would like how much watering it "plans" to do.3. No dual connectivity per tech support. I spent some time trying to configure WIFI as backup while I had the powerline connected to Internet. A lot of errors. End up I left the wifi alone. Then the tech support told me no dual connectivity.4. I sit down a lot and I still use my PC. Please support access and control thru PC web browser other than just android or iphone.5. Question. What powerline standard is it using? I already have TP-Link TL-PA4010 on my house wiring. I spent some time to see if the controller can talk to my existing powerline and, if not, I worried about if I could have two standards on the same wiring. Please give us more info about what standard you are using (HomePlug AV, IEEE802.3, IEEE802.3u, etc...)
