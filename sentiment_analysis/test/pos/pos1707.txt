Ive been using a Halti on my dog, but she'd become resistant to it recently, so I thought I'd give this a try and my trainers recommendation. It works well, my dog seems more responsive in it and doesn't resent the pressure like she does in the Halti. It's not a a one stop fix however, you do still have to train your dog. I love how sparkly it is; makes my dog look like a Vegas show girl. The only reason I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is because on of the clips broke within a week of using it. I returned it for another one, hopefully this one will hold up better.
