We bought 2 of these last year for Christmas for our kid's Ipad mini's. We received them and for some reason they had a funky musky odor on them that didn't go away for a week or two. Other than that our kids carry them around, drop them, and they have been absolutely fantastic! Just ordered a third for our 3 year old daughter who wanted her own. Overall I highly recommend!! They will love to tote their Ipad mini everywhere they go!
