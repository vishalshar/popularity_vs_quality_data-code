The Rif6 Cube ReviewFirst impressions are important.  The meticulously designed box that contained the Rif6 Cube projector immediately peaked my interest.  Each component contained in the cube-shaped box, from the instruction manual to the power/video cords are separately housed like a five-layer cake and my mouth was watering to take my first bite.The projector unit itself was much smaller than I imagined- diminutive enough to fit in your pocket.  The outer metallic housing is sturdy and attractive.  It is definitely the perfect size for any potential mobile projector adventures.Within mere minutes of opening the box and pushing the power button, the little projector is humming and a beam of light is radiating on my wall.  I am very pleased with the ease in which the projector can be launched out the box.  The quick start guide is very helpful.My sheer joy quickly subsided when I learn that the three video cords included in the box dont accommodate ios devices- only android.  I am also shocked to learn that my Mac is also excluded from the party.  What gives!?!  The remedy for iphone users requires a purchase of around $53.00 for the apple HDMI/lightning adapter.After purchasing the adapter, I attempted to give the Cube another try.  It was just as easy to launch as the first time, but now with the extra necessary step of connecting my iphone.  Once connected, my phone home page is almost immediately projected onto the wall with measured clarity.  With some adjustment of the focus located on the side of the projector and further adjustment of the mini-tripod (included), the picture is very clear and pretty solid.  Although it is not HD quality, it looks great.  This little Cube really puts out!Although, Rif6 definitely gets major props for including a mini-tripod in the box, the tripod lacks sturdiness, so it is not entirely user friendly.  It does a sub-standard job of holding the Cube in place while in use, so I intend to invest in a more reliable tripod.  Another criticism is that when you have the power cord plugged-in as well as the video cable, it tends to bog down the unit, which makes it harder to level the image on the wall.After fully charging the Cube, the battery stayed charged in play mode for at least an hour and a half, which is a fair amount of unplugged viewing.  However, there were no outward signs of its impending demise, by notification or diminished projection quality.  I just assumed it died because projector suddenly went dark and that of course was the case.Despite its short-comings, the Cube definitely puts out more than you might expect, so I feel the advantages of this unit outweigh the disadvantages.  Again, the positive features of the Cube include the following:  its extremely portable, it comes with most of the necessary accessories, easy set-up, decent battery life and good picture quality.  I would recommend the Cube to my friends and enemies.
