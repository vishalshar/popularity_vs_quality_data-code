This game is a lot of fun and provides some great laughs.  The ramps are spaced 15 feet apart, so it can be played in a relatively small area.  The game is played by four people at a time in teams of two.  Basically, on their teams turn, one person is throwing two balls.  They are trying to throw the ball directly into the nets for 3 points or get the ball to bounce toward the back of the goal for their team mate to catch for one point.  The third person involved in the turn is a member of the other team who is standing at the same ramp as the thrower.  Their job is to catch the throw after it bounces off the ramp (but stays in front of the ramp).  It is nice that on every turn, 3 of the 4 players are involved at any one time. A turn doesn't take that long so I can't possibly imagine the person that is out would have an opportunity to get bored. It is surprising how much one can exert themselves chasing the thrown ball for 15 feet to try to get a steal.  This would be a great game to play at the beach or on sand as it is quite easy for the people trying to catch the ball to hit the ground attempting to save a ball. I probably would not try to play this in a driveway for that  reason but I am sure you can.  But a lawn or sand is safer. The game balls appear to be racquet ball balls so if you need more you can probably grab a can of those - although you can order official Ramp Shot balls from their website.
