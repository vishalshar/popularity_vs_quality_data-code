As an RC hobbyist, I waited and waited before getting into these quadcopters and it all finally came together for me with this one.  Price, performance, support, user accessibility, features and a 'complete package' item all scored very high in my book.  I am also interested in supporting this new company as they make it easy for the user and seem to have built in upgrade plans for the user to accomplish; I hope they start putting things out (i.e. better cams or other attachments) that the user can upgrade to.  Do keep in mind though, this quadcopter is not designed to carry loads, I believe it can only carry around a half pound or less, so I don't expect new gear added, but improved gear.The LCD on the controller has critical flight information when you want to fly without Starlink or if your tablet/phone fails during flight.  In GPS mode, she is super easy to fly, even an inexperienced user would pick it up quickly and there is even a "beginner mode" and co-pilot option with a second controller to make it easier to learn.  The gimbal is absolutely fantastic and I enjoy the on the fly option in the Starlink app to switch between "Stabilized" and "FPV" (first person view).  The Starlink app is feature rich and functions well, but do your research in the F.A.Q.s on the Autel website as they will list what tablets and phones they've confirmed working with the app.  You will also learn that you want something with some graphic power so your 720p live feed won't stutter, I picked up a NVIDIA SHIELD Tablet K1 and while not as big as I wanted for a screen, it is the best graphic bang for your buck on confirmed tablets and the 8" screen is large enough for comfort and clarity.  I also use a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 (2016 Snapdragon model) and it is a great choice as well.I picked up three extra batteries and that gives me a full 60 minutes of care free flying time, I do get about 20 minutes to a charge, but the last 5 minutes are under caution, 25% or less, and that is time to get it back in front of you and you can kill a couple minutes flying close.  I've found that a full charge on the controller plays well with that 60 minutes of care free flying, the controller isn't dead by then, but it has a limited charge where you likely won't want to use it until fully charged again.  With no specifically designed hood for this controller out yet tmk, I went ahead and made my own out of black foam board and customized it with the K1.  My hood and tablet also fit into the Autel included case, with a little arrangement, I believe I can include my back up set of blades as well, and this excellent hard case is included.  The only thing that doesn't fit are the Propeller Guards, but I will only be using those for tight, indoor flying as they would prove useful if you touch a wall in a hallway for instance.  You'll get 2 sets of blades, good 64GB microSD card, and a lanyard.UPDATE: 7/27/16  I have an issue (everyone does actually) and took a little effort to get Autel support on it, but they currently are and have a fix being tested for their next firmware update restoring my faith and keeping my 5 star rating.  I have a second XSP for some dual camera operations.  Added one of my youtube tutorial videos to my Amazon review showing how the "Waypoint Autopilot" mode gets set up and runs, part2 is on my channel.  I maintain this is a lot of quadcopter for the money and see many good things about their user friendly design.
