I purchased the Moff Band for my nephew's 5th birthday. He had recently trended towards more sedentary toys such as legos and army guys so I wanted to get him something that would excite him about moving around a bit. I stumbled on the Moff band on YouTube and decided to try it out.The kid loves it. The snap band works well and can fit on small writs without any issues. The bluetooth was super easy to connect and get started. He has an old tablet and the App interface is simple enough for him to navigate. He is particularly fond of the sword noises and he spends a considerable amount of time running around and fighting imaginary pirates and ninjas. He says he wants a second one so he can play with his friends.He's still a lego fiend but the moff band was a great addition to his toy collection.
