I bought this to make sure I had Internet access while traveling in Germany.  It arrived 2 days before I was to leave which gave me a chance to try it out.  They give you 110MB of data (that is upload/download cellular data) to get it setup and use before you have to have either a pre-paid package or an account balance to pay for use as you go.  I bought the 29.90 1GB Worldwide package to use in over 100 countries including my destination Germany.  The data in this package is good for one year.  Most of the other packages were for Hong Kong and China.  Looking now they have added less expensive packages for other areas, including Europe but these are only valid for 30 days of use.  But for a limited trip these would be more economical.  There is also a year long package that gives you 2GB of data a month for 335 for the entire year but it is limited to use in 58 countries.  Not sure what happens if you use up all 2GB before the end of the month, but there is an option to topup data by paying for it in advance at .05 per MB.  I only used about half my package data (plus the 110MB from the included data) so I didn't run out to see if it just stops working or works at a slow speed.  My guess is it just stops unless you have paid for an additional package or have pre-paid for pay-as-you-go data.The device looks like a hefty sized iPod with a 3.5 inch screen and even has Apple like + - buttons on the side for volume control.  I assume that is just for any warning beeps, but I never heard any sound from my G2 the couple of weeks I have been playing with it.  The G2 runs Android operating system but has no apps or functionality other than as a cellular wifi hotspot.  The heft is from the 6000 mAh battery which supposedly can last up to 15 hours of use as a hotspot.  A bit heavy but still can be carried in a pocket though it will bulge.  There is also a USB port on the bottom so you can connect and charge a portable device. The G2 itself has a microUSB port for its own charge cable and a covered area with 2 slots for microSIM cards. On boot up the screen shows the auto log in, then how much data is left on the current package.  A SIM Manager screen allows you to choose among the included GlocalMe virtual SIM (which you use for your purchased package) or 2 optional SIMs. Additional information screens show you connected devices (it supports up to 5 devices), a blacklist for devices you mark as not allowed,Setup was pretty easy. Had to download the GlocalMe app for my phone (both android and IOS supported) then setup an account using the app and connect the G2 unit to the account by using the phone app and the units QR code. Then the GlocalMe G2 quickly connected to 4G here in my home in the US and showed the amount of initial data as 110MB.  I updated to the most current firmware.  Nice that they allow you to connect to your own WiFi to do this so you are not wasting allotted data to do this.  To connect a device you connect your device to the GlocalMe_xxxxxx SSID listed under Networks and enter the WPA2 encryption password if you leave that enabled.  Since you are paying a lot for this data I have no idea why you wouldn't password protect it to keep out strangers, but the option is there.  Thankfully WPA2 is the default.  According to the website support page to change the SSID or the password you can connect to the G2 from a web browser, but I wasn't able to do this getting a "Document not found" error.  You can change the SSID or the password directly on the device itself and also choose either WPA PSK, WPA2 PSK or no password security. Under Advanced settings you can change the radio channel (1 thru 11), wireless mode (b,g,n or all) and whether to broadcast the SSID.  Language options are limited to English, Japanese  IME and Chinese.I did contact GlocalMe support once to ask them why the device wasn't using my package that it listed but instead kept using the original free data.  They said it would use the package data when the free data was used up.  So if you have multiple packages it will use up the current one before switching to the next one appropriate for wherever you are located. The support contact was actually very prompt in responding to me within a day.When I got to Germany there was now less priority for me to get a local cellular topup card for my phone which has a German Vodafone SIM.  I wasn't sure how wifi would work in the hostel and hotel I was staying in during my visit.  As it turned out the hostel charged for wifi access by the hour so while I stayed there I relied on the GlocalMe G2 for Internet but at the hotel I used their free wifi and turned off the G2.  The GlocalMe G2 worked fine as long as I could get a good cellular signal.  I didn't think to test the speed, but on the tiny bar indicator at the top it showed 4G when I was either in my room or in a part of the lobby near a window.  Otherwise it displayed E which I assume was lesser speed Edge. Documentation also states 3G speed but I don't recall seeing that.  So as not to waste data on the G2 turn off notifications and any updates for your phone/tablet or laptop.  And don't leave apps running in the background that might use data.  Otherwise you will watch the data remaining counter continue to decrease even when you are not doing anything.Finally, besides support for 4G data speed, one of the reasons I bought the G2 versus the less expensive G1 was that it can take up to two micro SIM cards from other providers to also provide cellular data. So you are not locked into buying packages from GlocalMe, you can use whatever provider you want that supports a GSM/LTE device.  I'm planning to add this to my ATT plan and keep it in my car.  Yes I could use tethering from my phone since both will use the same data pool, but this gives me an additional option.
