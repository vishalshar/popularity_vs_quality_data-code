I am absolutely in love with Silikids! I have almost every item available and every time I use them I am more and more impressed. Spill free is wonderful if you have kids!! I use the top and straw even on my wine glasses to prevent spilling and/or bugs who want to share with me :).  My other favorite is the snack bags. I use them daily with hot or cold food items. Temperatures stay the same as when you put the item in them. And not to mention I am saving $$ on buying baggies!  That is always a plus! The BEST thing about these items, everything is silicone and microwave/dishwasher safe!  My items are so durable and I would recommend them to everyone! I can't wait to see what else they come up with!! :)
