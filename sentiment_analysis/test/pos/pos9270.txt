Very nice looking, and very accurate for timing.Also, though I never counted the actual steps in comparison with the steps recorded in the watch, the watch is, at least, very accurate in knowing what I'm doing, walking, running, etc. If I just go for a walk after dinner, it will automatically and precisely record when I started, when I ended, and the distance that I walked. Pretty convenient, and easy to check from the APP.Overall, very nice product.
