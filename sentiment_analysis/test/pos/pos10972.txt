You can't beat the features for the price. The home app is a little buggy to install (don't worry about height setting, change it after install), but it's easy and once it is done it works great for daily use. Just wear the thing and sync once a day. Battery life is great, it should easily last a week per charge, I just got 12 days. It only takes an hour for a full charge.The sleep tracker you need to press a button to go into that mode and again when you wake up, but the results I think are pretty legit and match good and bad nights. Now to figure out how to use that information in a useful way to sleep better!The wake up alarm vibration is pretty gentle, but it works ok if you are a light sleeper.I don't know why there isn't a heart rate monitor, I would think that would be easy to add, but who knows.They are coming out with a scale that will integrate too, that would be cool.Hopefully they eventually add a second product with more features like the ability to relay notifications from your phone (just a buzz would be great, but caller ID would be awesome).
