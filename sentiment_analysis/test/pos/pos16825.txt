So far I love this stuff! I bought it to hang Halloween lights on my front porch. Those little screw in hooks are terrible to try to get in wood and don't work on brick. It's quick and easy. I recommend watching the Sugru "how to" videos. I didn't do that first and ended up using way too much of the product and not doing it correctly. I will be buying more and I recommend it to everyone trying to hang lights the old way. I also used it to reattach my toll tag.
