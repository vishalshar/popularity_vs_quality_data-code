I love my leaf! I've tried other fitness trackers and this one is excellent. I love that it give a complete health picture, including stress levels, meditation, and more. I also love that it looks like a cute accessory instead of an ugly plastic something. I get so many compliments on my cute braclette and people are always so surprised when I tell them it's actually tracking my steps and sleep.
