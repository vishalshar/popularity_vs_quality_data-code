The Nextbit Robin has exceeded my expectations in nearly ever way relative to the price. For $169 there isn't any major flaw and dare I say competes with phones $100+ it's price.It's snappy, has a great front camera, good back camera, excellent dual front speakers and a non bloated version of android. My only complaint is the unlock/finger print reader is flush and can sometimes be tough to find. Overall though I love this phone for the price....A+
