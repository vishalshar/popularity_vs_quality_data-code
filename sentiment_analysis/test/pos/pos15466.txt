I have been doing IT for 24 years professionally and have to say that Dane Electronics Flash Drives are the most reliable and durable out there. I have had many products fail on me over the years, except DE. I still have my DE 8GB flash drive from 2007 and it works perfectly, and this after pulling it out of the USB port numerous times while still active. These things are indestructible! I highly recommend them!!
