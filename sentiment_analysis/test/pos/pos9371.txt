I tried these for the first time today. I used them in my Nike's which have very small lace holes.  They were a bit difficult to get in and by the time I put them all in my fingers were pretty sore.  They are very tight, it was difficult to get my foot in the shoe but I'd rather that then have them be too loose. the colors are more muted than I thought they would be. I was expecting very bright fluorescent neon colors. I've had them on for several hours now and the tongues have stayed in place all day, something that would not have happened with my regular laces. They stay put.
