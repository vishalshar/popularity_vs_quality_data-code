CHiP is a very fun, interactive toy. JD enjoyed playing with the navigation part and making it move with the direction buttons. He really liked giving it treats and making it follow him. It was easy to use, the app and the Chip. He was very engaged with this toy. The smart band was used the most. I think the value of the toy is great but the price is a little high
