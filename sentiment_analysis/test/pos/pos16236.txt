While the construction and design of this device is neat, compact, and functions great, I think it's important for anyone who is considering buying a "personal safety/security" device to keep in mind that the awareness and attitude/mindset of the user is significantly more important than whatever type of device being used. While my particular hearing is very sensitive to the 120dB alarm, a friend who pulled the pin on the device was seemingly unfazed by the high-pitched rapid chirping. And while I can imagine that this alarm sound would deter potentially dangerous animals or startle a would-be assailant, once the pin is pulled, the device is very easy to drop or have it knocked out of your hands. For those wishing to gain a more serious and in-depth understanding of violence/crime/criminal/personal-safety/self-defense dynamics, I would highly recommend starting with Facing Violence: Preparing for the Unexpected by Rory Miller. Because the makers of this product are genuinely concerned with our "safety", it would be wise to also think critically about the potential for using such a device and be realistic about its limitations. No device is a panacea.
