Excellent product.  I am a true 32 inch waist, as all of my jeans and pants are 32/34.  I ordered the medium 32-34 inch waist.  They do fit ,but are tighter than I would have thought.  Any smaller and they would not be comfortable.  If I had to order another pair, I would go with the next size for a bit more room.  Seems crazy that I would be ordering a 36-38 inch large, but these seem smaller than anticipated.
