This strange little coffee contraption, pleasantly surprised me to no end! I boiled my water in the microwave, and put the "La Llave" espresso coffee grounds in, pressed lightly but did not put in all the water it asked for.  The coffee came out strong like I like it, and the Crema was amazing! It is great for when the coffee machines go to the shop or if you can't do without your espresso (like me) when traveling! I love it!
