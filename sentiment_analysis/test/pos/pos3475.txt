This stuff worked great!  I purchased it for a triathlon and was very pleased.  Other gels tend to make my stomach upset but this did not.  I felt my energy was sustained and not quick energy followed by a quick crash.  The consistency is not like most gel, it is very liquid.  At first I thought that would be a problem but then I put it into a gel flask and problem solved.  In fact it work way better than a gel this way.  I could quickly squeeze what I wanted into my mouth and get it down fast.  Most gel sticks in your mouth and you need to drink water or something to get it down but I could squeeze about a package worth into my mouth, swallow and get back to breathing.  After all it was a race and who has time to get that sticky stuff down when your mouth is a little dry from all the effort.  I will be using this stuff exclusively and giving away all my other gels.
