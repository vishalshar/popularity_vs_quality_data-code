I store my favorite Cabot aged cheddar from Costco in this paper.  I used to just wrap the block in plastic wrap but after awhile it would get slimy and smelly. This paper keeps it dry and delicious. Love it, just wish it wasn't so expensive. I recommend not using the adhesive stickers, since they will tear the paper. Just wrap the cheese and put a rubber band around to keep the flaps closed,
