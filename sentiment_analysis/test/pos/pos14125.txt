I think I saw the same player for $199.99 elsewhere today.  So glad I bought this from Amazon when I did.  Love all the options, especially the Bluetooth so I can play Pandora through it.  Sound is fine.  Not Bose quality but certainly good guilty.  Love the vintage look, too.  Good deal all around.
