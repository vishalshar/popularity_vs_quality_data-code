Love this key ring!  It's saved me in multiple places.  It's very flexible, so it pairs well with my charging brick (I can fold the adapter so I can put the brick underneath my phone.  I dock it a star because I had to buy two of them... my first key did not work well at all, and I had to buy another out of pocket because customer support wasn't very helpful.
