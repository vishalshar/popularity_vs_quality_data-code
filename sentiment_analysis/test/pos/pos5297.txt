If youre reading reviews for the short and sweet:This feeder works great! Its exactly as described and operates reliably.The quality in the materials and design are evident the moment you remove it from the package.Order fulfillment was prompt and set up was easy for me. Ive done both the WPS button and the set up with a smart phone.Ive used it daily since June 2015, with only a couple intermissions due to moves, and its performed as expected, day in and day out.The creators of the product are wonderfully responsive to inquiries, and made the suggestion of a UPS for battery back up if your needs require it. Very smart and helpful idea!A couple notes:In the instance a breaker tripped while we were away, I was made aware there was a problem in real time - feed notifications didnt come in my email and when connecting via the portal, it showed as disconnected. This gives you the opportunity to do something or call someone, not come home hours or days later to a starved pet.If you are showing someone looking after your pet how to load the feeder, make sure you explain which direction it rotates (counter clockwise) and where to put the food, or better yet, mark it on the tray. Seems simple, but if you dont do it every day, or you havent seen it operate you wouldnt know.These were the only instances in almost a year that I experienced any issue, and the feeder was not to blame.Now, if youre reading reviews because you want to know WHY you NEED this product, here is my personal story:My cat was diagnosed with diabetes last year, which required a change in diet and feeding schedule. I struggled to balance this with my work and personal life and as others have mentioned, it makes leaving the house for more than 12 hours require the help of someone else to feed your loved one... and do it correctly, and let you know they're ok, and do it twice a day at the proper interval.I researched several feeders, but was hesitant to pull the trigger, meanwhile the struggle continued. I needed to leave for a weekend to help my parents out, I was contemplating turning down a photography event that paid very well, I was organizing social events around the feeding schedule, or missing them altogether.If you think it's just a small thing that you don't mind making work because you love your animal, youre probably kidding yourself, I know I was. Youre researching feeders because you need help. By making an investment in a quality feeder, that you can actually rely on to help you care for your pet - that is love, too.Enter, the feedandgo.The choice for me was that it had every thing I needed, and more. Most important was the capability to dispense wet food and to hold it for more than an hour or two, and the capacity to load up to six feeds. I only load for 12-18 hours at a time, but have done up to two days. The web cam and online scheduling/feeding were neat perks, but not selling features for me.Then there was the price. Probably my biggest reason for pause. It was a lot more than others I had looked at, however it offers a lot more I kept wondering, are those things worth it?Ultimately, it was the only one that met the important needs, and I finally decided that those were invaluable.It was after I got it and started using it that I came to realize all the benefits of such a product and that its worth every penny!I was bad at feeding my cat on time, a few minutes here or there, but it all adds up. When her schedule improved, so did her health and her mood. The web cam I thought Id never use is really fun! My nephew loves to check on the cat, and its the best way for me to KNOW without a doubt my pet was fed, a piece of mind Ive become thankful to have. The online format of making a schedule allows for more complexity than a simple timer. You can make a regular schedule, with certain days and times, or set a one time schedule. Lots of flexibility there to adapt to all kinds of special needs.My cat still knows I feed her, shes well aware Im the one that loads it - or the rare occasion I dont, however instead of harassing me the two hours before she gets fed, she goes near the feeder and waits. This means no more 4 a.m. hungry cat wake up calls.Turns out, all the things the feeder helps me with has made me a happier human, and, by delegating this part of being a pet owner, it enables me to focus on quality time spent on my pet.Think about how much any of these things are worth to you, for just one day. Multiply it by 365 likely in far less than a year you will have made a return on your investment.
