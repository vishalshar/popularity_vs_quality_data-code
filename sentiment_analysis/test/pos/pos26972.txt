I was going to wait to do a review on this product. I started using this product on Friday, 12/6/13 and today is Tuesday 12/10/13 and I have been using it twice a day. This is a very slight sting to the skin when applying this product however the skin already looks and feel better. I plan on making a commitment to the 12 weeks twice a day. If the clinical trials are accurate I have an 85% chance of my skin improving. I researched the ingredients and most of the ingredients are organic and are proven to promote healthy skin. Anyone suffering from eczema or some other skin condition should give this product a try. I read a lot of the reviews and they are overwhelmingly positive, this is one of the very few products for eczema that have clinical trial research to back it up and in addition a large percentage of the ingredients are organic and proven to aid in the healing of skin issues/conditions naturally. I am impressed with all of this information alone. I will do an update one on January 6, 2014. UPDATE! I am late with my update. Today is Friday, January 24, 2014. I have been using this product twice a day for SEVEN weeks. I wish that I had taken "before" and "after" pictures of the bottom of both of my legs as those are the only areas that I have been applying the Metaderm lotion. Listen up everyone "YOU" have an 85 percent chance of this lotion healing your skin. Yes you heard me correct "HEALING" your skin. That is exactly what this lotion does "HEAL" your skin. This is the absolute best lotion that I have ever used for the highly problematic issues of skin infected with eczema. This lotion has did an unbelievable job on my skin and is nothing short of amazing! I encourage anyone to give this product a try. UPDATE! Today is Friday, February 28, 2014. The last day of my 12 week twice a day application of Metaderm. Overall I am very satisfied with the product. I have eczema on the lower part on both of me legs (from the knee down) and on my left arm. I have deeply embedded rashes that I have not been able to do anything about. My skin has stop itching completely and is very smooth. No raised, bumpy or scaly skin. My legs look and feel about 75 - 80 % better. I will continue to use the rest of the Metaderm one application a day until the lotion is gone. And then I will return to using Eucerin. Metaderm does not provide enough moisture to the skin for me but I have lots of natural oils (almond, vitamin E, sesame seed, olive oil to name a few) that I can use for that. In addition I did some research and castor oil is good for lighting scars on the skin. Metaderm did exactly was it was advertised to do. I was really in to coconut oil and the lauric acid in it caused the fungus to exit my body through my skin as I did not gradually increase my intake of the coconut oil I use too much too fast. Anyway all products to do not work for everyone. Remember if you use Metaderm you have an 85% chance that it will help heal your skin.
