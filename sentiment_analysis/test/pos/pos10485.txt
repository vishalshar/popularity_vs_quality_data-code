Ever since I was young I've had to use some type of DIY noise cancelling pillow to block out my dad's snoring from 2 rooms over. I think this has resulted in my need to cover my face/head/ears in order to fall asleep. It feels so comforting.The packaging was incredibly thought out and well designed. The bamboo fabric feels amazing against my face. There is no odor to the pillow. It is perfect except for a few loose threads around the seam. Which are taken care of with a few careful snips.  Other than that tiny flaw, this item is everything I wanted.I've used it while sitting up in bed reading, watching tv, napping and even in bed while sleeping. I'm still trying to find new ways to configure it around my neck and head.I love pillows. Functional pillows. I know what you're thinking. For $60 dollars that pillow should sing me to sleep. Yes, it's a bit pricey. If you enjoy being comfortable anywhere, pick this baby up.
