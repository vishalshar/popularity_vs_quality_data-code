Looks and feels great! I just wish the instructions that came in the box were in English. From what I gathered online is that the watch takes about an hour to charge and the battery lasts for about 10 days. Charge fully before first syncing.This rating could receive a 5 stars easily if there were minor updates made to the app that fixed some of the very miniscule bugs that I noticed.
