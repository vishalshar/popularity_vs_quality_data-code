This is great -- it keeps me honest!  I have a basset hound, and it is soooo easy to just let her sleep on the couch and miss a walk.  I have a fitbit, and this works to make sure I keep her active the same way the fitbit makes sure I stay active EVERY DAY and I can't "rationalize" how much she actually moved around.  The device doesn't count steps, but "activity."  It is a fun app on my Iphone, connects via bluetooth.  The monitor fit snugly and easily flat on her collar.  Pearl is a bigger dog, and has a bigger collar; on my mother's Chihuahua, however, I think the fitbark would be too big.  It isn't heavy -- very lightweight -- so the only issue on tiny little dogs would be bulk.  The best thing is the attitude of the company.... this is a relatively new product, and they are continually updating and making changes to the software, and seem to have a really great and positive and FUN attitude.  There is the option to share and have friends, just like with the fitbit.  Love this, and it HAS helped give me the reason to shoo my dog off the couch and force her outside for a walk!
