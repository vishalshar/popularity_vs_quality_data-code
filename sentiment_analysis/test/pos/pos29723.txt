I donated when 3Doodler did a GO FUND ME and this newer version is a dream come true.  Remembering that practice makes perfect, I continue to gain skill through creating. It's easy to hold and easy to control once you get the mechanics down.  Love it.  Making a sheep today.  Made bugs for an art show last week.
