I just received my Bluesmart roller suitcase last week and took it on a weekend trip to San Francisco. I love this new bag! When I opened the box, the first thing that stood out to me was the beautiful design. The four-wheel design feels really smooth and easy to control. I was happy to ditch my old bag that had two wheels and constantly fell over. The day I left for my trip, I ran out of the office in a hurry and didnÂ’t have much juice on my phone. I got stuck on a long work call while I was waiting to board. Instead of stressing out about trying to find an outlet, I was able to find a quiet corner, take advantage of the built in battery by plugging straight into the bag, and focus on my call. I was only gone for 3 days, but I typically pack quite a bit, and I am always fearful that I am going to get hit with overweight fees from the airlines, so I LOVE the scale feature! How smart of this company?! Now I can decide while I am packaging at home if all the shoes are necessary, and save myself some money.  I also travel a lot for work and carry work sample to meetings, which can get pretty heavy. It will be super convenient to know if I should move some weight over to my backpack or not. The bag did not leave my sight, so I did not use the locking feature from my phone, but this will come in very handy if I ever check my bag. I never thought I would need a bag with this much technology, but now that I found this one it is all I have been raving about.
