After looking at reviews from Amazon and Head-fi, I had a few questions on the product, so I called the company directly. They seem delighted that I called, gave me some technical specs I was looking for and then answered a question on their fulfillment process. Some companies actually sell their web rights to fulfillment houses that then service their customers. Since I have been burned by that in the past, I was happy to hear that Amazon does their fulfillment and ordered the Turbo X using my Prime account.Since this was a birthday present to me from me, I waited till my actual birthday to open it and from the first note, the warm rich and detailed sound was outstanding. It could also get quite loud in "Turbo" which many reviews call annoying, but to me was not a hindrance at all. However what was a hindrance is that my battery would not hold a charge. Knowing that I was doing something wrong, I retread the instructions and charged it overnight only to find the battery still dead. One quick call to the company and the diagnosed the problem quickly, telling me what the determined and that I needed to ship it in, which I promptly did. About a week later, I received a brand new unit that worked perfectly.I have been enjoying the sound and found that I like the sound both inside and out on my deck. The detailed highs and the lower register excel where some of my other Bluetooth speakers don't. I cannot say enough good things about the sound from the Turbo X.
