Gave this to my sister for Christmas and she loved it so much, my cousin ordered one. They are obsessed with it. When we are all together they are checking it and sending treats. Takes cute pics. The dogs lick the screens sometimes when they talk to them - so cute! Definitely recommended for a dog lover. Especially one that wants to check in and send treats when they are away.  I haven't heard of 1 issue or complaint with the product.
