With much research and looking I finally found and got the 14" for my princess. Pretty heavy for my 28 lb. 3 y/o but she is so daring she can actually push the pedal with her feet to get it moving. She loves her purple bike and is so proud to have it! Even her daddy is so happy I got her this. She won't grow out of it too soon since I'm not rushing to remove trainers. Only negative for me is i couldn't find the hardware to install the red reflector for the back end but it's ok I'm always there when she rides. Otherwise, was def worth over the $100 for us over the cheesy, girly branded ones from big dept stores.
