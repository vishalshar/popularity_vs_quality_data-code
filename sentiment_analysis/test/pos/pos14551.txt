15. My daughter was thrilled when we opened the box that the lumi was shipped in. She was really excited to be using this product. The remote was super simple and the app was very easy to download. It had an update right away  and our phones had no problem finding it. She was able to figure out the instructions very fast. My only issue is that I don't have any songs downloaded on my phone and there is only one song that we could choose from the lumi  menu.
