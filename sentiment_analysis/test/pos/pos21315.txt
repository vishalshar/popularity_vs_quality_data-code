I replaced an 8 station Rainbird controller in about an hour, including a rain sensor.  Simple instructions, simple connection to WiFi, SmartPhone app is decent. I like how it configures each zone according to sun/shade, type of soil, and flat/slope considerations.  My system has large wires, and they fit just fine. I just had to route them into the box side-by-side and not in a cluster, which was no problem.  I got the Mini-Click rain sensor, and connected it to the two R posts just like the Rachio directions said and it works just fine.  This company knows what they're doing.
