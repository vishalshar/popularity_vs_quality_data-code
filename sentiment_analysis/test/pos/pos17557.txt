I've had this thumb drive for a few years. I wanted something that I could attach to my keychain without worrying about metal rings breaking and a thumb drive without a cap that would be lost. This drive is everything I wanted.Today I accidentally washed my thumb drive and put it through the dryer. Figuring it was lost forever, I tried to plug it into my computer anyway just in case. Well - it still works! Now if that's not quality, I don't know what is.
