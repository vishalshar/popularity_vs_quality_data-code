So only one issue, and I didn't see it as being a problem people had in the reviews, but I found a way around it. My boots don't have traditional eye holes. They have the fabric loops. While you can make it work, it's kinda a pain. But I'm pleased. I'm sure they will last, and me next pair will be more likely to work.
