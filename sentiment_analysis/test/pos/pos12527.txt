I wanted to give this 5 stars, but it just isn't as loud as I expected (mostly from reading other reviews).  First of all, it's much smaller than it looks in the description photos (the listed dimensions are correct).  It pairs quickly, is indeed rugged / solid, and works great for most of my applications.  But it just doesn't get as loud as I was expecting.
