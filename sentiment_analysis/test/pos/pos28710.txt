I am thoroughly impressed with how well the Bragi team has been able to execute this concept. From the box to the charging cradle to the touch interface to the fit sleeves, I can feel the attention to detail. This is a product ahead of its time and feels/works like a product Jony Ives designed himself, it's well worth the $299 price.
