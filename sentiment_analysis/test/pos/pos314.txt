I use this more often than I thought I would. I travel a lot & like to have a nice glass of wine before my trip, but don't want to have the whole bottle. Use Coravin, and it is waiting for me when I return. Longest I have kept a bottle was 3 months, will try more as this worked well. Fantastic tool to taste different years next to each other. Wouldn't be without one! Will order one for my island home as well.
