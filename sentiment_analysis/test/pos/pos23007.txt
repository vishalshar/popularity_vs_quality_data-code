For a year I could not wear my tennis shoes because of my arthritis. When I saw these advertised, I ordered immediately. They arrived today. Now it is so easy to just slip on my shoes. They fit perfectly and are so comfortable without hurting my fingers trying to tie up shoe laces. I would recommend these to everybody.
