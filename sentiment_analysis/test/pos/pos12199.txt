I put these on the front porch, back porch, and back door as well as for my reading light.As exterior lights they are the bomb, I programmed them to turn on at dusk and off at dawn. I also programmed the front porch light to dim way down when we usually go to bed as otherwise it shines into our bedroom, and then to brighten up when we get up.IFTTT ("If This Then That") is the programming language and it is simple to use. It took a little while searching on their website for the page where you can actually put together your own programs, but it was worth it.For Halloween we set it on "Spooky" and a dark orange... very nice effect. You can use a third party app (Lightbow) to make it flash red and I'm thinking I can use that for emergencies, to help the police or fire department identify my house.As a reading light I'm not so enthusiastic. We also use the reading lamp for light when we're watching TV and it is actually more of an effort to askmy Amazon Echo (Alexa) to change the light intensity or opening up the LIFX app to change intensity than it would be to turn a switch. I think I will go back to a regular switch on the reading lamp.
