This is a great little alarm system for those who want smartphone control and notifications, and don't want to pay a monitoring service.  Setup was extremely easy.  The components are surprisingly tiny and inconspicuous.  You can easily stick the sensors anywhere you like using double-sided tape (the tape that comes with it is adequate, however, I found that 3M Outdoor double-sided tape worked even better).  The motion detector is not suitable if you have pets.  My chihuahua sets it off, so I am unable to use it.  My only complaint is that the siren could be louder.  Even though my hub is centrally located and my house is small, it is not very loud for someone coming in from a back or side door.  You can certainly hear it, but it's not very intimidating!  I ended up purchasing the M-4 alert system so that I could put a second siren in my garage.  (There is also an outdoor siren you can add, though it is pricey.)  The iOS app is a little bit buggy, but so far I have been able to do what I need with it.  I like that this system can be expanded to include other home automation products by Skylink.  I added one of their plug-in dimmers so I can control a lamp as part of my system.  It is a little confusing as to which of their other products integrate with this particular system, however, when I emailed customer support I received a prompt and helpful answer.  I look forward to more components and app improvements in the future.
