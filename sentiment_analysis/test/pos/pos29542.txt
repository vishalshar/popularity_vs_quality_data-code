I bought this for my 8 year-old and she loves it.  Very interested in building the projects in the manual and her own projects.  The real surprise was my 5 year-old.  She has really enjoyed tinkering with the various components and experimenting with how they function and interact.  Truth be told, I've had as much fun as either of my kids.
