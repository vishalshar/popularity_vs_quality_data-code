First of all, for $100, these headphones go above in beyond. I'm going to break down my review in categories.Packaging: The box the headphones come in makes you feel like you've purchased a nice and expensive pair of headphones. It helps you feel validated in your purchase. Great packaging, great presentation. Clean, tidy, and organized. Very suave.Accessories: Comes with a carrying case that has pockets. Yes, pockets. It is small details like that that impress me. There is thought in all aspects. Nice zipper case that could easily fit into a suitcase, backpack or larger purse. Comes with wires for both Android and iPhone to make sure it is compatible.Headphones: I purchased black and rose gold. I like the fact that they are not flashy. It looks very sharp and the rose gold really pops. The ear pads and the headbands are nicely padded and the headphones feel very sturdy. Good material. They do have the left and right ears labeled, and it is engraved so it doesn't look tacky. Aux ports on both sides of the headphones for comfort and convenient. Not something I have seen much. Nice touch there.Music quality: I used to be on drumline and played percussion in the past, so you can ensure that I know what I'm talking about here. I think people need to remember that they should listen to 5-6 different songs (genres would be better) before judging. The sound is crisp and I can hear melodies and instruments that usually hide in the background of a song. The headphones do a good job of ensuring you can hear all the instruments and levels of each song; something key. Great bass. You can hear drops and octaves. These headphones get your head bobbing.Call quality: People forget, but there is a mic attached. Sharp and clear on both ends. Good job here as this was an aspect I was most worried about.**It's the little things about Plugged Headphones that impress me. Glad I bought a pair of these and will be buying a few for Christmas gifts.
