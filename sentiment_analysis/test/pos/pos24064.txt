My favorite case for the M9 by far. I love the look and the feel of the case. Feels solid in your hand like it will protect the phone. One of the best parts is the feedback when you press the buttons. It provides a nice solid click without being too hard to press, and the case makes the buttons easy to find which is something i have found hard to come by with other cases.
