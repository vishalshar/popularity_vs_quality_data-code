For me using a smartphone with a case is like making love with a prophylactic, it ruins the experience.  There are many elegant and expensive smartphone available and I have owned several of them.  I am rough on my phones I would regularly have the screen replaced because I refused, and still refuse, to use a case.  The phones never functioned the same after the screen was replaced so I decided to try a "throwaway" phone that was about the same price as a screen replacement.  My first throwaway was the Posh X500A which to my great surprise was amazing functionally and an amazingly rugged phone.  Due only to my stupidity did I kill the X500A.  My next Posh was the HD E 600a which was even more amazing and took levels of repeated abuse and drops that would have destroyed a high end phone.  That phone is still working but occasionally shuts down for no apparent reason other than I probably broke something inside the phone or shorted out the battery not because of the phone itself.  I bought another one because they are so cheap that it worked into my plan of using, abusing then tossing the phone.The phone itself is fantastic as far as call quality, battery life and all of the other basic phone tasks.  I love that it comes with very little added to the phone as far as apps and what I call junk.  I don't follow the latest version of the Android OS but I know this phone does not have the latest an the greatest but it is bulletproof and all the apps I use like Waze, Pandora and CM Browser (I highly recommend) work perfectly.  I think one of the reasons the screen does not shatter when I drop it is because the screen is not as rigid as the higher end phones.  The upside is that the screen does not shatter but the downside is that the screen will get fine scratches that are only visible when the display is not on.  Personally I can deal with little scratches but I can't live with a shattered screen.  There is a nice real metal edge around the entire phone that works as a great sacrificial shock absorber when no case is used.  Yes the metal edge will get a but banged up but it does not change the appearance of the phone without looking closely.  I know the camera on phones is a big deal to many users but all I can say is the camera seems as good as any other camera at least for what I do with it.  I have no doubt the highest end phones have better cameras but this camera seems perfectly fine to me but I am not authority.  As far as WiFi, it works perfectly and I can watch YouTube videos without any issue and the web browser works perfectly in airplane mode with WiFi.If you are looking for a bulletproof phone that works great and you won't worry about abusing, losing or anything else then I suggest this phone.  I am confident there are other very good off brand Chinese cell phones but I can assure you this one is fantastic.  Worst case scenario if you don't love it you can use it as a backup phone when your expensive phone is in the shop getting the screen replaced.
