Best solution for frayed/broken/failing connection between end of a wire and it's plug or the strain relief.  I didn't realize how many wires or cables I had that were failing at one end or the other.  I fixed my TV cable, circular saw, postage scale, angle grinder, etc.  It does this job extremely well.  Haven't really come across any other particular use. Four starts instead of five as I feel the product is a little pricey.
