I got my Leaf when my Fitbit One finally stopped working.  I don't like the wrist-band activity/sleep trackers, and had really like that the One could be clipped to my clothes.  The Leaf, though, while it can be clipped to my clothes if I need to have it showing, it a lot prettier, and tracks the same things I expected from my Fitbit - steps and sleep.  I really like the the app has tracking for "lady-things" and the ability to still set up to 4 alarms (including one meant as a reminder for birth control pills), as well as the "get up and move" alert.Also, the Leaf does not sync continuously all day, but needs to be activated to sync, and as long as you do it within 14 days, your data is still there.  This results in less radiation near your body, which I like.I have had it for about a month, and like my Leaf, that I can have it showing clipped to my clothes and it just looks like jewelry, that it comes with a necklace chain AND a bracelet should I want to wear it that way.  I think the app might need a few things added, like some items to add to the activities list, and compatibility with other health tracking apps like AnyMove or Apple Health.  I have not made consistent use of the meditation portion of the app, but it seems like a good thing to try to get in the habit of doing.  I get a lot of compliments on my Leaf, and plan to continue to use it, and encourage others who also do not like the ulitarian silicone-cased trackers to give it a shot.
