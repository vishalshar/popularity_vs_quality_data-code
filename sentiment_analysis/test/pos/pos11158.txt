When I first stated to lace my shoes I could not figure out how to use the loop. The videos and written instructions were of no help. I finally pulled out the cardboard insert in the package and opened it up. There were pictures and written directions....Whew!!!! I am a happy camper now. If the seller is reading this, I apologize for sending the awful seller review. I tried to edit but could not. This product is as advertised and wonderful.
