I would like to share my initial experience from owning this little guy.Pros:- Easy set-up, charge battery and remote, secure propellers, go to an open space and take to the sky.- Great price point for a 4k camera drone.- Physical buttons on remote: for take-off/land, go home, pause aircraft. This allows full flight control without a tablet.- Comes with a fancy semi-hard zipper case. The case has cut-outs to hold 4 extra batteries and other small accessories. With a battery in the drone you can carry a total of 5 batteries safely in the case.- Great customer support. Had to re-confirm that every battery needs to have its firmware updated. Opened chat and got my questions answered promptly.-Waypoints. If you want to film the same route during sunrise and sunset you can set waypoints. This allows you to focus on the camera shot while the drone takes care of the flight.Cons:- SD card adapter is not included for the firmware updates. As an iOS user I am not accustomed to using microSD cards so I could not update my firmware until I dug out an old SD adapter from my android days. Something that definitely should have been included with the whole set.- SD card slot on drone has minimal protection.I would like to see the SD card slot more protected from the elements. While I understand that you will not fly your drone in a rainy weather, dust will slowly get into the slot and eventually may make the SD card writing fail.- No lens cover on camera. Case provides decent protection but still additional protection is preferred for optimal protection.The accessories I purchased in addition to my drone:- 2 extra Batteries- Propeller Blades  be sure to check how many blades come in the set. I ordered 2 sets of 2 blades.- Propeller Guards  almost like training wheels for the drone, however I have not yet attached them as I wanted to get into the air ASAP. Probably will attach when my wife is with me as she thinks the drone is scary (but she loves the footage it is producing).Overall, my experience with this drone has been amazing. The footage that I filmed is breath-taking and is speaking for itself. I ordered a third battery as I love to send this bird into the air after work. I am happy to support an up and coming drone company that provides a great product and great customer service.
