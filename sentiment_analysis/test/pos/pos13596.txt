I'm at that age when reading a menu in a dimly lit restaurant can be a challenge, but I don't need to where glasses all the time. And I don't want to lug my reading glasses around just for those few moments when I can't read. These are the solution.Before I found these I was dreaming of finding something just like them. I wanted a monocle of sorts, but for both eyes, that is compact and easy to carry around. And that is exactly what this is.The case is thin and easily fits into my shirt pocket such that you wouldn't even notice I'm carrying it. They are lightweight too. The bridge of the nose has a springiness to it that helps it stay on your nose without holding them, and it has just enough grip to hold there without pinching your nose.My only two complaints are 1) I wish I could get these in an actual prescription form to factor in astigmatism in one eye. 2) I feel like a dork when I wear them -- but I guess that's just my problem, not a problem with the glasses.Ultimately, I'm really happy I found these. They've helped me on many occasions in just my first month.
