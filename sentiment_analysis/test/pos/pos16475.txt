It's a nice bag for the urban commuter and exactly what I was looking for.  Let's be real, no bag is for everyone.  For me, I work in IT and commute around Seattle by bus, walking, or riding my OneWheel.  I used to carry my daily items (which usually consist of a small notebook, a pen or two, OneWheel charger, some snacks, and sometimes my work laptop) in my Oakley backpack that I've had for more than 5 years and for me as a commuter it was becoming too cumbersome.  I was watching reruns of Shark Tank and liked the look and functionality of this bag so I decided to give it a try...and I'm very glad I did.  This bag is perfect for the urban commuter that needs to carry daily essentials and wants a stylish, functional, and comfortable bag.  It even stays in place when I'm shredding the streets on my OneWheel!  I also recently used it as my carry on bag for a trip to Thailand and I put in a HP Elitebook, charger, notepad, keys, a couple different phone wall chargers, power brick, a change of clothes and some snacks in this bag for the 19 hour flight and everything fit fine....tight but fine.  I'm sure this is not a good bag for a student carrying big binders and lots of things for school, but for professional commuters carrying work necessities, it's perfect.  I am 5'8" and I have plenty of extra room on the strap to make it longer if I needed too.  On another side note, the material is not near as shiny as the picture shows, which is very good because the shiny-ness in the picture looks tacky.  It's a nice flat black color.  I also haven't noticed the material being too scratchy like some posters talked about, but I always wear a shirt when using the bag and never rub it on my face so maybe I'm doing it wrong???
