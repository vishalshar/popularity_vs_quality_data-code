My setup is: Receiver Onkyo TX-NR5010, Monitor Audio Gold GX100 via Kimber Kable 8TC BI-AMP cables.I use MASS Fidelity Relay to listen to music from Apple Music and JRiver from my iPhone 6S and my IPAR Air direct to my receiver.Using MASS Fidelity Relay I could feel the sound more open and more crystalline treble compared to my Apple TV on 4th HDMI.The songs have gained a little more detail a little better the soundstage.The MFR is an equipment that will add much value to any quality system.
