I love this kit.  I just purchased my second one.  One suggestion I have is to be sure and download the right phone application since Lutron has more than one phone application and if you download the wrong one like I did it might be difficult to identify why it is not working.  Also, if you have difficulties like I encountered then don't wait to call their support line, like I did, because the support staff were very helpful and got my devices up and running quickly.
