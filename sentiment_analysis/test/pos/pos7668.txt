This kibble is expensive, but the cats like it, get full, and don't need as much of it to remain full.  That's because the protein percentage is at 42%, the highest I have seen in cat food, with fat min at 15%.  There are no fillers in this stuff, but lots of added vitamins and minerals.  The cats like the chicken and egg (and pea) combination.The kibble is rather large for cat kibble, but the cats seem to be able to break it apart easily.  None of my cats get sick off of it: no diarrhea and no vomitting.
