Makes for a MUCH easier time when measuring and getting an accurate measurement. Didn't gain a 5 star rating because the 'grabbing end' of the measurement tape, is loose and it can give off a false length. I must make sure that the end is pushed back in to get the actual result. I like that I can get the measurement read out in feet and in inches, and metric as well.
