I was skeptical at first due to all the negative reviews. I loved the concept of the FitBit but didn't want to drop the cash needed to get one. I found out about the Pivotal Living band on a Top 5 Affordable Fitness Trackers list. For $15 I figured it was worth a try. When I received the item I was actually impressed by how well built the band looked. It's extremely comfortable to wear and I had absolutely no problems syncing it to the app. I work at a very physical job that is very hands on and the band is holding up well. It is very accurate from what I have seen and I love being able to look at how well or not so well I am sleeping at night. It really is a huge motivator when trying to stay active and healthy.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the app itself could use some bug fixes. It does crash occasionally which is more of an annoyance then anything, but then again how many apps don't crash on Android.For the money the Pivotal Living band far exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable alternative.
