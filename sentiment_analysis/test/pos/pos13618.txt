This product is pretty much as promised although it comes rolled up so tightly in a plastic sleeve that it takes a while to assume its promised and proper shape.  I'm not too sure it's really as high as it's supposed to be: at its deepest point, it's only 9 Å¾" tall.  Isn't it supposed to be 12"????
