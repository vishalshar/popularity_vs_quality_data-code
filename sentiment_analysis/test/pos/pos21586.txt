This worked spectacularly in my large home. So much so that after I purchased one, I purchased a second. Why two? after the first Portal worked so well I recognized that a second portal connected in a mesh network might replace the four extenders that were previously required just to get mediocre coverage in most areas of my home. With two Portals on a mesh network I have better/faster/complete coverage everywhere in my home, and tremendous coverage in my yard. Far exceeded my expectations.
