Love my thin optics.  They're especially useful when getting my hair colored and not wanting to damage my regular glasses.  I have a wide nose and sometimes getting the placement/angle right takes a few moments to finesse but we'll worth the effort.  I don't attach then to my phone but I'm sure having that option works to great advantage for many.  I would certainly buy again, if needed.
