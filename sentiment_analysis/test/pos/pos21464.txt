Bought a new car (new to me) with leather interior. I think they must have used some kind of leather polish or cleaning service before I bought the car because there was a very strong chemical-like smell that was giving me a headache when I would drive anywhere, even after a month. I've always had issues with air fresheners and really wanted something to remove the smell and not just cover it. After this sat in the car a couple days, I no longer smell that sinus-irritating stink that was in there. I was very impressed with how well it worked so quickly. I will probably get another one if/when this one stops working.
