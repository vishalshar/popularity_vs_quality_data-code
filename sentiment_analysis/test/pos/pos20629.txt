*Update to review in comments*I wrote my initial review here: [...]I have been very excited about this watch since I seen it on Indiegogo in spring of 2014. The premise is a watch that recognizes the exercises you are doing and counts the proper reps and syncs them to your phone later.I was an early backer on the Indiegogo campaign in April of 2014 and ordered two watches. One for me, and one for my lady-friend. I finally received it in December of 2015 and here are my thoughts.Looks:Out of the box, I like the look. It is large but not obnoxiously so. There are two color options for the inside of the band at this time. Bright yellow and electric green. I recall the green taking longer to ship so I opted for the yellow.Function:I took it to the gym the first day I received it and was unable to track ANYTHING! It was bad. It was depressing. To wait that long for something and have it be almost useless was very upsetting. It also ran out of battery before half the workout was done.When I got back to my office, I put it on the charger and when it was fully charged I got a notification for a firmware update. Thank goodness. After the firmware update, this is a fully functional watch.The app looks great and is easy to use. The watch is fairly easy to use. And you have the ability to enter your workouts ahead of time and include the poundage you will use to keep you on track. Adding the workouts, I was using the Layne Norton dead-lift routine from Bodybuilding.com at the time, is fairly time consuming and requires you to make some adaptations to the workout. You really only have 50 exercise options to choose from. That sounds like a lot but in the grand scheme, it really is not. For example, instead of being able to do skullcrushers I needed to do TRX tricep extensions. Even trying to mimic that motion with an overhead cable extension, the rep counting was way off. In fact the amount of tricep exercises are very sparse. There are also times when you need to do exercises where the movement cannot be tracked by a watch (leg ext, hamstring curls, leg press) and I either need to swap it for an exercise that can or not have it tracked in my Atlas app.Using a pre-loaded workout requires you to go in order. You can kind of skip past an exercise but then you have to skip through everything to get back to that exercise you missed. Is a back button that hard?Rep tracking has been consistently 1 or two reps off despite my strict form. I have yet to complete a set of bench press and have the count be accurate. You can change the reps to the correct amount on the watch. Each time you do so, you have to confirm the exercise and usually re-enter the weight. Not a huge deal but also not something that can be overlooked.Heart rate is accurate but it doesnt read all the time and when weight lifting I can only see it some of the time. I have yet to figure out the pattern of when I can see my heart rate on the display as most of the time I cannot. Another issue I have found with the heart rate is then when I take the watch off so I can do my warm-ups without it counting over my planned workout (another issue) it just reads out at some ridiculous number like 215 bpm and skews my whole overview at the end.  Now I have an average that is not accurate and any data I gather using that is also off. I never liked wearing a chest band for HR but it would be nice if the watch could gather the number coming off of that.Freestyle mode only allows 15 of the 50 known workouts to be tracked and does a much less accurate job of doing so. It also requires me to add my weight in from 0 each set rather than using the last weight lifted. This would come in handy on heavy lifts like deadlifts and squats when I have to toggle up to 500.Wishlist:I really wanted to use this watch to log my workouts and pounds. To really do that I need a few things.The option to add an exercise even if the watch cannot track the movement. Allow me to type it in on the app along with the reps and weights I want to do and I will tell the watch when I am finished.A warm-up option in pre-set workouts or pause tracking. I could try pre determining my warm-up but I never really know how many sets I will need before I feel like I am ready to go. If I could pause the tracking instead of having to take the watch off and lose my accurate HR reading, it would be much more useful.A web based portal where I can easily create and edit some of my workouts. I would also like to see my progress easily.Web portal that can graph my progress or export my data in a csv so I can record my progress.The ability to add HR training as an exercise within a workout. I can add it on the app but when I get to it with the watch there is no way to start it.MORE EXERCISES!Conclusion:I like the watch but I have stopped using it. I dont like the amount of time it takes to add in my own workouts or the way I have to skip or adapt exercises to be able to log them. Even after logging, there is no macro style overview of what I have done. I can just go back one day at a time and look. Often looking at numerous workouts on that day because I had to skip over an exercise because the equipment was being used and run through the workout again on the watch when the equipment frees up. I hope to see some of these issues fixed in a future update.I am hopeful these updates will be soon as they have a very smart team over there.
