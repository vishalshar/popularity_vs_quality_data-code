I love this so much that I bought three--two as gifts and one for ourselves.  It's an excellent, larger night light for my father when he gets up during he night to go to the toilet.  Since it's on low beam 12 hours a night, I charge it every 4-5 days.  Saves on electricity, better than a regular night light since the latter is too dim.  We prefer this Pico portable solar lantern.  Charging is no problem and easy when there is lots of sun.  Winter will be the big test.
