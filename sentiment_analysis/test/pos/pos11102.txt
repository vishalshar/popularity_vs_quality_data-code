It's SO simple!! No more broken Keurigs for me. They are a hassle - you never know what's going to go wrong - the pump, the swing-out needle, cleaning the grounds out of the upper needles Q-Tipping every crack and cranny - Who needs the hassle? With this, you just pop in the K-cup, seat it on the lower needle, put the cylinder on, pour from your electric kettle to the desired marked level of 6,8, or 10 oz., press down slowly, and voila! Coffee. It's made tough with no easily breakable parts. I only wish it came with a refillable pod. You're stuck with OEM K-cups. If you have hot water on the ready, you'll be drinking a cup in 20 seconds. Clean-up is a simple under-faucet rinse. I love this thing! It takes up less space, too. I wish it were adjustable for tall mugs, but it isn't. If you find a refillable pod you can use with this, post a link for me.
