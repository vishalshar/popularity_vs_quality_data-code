To be able to acquire a thermal camera at this price is a major breakthrough! I have no reason to have one of these other than to just play around with it and satisfy my curiosity. It's loads of fun if you a curious fellow and you like gadgets. I've been all around the house with it and I'm amazed to see the properties of heat. It's always fun to see what the naked eye cannot, which is why I also enjoy my 2 microscopes, and night vision scope. The image quality leaves you wishing it had the capacity to be more detailed, but then you realize it was only $200 and at that price it does a really fine job. I was amazed at how it still picks up people at around 50 yards away if not further. It's got some interesting color schemes and settings to play around with. The B&W mode seems to have the most detail. Particularly fascinating is looking at residual heat that lingers on surfaces. Even after a stove top range is cool to the touch you can still see which range was in use 15 minutes after it's shut off with this camera. Kind of freaky. This would make a really great gift for a curious kid who loves to explore. I love mine and I plan to have fun with it for a long time. It would probably even be a hit at a party. UPDATE: It dawned on me that this could be used to find a lost contact lens because of the residual heat on the lens. But I discovered something even better! Thermal imaging doesn't pass through glass, so, the lens shows up as A DARK SPOT! This means you can locate the lens long after the heat has left it. This propbably only works on gas permeable lenses though. But, thus far, it's by far the most effective way I know of to locate a lost lens quickly!
