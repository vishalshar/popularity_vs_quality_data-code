If you enjoy games and you like physics, this is the game for you.The mechanics are simple enough for every gamer.  There is an element of chance (pun unintentional as you're only creating hydrogen), but there is some strategy in determining which quarks you are going after.This is a great game for learning about subatomic particles or just for something different.To top it off, the production quality is amazing.Well done!
