It's very nice looking, comfortable to wear, and the info it gives is very useful. For me, the only disadvantage is the fact that it's not water resistant or water proof. I'm used to getting in the shower with all my jewelery on, so it's hard for me to remember to take it off every day, & when I take a shower at the gym to put it back on afterwards.
