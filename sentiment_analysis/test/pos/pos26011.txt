Speaker works well.  Plenty loud enough, and plenty tough enough.  It would be nice if it had an option to charge devices over micro-USB, like many competitors do, but the description doesn't say it has this feature.  The only thing I disliked was being sold a returned item and told it was new.  The speaker I received was clearly opened before and had been mounted, as evidenced by the double packaging tape and wear marks from the previous mount.  Also, for some reason, it took over 2 weeks for them to even put the item in the mail, despite being sold as an Amazon Prime item with free expedited shipping.
