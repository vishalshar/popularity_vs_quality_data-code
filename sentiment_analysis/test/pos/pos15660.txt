For all the people complaining about it not working, if you read the product description, it comes with a guarantee. All you have to do is email them and they send you a free replacement. They did say to try not to get it wet so I'm thinking of wrapping plastic wrap around the bulb to see if it will last longerOurs lasted for 6 months which isn't too bad
