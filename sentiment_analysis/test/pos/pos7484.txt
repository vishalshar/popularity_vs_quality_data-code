I hate that I love these, they are rather pricey. I try to ration myself and eat half of a bag but I always end up eating the entire thing. They are so very good and provide 100% guilt free snacking. I highly recommend these but only if you can afford such luxuries I am finding that I can't, so my plan is to savor my last 3 bags.
