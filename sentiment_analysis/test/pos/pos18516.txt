I have been searching for the perfect lip color for a while. I find many colors of lipstick I love, only to have it become flaky and turn powdery a few hours later. THIS STUFF doesnt do that. It stays creamy and beautiful. It is easy to apply, has a great creamy texture and stays on for a while. Vintage mauve is a great color to transition from summer to fall. I would definitely buy this product again.
