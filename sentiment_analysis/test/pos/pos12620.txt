Works pretty good. We like the set up for our 2 Aleko sliding gates and detached garage. In addition to 433mhz, Aleko HomeLink compatible, and now G link, all 3 in parallel.  We figure you always have your phone in your pocket, and with renters in the Granny unit, we don't have to worry about remotes lost or stolen.
