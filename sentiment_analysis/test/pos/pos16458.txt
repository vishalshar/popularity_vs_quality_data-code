I have been using this for years with my cat, Ricky.  One tray refill lasts about 3 weeks with him.  So, six trays will last quite a while.  I really like this product a lot.  It traps the odor and does an effective job.  I keep this item in my cart at all times and monitor the price.  When it drops, I buy it.  For example, on May 11, 2010 it was $85.43... which is $14.24 per tray.  Great price, so I bought it.  Most of the time, I see the price hovering around $99... so when the price drops, you need to snag it!In regards to knock-offs... I tried twice another brand.  That brand did not trap the odor and the litter smell was gross.  The tray only lasted two weeks.  I went back to Fresh Step Crystals/ScoopFree litter trays and will not buy an off-brand again.I hope this review helps you make your decision.  Thank you!
