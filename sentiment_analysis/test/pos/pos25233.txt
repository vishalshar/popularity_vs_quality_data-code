Bought this for myself as a Christmas present, just a liitle add-on kind of present I handed to my wife to wrap and said,"Here, you bought this for me." In truth, it might be my favorite gift of the year.I am a lousy sleeper. After about 1 am, anything will wake me up. I was sleeping with ear plugs and sleep headphones. Now I just have this little thing going. Tiny but awesone. I tested the bluetooth and it worked as advertised. Don't know about sound quality - not why I bought it.My improvement suggestuons would be to split the volume buttons from the sound selection - that's a liitle quirky - and to add a battery level indicator so you have some warning that the battery won't last the night.
