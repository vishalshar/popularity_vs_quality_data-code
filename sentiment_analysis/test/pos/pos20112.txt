I LOVE this soap, and I am now a committed user of this product.  I work in a small shop & customers are always asking about charcoal soap, so I investigated it for myself and bought this product.  it's WONDERFUL, & I like it better than ALL the high-end soaps I have used when washing my face.  I have enlarged pores (t-zone issues), and it has greatly helped my skin; I actually have noticed a difference in my pores.  I will absolutely continue to use this product; I'm absolutely thrilled to have found this product.  thanks so much.
