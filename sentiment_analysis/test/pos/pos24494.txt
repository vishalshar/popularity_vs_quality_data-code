This is an awesome little camera that packs quite a punch. If you're ever concerned about your apartment's security while you and your roommates or family members are completely gone for long stretches of winter/summer break, study abroad, or vacation, then this gadget is a pretty ideal solution. It's super discrete for one thing, so it can sit beside your media stand or speakers and fit right in without looking tacky. It's also a breeze to setup -- I wouldn't describe myself as super techy, but here you literally plug in your Remocam, download the app, and go. And I was surprised by the picture quality; I feel like if there ever was an intruder, the camera would be able to get a good shot of the person's features. Pictures you take can get saved directly to your phone, or the cloud, or an SD card (not included). The two-way talk feature is also cute if you want to just check in with someone at your place. You can even plug in other emergency phone numbers aside from the default 911. And the siren feature seems pretty effective (and good for laughs too haha).If there is something that feels hard to understand, their customer service support has always been super helpful with my questions. Since this is a start-up, I feel like they are actively trying to always improve and incorporate feedback. No complaints! I think the only thing is that I don't have any Smart Home devices to utilize the Remocam to its full capacity, but it's neat to have as an option if I ever do.
