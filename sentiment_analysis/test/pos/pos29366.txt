After much research on scheduled feeders, I decided to spend the money on this one.  I am so glad I did!  My almost 11 year old German Shepherd had back surgery and needs pain medicine three times a day.  The only way that is possible with our work schedules would be for me to get up at 2 am every morning to give him pain med.  So, I started looking for other options.  Levi is a very food driven dog and a lot of the feeders seemed cheap and looked like he would claw and break to get at the food.  This feeder looked substantial and had everything I was looking for.  The webcam is really just a plus....not really necessary.  Well, my boy loves it!  It took no time at all for him to get used to it.  Now, he lays down by it a good 10 minutes before his 2 pm feeding waiting for it to go off so he can have his treat and his medicine!  He even hears it and wakes up out of a sound sleep.  Yes, it is kind of noisy, but I am grateful for that, because it is a great trigger for him to know it's time to eat.  This is truly the best Smart Feeder!  Trust me....spend the money.  You won't regret it!
