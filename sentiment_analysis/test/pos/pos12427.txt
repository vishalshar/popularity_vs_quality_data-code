I bought this case for travelling when I don't want to carry a purse and/or wallet and it's perfect.  It fits an ID, a couple cards and a few folded bills, but if you over-stuff it it does pop open.  It's a little bulky for every day use, but the quality is far better than any of the others I've seen (I purchased one at Five Below and it literally falls off the phone).  Would definitely recommend!
