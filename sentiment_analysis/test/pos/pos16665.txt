This is a great Greek yogurt machine. Easy to follow instructions. With a little experimentation you can vary the tartness by the length of time it is in the machine. Set the time and go. If you make it in the evening, it is ready to strain by morning. I get a little less than a quart per batch. It sure cuts down on the price of store-bought yogurt. Highly recommended!
