I bought this kit, nervous that it wouldn't work or worse, I was growing something I wouldn't want to eat.  Well, if you follow the "special" instructions inside the kit about dunking the growing medium first, you should find these super-easy to grow.The taste?  Insane.  They REALLY DO taste like shellfish!  You could add these to any $5.00 fish chowder and people would think you went all-out and bought loads of fresh seafood!I'm learning tricks online about re-growing these things but I gather you have to make up your mind to "go big or go home" early.  The kit is two-sided and instead of opening up the other side, I plan to use the fresh mycelium to grow a HUGE batch in a 5 gallon bucket filled with coffee grounds and sterilized sawdust.  (The internets say moisten sawdust and heat it in an oven bag at 160 degrees for 2 hours)It will probably take a month to spread through the bucket but I look forward to having more mushrooms than I can eat!!Great way to start your first journey.  I recommend it.*note* - if you're brave, there are cheaper methods in the long-run but the few extra dollars to use this easy kit will teach you a lot.
