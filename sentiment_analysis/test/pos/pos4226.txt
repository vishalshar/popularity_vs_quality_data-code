LOVE this tracker thus far! Very comfortable to wear, looks stylish and I have received many compliments. I also like to watch the tracker function go from zero to 100, and start over!As I also use CPAP and have an app monitoring my sleep I wasn't too worried about tracking that. I have discovered that the sleep tracking function doesn't jibe with my CPAP data as to length of time sleeping. However perhaps it does give clues as to whether I am restless while asleep, which is why the length of time sleeping doesn't seem to match. I would love more information on how they track or what the tracker uses as data to determine sleep and the levels of sleep it says it tracks. On one occasion it said I was sleeping but I was reading the news.As I don't run unless it's to save others or myself from an horrific event, I do not have experience with the runner tracking. However tracking my walking is very handy in helping me to analyze how much I am walking and motivating me to walk more.  I really like to see the dial move up.I did have a little difficulty getting the three taps to acknowledge and show me the alarm time. But eventually I found the sweet spot and it worked.
