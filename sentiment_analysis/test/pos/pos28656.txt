I got this for my daughter so she could have a phoneThe works pretty good the obly thing i didnt like was that it took a long time to set up and to get thinggs goung on it but once that eas done it worked fine and she seems to really like itWe downloaded 8 apps on itThe one thing you have to make sure of though is that everything is set to be saved on your sd card or it wont let you download anythingI dont know if anyone elae had this issue but once passes these steps the phone works pretty goodThe only thing that i noticed about it is when you press the mic seatxh button to speak your searchea is that it doesnt work half the time or ita delayed. But making and reciwving calls works fineOverall i think it works greatI think its a great first cellphone for my daughter and she seems to like it very muxhAnd it made a great conversation piece at the birthday party
