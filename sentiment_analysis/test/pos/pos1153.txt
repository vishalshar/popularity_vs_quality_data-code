I am not a screen protector fan normally because they are so hard to install but I have had really good luck with Rokform products so I gave the Rokglass a try. I was not disappointed. The packaging was great and included an alcohol wipe to clean the screen and another cloth to get all the dust off before installing the tempered Glass Rokglass. The Glass installed easily, I just lined it up with the top speaker and the home button and gently set in in place. The glass just sucked onto my iPhone bubble free almost like magic. The feel is better than the standard iPhone screen and the resolution and touch response is unchanged. The only difference is that with the Rokglass there are less fingerprints and the screen is much smoother to the touch. I highly recommend.
