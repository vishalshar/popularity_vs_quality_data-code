I was skeptical about how stable it would be in the CD slot, but the mechanism they use to secure it in the slot is actually pretty ingenious; the lever turns the middle of those three tabs upward at an angle (or downward? I forget) so that it is wider within the slot than outside of it.  Very stable.  And the mechanism by which you can lock the phone in the holder simply by pushing it against the back of the holder is nice.  It holds my iPhone 7 very stably; it's in a silicone case and the friction is great.  I actually have the clip holding the phone at the very bottom of the phone so that it doesn't block my clock, and this seemingly unstable configuration actually securely fastens the phone in place, even if I swivel it to landscape mode.One minor gripe; there are a couple of slots in the back that are supposed to be for cord organization, but my cord only fit in one of the slots, not the other one.
