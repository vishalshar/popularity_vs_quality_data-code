Let me first say that I got this TarDisk back in August and it has been working flawlessly every since. Until I upgraded to OS Sierra. I don't want to place blame on the TarDisk for my computer acting strange, but I figured it was time to call TarDisk and get their opinion on my computer's performance issues. Murilo took my phone call and knew exactly what my computer was doing and knew exactly how to fix it. He suggested I un-pair and then re-pair the device, and after that it has been working flawlessly. Thank you TarDisk for providing an amazing product backed by fantastic customer service! Would recommend this to anyone.
