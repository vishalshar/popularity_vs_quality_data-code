As a first time user of the Withings system-there are many details to figure out.  However, once all the profile information is entered and you have used it for 5 days, the system works pretty well.  Issues that I have seen are mainly due to the wifi link dropping on my end or if strangers step on it when you are not looking....but these are easily corrected.  The web site give a great deal of graphic information that can be downloaded and presented to professionals.  Similar information on handheld devices also helps you keep track during the day about your activity level.  It is also cool when you get ribbons or "badges" for various milestones you reach along the way to one's goal.  I'm inching along and for the device and website giving you encouragement and graphics helps give you feedback.  It also estimates when you will reach your goal based upon patterns.
