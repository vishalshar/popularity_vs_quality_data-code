LOVE IT!!! Very easy to use. Paired it with the Echo and my 3 year old uses it . No more looking for the remotes in the sofa , they are all put away in a drawer. Great for all ages to use. I have 7 remotes in it right now and can s*** them all off at the same time with 1 command or just one at a time if I want . Anymote outdid them selves with this . Also would be a great product for anyone with mobility problems, pair it with a Echo and you just voice controlled your home.
