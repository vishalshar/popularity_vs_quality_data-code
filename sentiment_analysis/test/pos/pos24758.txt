Grip Boost is awesome! I got tired of my 12 year old spitting into his hand thinking that was gonna do the trick to hang on to his bat...so I purchased the Grip Boost Batting Gel and he is amazed! He loves it and it works great, his team mates love it too and are going to buy some as well. Good stuff, highly recommend it to all baseball players!!!
