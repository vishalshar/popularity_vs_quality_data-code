Pros:- Our dogs love the taste of Bixbi treats, especially the salmon (but then we live in Seattle, so....).- The Bixbi Skin and Coat salmon jerky treats package lists salmon as the first of four ingredients.- Bixbi treat ingredients are from the USA, so I worry much less about potential jerky-related health risks.-The product does not contain wheat, corn, soy, or preservatives.Cons:-They are predictably more expensive than the traditional boxed treat available at a local grocery market. A solution that works for us is only giving our dogs small pieces of the treats at one time.
