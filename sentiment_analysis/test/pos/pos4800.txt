The paper airplane design the creator of this recommends you start with sucks honestly. I couldn't make one that had enough lift to get the machine any higher than my initial throw, but I worked at it until I got 2 or 3 good flights, and even those were not very controllable as it required maxing the power and ridiculous elevators to get any lift. Nearly lost it on top of a tall bush, almost lost it flying over someone's house. Took the motor and put it on one of MY designs that focus on low-speed lift generation, and voila! Highly controllable, gets massive altitude on EVERY throw, if I let it, and can glide back down to me whenever I want it to. The product itself is solid. I crashed it at least 50 times trying to make the recommended design work, and the unit took no damage. A solid buy for anyone who ever wanted an RC plane but was too afraid to spend $300 on something that is just going to crash and shatter on the first inexperienced flight.
