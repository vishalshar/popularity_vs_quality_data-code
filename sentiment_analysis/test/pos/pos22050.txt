I purchased the MS-526 because I have several Amateur Radio rigs that I just couldn't foresee fitting very well in my '02 4Runner.  Didn't want to do any "fabrication" to the dash area so the Mobotron mount seemed like the only way to go.I have a President HR2600 and a Yaesu FT-2900R stacked on top of each other. The mount is loaded down to a little over maximum capacity but it handles most bumps just fine.  Adhere to the weight limit, or else you risk having the mount topple over and dump your expensive electronics on the floor!  Utilize the various clamp downs on top of the tray table to secure your devices!The support arms for the tray table are very solid.  Each joint has teeth that lock into each other, and levers to clamp it all together tightly.  I have full faith that the mount will be able to handle anything thrown at it.You won't be able to make big adjustments to it on the fly.  You'll have to pull over for that.  The tray table is the only part that you can safely move around fast. (I don't condone taking your focus off vehicle operation.)The tray table material feels a little more cheaply made than the rest of the mount.  The plastic seems thick enough though, and will do it's job to hold up your devices.  The table has a lot of securing options with the adjustable little swing arms.  As you can see in the pictures, I was able to safely attach two ham radios on the top deck with a little bit of ingenuity!  The adjustable arms have thumb screws to tighten each arm down.  Make sure they're screwed in tight, or else they'll vibrate off.  Lastly, the table is mounted to the support arms by a thick metal post that inserts into the bottom of the table, and is tightened to the post by a metal adjustment rod.  You can loosen the the adjustment rod to rotate the whole table 180 degrees, however the table sits on top of the post so tight that I find it difficult to turn.  With the rod loosened, you can also tilt the table to the side left or right.Overall, very happy with this purchase.  If you want the option of having the telescoping support, I'd go with this one.  If not, buy the cheaper one!
