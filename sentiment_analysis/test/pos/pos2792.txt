I've held off on buying my first fitness tracker, mainly because of the bulkines and looks of others trackers.  Ran across this recently, and liked the sleek look and features for the price (I've had to mention to coworkers that I jumped on the fitness tracker bandwagon...they thought it was a magnetic bracelet!  I don't wear jewelry usually...). It tracks steps, has incoming call vibration alert, which seems to work or only when phone is on silent which makes sense, plus vibration alarm to wake you (this feature sold me on this!) and has a sleep tracker.I have small wrists, so the smaller size is a plus, and I barely notice it especially while sleeping.  While I believe the sleep tracker is only sensing movement, I was very surprised to find it seems to be rather accurate, based on how I feel in the am.  I've already improved my habits in less than two weeks.  Started with not so great looking sleep reports to finally getting a 'you slept Very well last night' message.  I highly recommend giving this a try!
