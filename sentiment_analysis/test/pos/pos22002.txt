I bought this router to replace an aging Apple flat router from 2012. I had wanted to buy a new Apple router and just before I did that Apple announced that it's leaving the router business. Not a wise move, Apple, since we have Apple computers and phones too. But, given that I had to do this I did a fair amount of router research and decided to get the Portal. The Portal router is the first product to come out in a long time offering something new and different to improve wifi. It is even able to create a mesh network if needed. So to the point: This router is excellent. The speed ratings on the other end of the house from the router are almost at the speed I'm paying Comcast for. I'm really impressed. Setup was simple using the IOS app. I connected it to a Western Digital My Cloud Network Attached Storage (NAS) device and ran Time Machine without a hitch. I have no regrets about leaving the Apple ecosystem in this situation.PORTAL Smart Gigabit Home Wi-Fi System, Easy Setup, Self-Optimizing Reliability, Congestion-Busting 3X Speeds, Turbo-AC2400 MU-MIMO, Mesh 2.0 ready
