I found this product to be exactly as advertised.  The packaging was very good, the instructions were clear, it was very easy to set up, and they even offered an option to recycle my old sprinkler controllers (I replaced 2),  I like the feature that allows you to take a photo of each of your zones and input it into the phone app so you know which zone is which.  I'm now getting notices from the controller when it decides to change my watering schedule because it has rained and no watering is needed - great!  Now I don't have to remember to turn off my controllers during rainy periods because the Rachio controller does that automatically.  Couldn't be more pleased with it.
