Easy to attach to my shoes, but a little tight across the instep.  I haven't tried to wear the shoes I put them in longer than a couple hours, since I mostly wear them to the gym.  I'm thinking they might loosen up a bit as I wear them.  I bought these to replace the laces in a pair of shoes that have short, round, slick laces that will not stay tied.  The black/black look great in my mostly black shoes.
