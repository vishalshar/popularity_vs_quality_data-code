I've had my Leaf Urban for a few days now and I am loving it! It looks great on, so much better than fitbit and the otherstuff out there. My only complaint, which isn't really that big of a deal, is the I wish the straps to wear it as a bracelet attached better. This is my preferred way to wear and mine has fallen off a couple times but I was at home luckily and was able to find it quickly.
