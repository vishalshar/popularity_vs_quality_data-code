Taught our jack-russel/poodle mix to use it herself in a day!! Played continuously until she got too excited (& close) & it shot into her eye... now she drops the ball & rolls it to us to drop in.  Minor issues: cord slips out frequently &  can't load more than 1 ball at a time, but overall more than met our expectations. If she sees it, she barks until she can play, and plays until she is ready to drop & we hide it!
