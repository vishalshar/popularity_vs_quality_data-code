I ordered this for my boyfriend's daughter and we never could get the dinos to illuminate. We followed the special care instructions carefully, and even waited ot out for around two weeks before giving up. Biopop emailed me for a satisfaction check up and I told them about the issues I was having. Within three emails, they gave me a code for a refill pack for free. I was really bummed and unhappy at first but they reached out to me and found a solution very quickly. Overall very pleased.
