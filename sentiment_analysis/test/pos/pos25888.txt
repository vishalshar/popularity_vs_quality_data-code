It is a shame that Pebble is no more. The watch is excellent.  The only limitation I can find is that it does not have the sender for detecting earths magnetic field. Or your direction in space. That was what I like about the earlier watches like the Pebble steel. Instead it has a heart rate sensor, which is good. It was what I wanted when purchasing this watch. All in all, it was a good choice.  Once again, it's too bad that Pebble could not continue their good work, Continued development fo this product will be sorely missed.
