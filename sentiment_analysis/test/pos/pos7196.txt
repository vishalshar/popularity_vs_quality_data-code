Pros:I love the solid and damage proof design and features of the product!The case is sleek and hard!Easily install and remove from bicycleCons:waterproof silicon cover is too thick (touch screen is not working good)ExpensiveAnd difficult to put it on and off (too fit to the size it doesn't bother me much as the thick cover)Maybe i can use this product for long long timeIts an expensive spending for a phone mounting, but you won't be disappointing
