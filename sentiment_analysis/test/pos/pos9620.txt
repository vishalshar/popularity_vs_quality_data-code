The Ranch and the Nacho Cheese flavors taste like Cooler Ranch Doritos and Original Doritos - I love this because I air-pop my own popcorn and these two flavors sprinkled on top make me feel like I'm eating something 'bad' when actually I am eating something healthy!The Cheesy Jalapeno really has some kick to it!The Kettle Corn flavor reminds me of the freshly-made popcorn at The Fair, so nice to have at home year-round.The Caramel is nice & sweet, sometimes I toss a few bittersweet chocolate chips into the freshly-popped popcorn when I use this seasoning for a decadent treat.The White Cheddar is delicious and very cheesy tasting, this might be my favorite flavor of this sample pack.The Butter flavor reminds me of movie theater buttered popcorn - yum!The Bacon Cheddar....this one I wasn't a fan of, it had a strange after-taste and tasted neither like bacon nor cheddar. It had a 'smoked' flavor, which I'm not a fan of.Try this sampler pack of mini jars - a serving is only 1/4 teaspoon so these will last forever. This is a great way to find out your favorites so you can buy the full sizes.I deducted one star because this was delivered late (I actually had to go to the UPS Store to pick it up because it came two full days after promised, and then the UPS guy would not leave it on my porch).
