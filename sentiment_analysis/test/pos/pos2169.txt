This product works perfectly!  Our sweet "country" dog loves to wander into the nearby forest and during a snow storm, she got disoriented and then lost.  When we found her at an animal control office a week later, we heard about the Whistle GPS Tracker.  So simple to set up and use, Whistle sends a message to my cell phone as soon as our dog goes outside our generous whistle zone and we can see where she is.  For us, the Whistle GPS Tracker has given us peace of mind, which is Priceless!
