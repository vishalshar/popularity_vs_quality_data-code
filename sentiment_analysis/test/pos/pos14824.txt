Grateful for these mirror mittz daily!  They look good, they go on and off easy, though a bit awkward getting the tie through the door frame to lock them in if the wind blows.  They stay on really well and look cool!  The bright blue snowflake and lettering helps you remember they are on the mirror before you drive off.  We have tried other mirror covers and they weren't as great quality, ease of use putting them on and taking them off, and usually didn't have the ties as anchors for vicious winds we sometimes get in our Alaska winters.
