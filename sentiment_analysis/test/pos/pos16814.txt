I love the Mionix NAOS  mouse series for their feel and button placement. I had the NAOS 8200 before this. I thought the more expensive mouse would be the better mouse. I found the 8200 laser was far too picky about mousing surface. This 7000's optical sensor is amazing. The feel is an immediate improvement over laser, it's less finicky about surfaces and it helped my gameplay accuracy significantly.I prefer this mouse over the R.A.T.7 and any of the Logitechs (I've tried many of them). My hands are bigger than the average gamer and the NAOS fit the best so far. Due to the size of my hands, I'm forced to use a hybrid claw/fingertip grip. This mouse suits almost all available grip styles.
