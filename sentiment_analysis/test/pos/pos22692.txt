A word of caution for those who plan to use their MyLifter with pulleys: using the pulley system is fraught with challenges.  I bought two of the MyLifter pulley hooks, with two MyLifters, to lift two kayaks.  I will be returning the pulley hooks.First, to use pulley hooks to lift a kayak, the straps need to be *very* precisely positioned around the kayak's center of gravity.  If they are off to any degree, the kayak will tilt severely or, worse yet, only lift one end.Second, the pulley hooks are very inefficiently designed.  They take up nearly 9" of vertical space.  If you have any restrictions on vertical space (as I do), they will cost you inches.Third, the pulley system itself prevents the MyLifters from hoisting up as far as they can go.  As the kayak ascends to the MyLifters, the pulleys pull in towards one another, increasing tension on the cable.  This causes the MyLifter to reach maximum load capacity sooner than it otherwise would, again wasting valuable vertical space.The only solution for my setup was to by a second MyLifter for each kayak (four total).  By having a *pair* of hoists for each kayak, the balancing issues are resolved and I'm able to utilize the maximum amount of vertical space.The MyLifters are great and seem to work well, but the pulley system is sloppy and inefficient.  Having to abandon the pulley system caused me to spend twice as much as I originally intended on this project.
