I love this towel. I take it with me to the beach, or a public pool. My favorite feature is the pocket. It's a great place for a phone. Keeps my phone out of sight but still in reach. If you have the pillow in it the towel can be quite ackward to dry with. I recommend two towels this to lay on and another to dry with.
