I am enjoying my Misfit Shine 2.  The app is user friendly and has great information!  I hope they will come out with new watch bands, maybe something more secure.  My Misfit Shine 2 has popped out of the band twice.  It popped out twice when I stuck my arm inside my carry on looking for something.  Luckily it fell into the bag both times.  I like the watch look and the time function.  I really appreciate the vibration and the alert lights when I am getting a text or call.  My phone always seems to be in the other room but the Misfit is always on my wrist!!  I recommend this product!!
