I'm a fairly large SportDOG fan and own several of their products. I wasn't expecting to find out they had a check cord available as a product but the other available products kept me looking.The other leashes were either, overpriced, too short, low quality or a combination of all three.I just purchased my second SportDOG check cord and both the new one and the old one have held up very well. I found the claim to be knot proof interesting. However, the claim was true in several cases. The cord will pretzel up but the slickness of the nylon and the thickness of the cord makes it fairly hard to have a tight knot. It comes out very quickly and the cord reforms.I have only used it indoors but I have found no flaws, it is a solid product.
