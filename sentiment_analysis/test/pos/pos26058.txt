As I entered middle age and my natural good looks literally began to evaporate, I became an intense user of high end creams and moisturizers. Because many of my piers are picking up odd illnesses from auto-immune diseases to cancer, I also keep a close watch on ingredients. Prior to discovering Seaweed Bath, my two favorites were La Mer and Estee Lauder. My new favorite is Seaweed Bath. The cream itself is light and refreshing. It is effective and long lasting. The ingredients are surprising clean and natural. Finally, the price is a steal for this high a quality product.
