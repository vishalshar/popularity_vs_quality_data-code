I do interview videos for political candidates and my process has improved exponentially. My 'subjects' are natural and at ease and our sessions go quickly. The price/quality ratio is outstanding. In addition, the remote is well worth including. The Parrot app works well with my Android Samsung 6 edge. The remote instructions are clear and pairing is easy. One caveat though, the raised button on the remote emits an audible click that may be picked up with sensitive mics.
