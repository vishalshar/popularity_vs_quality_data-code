I love the convenience of my door auto unlocking as I approach. It isnt perfect, but works >95% of the time.  Installation was fairly easy and straight forward, even someone who isn't the most mechanically inclined can complete it, just watch one of the youtube installation videos.The only draw back to this device is the lack of wifi connectivity.  The lock works with Siri, but requires an additional connector if you want it be wifi connected, and work with Alexa.  Outside of that, I love it.
