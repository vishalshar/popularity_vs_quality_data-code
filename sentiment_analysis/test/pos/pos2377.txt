AMAZING!!! I love this product! It holds my giant iPhone 6 Plus as well as other things - It fits comfortably and does not ride up like some of the other products I have tried. I use this for my runs as well as festivals, museum days, long term shopping - any situation where a purse is too much of a pain.Don't hesitate! You will not regret this purchase. I am planning on getting a few other designs!
