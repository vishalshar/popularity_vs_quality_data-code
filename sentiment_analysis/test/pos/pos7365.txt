Android desktop on the cheap.  I missed the kickstarter but bought this from a 3rd party amazon seller and couldn't be happier.  I knew exactly what I was purchasing though as I didn't expect a full desktop experience,  For me the only thing that Android is missing is Printer and scanner support.  But who scans anymore...I would like a printer option though and flash support and it would be a fully fledged desktop machine.  With that being said you don't get the crazy viruses that are infecting computer now-a-days with this box and it is something like a 5 second boot time.
