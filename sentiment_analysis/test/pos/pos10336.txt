I used these on a 5 day camping trip, in situations where the ambient humidity was often 90% or more.  Unlike my small microfiber towel I was using as a washcloth that I could never get dry, these things were dry EVERY MORNING.  Even when it rained the night before and they had been soaked by rain and only had a few hours of dry weather to dry out, they were dry enough to use comfortably at 6AM.When you get them, the fabric feels kind of weird, like it won't be absorbent enough.  But in practice it works just like a regular towel would.  They didn't get smelly after five days either.These weigh so little you can even carry a nice big, bath towel sized one with you without any meaningful weight penalty.  I also keep a smaller one in my day pack just for wiping off sweat etc. because the weight penalty is so trivial there is really no reason not to have a towel along.Sometimes you buy stuff on Amazon based on the glowing reviews and it turns out that the hype was BS.  This isn't one of those things.  If you are looking for a camping/hiking towel, just stop looking and buy these.  You won't regret it.
