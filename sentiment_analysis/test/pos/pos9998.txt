First thing is I don't understand why reviews for the Kisslink NANO ends up here on the Smart Grill Pro. Yes the NANO will melt because it's not design for oven use and I doubt that it would fair well on a grill.But the Smart Grill Pro 6 is the tool for that job. BBQ, grill, smoker, Big Green Egg and even you Thanksgiving turkey in the oven.I used it yesterday and finally no more guessing. Our steaks were exactly medium rare. Even though they were of different sizes. I could see instantly see the temperature of each steaks and control the time or heat so they come out perfect. Here in Canada it's was 2C or 34F yesterday, so the Bluetooth feature comes really handy. I can go back inside the house and keep an eye on  things with the App on my cell.I am told by the seller that,  the extra probes will be available for purchase soon. ( update 21 Dec 2016, still waiting for the spare probes)The removable plastic clip on the probes are g√©niales as we say in French. It holds on the probe, than you coil the wire around it and the 1/8 jack fits just perfect in the gap. Everything can be put away neatly no messy wires entanglements.
