I bought this because it was the first keychain bottle opener I saw on Amazon that a. looked like it would actually fit in my pocket on my keys and b. looked durable in any way. I was not disappointed! It fits right in with the rest of my keys and goes just fine in my pocket, it's obviously made of high-quality material, and the bottle opener works great. I was intrigued about the "snakebite" aspect so I tested it out on a few cans of beer...it really works! Me and my friends were all amazed at what a significant difference it made in the pour. Thanks, Snake Bite Company, for making an amazing product!
