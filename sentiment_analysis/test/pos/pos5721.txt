I was thrilled to learn this option existed to expand the storage for my Mac Air.  Great reviews, seemed easy enough.  t followed the instructions exactly with no issues until the final step where I received an error "Something Went Wrong."  The installer automatically generated an email with a diagnostic report so that all I needed to do was send.  The next business morning I receive an email asking to schedule a call at my convenience to get me set up.  The technician called me right on time, asked a couple of questions & started to work.  In just a few minutes, I was up and running.  Absolutely the very best experience in tech support I have ever had.  I definitely recommend the product.  I doubt you will experience any issues, but if you do, the support is fantastic.  I will definitely recommend the product to my friends & family!!  Thanks TarDisk!!
