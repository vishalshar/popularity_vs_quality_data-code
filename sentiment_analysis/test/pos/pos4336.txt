I have 5 dogs; 2 boxers & 3 Chihuahuas as well as 3 small children.... I had a 2 dog set up for my two big dogs until one decided to chew up one of the receivers/collars. I needed another one asap, thank god for primes 2 day. It connects to the remote super easy and is waterproof. I haven't taken my dogs to the lake to see if its really submersible yet but that will happen soon. It's a great price for a great item. If you have a dog that can be a little(or a lot) crazy, this is a must.
