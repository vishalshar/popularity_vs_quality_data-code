Thanks to Jenny Dean of FloppyCats.com, I was made aware of Amazon's great deal on this 21oz.bag. All the pieces are soft enough to crumble into little pieces for my kiddies. I have to admit, that the bag had a very slight stale smell, but my cats eat it anyway. This has happened to me before with a smaller bag, and the company sent me a replacement bag, which had no stale smell at all. Even though the expiration date on this big foil pouch is with in the correct time, it still had the slight stale smell. I so WISH I could buy this product directly from the manufacturer for the freshest product possible, but they don't sell from their site.
