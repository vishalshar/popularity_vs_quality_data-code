This is a fantastic device. To clarify: This is NOT a GPS tracker that lets you follow your stuff in real time anywhere in the world. This is a bluetooth device, which you can pair with your smartphone. This gives you the ability to track whatever item you attach the TrackR to, as long as it is in bluetooth range. Additionally, you can use your phone to "ping" the device, causing it to emit a beep. I use this feature almost daily, because I consistently lose track of my keys. The TrackR has even saved me a couple times when I was running late and had forgotten exactly where I left my keys. Finally, the TrackR has one more function: If the app is open in the background of your phone, you can use the device to "ping" it. Yes, you can use your keys to find your phone. This is an awesome device that everyone should have. Buy one for yourself, get them as presents, you can even put it on your dog. You will not regret it.
