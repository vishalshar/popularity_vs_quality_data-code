Was a skeptic but thought what the heck.  These actually actually work really well.  I use them as a back up when I don't have my regular glasses with me.  In my opinion, they aren't a replacement for full reading glasses, but they come through again and again.  I will buy another set as a I depend on them more and more as time goes by.  It takes a little time to get used to putting them on, however, after you used to wearing them, it is no big deal.
