If I could, I would give Kuna 3.5 stars.  It is a good product that fills a need for security with technology that makes its function even better, but not everything works perfectly.Install:  Very simple.  Step 1:  Turn off the power at the breaker.  Then two screws for the mount, connect 3 wires (black to black, white to white, ground to ground), put the light on the mounting screws, and twist on the black caps.Functionality:  The video shows well on my iPhone.  It's choppy at times, but very clear.  The angle is wide so you can see a sizable area.  The microphone feature needs some improvement.  There are 3 preset male voices - "Can I help you," "We're a little busy right now," and "Sorry, I'm not interested."  You can speak directly into your phone and the microphone on the light will project your voice, but it frequently echos so it's not the best.  The light can be controlled remotely from your phone's app as well - you can turn it on/off.  There is a setting where you can specify the time for the light to turn on/off, but that does not seem to be working for me.  I keep receiving an error to update the firmware, but, when I try, I am told there is no update available.What can improvement:  The voice/microphone feature, ability to dim the light, setting on/off time for the light.
