So I just got these today and I was worried that they would be melted and stuck together like the other reviews said. They don't seem to be that way, which is great. The other thing was the strong vitamin smell and the awful taste, which I will say they do smell like vitamins.... and they taste really good(I tried one myself). My two year old liked these vitamins, so I'm glad.
