So I received my new phone about 2 days and a half ago and honestly its just what I was looking for I don't know why some people even complain about it for the price you pay you have nothing to complain about seriously although I had a little complication with the Sim card cause it didn't register my previous one I was using for straight talk so I had to buy a new sim and activated it through the phone it was easy although the internet didn't want to work but I didn't give up on it I ended up just calling my phone provider again and they fixed the problem so far its really fast much faster than my previous phone I was a galaxy user just gave it to my mom and the camera IS NICE good quality for what you pay for I'm happy with my purchase  no regretsPS I never give reviews on anything but thought this should help cause I was really iffy about it at first as well
