I took this product to a music festival and it worked reasonably well. The first day that we used it (for our best results) it was an extremely sunny day and we managed to charge a phone halfway in two hours. It was great. When we tried t the next day, slightly overcast, the process took so much longer to get the same results. The packaging was cute and the bright color was attractive and easy to find.
