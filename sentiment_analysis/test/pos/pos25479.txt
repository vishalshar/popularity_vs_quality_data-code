I looked at all of these cameras available on Amazon and decided to go with this one because it was priced well, has a range of motion, and has night vision. It ended up being the best choice for me. Some of the others only had 1-Way sound but this camera has 2-way sound (I can hear the cat and she can hear me). She is slightly amused by the laser but mostly loves my voice. The reason I got the camera was because I travel a lot and my cat gets high anxiety. So far, I have used this camera and app on my iPhone to log in and check up on her. If it weren't for the night vision and the free range of motion (left right up down) I would not be able to find her in my tiny studio apartment. She actually hears the camera moving and gets up to check it out. Not only is it adorable, but it keeps her interest. She also loves to hear my voice and meows back excitedly. Worth every penny! I am glad I chose this one specifically for the night vision, free range of motion and 2-way audio. It did not seem like the other cameras had all 3 of these features, which I have found to be the most important. I did not realize how dark my apartment was and I am glad I have the night vision feature to correct for the poor lighting. I highly recommend this camera!
