Great product, consistently provides what feels like good data. Does not provide actionable interpretations of data, so I have all of these graphs of REM and deep sleep, but I had to comb the internet to find out if my sleep cycles are normal and I'm still not sure, that's why I'm giving the Aura three stars. Quality and feel of the product is a 5. I like that it can attach two devices and that it has a bedside usb charger. The touch features are a 3, sometimes that's a little buggy and I'd rather have a few buttons than to constantly be "petting" the side of the periscope trying to turn down the volume or brightness. The syncing is a 2 star experience. The data will appear a few hours after you wake up -- if you get up and leave for work, you won't see your data until the evening. The Withings HealthMate app is a 2 as well - more below. The Aura lights are a little strange at first - I have a baby that wakes me up at least twice a night, so I rarely get the blue wake-up light, but it is a nice way to wake up.Am I sleeping better? About an extra half hour of deep sleep on average. I bought a step tracker at the same time, so I don't know if it's the lights, the data or the increased exercise that is helping me sleep. I found another app, "Addapp"  - the app provides a ton of actionable insight on all of the metrics (steps, sleep, and activity) that is actually useful. Withings doesn't really do sleep notes, so you don't get to see if caffeine, stress or late-night tv is affecting your sleep - I really dislike that. Also, Withings app doesn't really use data from ios Health to give you insights, which is why AddApp is so nice. I have a step tracker from another manufacturer, but Withings only uses the step data from the phone's pedometer, so it only knows how much the phone moves, not what my tracker is reporting.Overall, this is a great product- I sleep a lot less than I realize and I love that the device tracks me without me having to start/stop it. The alarms are easily set and adjusted. It just takes some hacking to get the most out of the data, which feels really complicated right now, but overall, I'm sleeping better. I think that in time, companies will find better and better ways to aggregate and interpret the data. After reading about all of the sleep trackers out there, I really think that Withings is the way to go. My misfit flash gives the least useful data ever and I would not recommend a fitness tracker to monitor sleep (unless it's the Withings Pulse which is supposed to be awesome). Sleep cycle app is only so-so and you have to turn it on/off and constantly find a place under your sheets for a phone, but it provides more feedback on what is affecting your sleep based on what you record before bed.
