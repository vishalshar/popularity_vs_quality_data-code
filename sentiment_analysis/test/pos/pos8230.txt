I had some problems getting bulb to connect to my phone at first however I followed instructions on site (turn off/on about 5 times)and got it working.I actually had to to do this about 3 times since everytime I turn off my phone, when I restared it I lost the connection. However now it seems to be connecting easily even though I use the light switch from time to time. I haven't been able to try the music player (it needs certain music players) to see the effects on the bulb.Otherwise I am pleased with it.
