Bought these for my teenager with special needs.  She can tie her shoes, but loosely, so the knot never stays.  These seemed worth a try, and so far (a week) so good.  If they are tight, you can try the Loose Method (in the instructions and web).  We were also warned they also take a few days to break in and stretch a bit (think rubber bands).  I hope they are durable--if they fall apart that would be where my review would turn south.
