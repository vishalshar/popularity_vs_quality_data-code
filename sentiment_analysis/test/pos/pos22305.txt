This thing is amazing as silly as it sounds. I was tired of being blinded anytime I had to use the bathroom at night. Saw this featured on "The Chive" and said "I need this!" I have never has an issue with it turning on and there are a lot of color options that are easy to cycle through. (Wife didn't like the red, made her think there was blood in the toilet lol) Runs off 3 AAA batteries and the suction cups have not slipped of popped of yet so it should stay in place for some time with no issues. I would hands down buy this again and recommend it to anyone that has ever tried to pee in the dark.
