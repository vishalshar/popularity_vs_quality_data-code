Our two dogs kept escaping from our yard.  We live on the side of a mountain and there have been coyotes spotted in our neighborhood.  We have a German Shepherd mix and she likes to explore and dig.  We also have a Basenji mix and he is the same way.  I had tried blocking the areas and using chicken wire.  I also used zip ties and metal stakes.  It did not do any good.  The zip ties do not hold up well.  The collar works perfectly and keeps her and our Basenji mix away from the fence and the corners of the yard.  There are 5 levels of correction and we use a setting on 3 and they turn around when they feel it.  The collars are very effective and the dogs are learning real fast.  This is an excellent resolution and kind of a last resort for a big problem of dogs that get out the yard every day and could get themselves into trouble.
