My husband is a coffee lover, especially loves making cold coffee. He is also a person who travels a lot for sports competitions, and for seminars. He LOVES it, and I am thrilled. The quality is very good, it is exactly as described, and works perfectly!  He has already used it twice and just got it for Christmas! Perfect for travel, makes great coffee,  and this little device can save you a lot of money instead of spending more at cafe's.  I wouwld buy it again as a gift for someone who travels or enjoys a really nice cold coffee!
