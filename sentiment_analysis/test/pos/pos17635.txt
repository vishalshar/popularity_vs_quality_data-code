I wear sneakers to work everyday and these help keep the stank at bay. I tend to rotate through a couple of pairs of shoes each week at work and spray a bit in each shoe about once a week. Really seems to help control the odor. I also use this for my cycling shoes and hiking boots. Works so well that I might use as underarm deodorant. Okay, no, I'm not actually planning to do that, but it does help without making the shoes smell like shoe deodorizer like my dad used to use. Nothing wrong with some Dr. S's foot powder, but I prefer this spray. I found this product since I love the wash that I use with my cycling and gym clothes, which I also really like.
