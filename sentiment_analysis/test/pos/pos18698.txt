This this is pretty amazing.  Had to adjust the volume on the inside the app to make it respond.It's pretty much hassle free for electric guitars(strats) but for acoustic and les paul style electrics, it's gonna give you some exercise on your hand and wrist because you will need to hold the tuner upside down to tune the GBE strings because the pegs are facing down.Other than that, for $99.... a little pricey but hey, you pay extra premium for being an early adopter.Hope the maker of this product will keep updating the app so that it can get better and better.  I gave you my $99.  Hope you guyz prosper and succeed!
