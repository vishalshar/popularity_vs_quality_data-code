I bought this after reading several reviews and watching a segment on Dr. Oz where they tested several of these devices.  This device seems accurate.  I also love the additional mouthpieces, so others can use this too within spreading germs.  The battery lasts for longer than expected.  I do wish that the mouthpiece screwed in a little instead of just pushing in, as it kept falling out and get lost in my purse.  For a $50 breathalyzer though, I cannot say that you will do any better than this.  I will continue to use this
