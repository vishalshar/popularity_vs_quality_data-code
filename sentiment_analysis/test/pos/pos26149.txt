Does exactly what I needed.  Fits on collar easily.  Charging is very easy and battery lasts a long time if dog spends most of its time within range of the base station.  We bought it to ensure we could always locate our dog when walking it off leash in woodlands near us.  The app enables us to do that very well.  The activity reports are fun but not that relevant to us - we know our dog never sits still.
