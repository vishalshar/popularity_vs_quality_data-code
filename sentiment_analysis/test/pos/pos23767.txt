A word of caution, nylon rope and a running dog = rope burn. My initial impression of 30 feet was off and I trew the bumper, dog took off and my hand now hurts.  I learned that lesson, the next lesson came shortly when my dog circled around like she was picking up a skier and now my leg hurts.  I didn't dock a star for that, but I'm just posting to help out others.  I did however dock a star because the latch is tiny, like something I would put on a key chain.
