I know every child is different, but for my child, this is the ideal way for her to play and learn numbers.  She already knows a lot of numbers and she can count but she really needs to sharpen and refine her skills.I have tried online learning programs like ABC Mouse and programs like that, and she is not overly interested.  They don't capture her attention.  But when she can play with tactile shapes AS WELL AS the tablet, she is SO much more engaged and has a lot of fun with it!She also had great success with Tiggly Shapes, it is a similar tablet game with rubbery shapes, and there is also a counting one.  Thanks to Tiggly she is very solid in her knowledge of her shapes, she's also really good with colors.  But I was looking for something that would solidify her grasp of numbers and letters.  I like that there are levels in each app so that the game can grow as the child learns more, this will take her into addition and subtraction!So far she loves the numbers one and we are going to purchase the letters shortly.  They are a little bit pricey but since it works perfectly with my daughter's way of learning, it is worth the expense.  We've only been using this numbers one a few days but I can already tell that it will work well for her.  (The plastic container that they come in is fun for her as well, she treats it like a wooden puzzle and likes putting the numbers back in their assigned places.)Again, I know every child learns differently, but I would highly recommend this!
