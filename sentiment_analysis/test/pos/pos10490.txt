I used this pillow when travelling on an intercontinental flight from the West Coast of the USA to Europe, and it was very handy, especially in covering my ears so that noises didn't bother me as much while trying to sleep. It is, however, awkward and very big when fully "extended". Makes a great pillow when folded up and with the white band around it.
