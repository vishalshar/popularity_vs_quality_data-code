Although I am new to 3D scanning, I was contacted by the Matter and Form team with an offer for a free tutorial on how to use the scanner as well as tips and tricks to get the best quality scans. It was very helpful, and showed me that they really do care about putting out a good product and having good customer support. The tutor walked me through step by step and answered every question I had for him. I'm glad I made the purchase.
