Love the softness and fit. I've noticed that I have less foot fatigue at my job compared to wearing the usual department store brands. Four instead of five stars because I can sometimes feel the logo stitching underneath, and they also shed more than average, leaving behind little back pilings on my white carpet. Maybe that's just because they're new.
