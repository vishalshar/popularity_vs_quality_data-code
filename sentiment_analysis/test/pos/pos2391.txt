Let's face it...having a PICC line is no fun. Care+Wear does a tremendous job of creating an amazing option to help protect a PICC line. The comfortable design is also easy to wear. Ive seen some of the other companies and have been disappointed by their designs. I even bought another companys sleeve and was horrified when my nurse told me that unwearable! Apparently it constricted the air flow to the dressing and site rendering it useless. With help from the nurses, we went through all of the options and Care+Wears PICC line cover was one that all of us were blown away by. The design is absolutely phenomenal. The nurses loved the unique mesh window which allowed air to get into the dressing while also enabling us to see the insertion site and monitor for infection and leakage. Having the antimicrobial treatment adds to my comfort level.  It's easy to throw it in the wash (and dryer) with the rest of my laundry  no special care is required! These PICC line covers have allow the user to go back to daily life and not have to worry about my PICC line. Thank you for creating such a fantastic product!
