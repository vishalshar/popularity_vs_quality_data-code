I bought the Petzi Treat Cam cause I travel a lot and am away from home for weeks at a time. The Petzi has a great camera and app that easily lets you see and interact with your pet. I must say the treat button is terrific and fun to use to keep your pets attention. I absolutely love this product and would recommend it for any pet owner. The Petzi is a great value for the money and well constructed. This is great product and very fun to use.
