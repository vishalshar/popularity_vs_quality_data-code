Let me start the review with the conclusion: I strongly recommend spire to anyone who's realized the power of breathing and who'd like an "invisible friend" to help him/her breathe better or more. Spire is elegant and small, you absolutely do not feel it when wearing it, or say forget about it soon after you start wearing it. It's easy to use, features, charging, etc. Most important it's just incredibly powerful in picking up your breathing patterns. As a simple example, I've been amazed at getting a gentle buzz (I've set it up for it) about being tensed, as I was getting ready for work and had just left my mind wandering 2 minutes on the pretty heavy schedule ahead of me. I didn't think I was getting particularly stressed about it, but it seems I had stopped breathing! Spire undoubtedly helps me breathe better and more and therefore helps me better control my state of mind. The amazing aspect is that some of it becomes more automatic: just putting spire on and wearing it acts as a gentle reminder to breathe. And this is the whole point: better breathing allows to be calmer and more focused and it works!
