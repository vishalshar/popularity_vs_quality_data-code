I have the taller mug at home and wanted one at the office. I leaned that the taller one does not fit under our coffee maker dispensers. I was thrilled to learn that a shorter one is made. This is the perfect mug to have around electronics and we all are surrounded by these intolerant to water devices. The mug is fun to show others, but it really shines when you unintentionally bump it and it does not spill. Great product.
