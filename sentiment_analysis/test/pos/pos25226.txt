It feels like sizing chart is a tad bit off; the med/large should have fit my puppy with the smaller adjustments an inch less than she needed, but it's rather loose, about 2-3 inches per measurement. Not too big a deal as my pup is a Great Dane and will certainly grow into it, but just putting it out there. Otherwise nice coloring (green), c, and ease of putting onto a dog! Will edit once I get to use it properly ;)
