I have been trying many different types of underwear in search of something that gives me support while running. These are definitely in the lead against anything else I've tried yet. The only thing that could be better is if it were made out of a water wicking material. Maybe they'll consider making a sport nicer brief in the future. For now, it keeps everything out of the way in a secure and comfortable way.
