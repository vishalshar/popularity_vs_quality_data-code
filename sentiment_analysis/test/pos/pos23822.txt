My husband the Riverview,Florida licensed barber received these as a birthday gift. He stated he is very impressed with the way these clippers handle. He hasn't had a pair of Wahl made clippers that has such a thick cord and sturdy.  He cuts about 15 heads a day and these don't get hot to his hands like some of the others. Nor did he have to adjust them out the box. He rates them 5+ and says HE LOVES THEM!!!  (I'll post pics later)
