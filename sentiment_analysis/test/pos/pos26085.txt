Keep in mind that if you are looking to buy a portable battery that will give your phone a FULL charge, this is not what you want.PROS:- Great design: product is very slim and fits into my front pocket (along with my phone and wallet).- Charges very quickly: I like to use this battery so my phone is not constantly connected to the wall when I'm using it in bed or on the couch. I can usually get a full charge on my phone after three cycles with the portable battery while using the phone the entire time.CONS:- The LED on the front of the battery is literally so bright and it flashes either blue or white the entire time you use it. Do not expect to charge this in a dark room that you plan to sleep in. For whatever reason, this is more frustrating to me than it should be. I have no clue why they gave a flashing LED such a dominate role in the design.
