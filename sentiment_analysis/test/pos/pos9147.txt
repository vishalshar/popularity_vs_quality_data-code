I use the Glyph's for mainly flying my drone and they are great.  The key to comfort and performance was taking the time to get the best fit/nose piece.  Once purchased, go to the website and follow their instructions and take your time with proper fitting/adjustments.  I tried each nose piece and watched Video's while making adjustments to nose piece height wheel, head phone distance/tightness, head-strap adjustment and placement for supporting the weight off your nose, eye goggle separation distance and the ability to focus for each eye.  The end result was the ability to wear the Glyph's for long periods of time not only flying a drone but watching movies during commercial flights.I will also comment on Avegant Customer Service, Grant and Tori went out of their way to assist and help me with my purchase, even on Thanksgiving Day they were responding to my emails, I couldn't ask for better support than what was provided.
