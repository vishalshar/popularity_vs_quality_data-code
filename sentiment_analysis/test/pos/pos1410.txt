Just finished hooking up singlecue. Setup took a few long minutes but it was relatively easy. They gave a step by step process. I connected my TV+ cable, my apple TV and sound bar, I just tested the hand based control and it worked, I lifted a finger up in the air and the screen turned on showing me the TV and apple TV icons, I then was able to choose what I wanted to watch, and control the volume and channels. So far, I love it!
