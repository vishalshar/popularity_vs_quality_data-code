I bought this more expensive device to use as a ranger extender when we had to set up a home office that required the modem/router to be upstairs.  Our home is about 2400 sq feet, with the office in a bonus room upstairs.  I have this unit located at the bottom of the stairs and we have Comcast Xfinity internet.  I chose this based on the Amazon reviews of the ease of use, dependability, and customer service.  I'm not tech savvy, so I was looking for something that would not require an advanced degree to use.  This fits the bill for a person like me.  I was able to set it up with ease, really almost 'plug and play'.  We have multiple devices connecting to it and have seen no slow down, no dropping anywhere we are in the house.  I haven't tested it out in the backyard yet.  Yesterday, our internet dropped and I had to reset the modem.  I noticed that the Almond was having trouble holding the signal and appeared to be offline, but yet I had no problem getting the signal furthest from the modem.  I went to Securifi's website to FAQ.  I saw that there was an issue with the Almond 'appearing' offline, but was actually online, and a simple update would fix it.  I followed the instructions, but my Almond needed to go to the next step which required it to be done with UI, which of course, I had to google to find out what UI means, lol.  At this point, I'm thinking I need a cord and I'm not sure what to do, so I call tech support.A Mr. Raju answers my call.  I notice this is probably an overseas call center.  I usually dislike getting the overseas call centers because most of the time, even if the person speaks English, there is something lost in context and it can be difficult to get the customer service/tech support agent to understand my issue.  Not in this case.  Mr. Raju not only speaks excellent English, but he had no trouble understanding my situation and what I needed to do.  I did not get the 'run-around', I didn't get 'scripted' responses, I didn't get a condescending attitude, I just got step by step, EXTREMELY COURTEOUS help.  He explained everything I needed to do, stayed with me on the phone about 20 min or so to make sure everything was up and running properly after the update, AND he even gave me some very good advice should my internet drop again and how to reset the modem and my Almond.  It was so refreshing to have a kind, patient and polite individual to help me and treat me respectfully.  In the day and age of 'no-customer service', this was a pleasant surprise and I would recommend this product and the company to friends and family.  For me, it was worth the extra money for the peace of mind and ease of use!  I also want to give a plug to Amazon.  I've been a prime member for almost 3 yrs.  I was late to get into shopping with Amazon, and only because I got the freebie Prime trial when I bought my mother a kindle.  I LOVE it.  I do a lot of shopping with Amazon, especially on subscribe and save.  And anytime I need honest reviews on an item, even if I don't purchase the said item from Amazon, I go here to see what people are reporting.  Also, the only other time I have had a good experience with an overseas call center was with Amazon.  I have had a couple of minor issues that required me calling customer service.  Sometimes I get people in the US, and sometimes in the Philippines.  Every time I have gotten the Philippines, it's the same as with Securifi tech support.  The Amazon call centers in the US and Philippines have been so nice, so easy to talk with, 0 problems in communication and every issue has been handled beyond my expectations.  Kudos to Amazon and their employees.!
