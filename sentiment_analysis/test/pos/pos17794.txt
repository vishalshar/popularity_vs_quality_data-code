Wow, all I can say is WOW. The sound is better then my $399 headphones. They a very load, deep base, and crystal clear. The volume control is very easy to use. my whole family loves these. Made very well, these are not cheap. I wish they had a Bluetooth version you could use with a phone, these need the cord if connecting to a phone or MP3 player. the Bluetooth transmitter uses a USB, so you can only really use them wirelessly if you have a USB port.
