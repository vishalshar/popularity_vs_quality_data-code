Merge VR - Virtual Reality Headset for iPhone and AndroidVR, Virtual Reality, has been around for decades but has only become affordable to consumers in recent years. These days you don't need incredibly expensive fast graphics machines, specialized 3D stereo displays and (finicky) custom trackers  most of this functionality is built into todays smart phones. As proof of concept, Google created Google Cardboard, an inexpensive headset which could be used to immerse you in 3D stereo video on your phone while tracking your head movements creating a realistic experience of being immersed in the scene. The MergeVR Virtual Reality Headset is essentially a more robust version of Google Cardboard with better lenses.Merge VRs virtual reality googles, like Google Cardboard, should work with any Android or iPhone made in the past two years. They are made of heavy-duty foam with adjustable lenses for optimizing the 3D stereo on your smart phone to your particular vision. Two sliding knobs can be moved left and right to make adjustments. Each of the knobs has a button on top to activate certain functions in apps (walking, selecting, etc.). There are cut-outs in the foam to access the phones headphone port and camera (for augmented reality apps). The goggles also include a heavy-duty elastic strap to hold the headset to your face and an optional top strap which I would recommend installing to keep the headset in place. There is also a simplified set of instructions and including multiple pages of warnings and a URL to the MergeVR website where one can find more detailed instructions, videos and links to curated content.The headset appears well made, is very comfortable to wear (especially with the top-strap installed) and seems nearly indestructible. From my experience, they wont easily fit over prescription glasses but I found I didnt really to wear them with this headset. I initially wore the headset strap too tight, however, which pulled the goggles too close to my eyes making the video appear blurry. Once I loosened up the straps, the screen was MUCH sharper. Installing the top strap helped a great deal. To experience VR, all you need to do is to download and run a Google Cardboard compatible app or open a Cardboard compatible YouTube video, slide your phone into the headset, attach headphones and place the goggles and headphones on your head. Headphones are highly recommended since some apps use directional sound. As nothing is ever quite as simple as you expect, sometimes sliding my phone into the headset would press the HOME button on the phone and go to the home screen. I would also recommend trying this out while seated because you can easily become disorientated and trip over things. Once the app starts running, you can usually turn your head to look all around and stare at menu items to open them. I might suggest trying a spooky little app called Sisters as a short demo (don't forget the headphones).This headset is a great deal fun but consumer orientated VR is still young so there are still only a limited number of apps and videos and the technology isnt quite mature at this point in time. For this reason, I would recommend the MergeVR and its like more for early adopters and experimenters. And if you have one of the newest Samsung Galaxy smartphones, you should definitely check out the Samsung Gear VR - Virtual Reality Headset.
