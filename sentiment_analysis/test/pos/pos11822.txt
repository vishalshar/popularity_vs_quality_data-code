These are SOOOOO comfy.  We have two of them set up in the garden and there is nothing more relaxing than lying in them on a warm summer's day.With the netting pegged out there is a massive amount of room in side and the hammock portion allows you to lay across the hammock (which is the recommended way to use a hammock).
