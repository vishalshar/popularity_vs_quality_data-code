Bought this scarf for my Houston-born (read: usually cold) wife for some relief during our frequent visits to my family in Detroit. Due to lack of reviews (and performance of cheap imports) I thought it most likely that we'd be disappointed by either the warmth or coverage of the scarf. I justified the risk thinking at worst it would be a donation to innovation in my home city.We've just received it today, and I wanted to take a moment to leave a review saying how much we like it. It gives a strong warmth, like a heating blanket around the neck. The heating surface is soft and covers a generous amount of the scarf, and the overall length is appropriate for easy wrapping. There is some weight to the battery, which sits in a velcro pocket at the end of the scarf.
