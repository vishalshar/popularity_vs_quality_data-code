Nice one - this is the second EYN case I am buying - the first one for an i-phone 5 and now an upgraded i-phone 6s plus. They were the first to introduce this concept (I think) and are still the best. The 6s plus case is slightly thinner than the original 5 case and yet can hold up to 4 cards without any problems.
