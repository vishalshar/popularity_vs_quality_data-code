Ozmo puts out great products and this is no exception. It's fun and entertaining, teaches math (giving change to customers) and multi tasking (handling the customers pizza demands and then collecting payment). It's great for even up to three people to play if you divvy up responsibilities. It's so much fun even adults like my boyfriend and myself want to play. Which we did, but the fun ended when he went full Gordon Ramsey on me based on my apparently lackluster topping skills. But don't let that deter you!
