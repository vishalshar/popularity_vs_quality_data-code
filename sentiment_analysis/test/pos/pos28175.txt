These are so good their are addicting.  What I like about them is they are very easy to make.  I have added peanut butter to make them more like a peanut butter cookie.  They come out a little softer and so you have be more care with them but they taste like a peanut butter cookie.  Got them on my subscribe and save list.  Great when you crave something sweet.
