The pivotal living band is a wonderful addition to my exercise routine. I love how it keeps track of hydration, steps taken, sleep pattern and calories burned. You receive six straws and two cleaners with the collection and they are durable to last. The digital display shows you everything that you would want to know. It is easy to set and also comes with an app to download your progress. You can also complete with your family and friends with your progress. I would recommend this to my family and friends.
