The best kitty toy since string.  Frolicat. / Bolt. Rex LOVES it !  Beats the Bada Beam as it does what the BB was meant to. Engage your cat with very little effort on your part. All you have to do is set it down and turn it on and kitty is all over it. At LEAST watching it with some pouncing and chasing antics. Depending on kitty mood swings of course. Sometimes Rex goes totally nuclear if he has been bored. YMMV. I would get a cheep laser first and test out your kitty, if they like that they will love the Bolt. [ Some cats are just not interested.] The Bolt has a 15 minute shut down, how CONVENIENT. It takes 4 AA cells [ Not included.] so it is pretty bright. It even works fairly well in the daytime. But night time with the lights off is the best. It makes a not too loud or annoying whirrring noise that cues the kitty. I turn it on and Rex is RIGHT there. The mirror is adjustable which is a very good feature for beam direction and setting it on different hight tables or the floor. We both recommend the Bolt Frolicat very highly. It is the best 20 bucks I ever spent.  TODD & REXPS. Dogs can love it too but BEWARE some dogs can get totally obsessed over lasers. TO the point it is a health concern. For more on this check some other Amazon pet laser reviews. I think the Bada Beam has more info on this issue. Also dogs are more smell oriented than cats and a lot of them are totally not interested since light is not smelly. Jack [ J.R.T.] will chase ANYTHING though. So again YMMV. I would check em out with a dollar store laser first.PPS.  Speaking of health concerns. Due to the randomness of the kitty and the laser beam. Occasionally they get it in the eye. I do not think this is a instantly blinding thing unless they stare directly into it for quite a while which is very unlikely. Rex has been playing laser tag for years and still seems to see just fine. And hey I have looked at the sun a bit and I can still see. Any more info on this issue please comment.
