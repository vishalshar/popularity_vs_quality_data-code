I purchased my Leaf and have been using it for two months. It has been a blessing for tracking my sleep (I have sleep apnea) and menstrual cycle. I do like the meditation mode also. I have been using the Activity mode also, but I dance hula & lateral movement doesn't show up. Maybe the Leaf will be able to track that in the future.Many people have complimented me on how pretty it is.I have to say that I accidentally left my Leaf on my blouse & washed it... but much to my surprise, it still works perfectly!I kinda wish the bracelet was bigger...But overall I am extremely happy with the Bellabeat Leaf!
