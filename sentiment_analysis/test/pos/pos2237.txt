The Autel X-Star Premium Drone is an amazing drone and gives the DJI Phantom 3 Advance and Phantom 4 a run for their money but for much less money than a 1500 dollar Phantom 4. The X-Star impressed me with it amazing 4k camera that uses a 12 MP camera to take breathtaking pictures and 4k videos. The gimbal allows for smooth camera scenes and its range is amazing at 1.2 miles. It is also worth to mention that they provide you with extra parts in case something breaks and thats really nice and saves you money from purchasing replacements. It is really easy to start flying this drone as it has many features that allow the user to let the drone take off and land by itself safely. It has cool flying features such as Follow Me, Waypoints, and Orbit to let you make cool videos or take photos. The app is good but could use some work to improve the ease of use. The controller also has many options right on it to make it easy for the user, the build quality of both the controller and the drone is exceptional and feels like a premium product. This drone is also modular which means that you can take parts off such as the camera and in the future buy attachments to your drone to customize to your liking, and it's open source software can help you bypass factory restrictions letting you fly to your liking but also fly responsibly. Overall this products is amazing for its price and matches any premium drone out there in the market!
