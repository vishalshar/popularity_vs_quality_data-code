Having owned two previous laptops I am extremely content with what this product brought to the table. The cpu, gpu, ssd, body, weight all are amazing and of great quality. The only complaints I have is that the metal finish is a magnet for fingerprints, the TouchPad is mediocre at best, and finally a winning feature would to have a backlight keyboard.Otherwise I am content with the product I have received and brag highly to close friends about what great a laptop I have found.
