Purchased the bluesmart suitcase for weekend getaways and it's perfect for that techie person. The laptop sleeve in front is a padded and felt lined sleeve to protect a laptop and or tablet. There's also room in there for chargers and wires. The con of the laptop sleeve is that you sacrifice the internal storage as the sleeve takes up most of the room in the top shell. It is easily unzipped for tsa checks. The overall quality of the case is similar to other hard shell carry on. The built in battery is a plus as you can now sit anywhere in the terminal and not worry about looking for a power outlet. It charges most devices via usb and is super convenient as you no longer need to carry a portable one out or worry about losing it since it's all built in.  The wheels are unique looking with hollow centers/blue accents and although the rubber picks up a lot of dirt, it provides a nice smooth roll. The built in lock is a flap that covers the zippers for fast and easy locking.
