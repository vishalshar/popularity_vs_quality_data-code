I bought one of these earlier in the year to alert me if an alarm sounded while I was away from home. The first one I put upstairs where it could hear all the newly interconnected alarms I had installed, and it also served as a pleasant nightlight (with the color set to red and intensity at its lowest level.)It worked well, but I have an ongoing issue with the feature where, if the service calls you to say an alarm went off (and you agree that's what it was), and it then offers to text you the phone number of your local fire department, the number it sends me is for a Sheriff's office more than a hundred miles away. After it did this the first time, I reported the problem to Leeo support and they promised to fix it. Then several months later it happened again. This time Leeo support said that I was supposed to call 911 and that the feature of texting the phone number could not be relied upon. (They use a third-party service for this, and yes, my address was correctly registered.) The issue I have with calling 911 is that if I'm home I'd just call 911 anyway, and if I'm away (especially if I am outside the US), calling 911 there would not likely do any good. So now I have the local fire department number in my contact list.Recently I bought a non-connected explosive gas detector and also had installed a water leak detector in the basement (Leeo supports these), so I bought a second Leeo and put it in the basement. Works fine there too. So now I'll know if any of the alarms sound when I'm away from home.Leeo can also report, through the app, the temperature and humidity. Perhaps more useful for a second home.Leeo is an easy to install device that works very well as a substitute for expensive "smart" detectors, or limited functionality devices such as Roost Smart 9V Battery for Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Alarms which doesn't fit in some of my detectors (that take AA batteries) and costs almost as much for one as a Leeo does. Leeo is good for your primary home, of course, but it would be even better for second homes or maybe some peace-of-mind for a distant relative.
