I mostly work from home and and ordered CUJO as an added layer of protection for the highly sensitive information I store in devices on my home network. At first, CUJO was not able to identify all my devices but after speaking with someone at their Customer Service it seems to be working well. I have not noticed any drop in my Internet speed, itÂ’s something I'am watching closely. The device itself was easy to set up and looks great in my home. So far, so good.
