product is excellent.  try not to lose it, like we did, and had to replace it.  The small dog system has 15 settings, and are very well spread out.  I can't even feel the first 2 or 3, but the forth one I can, and that's the one we use for the "yellow button" for ours.  The only reason at all for not giving 5 stars, is because it arrived 2 days late.
