My daughter is 3 and she loves this bear but the app is seriously lacking. Only 2 stories and no games. There are two more stories that say they are coming soon. If there is a ETA on when they will be released I would love to know. It is a great toy but needs a more robust stories. She loves reading the two over and over but for the price I think it should have more.
