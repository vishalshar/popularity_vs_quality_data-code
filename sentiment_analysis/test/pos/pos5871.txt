The technology is still new and forthcoming and is improving all of the time. I get motion sickness easily and only had problems on the rollercoaster ride. I like the soft foam of the viewer. It's a great learning tool and resource for those who want to experience something new in a safe place. I think there is high potential as a learning tool.
