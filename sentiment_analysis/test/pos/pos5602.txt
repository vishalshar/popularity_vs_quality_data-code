My five star rating is for the customer support given by Alex. I have an older door opener, an Allister model ARD IIA. It has three terminals, but the gLink has only two wires. I contacted Alex to see which wire to put where. His reply was quick and concise. We attached it to the middle and right terminal, but it did not light up. It did, however, short out the wall switch so it wouldn't work until I disconnected the gLink. Alex asked me to test the gLink with a battery, and it did light up. He then had me sent it back for modifications. The new unit arrived with a third wire for a power supply, which he thought might be the third terminal on the right. I attached it with all three wires, and it did light up. My phone app also found it. When I tapped the door icon in the app, I got the message, "Success!" But the real life door did not move. Again, the wall switch also did not work. Alex tried a few more things, but to no avail. I really wanted this to work, as it would be incredibly convenient. But it was not so. I'm returning it for a refund. Nonetheless, the customer service was top notch. I just happen to have one of those door openers that is not compatible. So if you have an Allister model like mine, I suggest you not get this particular product.
