I actually loved this watch, but the cheap band it came on broke and it got flushed down a toilet. I will probably replace it someday, but invest in a better band. The user interface on the app is fine, and it does everything I wanted it to do. I really miss mine! I just can't give 5 stars because of the cheap silicone band.
