I have an avid young football player in the family, but he is rough on gloves and other equipment. We thought we would try this grip boost but have tried others with little to know results. So based on the price, we thought we would give this a try. WOW! It does work. Not only did it dry fast, and leave no tacky residue, it helped to restore the glove back to the original grip feel. The best part is you don't need very much at all. This small 2oz bottle will go a very long way and could last you several seasons. Know I am not an expert in football or the products that go with it, but I am looking as a mom for products that would help extend the life of our equipment and that would help my son be more successful. Well, this is an excellent' product that I highly recommend for those of you needing a new grip boost.
