These are delicious! Yes, they're very expensive, but as an avid vegetable gardener, I can appreciate just how labor intensive this product is.  And, yes, they're very delicate, but that's an inevitable outcome after desiccating a paper thin leaf.  I just enjoy the large pieces that have survived intact by eating them by hand, and then I eat the remaining crumbs with a spoon.  It's all good, no matter how you consume this healthy snack!
