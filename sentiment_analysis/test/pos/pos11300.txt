My cat goes nuts over this freeze-dried turkey.  She even ripped the very sturdy package to help herself to more.  I can now give her a special treat without feeling like I'm giving her junk food.  Cats are obligate carnivores and shouldn't eat grain; it's unnatural for them.  The chicken treats of the same brand are just as much of a favorite.
