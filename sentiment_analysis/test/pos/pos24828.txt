My cat has terrible dermatitis. It's so bad, she has to regularly get steroid shots. I've taken her to multiple vets to figure out the problem, and there seems to be no underlying issues. They all just say she has sensitive skin or an allergy that's not food related. I've started adding this supplement to her food, and all the itchy bumps are gone! Her coat is also really soft. Even friends who've visited have commented on how soft she is. I expected this to be one more product I tried that didn't work, but I'm so happy, and so is my cat! Side note: it took about 2 weeks for all the bumps to go away, but I noticed new ones weren't appearing after only a few days.
