Fun stuff, but a lot of money for a very small amount of product.  The product is intriguing and does a lot of handy things, but it's so expensive that you want to think it through several times before committing this sugar-pack size of moldable glue to a project, because it becomes an investment! Having said that, it really does some interesting things and this kit comes with several little projects you can use the four envelopes of Sugru for - pretty handy stuff!  But, as I said, waaaaaaaay overpriced for any kind of regular use.  Kind of like a useful novelty toy.
