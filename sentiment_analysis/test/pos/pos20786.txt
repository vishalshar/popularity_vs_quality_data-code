Stumbled upon this while looking for non-plastic bags to use to get veggies at the store. Decided to give it a try. My husband has salad for lunch most days; I can't say how many greens we've tossed because even in the containers they've gone bad - they get damper and damper, and wilt, and have to be tossed, especially if for some reason he skips a day or two.So far, the paper works great! I just bought some more packages to have on hand. He's happy, I'm happy, the budget is happy!
