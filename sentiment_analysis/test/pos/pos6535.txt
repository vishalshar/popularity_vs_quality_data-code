I LOVE this drone.  Flying is easy - "Avatar" mode flies with just a wave of your hand using your phone, "Waypoints" mode is just a click and tap on the map overlay for autonomous flight.  The build quality feels on par with a DJI Phantom (this is no toy drone).I experienced about 20-22 minutes of flight per charge (and I always landed it with 5+% battery left), was able to learn how to fly it in minutes, and experienced only one glitch during several flights.The one glitch I had was when the drone was about 1300 ft way at about 250 ft in elevation and I had to click the new waypoint location 3 times to get it to respond.  The drone hovered perfectly in place and then headed where I wanted on the 3rd click - took a total of a few seconds.  But, for a sec, I imagined the drone flying off, never to be seen again... lol. It didn't, whew.The GPS is accurate to within a foot or so.  When in hover hold mode it will move maybe a foot up/down and a few inches to the sides at most.  It's impressive.This drone works in "headless" mode at all times.  This means no matter what way the drone is facing, when you pull the "controls" (move your phone or use the virtual joy stick) toward you, the drone moves toward you.  This makes flying way easier, you don't have to worry about orientation.The gimbal performs well.  I posted a review on it's page here: Ehang GHOSTDRONE 2.0 Gimbal, Black.  It's smooth during operation and keeps your shots PERFECTLY steady.Please check out the video, here's the lineup: Unboxing, prop installation, pairing and setting up the app, flight controls, and some footage shot using the Ehang 4K camera (EHANG 4K Sports Camera.The video is a bit long, if you want to cut to a specific part, the times are listed below.Unboxing: at the beginningPropeller installation: 8:00Setting up the app & Pairing the GBox/phone/drone (android): 10:10Calibration: 12:43Flight Modes and app controls: 14:03  (I REALLY wish I could of done more with this, but the weather wasn't cooperating and had to do it inside)Example flight footage: 19:09FPV Monitor shown in the beginning of the example flight footage is the: Hobbytree RX-LCD5802 5.8G 7inch LCD Diversity Receiver Monitor for PFV RC. It works great and I recommend it.  I HIGHLY recommend you use a monitor or the Ehang GHOSTDRONE 2.0 VR Goggles.  If you're flying alone you'll want a monitor, if you have a "cameraman" the goggles are awesome.  I'll post a review on them shortly.There are a couple cons: 1. you can't easily do a circular type ariel shot (ie pointing at you while flying around in a circle), 2 you can't control more than one element on the screen of the app at once (ie adjusting the elevation slider AND moving the camera gimbal slider at the same time).  3. "Follow Me" mode is glitchy when you slow down, it tends to overshoot you a bit.  These are minor and I know Ehang is working on the circular shot thing now and will hopefully address the multi-touch and follow me issues.I received a sample for my honest and unbiased review.  I've flown many drones and this is by FAR the easiest to fly (accurately) out of the box I've tried.  Please feel free to ask any questions you have in the comments below.
