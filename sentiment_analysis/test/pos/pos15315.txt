This thing is really quite amazing.  When you first get it, the back will feel a little tacky, but after a couple of days that dies down (presumably because it has picked up some dust, etc.).  The flat-out amazing thing is that the case continues to stick just as well after the tackiness dies down (hence their claim that it sticks without being sticky, I guess)!I don't really take selfies in general, but this is great for watching my Netflix hands-free, putting my phone someplace I can see the screen while working on something with both hands, etc.Now, there is one thing that I will warn about.  I didn't even _think_ about the times when I actually might not want my phone to stick until it started sticking to things I hadn't intended!  I'd definitely recommend this case, but you might want to consider how you currently use your phone and plan to keep some post-its or scraps of paper you could use to cover up the back of your case when you need to put your phone someplace you don't want it to stick...  Nothing against the product, this is just saying it works better than you might expect :)
