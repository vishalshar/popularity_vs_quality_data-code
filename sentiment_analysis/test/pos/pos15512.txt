Our family has been big Skeeter fans since we first discovered them this year.  The cookies are delicious and we feel safe giving them to our son, who is allergic to peanuts and tree nuts.  We just ordered the Skeeter chocolate chip minis for the first time and they are so addicting!  They melt in your mouth and you can't eat just one.  They also make a great topping on ice-cream!
