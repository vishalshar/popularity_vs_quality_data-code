It's a very neat little gadget. I bought it just because its something I've been interested in for the longest time. I've used it for cooking and other stuff. It would be very useful for either night navigation camping, looking at your furnace or AC to see hot spots.The Device: The resolution is decent for the price, it's certainly not a high-def picture. The field of view/zoom takes a little time to get used to, and since the actual sensor is offset from the center of the iPhone it can be a little confusing when trying to point the camera at something. The lightning connector is close to the device and if you have a large protective case you will have to get an adapter/extender or remove the case.The app: It could use a bit of work, its a little clunky and finding all of the settings takes sometime. I think they could do a lot better and look forward to some improvements.
