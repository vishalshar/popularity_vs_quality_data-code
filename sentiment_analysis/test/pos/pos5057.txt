I'm not a cyclist, but I got this bottle since I was tired of my aluminum bottle, which held 30oz and was impossible to scrub out properly.  The clean bottle, on the other hand, is incredibly convenient in this regard.  I've been using the it for some time now and the bottle has held up very well -- no dents or scratches like the aluminum one.  Even when the caps are screwed on tightly though, I've found that the bottle will still leak a bit if it's very full. This is mildly annoying, but easy enough to prevent by not filling it up to the brim.  Also, while the bottle is made with cycling in mind, it would still be nice to have other bottle sizes or top shapes available as an option.  I do love that it's durable and easy to keep clean though, so I would recommend the clean bottle even as an everyday water bottle.
