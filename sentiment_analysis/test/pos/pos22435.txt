***EDITED AFTER WHISTLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT CONTACTED ME***Within an hour of posting my review below, Whistle support reached out to me let me know they would be sending out a replacement tracker for free, and also included another months subscription for free. As I said in the earlier review, customer service has been really good at resolving the minor hiccups I had encountered in the past. Now I am really impressed with them. I'm still nervous with the fact that the tracker was able to separate from the collar  attachment so easily. Personally, I will add some sort of lanyard to retain the tracker if this happens again. But I must admit, Whistle customer service is probably the best I've encountered with a product. Phone calls are always promptly answered by someone in the US, and they are very helpful at resolving any issues. I'm changing the rating from 1 star to 4, simply because of their customer service. It would have been 5 stars, but I do think the product still needs some work. Better retention of the tracker to the collar, and it would be nice to if there was a function to make the tracker emit a noise. I have seen this feature on a couple of other GPS trackers.***ORIGINAL REVIEW***I bought this product for a new pet, back in April of this year. It had a couple of hiccups along the way, but these were easily resolved by contacting customer service. But a couple of days ago, our dog got through our fence and into woods by our house. I immediately activated the tracker unit by the app. It led me to an area of brush, but I could hear Alfie, our dog barking and whimpering in the distant. I went further, calling him until he appeared. Somehow the tracking unit had come off the collar attachment. It was attached for about a week, so it  wasn't as if it had been attached incorrectly.So here it is. I contacted customer service to see if anything could be done. A nice feature would be to have the ability to make the tracker emit a sound. My wife and I have spent multiple hours in the area where the tracker reported itself, searching to no avail. Now the battery is dead and we can't find it. Customer service did tell me a nice story about another gentleman who lost his tracker. Apparently a squirrel had grabbed it and taken it to its nest up a tree. Are you kidding me? Who would be looking up a tree for a tracker that came loose from their dogs tracker? I mean, maybe I'm missing something, but I've never seen a dog climb a tree before, so why would you climb a tree and look in a squirrel's  nest? All you have is GPS coordinates so surely you would confine yourself to looking on the ground. I had the feeling someone was blowing smoke where it wasn't wanted.So my issue really is that the one time we needed the tracker to work for us, it failed miserably. Luckily Alfie came back to the sound of me calling him. The tracker should be attached to the collar with a better system that won't fail and allow it to become detached. So I guess my next move is to cancel the connection and look for a better alternative to the Whistle product.  I would advise anyone who is buying this product or has bought one, to maybe attach the unit to the collar with a backup lanyard or something, so if it does become detached, at least it will stay with their pet.
