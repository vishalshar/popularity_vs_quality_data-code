This is probably the coolest tech I have in my possession. The tactile feedback when I have the device on is just superb when im listening to my music or even playing any of my video games, i was surprised how much low frequencies my digital media had that none of my headphones picked up. If you have the money and want to try something new to enhance your auditory experience then this is something to believe in. I personally haven't tested how long the battery lasts on the highest sensitivity but when the dial is at noon its plenty powerful and definitely amazing. almost like a massage at times as well.
