Very nice!  I've been using alternative deodorants for years.  They have worked *OK*.  I used the Thai Crystal spray, which initially caused irritation similar to what other reviewers mentioned when initially using Primal Pit Paste.  At that time, I didn't know it was a pH issue.  I also have used EO spray, and while they both sort of worked, I found I had to use them in combination to stay stink-free and dry.  It got pricey as I was purchasing them BOTH on a monthly basis.  Although this is pricey, as deodorant goes, I can see that it will last longer than than the sprays.As for how this works:  I could not be happier.  It works just as well as or better than "traditional" deodorant.  Though this is not an antiperspirant, it seems to keep me from sweating just as well as "traditional" deodorant/antiperspirant.  After just a few days using it, I have noticed that my armpits are softer and smoother and it makes shaving so easy!  No more armpit razor burn!  Yay!  The smell is lovely, however as other reviewers stated, it doesn't last all that long.  I'm not bothered by that as I like wearing scented lotions and perfume.  This definitely will not compete with any lotion or perfume.  I highly recommend for anyone searching for an alternative deodorant that works as well as a traditional one.  I'm a happy customer and will definitely purchase again!
