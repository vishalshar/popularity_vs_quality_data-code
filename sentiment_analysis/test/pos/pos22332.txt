I have had this for over a year and had no problems. It works as advertised and is a bargain at this price. It has an app for your phone to monitor your pet's location. It's been in and out of water with no problems. The battery lasts at least a week depending on how much time you spend away from home base. No problems with it falling off the collar like another similar device I used previously. I bought it for a lot more money and I still think it was worth it. I also love getting the automatic texts telling me how much exercise my dog is getting everyday.
