I am not a paid reviewer, I am a very fortunate man who has survived a tough type of cancer.  It required alot of chemo and steroid treatments.. The residual damage...five years later my arms look like they had been in the worlds worst tattoo parlor.  I am providing pictures of when I first started using this product.  I live in Stillwater and just by Gods wink came into contact with a person who was writing newsarticle on the company in Oklahoma who makes Meta derm.  I purchased my first tube and did not put it on like I should have.. The summer has been brutal to my arms. I wear kevlar sleeves outdoors and still get cuts and brusies.  I am very impressed with using the product as directed over a three week period and the difference in my arms.  I even wore a short sleeve shirt to church yesterday.  People this is really working for me.. Take a look at the pictures and all I am doing is trying to help others who are fighting thin skin problems... or chemo related problems... This company has an exceptional customer relationship team attitude...  last picture is taken todayi!
