Seems to work well. It would be good to be able to adjust the distance to a shorter "leash" between your phone and the Ditto. Or change the 30 second delay from when the Bluetooth signal is lost to around ten seconds. Otherwise, this is a good convenient product that serves it's intended purpose well.
