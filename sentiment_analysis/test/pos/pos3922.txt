Update:  This is still a fantastic food, but no longer available with Prime shipping.  We now order through Chewy.com.This food is outstanding. Dogs have great coats, plenty of stamina, and it put some weight on my Setter, who is a hard keeper.  Recovery time after a couple days of hard running, or hunting, is much better than the previous food we were using.
