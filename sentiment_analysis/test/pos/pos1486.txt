I got this mushroom kit hoping it would grow well. It seemed almost too simple, and there is a catch. YOU HAVE TO SOAK the mushroom bag (after cutting open the side) for 24 hrs before you start misting regularly.It did take about 10 days to start growing, at first it just looked like larger of the white stuff, but it really did double in size every day after that.They were coming out very well, but on about the 5th day(after starting to grow), they stopped growing. 6th day, they started feeling slightly hard and drying out. I tried to mist them more often than the 2x a day recommended, but they continued drying out, and had completely stopped growing.I tried soaking them, hoping it would help, but they are dead.We didn't get to eat them, or see them full size, but it was pretty interesting to see them growing. I probably wouldn't try growing them again, until I found a way to keep the room more humid (Arizona, no humidity in the air). Oyster mushrooms are almost as expensive per pound as the kit is supposed to generate (1.5 lbs 2-5x, so 3-6lbs of mushrooms potentially), so it could have been cheaper than buying them.So I would recommend these if you live somewhere humid, or have some way to keep decent humidity in the room, but not if you live in a dry region.
