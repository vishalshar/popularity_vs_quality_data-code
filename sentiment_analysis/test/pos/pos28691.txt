Like many multi-sport athletes I love to be able to view my metrics and this provides and exceptional array of them. Syncing with the app for my phone was very easy, as was attaching it to my running shoes and it worked well for the first few runs.  The issue I have is that it does not attach securely enough to the shoelaces, which caused mine to come off during a 5k and I unfortunately didn't discover this until I went to sync it up in the car.  Whether this was a one time issue or a design flaw I don't know, all I know the bottom plastic piece that sits under the shoelaces remained in place but appeared to be stripped where the pod itself locked on.  I would absolutely give it 5 stars for the information provided from each run but 1 star for the design.******UPDATE******- The crew from Milestone were awesome and took care of the issue for me. Since that time I have used it numerous times and LOVE IT!  The metrics help point out form issues and the key is to gradually make changes, instead of making  large sweeping change, so you can avoid injury. I have updated my rating accordingly.
