I'm extremely happy with this watch. It does everything I wanted it to do. Notifications work great (I'm on android), watch faces are neat, the display is very clear, and the battery lasted five days even with constant messing around. It seems very durable, but it's also cheap enough that I don't stress out wearing it.
