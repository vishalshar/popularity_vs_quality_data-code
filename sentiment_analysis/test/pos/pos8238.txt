I am OCD about one thing, and that's my pockets. I hate having clutter in my pockets, and keys have always been a struggle. This product has been great though, it's very high quality, I've been using it for a few months now and the leather is showing no irreparable wear. My only (obvious) issue is that it makes for an extra step when pulling my keys out when I get home. I've gotten pretty good at flipping through for the right key, but I'll never be as fast as when they were loose on a key ring. Totally worth the sacrifice though.
