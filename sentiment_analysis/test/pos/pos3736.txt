I got sick of always breaking those apple cables they give you when you buy the phone so I wanted a cord that won't break as easily and I found this on youtube and wow I am so happy I bought it, I don't even think I could break this if I tried, I am more than willing to lend people my cord when they ask because I know they won't break it. Basically, I give this a 10/10 and recommend this to all who are sick of breaking their charger.
