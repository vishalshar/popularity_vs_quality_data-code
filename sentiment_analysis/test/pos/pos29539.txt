This kit is great for teaching young ones basic concepts of electricity, how simple components operate and how they be used together to produce interesting functions.  The premium kit contains enough components to really get creative and quickly go beyond the suggested ideas that are illustrated in the accompanying manual.The single biggest frustration that we have faced is the tendency of the components to come apart easily and we have found ourselves occasionally using tape to hold the pieces together.
