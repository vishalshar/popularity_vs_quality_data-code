Great battery capacity and design and overall feel. I would say this could charge my iPhone 6s Plus about 5 times fully without having to recharge it. The downside is the fact that I work and live where my windows are tinted and it filters the actual UV and direct sunlight needed to activate the solar charging abilities. Otherwise, great product to use for emergencies and road trips/camping trips or traveling abroad.
