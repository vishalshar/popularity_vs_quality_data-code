I purchased these to use mostly when training and they are great. Earphones remain seated and my ears do not hurt. I completed a triathlon test last week and after my swim, I inserted these and then completed a 2 hour cycle and then a 45 minute run. No problems at all and sound quality was good enough for what I required. I tried many different earphones including denon, skullcandy, jabra sport, sony, apple, wireless, etc and all of them would result in my left ear piece falling out after 20 or so minutes and after about an hour my ears would start paining. No problem with my Decibullz! Great Product!
