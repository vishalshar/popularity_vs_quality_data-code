This device works exactly as advertised.  I occasionally have episodes of atrial fibrillation.  I can usually tell when that is happening, but am never sure.  This quickly does an EKG, and it telly you if you are in afib,  The first time you use it you have to wait for their doctor to email you before you can use it again, but that is a one time thing.  Once you get that first report back you can use it as often as you like.  It saves the results each time so you can examine them or email them to your doctor for analysis.  You can also email the results to their doctor for analysis for a fee.  My only complaint is that the app won't run on my iPad.  It works fine on my iPhone 6s Plus.
