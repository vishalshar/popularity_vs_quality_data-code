The LensShifter consists of a four-inch plastic rod and an elastic band.  You place the elastic band around the lens' focusing ring and twist the plastic rod to secure it around the lens.  This is a super easy and quick process that ensures that the LensShifter fits snugly on your camera.The LensShifter acts as a lever to make focusing easier and arguably more accurate.  In practice, it worked beautifully when my camera was secured on a tripod.  The LensShifter allowed me to change focus from the foreground to background and vice versa with little effort.  A great part of the LenShifter's design is a counterweight that is on the elastic band that ensures that the weight of the LensShifter doesn't accidentially change your focus even when the camera is left unattended.My feelings were more mixed when using the LensShifter without a tripod.  When using a lighter lens, it's relatively easy to hold your camera with your dominant hand and then manipulate the LensShifter with your other hand.  However, the LensShifter is more difficult to use when you're using your non-dominant hand as a base for the camera.  I tend to use this type of camera grip, and I found that with this grip I had to loosen and reposition the LensShifter often.I'm still giving the LensShifter Five Stars, because for $25 it's such a great value.  It's one of those gadgets that will make your life so much easier in many scenarios, and although it's not perfect for all situations I think this was still a good buy.  It's also small enough so you can take it anywhere without even thinking about it.
