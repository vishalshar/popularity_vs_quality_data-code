I've only been using them less than a month but so far, so good.  Beats having to re-tie shoelaces that have been lollygagging in dirt, mud, slug trails, etc.  When putting on Hickies-equipped shoes I sometimes use a 24" long shoehorn in reverse to keep the shoe's tongue from wash-boarding up, which it tends to do when Hickies are installed in the upper shoelace holes.
