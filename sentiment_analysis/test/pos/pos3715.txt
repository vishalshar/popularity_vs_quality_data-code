I hate lto write a bad review but  to to tell the truth nothing has happened. No mushrooms have ventured forth despite my following the instructions given exactly. I am still putting the tablespoon of water on the mixture just in case,but it has been a while.I received a second "mini farm" and to my delight I now have mushrooms. I left the second one in my house on a windowsill. The one that dint produce mushrooms I had in my greenhouse. Maybe it was too warm for it. I have altered my stars from one to five.
