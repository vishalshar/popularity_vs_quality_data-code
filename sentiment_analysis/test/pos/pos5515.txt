This scarf actually warms up quite a bit! Sometimes I have to turn it down because it works so well. The scarf uses a 4500 mAh that feels and looks like it's well made. I had concerns about it potentially overheating when the scarf is on max power. It gets warm but nothing to be alarmed about, plus the warmness of the battery is nice because of the added heat. The charge time isnt too bad, a few hours maybe? I didn't time it but it wasnt bad at all. The scarf has a little hidden pocket that you put the battery in and plug it in. There's also an extra pocket on the other side for an extra battery that you can order from the manufacturer website.There are 3 levels of heatGets Super Warm on the highest level,Fleece is really good qualityStitching is good qualityNot heavy at all even with the batteryOverall really impressed with this product. I was actually half expecting it to not work well, but it has been a pleasant surprise. Everyone I show it to wants one for their own. I'm ordering another one for my girlfriend because she constantly takes mine.
