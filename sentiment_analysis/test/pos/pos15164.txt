I bought the Novi kit ( 1 relay base station and 1 sensor ) the first week available on Amazon, Novi is still enhancing the Novi Phone App, I emailed support and quickly downloaded the Android Google Play Novi App into my phone, followed the Novi Phone App's instructions, plugged in power and router ethernet cable into Novi base station, removed paper under 1 battery of Novi base station giving the Novi base station backup power, removed paper under 1 battery of Novi sensor giving power to the Novi sensor, entered into the Novi Phone App my devices UID identification #'s, the Novi App then updated the firmware of the relay base station in 10 minutes ( + - ), Novi system is working nice, smooth, within the Novi Phone App I set my phone as a backup to receive text messages of alarms with zero ( time to wait ) after alarm triggered and email sent, I have the standard cable plan with average 10-15MB download, ( 1MB upload - -> which is what the Novi base station uses to send email notifications, phone text notifications and phone App picture images ), I activated the Novi App alarm, moved my arm and the Novi sensor took pictures, wirelessly transmitted the pictures to the Novi base station, transmitted the pictures using my 1MB upload internet and received email and text notifications in a few seconds on my phone, pictures then appeared on my phone App where I then selected to turn the alarm on, then selected to turn the alarm off, I selected to take additional pictures which again appeared within the phone App, I cancelled the alert and did not select to notify the police, I work in IT, I understand programming difficulty and patience in getting logic and communications working properly, I have been following this product for 1.5 years and knew this was a good product, I emailed a few questions in the past to Novi and always received a quick response
