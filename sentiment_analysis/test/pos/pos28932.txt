This case is not just any case. It's a brand new way of life. Before this one, I rarely used a case. That has caused me to break many phones in the past. This is the second Rokform case I've owned, and I don't want to take it off.The magnet is very strong. Stays on my dash with no problem. The only issue I had was with the provided 3M adhesive. It didn't stick very well. This could be because I tried to wiggle it around too soon, but either way I needed a new solution. I used some 2-sided foam tape, and that did the trick.I don't often use any of the accessories, because they're kind of bulky, and doesn't seem natural. The belt/pocket clip is cumbersome when not attached to your pants, and when you detach the slip from the case, your phone gets covered in pocket lint in the opening.I'll definitely buy again when the iPhone 7 comes out.
