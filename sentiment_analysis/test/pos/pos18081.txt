I purchased this on October 19, 2015 and was really loving it until recently as it now disconnects/reconnects randomly..The transfer speeds have been excellent. The unit does warm up a bit if transferring large amounts of data but hasn't become hot enough that I was worried about damage. and I only use this 1-2 times per week for data transfer to another computer.  This being said about 2 weeks ago the drive began to disconnect/reconnect, and sometimes I need to physically unplug/replug it in, and this can happen even when the unit hasn't been used yet so not even warm (I do not leave this plugged in, only use it when I need to).  I have tried alternate USB3 cables and this is still occurring.  I have also plugged this into both powered & not ports - no difference (only did this after the issues began, there was no need to try this method before)I am now attempting a 10gb transfer as it has reconnected (without physically unplugging)....  averaging 107mb and it worked this time.  Yeah!  Except that this doesn't happen regularly.  I was originally going to rate this with 5 Stars but for now I give it 2 Stars.For now I would not recommend this unit because it has become a PITA.  Very impressed with the transfer speeds though...EDIT:  12/11/2015It has continued to disconnect repeatedly, sometimes over & over (a short while ago it just kept doing this until I unplugged it finally).  I have also tried using the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0C4M5M?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01 that another reviewer recommended but this also doesn't work anymore (the Ugreen works, just not the SSD) so it seems that the SSD is the issue.  Originally the only time I supplied additional power was when using this with my android mobile & tablet, though not necessary - well, not entirely true.  I decided to use a powered hub because I was transferring small vids (most under 200MB or smaller) but still wanted to save my android battery life.  As I mentioned during my first review I've only been using this a couple of times per week, and now only once per week.  As it is too late to RMA (over 30 days) I expect that I will need to contact MyDigitalSSD.com myself, although I may give Amazon a try just in case they can expedite something.EDIT 01.20.2016Deleted some stuff to save space and eliminate unneeded babble.  After emails/this & that I have received a replacement which seems to be working 100% at least on the 4 computers I've tested it on (both USB 2 & 3).  I'll need to give it 4-6 weeks to make sure the issues from the previous unit don't appear again.  Thanks to Douglass @ MyDigital for his awesome assistance.
