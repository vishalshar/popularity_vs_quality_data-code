I must say it is so nice when a product works as advertised and does exactly what it is meant to do.  While I am sure there are several more thrills the developers could package into these sensors I love the fact i am getting exactly what I expected.  I have read every review on this product and am dumbfounded at the number of folks that were not able to get the sensors to pair with their phones, a simple reach out to the customer service team most likely would have resolved the issue.  I have a Galaxy S5 and must say the pairing process took less then 3 minutes once they were installed on each tire and most of that was downloading the app, you literally open the app, tap the sensor and BOOM..... they are paired.  Watch YouTube videos as well, those will give you an idea of what to expect if you are on the fence, helped push me toward purchasing them as I was most worried about the valve stem and general install.I highly recommend this for anyone that is even remotely worried about tire pressure.  Nothing would suck more then to be in the middle of the ride only to realize the problem could have been solved by simply adding a little air to your tire before leaving.  While the sensors may be a bit big for my taste you get used to them and they even add a little flare to the rims depending on if you get black or silver.Great customer support, emails where answered within 24hrs or less with general UI questions I had with the app and custom setup.All in All great product and will look to purchase more for my trailer as well.
