I got this for my new 5mo Standard Poodle puppy as we were taking him on a road trip and didn't want to take a chance on losing him in unfamiliar territory.  I initially had difficulty activating the tracker.  I think the activation instructions could be a little clearer as well as a description of how it works with cellular technology. So I called their Customer Support and got connected with Shannie O. who was terrific.  She worked with me step by step until we got it working and then followed up with me after I left on my trip.  I have been testing it every day on the road and am very pleased with its accuracy and the notices (text and email) it sends me when our puppy leaves the "Whistle" zone (an imaginary bubble that the user sets around the base station that alerts you when he leaves).  It sends pretty accurate tracking notices every three minutes including the street address where he is.  All in all, it is definitely worth the small monthly tracking expense to keep him safe.
