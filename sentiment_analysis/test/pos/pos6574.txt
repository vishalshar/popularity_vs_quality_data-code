Sound quality is good and the bluetooth works well. Product quality is ok and looks fun. However, the online product details do not state that the device is splash proof and not water-resistant, which means that it cannot be exposed to water. I was disappointed in this, seeing as it's advertised for use in the shower. Also, it's recommended that the device not be stored on the wall as it'll drop and risk becoming damaged.
