I have PCOS.  I got my miracle baby 15 months ago (after trying for 6 years), but my husband and I wanted to try for one more before I got too old.  My periods were 60-70 days apart prior to taking this, so I was working with next to nothing.  Someone I know suggested I try it, so I gave it a shot.  I'm not sure if this is what did it or not, but after one month of taking this and Vitex, I'm pregnant.  I would say if you are having trouble trying to conceive then it surely wouldn't hurt to try this.
