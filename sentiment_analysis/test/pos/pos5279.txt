The machine itself came with a slight issue(I can still print).  One call to tech support and I have a free part on the way.  Robo is willing to help in more ways than I can think of.  If you have any doubts please just ask!  Amazing printer for the money and you can't buy customer service like theirs !  Where is the option to add more stars !?!?!?  I'm new to printing and here is an example of what the robo can do (see pictures).  Easy to learn software, great product, can't wait to buy another robo
