Hope she never has to use this but I have a kid who hikes long wilderness trails and reported a surprise encounter with a moose - and another kid in a high risk job.  I like how small this is and the fact you can turn it off.  Easy access would be key to making use of this alarm.  I have not heard the sound yet and hope I never do!
