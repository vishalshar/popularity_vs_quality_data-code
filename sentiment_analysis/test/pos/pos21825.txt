I can't say enough good things about this device. Gone of the days of handing out keys! True story... 2 hours after I installed the lock and the August Connect, I was over at a friends house. A relative called me and urgently needed to retrieve a set of his door keys that he had accidentally left at my house. I was able to unlock the door while being away from my home, and lock it back after he left. Quite amazing... And the irony of the situation does not escape me. It is not cheap, but it is an amazing product.
