My husband and I both gave up sugar over 2 years ago and we used Stevia and "natural cane sugars." Then we heard about xylitol and how much better it is for you. We purchased xylitol at health food stores at a high price but we wanted nothing to do with sugar. Then I saw it on Amazon for a much better price and have purchased it from then on.  Unbeknownst to us, we soon found out there are different types of xylitol...most of which are made from corn. Researchers say the best source of xylitol is from birch. Morning Prep is 100% birch and we cannot find it anywhere else.  It's even better when it's on sale too!  We highly recommend this product!!!
