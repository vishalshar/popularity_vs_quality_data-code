We purchased the Robocopp SOS Personal Alarm as a gift for a neighbor's daughter headed to college. We were looking for a practical gift and liked the idea of having a safety device that she can carry anywhere. She tried the device before she left to get comfortable with it and it really does emit an ear-piercing sound that will hopefully make a person with ill-intentions think twice. It's small enough for her to carry in her pocket or attach to her purse or bookbag. Her parents appreciated the extra sense of security as well. This is a good item to have and hopefully never need to use!
