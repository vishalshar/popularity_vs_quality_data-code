I got a recommendation for the Quad Lock from a Harley rider. I looked at it and if it can securely handle a phone on a mountain bike, it should do just fine for my street bike. And I was correct, it has been a great addition on my Zero S. The Zero has a mobile app that lets the phone act as a secondary instrument cluster and the Quad Lock lets me glance down and see the data I need with no trouble.I don't have an iPhone, so I bought a clear case Nexus 5 Case - Ringke FUSION Case [Free HD Film/Drop Protection][BLACK] Shock Absorption Bumper Premium Hard Case for Google Nexus 5 - Eco/DIY Package and attached one of the Quad Lock Universal Adapter for All Quad Lock Equipped Devices - Black to the back of it. The 3M tape has been rock solid and the phone doesn't even jiggle. The included o-rings work great to keep the Quad Lock attached to the handlebars. I added the zip ties after I was happy with the positioning.Due to the windscreen mounting on my Zero, I had to put the Quad Lock near the left grip. It's just barely high enough so that the phone clears the controls in landscape mode (which is the only orientation for the instrument view). In portrait mode, there's plenty of clearance.I'm quite pleased with how this all turned out.
