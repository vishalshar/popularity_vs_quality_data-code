This is a very solid battery pack. The case is made of metal and the USB and Lighting cords feel like they are good quality.  I ordered the Lighting Cable version and that is exactly what I received.  Disregard those other reviews that claim they ordered Lighting and got microUSB or needed an adapter.  The product description is correct and accurate: LinearFlux Portable Charger for APPLE.This battery charges my iPhone 6S Plus a total of 20% in under 30 minutes. I think they claim one-percent per minute and that's close enough for me.  The biggest selling point of this item is that the dimensions are exactly what are advertised:  it is the length and width of a credit card and as thick as 5 (and that's being conservative).  There are other products out there that claim to be the same size as a credit card but are actually bigger and will not fit in a wallet slot.  The LinearFlux fits in a regular card slot, it fits in the bill compartment and even behind my ID.  The only feature missing is that unlike this products newer big brother, the LinearFlux Pro, this one will not double as a sync cable.  Not a big deal.  And the Pro is like twice as thick and I feel would be too big for a true wallet-size charger. Oh and I almost forgot, the sticky rubber pad is super handy for sticking the battery pack to the back of the phone while it is charging.  A nice and thoughtful touch from a great product.The last thing I have to say is that I emailed LinearFlux with a question and I got a prompt response from a knowledgeable person with an accurate answer to my question.  This is a premium product and worth every penny. I did not receive any discount or compensation in exchange for this review as has unfortunately become common here on Amazon with companies offering free product in exchange for a review.
