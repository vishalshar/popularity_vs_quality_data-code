If I could give this thing 10 stars I would. I've had it for about 3 days and it is a stone cold rat killing machine. 1st and foremost, I keep my unit outside on top of my fence which is adjacent to my neighbors mango tree. I built a custom outdoor wooden shelter and I measured the overhangs so that it would provide enough protection from the elements but still be wide open on both sides. I live in South Florida but I only put the unit outside at night.2 Things are crucial to making any of these things work. It needs to stay clean and dry inside. I let the rats have 2 free meals and they left a ton of droppings on the front of my custom raticator shelter. Now, I can't stop killing rats. They are coming back over and over. Im killing 2 per night. I highly recommend this product
