Best headset I have ever tried. Battery lasts a long time, sound quality is great, mic quality is great. I even was able to talk to someone with the headset via desktop and listen to my game on console and vice versa simply because of the optical port functionality. Pretty comfortable aswell. Just make sure when setting it up with a home console to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST. Your ears will thank me. haha
