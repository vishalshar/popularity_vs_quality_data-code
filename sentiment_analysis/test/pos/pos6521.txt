I am a big fan of these products having bought one for my Macbook Air. However, Acme appears to have added a manufacturers label under the strap. Every time you pull back the strap it pops out spoiling the elegant design. Since it is sewn into the base of the strap there appears to be no easy way to remove it with a jagged cut or damaging the strap. For such an elegant and well designed product, this is Very tacky. It could have been put out of the way on the inside. I knocking what should have 5 stars to 4 stars just for that.
