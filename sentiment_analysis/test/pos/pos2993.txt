I have an 8 month old pup and I only feed him dry food. Lately, he doesn't seem so interested in his food anymore. There would be days that he would not even touch his breakfast until dinner time. I bought the Clear Conscience Pet Super Gravy and he did not want anything to do with it so that went in the garbage. I gave this a try and he loves it! He immediately eats as soon as I put his bowl down. I put a teaspoon full of the mix in his bowl, put 3-4 teaspoons of warm water and mix it a little bit & then add his dry food and mix again. Every time I prepare his meal, he patiently sits beside me waiting for his delicious food to be served. This is good stuff and I highly recommend for picky eaters.
