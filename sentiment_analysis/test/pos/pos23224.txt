I purchased this feeder when I was traveling for work out of country!And now after 1 year I'm using it every day, happily.It's amazing how simple it is to make sure your pet has food at the exact same time every day, or at the time that you want them to be fed, and you can watch them eat, or have the angle of the feeder in a way that during the day you can check on them and watch them play with their toys!It's amazing, I absolutely love it.Every night, my cat would wake me up to feed him, it was not fun, if you're a cat owner you know the story! Till I started using this feeder, at 3 am, he gets his food and I get my sleep! I even record my voice on the feeder so right when it wants to feed him it plays my voice which is very cool.Also, at lunch meeting, you can show your cat LIVE to your workers, how cool is that heheh : )It also has 6 sections, and if you're traveling you can just feel it anyway you like and be sure he gets fresh food.Good luck.
