The idea of using the side of the pencil tip to shade/render was brilliant. None of the other styluses I tried could do that because there's no Tilt.Paper has been a great app for me to take notes and sketch. Except for one thing, writing is really hard with a fat rubber tip.For Sketchbook Pro, Procreate, Concepts or Adobe Sketch, I usually use adobe Ink or Adonit Touch. But the latency has been a big problem, especially when sketching, when I need to make quick, clean lines. And the line I draw tends to have misalignment with the stylus tip.Then Apple Pencil changed everything, there's still some latency, but barely noticeable. Palm rejection is significantly better. And it has pressure sensitivity and Tilt.I still use my 53 Pencil when I sketch or take notes in Paper. I've always wondered how the tip works when shading sideways. And now the tip finally wore out after a few months of light use, I only use it like once a week since I have a few other stylus. I will see how the new tip will hold up.
