Pebble 2 + Heart Rate Smart Watch- White/WhiteThis was ordered thru Amazon on Oct. 25, 2016 and it arrived the next day to my surprise (yey free 1 days shipping!). As of this writing, trying to buy this thru the official Pebble website will just lead you to a page with "Starts shipping in November". Even so, it did not have the Kickstarter logo underneath. This will be an initial review and will be updated in the coming days :)This is my first smartwatch ever, I did not buy the original pebble as well. I am familiar with Android wear/ Apple watch though, with all the different designs that keeps popping out left and right - I tried them in stores and to me, they all look the same, function the same, with added bells and whistles depending on the manufacturer. Let us assume that the intended purpose of smartwatch is to extend the capabilities of your smartphone and all  of them are successful in that aspect.Then we have Pebble - which is to me, a different league of it's own (think of the Nintendo Wii vs PS and XBOX). I do not know of any Geeky smartwatch that can match Pebble 2 currently, not just by the uniqueness of how it extends your phones' capabilities, but with the price, the community support and how capable it is. I dig the style of using buttons to navigate because I know in time, this feature will slowly die - replaced by touch screens everywhere. Kinda like how the Shift stick in cars are slowly dying. Most of the smartwatches in the market are touch-capable and only Pebble opted for this style afaik. My only comment regarding those buttons is that, I kinda feel that I might crushed the watch by exerting a little force, imagine 1 finger pushing, another finger acting as support.The watch bands are very good quality they feel sturdy and smooth to touch but I kinda feel itchiness since this is my first day. I'm sure once my skin is used to it, I won't even feel a thing. Inserting the bands made me sweat AF though, since I could not figure an easy way of making use of my fat fingers. Tip is to lay it down the table and exert extra effort in pulling those little pins.Installation,pairing with the phone is very straight forward and faster than finishing a Kamehameha. The only thing that made me wait after pairing is it updated the firmware right after. The watch face is very readable without the backlight, but is obviously needed once you're in a dark room. The first thing I did once everything is set is to find a nice WatchFace and the community did not disppoint - There are a lot of choices. I added Weather, Heart rate and date to my new Watch Face.About the heart rate sensor, the reports are true - not sure if this is a hardware or software thing, but definitely the readings are kinda off from time to time, I took a dump and it spike higher than expected when I was so relaxed reading Reddit  while seating at my throne.The Pebble 2 is kinda motion sensitive, I was just in my room - switching in bed and chair mode and Pebble reported that I had 108 steps and I burned 122 calories.I feel that this watch has an intended audience and I am gonna say it's not for the Power Fitness users nor the Casual Hipster users. I think this is an in between - those that do light workouts and tinker with stuff. I don't know, its just me. If you're a power fitness user, go with Garmin or Fitbit. Casual users - go with Android Wear/Apple. Don't wanna start an internet War now.Feel free to ask questions and I will update this in the coming days.My initial impressions so far:+ Geeky/Stylish Look+ Great plastic quality+ Very Readable Watchface+ JUST right Price+ Excellent Community+ Excellent as a smartwatch+ Excellent Pebble App- Heart Rate Monitor is inaccurate- Needs improvement as a fitness watch- Fitness feature of the pebble app needs more detailsUPDATE: October 28, 2016 (usage update, edited initial review grammar)- Battery is at 20% now, it started 50% first time I got it.- While checking my Heart Rate, the watch suddenly froze and went to Recovery mode - was able to recover, pair  and it updated the firmware again. I guess firmware was corrupted or something (Fix this Pebble team, thanks)- Heart rate monitor is a little accurate now( it must be learning?) - the thing that baffles me is that when you remove it from your wrist, the amount of spikes is too damn high. Laying it flat on the bed had the sensor spiking too, not sure what kind of beat it's sensing.- Not a fan of using devices while taking a shower even if they're water resistant but decided to use it twice now. So far so good.- I had the white Pebble 2, so far - showering, sweating a bit, eating Cheetos- Bands are still clean.- The weather system app is Accurate - what baffles me are those Watchfaces that uses API Keys to get the weather data from different sources, It cannot get my location thus resulting to outdated weather compared to the official weather app that came with Pebble. I'm not sure if it's my phone or what.- I discovered that you can tap the watch so it will light up the backlight(yey!) - not sure if this is accurate or if this is intentional, but I cannot find the sweet spot of tapping it. Sometimes I tap the upper band (near the quick latch) and it lights up. Not the same at the lower part.- I found out that the glass is quite reflective. A little annoying but tolerable (especially when driving)- Sleep pattern monitoring is good as well.- I'm still getting used to the different vibration behaviors - am I getting a notification or it's a time change or bluetooth got disconnected? Kinda wish MIDI beeps are supported :)- Added a new Pic of my current Watch face, was eating some chicken tenders(Hello KFC Nashville chicken) and saw my heart rate spike. Time to go vegetarian.There is a trend we can see here - as a smartwatch that extends your phones capabilities, the Pebble 2 definitely nails it since they learned it from the first Pebble. As a fitness device, the heart rate monitor feels like an after thought which is not acceptable as it is the selling point for others, we can only hope that it will be improved in both the hardware and software area of the current Pebble 2 and and not just carry over the lesson in Pebble 3.Please excuse my long post, here's a pic.
