The one thing I didn't like about this case was the rubber tab that covered the home button. It made the home button really hard to press.Rokform has since redesigned the bumper so that there is no tab covering the home button.I had used an exacto knife to slice off the tab from the bumper on my case. Today I contacted Rokform when I noticed the new tab-less design. They are sending me a new style bumper free of charge.Great company!
