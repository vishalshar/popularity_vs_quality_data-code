Looked for an alternative option to Kan Jam and Corn Hole.  This game fit the bill pretty nicely.  I'm not going to explain how to play it, plenty of other reviews already go into that.  I bought this primarily for a 10 day long camping trip with friends.  We range from age 27-35 or so.  Pretty much everyone enjoyed playing this. Simple to learn, simple to play but random enough due to the bounces that it's always interesting. Ramps seem sturdy and well built, balls and net seem durable. I like the fact you can put the balls in one of the pockets, place the other ramp on top and have a pretty compact game for your next trip.I took one point away just because of having to assemble the pocket to the ramp.  Not the easiest of assembly and was just kind of annoying that you still had to do that after paying that much for the game.
