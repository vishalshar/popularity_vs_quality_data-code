Bought the Explorer Kit first and this one because my son loved building with that kit and he wanted more servos and pcs to build different characters.  The price is kinda high on this kit but well worth it considering it comes with 16 servos.  Long story short this Jimu system was perfect for my son and he's learning programming while building these things.
