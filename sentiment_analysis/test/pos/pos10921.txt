This thing changed my life. It's so great knowing that if I'm going to be home late from work, or away for a night or two, I don't have to make my cat wait and/or pay someone to stop by and feed her. I also LOVE that there's a webcam so I can confirm that she got her food, or just turn it on at any time to check in.I was a little skeptical because it's not cheap, but it's worth every cent.
