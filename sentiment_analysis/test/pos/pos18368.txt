Wow! I'm blown away by this speaker. I originally had the RIVA Turbo X, which sounded great, until I heard about the Peachtree DEEPBLUE2. The RIVA still sounds great but serves a completely different purpose. While the DEEPBLUE2 can easily be moved around within the confines of your home, it's real purpose is to be placed in a good spot and left there. I've placed mine right under my wall mounted TV and I use it for bluetooth audio & also my TV sound via optical cable. This speaker gets pretty loud, but the quality of sound is what sets it apart. Great bass that can be adjusted to your liking, and a perfect sound spectrum through all frequencies. While not as good as a standalone home theater, TV sound is greatly improved when you use the DEEPBLUE2. I have the bass set to 60% which is perfect as anything more gets a bit boomy. There is no replacement for displacement, and the 6" woofer really does the job here. The volume & bass level LEDs are also a great touch. The unit is very plain looking and in solid black which is perfect as it can fit in any time of home decor.I was on the fence between this and a Klipsch soundbar, while the Klipsch soundbar did have more bass and go louder, I like how this unit is just 1 piece as I did not want to have a separate subwoofer on the floor.Highly recommend this unit; it has enough sound & bass to fill a big room full of guests. As we know as soon as you introduce bodies into a room, what you thought was loud is suddenly thinned out, but this unit has enough power to overpower.I've had this for a few months and still go home and put songs on to hear how good it sounds.
