This incredible product is a life changer. I have suffered from debilitaing  fibromyalgia /chronic fatigue  for years, I have seen so many doctors and tried dozens of different pain medications both holistic and prescription, the only pain medicines that work were the Opioids like Tramadol, but I won't take them due to the side effects and the dependency issues. I have tried so many different things, none of them worked so I was  skeptical of the Quell  device. With the fair return policy I purchased it, It took a few days for it to work but this device has eliminated 99% of the pain in my legs and upper body. Since the pain is almost  non-existant my severe tiredness and fatigue has been reduced SIGNIFICANTLY. I have used it for 10 days now, if it continues to work consistently over time then the  Quell, to me, is the most revolutinary  pain product there is. I believe the pharmaceutical companies will have difficulty competing with this amazing product and  it could have a major impact on the use and abuse of Opioids.
