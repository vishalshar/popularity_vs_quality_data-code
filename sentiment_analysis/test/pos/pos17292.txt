I love my Bellabeat! It accurately tracks my activity, sleep and stress levels. My bellabeat syncs perfectly with the app, I have had zero issues. The one downside, so I thought, was that it is not waterproof or water resistant, but I accidentally washed it when it was left clipped to my shirt and it still works great! I wouldn't recommend making a habit of letting it go through the wash though.
