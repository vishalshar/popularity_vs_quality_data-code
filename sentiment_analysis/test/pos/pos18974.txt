The boys love it!  I have two Yorkies and they've been on Solid Gold their whole lives; even before it was easy to purchase.  The Lil' Boss is just right for my dog who has few teeth left in his aging mouth and the other can't wait for dinner time.  I feel good knowing that this is a very high end food for my pets.
