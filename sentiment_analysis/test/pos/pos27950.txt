I've done a lot of research and in the end I chose Plugged over Beats, SMS and SOL. I'm extremely satisfied, the headphones blew me away. Some of my feedback is below.Sound? I dont listen to Classical or Rock music. I listen to Rap, Hip-Hop, EDM, Top 40, etc. Plugged sounds way better than the $300 Beats my cousin has. Really great sound quality for $100.Comfort? Most headphones hurt my ears after 30 minutes. These are REALLY comfortable even after 3 hours of wearing them. The leather is soft and the headphones feel light on my head.Design/Feel? They're different. They don't look like anything out there. I get compliments on them all the time and people asking me what brand they are. They feel VERY premium, the matte finish is textured and really strong.Packaging/Accessories? I felt like I was opening up a product from Apple, packaging is nice. The carrying bag is high quality, not those cheap soft type. The music controls and mic work perfectly. They come with cables for both Android and iPhone.Overall this is an amazing value. Im surprised this product isnt priced at $200.
