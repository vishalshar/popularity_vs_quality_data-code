Takes a little getting used to, but overall feels very comfortable once I got the hang of it. I'm not sure if it actually improves my posture long-term, but I do find myself missing it if I'm not wearing it. I use it mostly at home, I'm not entirely sure how professional this would look in an office setting (has a bit of a parachute harness look to it). But if you're in a home office, or a more casual environment, I would check it out. Will probably buy one for my wife (or end up buying one for myself if she takes mine first...)
