Being able to view the earth from above has opened my eyes to unlimited possibilities.  The 12mp camera takes stunning photos and holds steady even when the drone is buffeted by the wind, or my less than fluid direction changes, ha. It seems a little unstable when landing in a breeze and has tipped over a couple times flailing the propellers in the gravel. I was unable to cut power and ended up picking it off the ground with propellers spinning.  In all fairness, I've not had a lot of experience with the controls so it could well be my fault. I have three batteries and use them all when I find the time to go out.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase.  The cost v/s quality is a no brainer and the support is stellar.  You won't be disappointed with this drone!!
