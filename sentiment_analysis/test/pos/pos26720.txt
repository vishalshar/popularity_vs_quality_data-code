For the price its an awesome gadget with real world applications particularly if you work with mechanics or construction. Also fun conversation piece to show people at parties! LOL :)More seriously though, I wish the software was as good as the hardware. On Seek's website I see that they released a SDK for the device so hopefully there will be more innovative and advanced software applications coming in the future.
