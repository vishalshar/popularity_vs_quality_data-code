I love this.  It has the most amazing smell.  I found it in a restaurant bathroom and took a picture of the bottle so I would not forget.  Only problem is shipping.  My bottle wasn't packed well and leaked all over the packaging.  I don't know if that's a common thing with this soap, but it was very disappointing.
