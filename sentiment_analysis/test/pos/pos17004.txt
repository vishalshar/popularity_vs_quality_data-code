Best remote ever.  I want two now.  I almost want to cry.  You must follow the instructions closely.  Step 1 leads you to think that you must have a green light, but that doesn't happen until you use the app from your smart phone.  After that, importing my previous remote was sick!  Setup your favorites.  If you edit your favorites, you MUST do an additional step (the only stupid part).  Scroll to the right, scroll to the left, scroll up, scroll down. It's all there and it works great.  I just wish they added a CC button.  This is perhaps logictech's best product ever.  Nicely done.
