I love this phone!!! I got this for myself for Christmas and I can't put it down!!!!! It feels so nice and it has the longest battery life i've ever used on a phone. I was able to find all the drivers and recovery files so I'm not too worried about bricking :-). I found a case at my local mall too! not the best case but it fits almost perfect.
