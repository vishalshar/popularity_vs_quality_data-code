I can't say enough about how happy I am with the Beastgrip pro. I am using it to make explainer and new product videos for our company as well as for my own personal use. The ability to attach lenses, led lights, mic and other tools is simple and secure. My iPhone 6plus is very well secured and stays in place. This is a very well built product. Feels like a professional piece of equipment all the way through.I am looking forward to using it for a long time!
