So far, I love Pencil!! I had a few hiccups when first pairing it with Paper (it is very easy to pair), and I accidentally pulled the tip off, leaving the battery kit stuck inside. Careless of me, and I wrote to 53 support to tell them the stupid thing I did. Jason replied quickly and told me how to remove the battery when there's no tip attached to pull it out with: If it happens to you, just grasp Pencil in one hand, pointed down at a writing angle, and with your other hand, karate-chop or smack it several times until the battery slides out. Now you can reattach your tip the proper way. Great support from Jason at Fifty-Three! Now I just need to learn how to master Pencil, and draw! I'll try to remember to update this once I actually use it for a decent amount of time. Meanwhile, it's been working very well on Paper, and on the few other compatible apps I've tried it with.
