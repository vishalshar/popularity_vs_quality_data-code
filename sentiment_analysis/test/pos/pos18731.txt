Fantastic exercise headphones.  Very comfortable, sound good, plenty loud, easy to use.  They do not go anywhere - I was doing everything I could to get them to budge out of my ears and they stayed right in place.  Very light, very convenient.  I love the onboard memory.  I don't care about the fitness tracking (the HR monitor was accurate after the 2.1 update, at least for me).  They maintain connection - my biggest problem with Jaybirds (well, Jaybirds die at the first sign of sweat...).  As soon as you get them do the 2.1 update - I used them with 1.4 for a day then updated and the difference was significant.  Better sound, louder, etc.  I really like these.  If you are on the fence might wait until the next generation of Dash comes along, but if you are looking for true wireless you can't do better at the moment.  I wasn't interested in airpods because I don't care for earpods and these sound somewhat better than earpods do.I took a star off for the bluetooth.  I don't really use it, but the bluetooth in my limited use was pretty bad.  Connectivity sucks.  I am not big on using headphones in lieu of my phone so, again, the microphone isn't really a big deal for me.  Happy with my purchase!
