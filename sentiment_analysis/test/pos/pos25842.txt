This lunch box was a great idea/investment.  I cook dinners/lunches for my fiance to take to work and food was going to waste since he didn't have a way to take them to work and keep them refrigerated.  This lunch box has helped to make sure he can pack a lunch for work and keep the food waste down.  Because it looks so masculine, he doesn't mind carrying it with him to work either.  Would definitely buy again!
