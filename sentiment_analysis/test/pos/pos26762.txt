Im usually too lazy to write reviews but this speaker is too cool not to rave about.I spent weeks searching for the perfect portable speaker and certainly found what I was looking in the Libratone Zipp Mini! The speaker comes in a really nice, quality cylinder box. Very impressive right out the gate as almost all electronics come in a standard square or rectangular box. I would be proud to gift this item without having to wrap it ;). I chose a red speaker and love it! Its portable and chic! Set up took just a few minutes, super easy. I love that the speaker can also store preset radio stations, something I havent see offered by any other product. The interface is great and intuitive but the most impressive feature by far is the sound! They were not kidding when they said this baby delivers surround sound.  I did laps in the pool today to my favorite workout music and it was awesome! The Mr. now wants to buy more so we can fill the house w/these speakers. What have I done?! LOL All in all, I highly recommend this item. Its such a great functional and decorative piece for the home, yard or anywhere you like. Great job Libratone!
