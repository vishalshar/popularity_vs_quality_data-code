OK. So its not the fastest phone out there. It doesn't have a HD screen. You can't charge it wirelessly. It isn't waterproof. And you cant use it as a remote. Now that the unnecessary stuff is out of the way. This is the niftiest little phone you could ever have. It has all of the essential utilities you need for a phone: 3g/4g speeds on gsm carriers, WiFi, Bluetooth. It uses a micro USB charger, which be warned it uses an 8mm long tip which is approximately 2mm longer than a normal micro USB tip. So you can either get a new cable/ trim yours back so its like the included cable or you can trim back the plastic surrounding the port so that a normal Micro USB cable will fit. This phone has a tiny 650 mah battery, which sounds comical. In all honesty tho that battery will last you a day just like a 2500 mah battery would a regular smart phone. Yes the performance is NOT mind blowing. it only has 512 mb of ram and 4gb of on board storage, which is probably closer to 2gb due to android taking up space. These specs are horrible compared to flagships, obviously. It does have small lag spikes while using the device but the fact that i t runs android in the first pace is phenomenal. If you need a tiny phone, for any reason what so ever. GET THIS. whether it be to use it as a fitness device, mp3 player, or actual phone. This is well worth the money. On another note, children LOVE IT. It's like a phone that is kid size.
