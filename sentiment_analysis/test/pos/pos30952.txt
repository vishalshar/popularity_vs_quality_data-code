I received my Luma 3-pack system on Aug 8 so it's been almost 2 weeks now since I set-up my Luma WiFi System.  I have had WiFi signal issues in my home for many years and have gone through many different wireless routers (TP-Link, D-Link, Linksys, NETGEAR) including a NETGEAR wireless extender in the bedroom.  Although I had to switch between two networks in order to get decent wifi signal in the bedrooms and the wireless extender was a slight improvement, my wifi signal at home was very unreliable.  We have around 20 wireless devices hooked up to our network and upgraded our internet service to 100mbps.  Still, we had very inconsistent WiFi signal and constantly had to reboot my router and modem just to get the signal to work.  When I checked speedtest.net for my network speed, I would get above 100mbps after I rebooted my modem and router.  Then the next day, my network would slow to a crawl down to 10mbps and less than 5mbps from the wireless extender.  Forget even trying to use my phone or laptop in the back of the house because I simply could not get any WiFi signal from there even though the wifi extender was in the same room!  At times, we simply turned off wifi from our smartphones and just went with LTE which was much more reliable and faster.Until....I finally received the Luma WiFi System.  About a month before I placed the pre-order on March 2016, I had researched many different options including trying other (and more expensive) modems and wireless routers.  I even considered switching my cable internet service to satellite internet service because I had assumed that it was the cable company's crappy internet service.  At first I considered buying the EERO WiFi system but I was not sure about investing $500 for a wifi system that was relatively new for home use.  EERO was getting great reviews but then I ran into the Luma system on Amazon.  Luma and EERO seemed to be the same exact system but because Luma was on pre-order, I was able to get the 3-pack for half the price of EERO's 3-pack.  Also, I figured if this system didn't work out, I can simply return it thanks to Amazon Prime.Well, after just 2 weeks of use, my family and I have been extremely happy and satisfied with the Luma wifi system.  The set-up took about 20 minutes from the time I opened the box to the time the 3rd Luma was set-up.  When I checked speediest.net again, I got 118mbps download and 11mbps upload speeds right away and when I go to the back of the house, I get anywhere from 50-70mbps download and still 11mbps upload speed in an area where I was basically getting no signal!  But I figured I'd wait a little while to make sure how long this was last.  It's only been 2 weeks later but I have been getting consistent internet speed and because I no longer use the wifi extender, I don't have to worry about switching networks just to try and get wifi signal.  I did hook up my wireless router to the main Luma pod since their is only 1 ethernet input on the pod as I still have  wired devices that need internet connection but I simply turned off the wifi option on my router since I really don't need that option any more.Luma has given us reliable and fast internet service and now we don't have to worry about losing signal when we go to our bedrooms.  The Luma app is great and very user friendly, however, I do agree with some of the reviews that the app should include an option to be able to connect to certain pods and to be able to see which pods any particular device is connected to.  The only thing I can tell is whether or not the system is online.Other than that, I would recommend the Luma Home WiFi System to anyone who is having signal issues in their home.  Yes, the app can be improved but I expect this to come in the near future as Luma starts to gather their customer's feedback.  It was a bit of a wait to get the system but well worth it for us.  If you are looking to solve your wifi signal issues and want a simple to use system, then I would highly recommend Luma.
