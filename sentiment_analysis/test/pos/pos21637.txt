Very nice product so far, especially if you like playing board games and don't like your stuff drenched in alcohol. Here's the break down of the pros/cons:+++Pros:1) Does not tip over (for the most part)2) Made of plastic so it won't break if it falls3) Holds a lot of liquid4) Easy to clean5) Lifts up without clinging to the surface---Cons:1) If surface is not completely smooth or the cup/surface is not clean enough, it will tip2) Does not feel like an actual glass3) $15 per glass is a bit pricey4) Not useful if you're a careful person
