IÂ’m using Foobot for a few weeks now and I found out that I had a very important issue in my bedroom. Because of a very bad ventilation, the VOC were increasing very high. Thanks to their recommendations I've been able to fix it and now I wake up each morning feeling rested! Thats cool!The app is crashing sometimes and they told me that it is just software problem which will be fixed by their technical team very soon.
