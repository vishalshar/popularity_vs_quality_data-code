Great Dog food!  The problem is that Amazon upped the price to $70.55, and I previously paid $44.50 in May.  What is up with this?  It looks like Amazon is trying to cover their "free" shipping by upping the price of the dog food.  This is a $26.05 (58.5%) increase in price within 2 months. What is up with this Amazon?  I am a loyal Prime customer!
