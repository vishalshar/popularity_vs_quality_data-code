Lightning connectors wobble a bit in this unit, but it's not a huge problem. Just takes a little extra care to seat a device. Aside from that, this unit is excellent. Extremely solid, and future-proofs your device docking needs. Apple has seriously disappointed by not producing something like this, but the EverDock is probably better than what they would have produced anyway (based on the cheesy Apple docks I've owned in the past). A little pricy, but you won't be disappointed. I love being able to take my device out of the dock without the dock coming with it!Note to some complainers: if you want to be able to reach the home button of the device while it's docked, put that device in the front slot. Or just take it out of the dock for Pete's sake. You can't expect a dual-device dock to give you full access to the rear device while docked, especially when there are two devices in the dock at once. If it's that much of a problem for you, get two single docks instead. Get real and stop complaining.
