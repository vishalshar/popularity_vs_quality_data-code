I have only had the product for a few days, so I can not speak to its durability yet, but the design is outstanding. This is perfect for my wife and her iphone 4s in our minivan. The suction cup holders are too short or too bouncy and our dashboard is not remotely flat for a dash mount. We don't use the CD player at all anymore, so this was perfect. Holds securely in portrait or landscape and swivels on a ball joint to more directly face the driver. Moves a tiny bit when driving, but not bad at all. The only downside is that the button to release the arms ends up behind the phone, so it can be a little bit of work to get your phone out. But for all the other pluses, that is a very small annoyance for us.Also it got to me in three days, so don't worry about it not being prime eligible. They will get it to you fast.
