Works as advertised. Setup worked as directed. I just had to learn a little bit about WPS in my WiFi router. My only complaint is that the D-Link app neither allows you to set the interval between notifications nor shows the interval default. Based on satisfaction with this device, I also purchased a D-Link smart plug, the control of which is integrated into the same app.
