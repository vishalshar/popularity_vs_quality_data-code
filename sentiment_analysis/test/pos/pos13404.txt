Just installed my new MyLifter yesterday.  Everything is great.  The instructions were easy to follow and the app is supper intuitive and easy to use.  I used two straps and am using it to lift my wheelbarrow loaded with extra gear inside.  It has freed up a ton of space in my garage that I didn't have before.  I have used manual bike pulley system for a while to lift bikes up, but this is so much nicer.  Pull out my phone, one tap and the stuff comes to me or goes away.  To get my bikes with the manual pulley system I have to pull tons and tons of rope.  I'm also very impressed with the load capacity.  Feels very sturdy and safe.  I would never attempt to lift 100 lbs with the manual pulley stuff I have.  I will probably be purchasing more soon!  I might try what someone suggested and make a stand to lift multiple bikes all at once.  Overall I'm very pleased and impressed with this product!
