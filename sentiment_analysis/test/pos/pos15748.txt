This is the honest to God truth. This is the best cream I have found for moisturizing your face, neck and hands.  I would give it 5 stars if I had seen any improvement at all on my wrinkles.I am 53 years old, I have always taken good care of my face, with the exception of sunscreen.  I never liked sunscreen,  but I I'll definitely start wearing it.  I understand that you should wear sunscreen all the time when your outside, even when the sun is not shining.  Dermatologist say UV damages our skin more than anything.I have some wrinkles on my forehead, crows feet, my mouth, and one really semi-deep one on my left cheek from sleeping on my left side.  I read somewhere on the Internet that depending on the way you sleep, can give you WRINKLES.  So I now sleep on my back and with good moisturizers it has become minamal  like the others.  That is why I reordered Jonre for the second time. I was going to get a refund, and realized I won't find a better moisturizer.If I notice any improvement with my wrinkles, I well update this review.But I can tell you, that you won't find a better moisturizer than Jonre.  It is a light cream, with a silky feel on your skin.If I can assist anyone further regarding Jonre, please feel free to contact me through asking questions about this cream.I am not expecting a miracle in a jar, I just want to age gracefully.  God Bless!
