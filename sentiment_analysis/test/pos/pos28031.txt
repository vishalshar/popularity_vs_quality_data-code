awesome.  i use the smart mode and it's already cut our water bill in half.  also check with your state if you can get a rebate because in California we got $125 rebate!!  this thing is going to pay for itself in a few months.  easy to set up and use.  and i love how it automatically works with the weather stations to pause for rain or freeze.
