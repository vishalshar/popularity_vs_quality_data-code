Dude, this thing is fantastic. No joke -- it does all it says and then some. App support is great and it only has minor hiccups here and there. It's pretty intuitive and doesn't really require instructions. You put it on, you do your damn thing, and you press the button on the device (to wake it up) and the sync button in the app, and it puts in all the day's data, and all the other days you forgot to sync. Great device at an unbeatable price point. I tell everyone I know about this, and tell them not to spend so much on an expensive-ass Fitbit or any of the other big brands, because this thing does it all. Oh, and for anyone wondering (because I know I was prior to buying): yes, it functions perfectly as a watch, syncing the time up to your phone flawlessly. There's even room in the app to allow you to input your daily weight, water intake, and more. I don't do that because I'm lazy, but it's there!I'm someone who doesn't really wear watches or anything on my wrists, so there's a little discomfort, but it's not at all the fault of the design or the device itself. All in all, it's pretty light and far more comfortable than your average watch.
