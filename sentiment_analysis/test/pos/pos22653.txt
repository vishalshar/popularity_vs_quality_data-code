This review is for 4 different iPhone 6 Wallet Cases I have personally tried out and compared against each other. Note that I am not an affiliate of these companies and had to buy each case at full price. I am a wallet minimalist who has used the Ridge front-pocket wallet for a long time but have since sought to further downsize my pockets by acquiring a wallet case for my phone. I also seek to combine as much functionality into my case as possible. On a scale of 1-5, 5 being the best, I will rate each phone case in the following areas: #1 Storage Flexibility; #2 Protection; #3 Design; #4 Operability if Broken; #5 Features, followed by an overall score. Also let me preface by stating my wallet preferences: I like to carry 3 cards (1 credit card, 1 debit card, drivers license) + loose cash + a couple checks + my CD Slot Car Holder magnet. If needed, I would compromise by downsizing my checks, debit card, and car holder magnet. Full-framed protection, including and especially the bottom ports-side, is a must as well, which, as an example, this wallet case does not offer. Finally, additional features or perks is icing on the cake.1.) Wallet Case by EYN: #1 Storage Flexibility = 5. I have not needed to compromise at all with my preferred contents. There seems to be extra space for 1-2 cards as well! #2 Protection = 5. Full framed protection, great backside protection, front side is lipped that elevates the phone and protects against scratching. #3 Design = 4. The case seems to be designed well and the concept is great. The smoothness of the case feels almost felt-like which might mean that it can slip out of my grip more easily though. #4 Operability if Broken = 1. If a hinge on the back door breaks, or the clasp to keep the door shut breaks, the whole case will become useless. Also if the bottom component that holds the phone in falls off, the phone will fall out. #5 Features = 5. The back door can be used as a kickstand for watching videos on the phone sitting sideways. This can be adjusted for 2 viewing angles as well. Theres a mirror inside the case and an included lanyard with a hole at the top of the case (for more effeminate uses). Overall = 4.0.2.) Vault Slim Wallet Case by Silk: #1 Storage Flexibility = 3. The case backing is flexible rubber which means theres some wiggle room with what you have in it (but not too much). I was able to fit most of my setup inside. #2 Protection = 4. Full framed protection but theres significant unprotected space around the camera lens on the back. The phone comes with a complimentary screen protector though. #3 Design = 5. The 2 main things this case has going for it is that its slim and simple. Theres no excess bulk like the EYN Wallet Case that has a mount for a mirror in it. And theres no mechanisms or gadgetry for its wallet function; its just a flexible rubbery pocket. Theres even a finger push tab cut-out that helps push out the cards too. #4 Operability if Broken = 5. Short of the rubber ripping, this case isnt going to break anytime soon and leave its functionality inoperable. #5 Features = 2. They advertise that if a card juts out just right it can act as a kickstand, but in reality the phone stands perpendicular which is by no means ideal for watching videos. Overall = 3.8.3.) Commuter Wallet Case by OtterBox: #1 Storage Flexibility = 1. Advertised as carrying 3 cards and 1 bill. What if you have $9? Youre screwed. The compartment drawer is hard plastic so theres zero wiggle room for flex capacity. #2 Protection = 5. This case is actually 2 in 1: a hard plastic outer case with a soft gel inner liner, offering full framed protection AND port covers. #3 Design = 3. On paper the design is great but in practice its lacking. The wallet compartment is really hard to push open and mine didnt sit flush with the backside of the case when closed. #4 Operability if Broken = 2. If the sliding compartment drawer broke off then the wallet would become useless. Though the chances that this drawer will break off doesnt seem very likely. #5 Features = 4. Comes with a screen protector and the soft gel liner has port covers which can be useful. Overall = 3.0.4.) Undercover Wallet Case by Prodigee: #1 Storage Flexibility = 1. Like the OtterBox Case, there is no wiggle room for additional items in the compartment drawer. #2 Protection = 4. Full framed protection, comes with a tempered glass screen protector, but if it falls on its backside too much, I fear that the drawer mechanism will break since theres no buffer between it and the ground. #3 Design = 3. Great concept. Disappointed that it doesnt come in black - a navy blue case with a black phone really doesnt look good. The mechanism switch is really tiny too and hard to release the drawer; Im afraid Im going to break it every time I open the drawer. #4 Operability if Broke = 1. If the mechanism switch breaks or the drawer refuses to come out, good luck getting out your cards. Youd probably have to pry it open with a flat head screwdriver. #5 Features = 3. A drawer with a quick release is a nice idea. A credit card can be affixed to the outside groove to act as a kickstand. The tempered glass screen protector is really nice too compared to the plastic ones (prevents oily fingerprint smudges better). However, this case costs 2-3 times more than every other wallet case (bought it at $40), so minus 2 points for that. Overall = 2.4.In summary, I prefer the EYN wallet case the best and Im also keeping the Vault Slim case as backup, in case the EYN cases door hinges break.If you thought my review was useful, please +1 it. Thanks.
