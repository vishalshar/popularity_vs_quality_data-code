I really like this kit as it has most of everything needed to start hooking up your lighting to your connected home. The Smart Bridge is easy to set up, and wiring is as simple as it gets. Pairing all the components was easy, so I was up and running in only a few minutes. I probably spent more time messing around with the packaging than anything else. My only complaint is that the remotes come only with pedestals, and no wall-mounting plates that allow them to be put alongside other switches. These plates aren't expensive, but they are hard to find in stores, so just be prepared to mount using removable adhesive strips (which work very well).
