I like this phone, I thought the battery life would be worse than what it is, but have been surprised. My phone lasts me all day (in a low service environment) and still survives a 12 hour day with about 20? left over.The screen is bright and very crispI'm clumsy, and stop this phone a lot (because it's a bit slippery) and what I've noticed is, the material is really hard to dent. It's tough, lots of smudges, but no scratches. I would recommend a case and tempered glass screen protector though.The sound is great and clear, although, don't expect any bass.It's not the fastest phone in the world, but I'd be lying if I said it's slow. It works best when it's not hot.What makes it hot:Skyping really heats up my phone although, gaming is fine.Basically, anything that keeps your screen on, will heat up your phone, but then again, it cools down really quickly too.All in all, for the price you can't go wrong-its competent, looks great, has a good accessory market, is VR ready and is supported well. Also the fingerprint sensor is pretty good, as long as your hands are clean and not pruned from being in water for a while.
