I've had my Glion Dolly for about 3 months now, so I finally decided to give it a review.I ride this scooter to and from work in Boston (2 miles each way), and I must say it gets the job done wonderfully.THE SPEED: The scooter is pretty fast (but I do sometimes wish it was even zippier). I keep up with most cyclists, and am even faster than a small handful. Cars are clearly faster, but due to traffic, I usually get from A to B much faster. When accelerating, I find that it gets to full speed quickly but there is a gradient. You can also keep it at a low speed to scoot next to someone who is walking, which is nice.THE BATTERY: I cannot say that I've tested the battery to its full extent, as the most I've clocked in one day is about 6 miles. The battery reads that I've used about 25%-50% of its charge after one trip to and from work, which is on par with the mileage it should get with one charge. I'm a heavy rider so I'm sure that doesn't help. The charge is pretty quick, just a couple of hours.THE SIZE: This scooter is a nice size, with fat tires that can handle most bumps and potholes. The handlebar is adjustable so it works for someone of any height. The weight is GREAT. It was so hard to find a scooter that I would be able to carry up my third-floor walkup, but this hasn't been a problem. My favorite aspect is that you can fold it for easy storage. You can even leave it standing upright when walking in stores (to easily pay for something, grab your bag, etc). The dolly feature is very useful when you do need it.NOISE: This scooter is downright stealthy. It's almost too quiet--I wish it was a little louder so pedestrians would know where I am!Cons: There are two design problems I've noticed. The biggest caveat is the electric brake. I hate, hate, hate the brake. It's very sudden and it feels like I'll be bucked off the scooter. In all honesty, I cannot say I've hit the brake hard when going full blast. Fortunately I haven't needed to, but I dread what'll happen when a car cuts me off and I need to brake fast.The other problem I have is that you need to constantly tighten the handlebar so it will stay locked in place. I had the bar loosen while riding, and it actually dropped down to the lowest setting (I use the highest), meaning I was suddenly riding without any means of steering. I immediately fell of going full speed and seriously hurt my elbow. I was very lucky no cars were around. I had NO IDEA I had to keep the handlebars so tight to prevent any failure from Glion's locking mechanism. I do so now, but it's still a little discomforting.All in all, I do love this scooter. I think it's an excellent value for someone who's looking to travel a couple of miles every day and wants a quick commute.
