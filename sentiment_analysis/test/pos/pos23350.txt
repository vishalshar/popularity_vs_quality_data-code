Bought a mini farm from my local Ace Hardware for $13It was very easy to grow and i had my first flush of 2 oz in 11 days. Mushrooms don't get any fresher and the kit is easy enough kids could grow it.Nothing much happened in the first 7 days and then over night I had baby mushrooms.I did make a humidity tent for it out of a 1 gallon ziplock bag with 6 holes punched near the top, I used bottled water instead of tap water and grew it flat with the hole facing up.
