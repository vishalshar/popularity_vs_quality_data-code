I am a fairly casual phone user, so take my review with that in mind.That being said, I absolutely love this phone. My iPhone bit the dust and I was at a loss because at this time purchasing another iPhone was just not financially feasible. In fact, the more I researched more "mainstream" phones, the more discouraged I was by the price tag. I was convinced I'd have to get a $20 flip phone after years of becoming accustomed to smart phone technology.After I got over the fact that I may have to look outside of the iPhone or Samsung bubble, I found the Nextbit Robin in a list of inexpensive smart phones of decent quality. I read a few more reviews and took my chances.I am so pleased by this phone. This is my first Android, and I was worried about the transition from iOS to Android -- but I think this phone makes that transition a little easier with its minimalist design. I like the feel of it, and the display is very crisp. So far, I have been able to do everything I was doing on my iPhone, and I actually like the home button and fingerprint detection a lot more than the iPhone 6; when you set it up, you can move your finger around to ensure every part of your print is identified, so you don't have to place it "just so" every time like I had to with my iPhone.Many of the reviews I read mentioned the camera and battery life as mediocre at best, and while the camera definitely isn't as powerful as the iPhone's, I don't think it's really fair to expect that level of quality from a $150 phone. I feel like the camera is more than adequate for that price, and I would argue that the front-facing photos I've taken are actually better than my iPhone's. I may be imagining it, but they do seem less grainy to me. As for the battery life, once again, I am a casual phone user (and I have a small child who can't see a phone without wanting it, so a lot of times it's simply out of sight) so your mileage may vary, but I have not had an issue at all so far with the battery life.The only complaint I will echo is that the phone does seem to get warm quickly. It's never been uncomfortably warm, but warm enough for me to take note of the heat.All in all, I really like this phone and I am rooting for the success of the company. They may have made a convert of me.
