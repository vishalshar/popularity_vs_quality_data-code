My six-year-old daughter wants to play this non-stop! The rules are easy to understand and the object of the game is clear. The cards are durable. I'm very pleased with this purchase. (Note: We have a house rule that when you find a monster in a treasure chest, it goes into your hand. The rules say you have to fight the monster.)
