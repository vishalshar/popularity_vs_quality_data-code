I. LOVE. THESE.  These cheese bags are worth every penny.  They actually work! The bags really do extend the life of your cheese slices/bricks.  I purchased a second box just so I don't run out.  My Costco packs of pre sliced havarti love living in these cheese bags...we have no cheese waste anymore!  No hard edges on our opened bricks.  No hardened slices of pre sliced cheeses.  We've even stored opened cheeses, gone on vacation, or have forgotten about the cheese for multiple weeks and the cheese is still like it was the day we opened the package.  These are my pantry staple now.
