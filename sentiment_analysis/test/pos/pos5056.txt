I saw this product on some gadget site a number of months back and thought it could be a useful product so I ordered it. There isn't much to the product. It's a bottle with a top and, Oh my, what's this? A TWIST OFF BOTTOM? OH MY GOD THAT'S AWESOME!In reality, I ordered this for use at my office because we don't have a dish washer and the type of soap we carry never seems to get all the way out of the bottle after I wash it. So, when I clean the bottle out and go to use it for the first time, all I can taste is dish soap, and sweet mother of God that tastes terrible.I don't have that problem with the Clean Bottle. I can clean it out and drink my water without a problem. I know this sounds like a stupid problem but sometimes it's those little things in life that can put a smile on your face.Thank you, Clean Bottle!
