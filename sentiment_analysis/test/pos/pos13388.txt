I have tried a couple of sets of wireless headphones and these are the best. They were a little challenging to get connected at first, not any worse than the others though. I tried to use them without the silicone sleeves but they made my ears itch a little. Once I put the sleeves on they were great and have had no comfort or fit issues. I use them about one hour at a time, I have not ran out of battery(which I shouldn't). When I work out I throw the case on the charger so it is charging while I am using the headphones(the case is a battery charger). Having the case as a charger is awesome since they can just recharge in my bag and be ready to go the next time. The audio is good, not great. I didn't especially that though, they are small and truly wireless. They are as good as any Bluetooth headphones I have used for audio though. I really like that you can tune in your surroundings if you want so you can have a conversation with someone while they are still in your ears.
