I have used this zapper for several months to address a severe chipmunk problem and it has work super. It's humanely eliminated close to 100 chipmunks and we are still using the original batteries.  It's killed some mice and moles as well.  Although its not used for squirrels, they do go inside it from time to time to get the sunflower seed I use as bait. It shocks them but does not kill them (exception of 1 squirrel). They flee and know enough not to try it again. I purchased a second unit to keep inside the house in the basement just in case a mouse should find itself inside. Overall, this unit has completely exceeded my expectations.
