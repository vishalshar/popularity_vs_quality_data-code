I absolutely love my Honey Soles!! I wear them with a pair of sandals that have no other support. Before I bought the Honey Soles, I considered getting rid of the sandals because they bothered my feet and toes. These soles are comfortable, make me feel like I am walking on air and my feet and toes feel fantastic after a full day of walking in the office. I am ready to try them on with other shoes and boots for the winter!!
