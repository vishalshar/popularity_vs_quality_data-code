To preface I have 2 Harmony One remotes, the new Elite is going in the living room and the old One into the beadroom. Install is 3 easy steps. Plug the remote into the computer, since I already have the Logitech software it updates the remote to my gallery. Then plug in the hub to power and link it to wifi. Then set everything up in your entertainment stand, download the Harmony app for your phone, and run all of the set ups. You don't need to plug your remote into the computer anymore...everytime you make a small change...your phone is the bridge to set buttons, configure, update, etc. and when you're done your remote auto updates. It took me one hour to set up DirecTv, Apple TV, Amazon Fire, PS4, and Hue lights. Everything is integrated, everything works (IR and BluRay) and the few small tweaks needed I did on my iPhone which auto updated my remote. IF... you understand how the remote works and are tech savvy you should be thrilled with this update. I AM!! Awesome upgrade.
