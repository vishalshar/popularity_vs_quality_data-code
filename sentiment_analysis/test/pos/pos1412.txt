Singlecue is a remote control for all your devices, that is activated by gestures. The combine of those two make it super powerful - you can define actions that turn on a few devices at once, saving the need to scramble for remote controls. You can turn things on and off just by using your finger. The gesture recognition is amazing - super impressive that it can pick up things like a shush motion for muting.Setup was easy, the device mounts on a surface or the tv without any glue or assembly and it's very stable and sleek looking.If you're looking for a way to simplify your use of multiple remote controls, this is a great product for you.
