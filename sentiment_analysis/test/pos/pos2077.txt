I bought this because the Apple store refused to replace the screen on my phone, saying it was "too far gone" and "bent."  Of course, they wanted $300 for a replacement phone.  The screen was extremely shattered, I'll give them that, but I couldn't see how it was "too bent" when I vaguely know how they work and what needed to be done.  It took around an hour and was a little bit frustrating at times, but it worked like a charm and I now have a fully functioning iphone 6 for only $110.
