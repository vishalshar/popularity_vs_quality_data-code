Bought to replace my screen which suddenly had color issues. The tools provided are great. I watched the you tube instruction video along with the printed material and was able to follow along. Just make sure you have plenty of space to keep your screws isolated as they are of different sizes and have to go back where they came from. When I got to the hairdryer/heat gun step where you have to heat the front to loosen the adhesive. I made the mistake of blowing it where my screws were and they went flying. I got everything back together and the screen worked great. There are a couple of details that either the video does not cover that the instructions do. And details covered in the video that the instructions do not. I don't have a specific example but make sure you watch and read both.
