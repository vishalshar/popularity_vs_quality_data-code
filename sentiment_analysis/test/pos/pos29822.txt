These things are completely irreplaceable. If you don't already own a set then you need to get it, now. If you do then you already know what I am talking about. They have actually fixed some of my old splayed brushes (clean with soap and water mixed with olive oil or brush cleaner, slip them on, then leave them alone for a few days brush side down in a glass) They do what they say and make cleaning your brushes a snap. My only problem is one brush that I can't put it on because of the shape of it, but that's the brushes fault really. (It has a pencil sharpener on one end, weird brush but I adore it.) Other than that my only regret is I didn't buy them sooner. On the buying side I should have shopped around before I bought these here, shipping took forever and I ended up buying another set from another seller that had prime shipping and were cheaper.
