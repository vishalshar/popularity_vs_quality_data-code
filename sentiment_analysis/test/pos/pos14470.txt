Bought as a Christmas present for my daughter who draws and does calligraphy. Drawing feel is very easy and fluid, great weight (walnut version), and doesn't scratch up screen. We haven't been able to use the pressure-sensitive function because she has an iPad 3 and is reluctant to take the performance hit upgrading to ios 8, without which PS doesn't work. Tips wear out quickly if you draw for 2-3 hours a day (2 in the past 5 months) but another $8 for two more tips is not a big deal. Really only shines if you use it with Paper by 53, but in its native environment it is absolutely awesome. If you use Paper, definitely buy the Pencil.The really priceless thing about this is not the Pencil itself though - it's Mix, the online networking via the Paper app. It has been a door into a world of other people interested in art and drawing which has been otherwise nearly impossible for my daughter to find in her current IRL circles of acquaintance. The interface is natural, stylish and encourages collaboration and artistic dialogue (by which I mean dialoguing by means of drawing and adaptation rather than snarky comments).  I don't know how many art professionals are using this, but that' s not the point ... it's a community of people who want to communicate through artistic expression.
