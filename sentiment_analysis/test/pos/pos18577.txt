I am using this on iPad Pro 9.7" and it works amazingly well. While I am an Apple proponent, after trying 6 different styluses, including the Apple Pencil, I can give you the assurance that this stylus meets and exceeds all my expectations. I would put it on part with the Apple Pencil. Works equally well on my iPhone too! Don't hesitate to try this, you won't be disappointed!
