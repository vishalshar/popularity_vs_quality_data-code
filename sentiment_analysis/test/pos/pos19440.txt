After buying the Neck Track for the set of Massage Track massage balls I had, I went forward with this purchase too.  This holder has been super for back, stomach, and more.  Massage Track support is helpful and friendly and answered all my questions.  After being released from physical therapy I turned to these products and they have been instrumental in keeping on with physical therapy at home.
