We have only had this camera for an hour and I am thoroughly impressed! The app is great on iOS 9.3, the video quality is incredible, and the customization is just what we were looking for!We had the iBaby M6 (because I didn't do my research to realize they had newer products out besides the M6T [which had bad reviews]) and had an awful time with it. It was giving us motion notifications when we wanted sound notifications, the picture quality was not very good, it was hard to find a good place to set it for a good view of the room, my wife's phone stopped receiving notifications from it, ETC (I'll stop there). All that being said, this is a HUMUNGOUS step up...and it was CHEAPER!So happy with this purchase. Hoping that we stay impressed with it.OH! Didn't even realize when I ordered it that it came with a mount. That was such a great idea! Completely counter-acts the issues in other models of not being able to look down well.
