Best thing that ever happened for our wayward Husky mix. Now we know immediately when he decides to "ramble" and can go find him quickly. The app has worked perfectly for us and a brief contact with customer service was very helpful and friendly. Every pet owner that has a dog or cat that likes to go visit the neighbors should have one of these. I would definitely buy it again.
