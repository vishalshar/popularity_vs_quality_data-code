My daughter (6 years old) and I played this just about every day for a month. 6 months later and it is still a weekly play. Her addition and subtraction is well advanced of her first grade requirements and she has even learned may multiplication facts.I give this game my highest recommendation.(PS be sure not to skip the bonus fun of creating your own Prime Cards with the included blanks.)
