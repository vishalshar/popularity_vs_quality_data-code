Bought this one when they offered a $50 off promo code. I have a Logitech G710 blue switch keyboard as well. Though these two are cherry blue, they feel different due to the materials of the keycaps and the body.G710 has slightly longer touch distance and a bit louder. Qwerky, of course, looks way cooler but smaller. Battery is a worth-mentioning feature; I haven't charged it for about 2 months and I used it for 8 hours a day. It disconnects with my mac about every 3 - 5 mins (I guess it's for saving battery), but once reactivated, like when I was typing "qwerky", "q" would sometimes be used as a reactivate command and only showed "werky".O-rings can't be used in this keyboard.In sum, I would still recommend this keyboard. You will be the STAR in your office, if your colleagues didn't kill you for being so clicky.
