Oh my goodness!  So I just got this beautiful silver aluminum beasty with instructions which read sets up in one minute and I was super scepticle but I promise you it's true.  Take this out of the box, screw in the tiny antenna, plug in the power cord, hook up your RCA cables (all included by the way) push the power button, hit the Bluetooth thing on your device and look for your Relay and Bam your listening to music.  I am throwing back adult beverages listening to Joey DeFrancesco on my iPhone 5c (music phone) from across the room (20 feet) from my MacIntosh MC7270 while it sends beautifully DACed (is that a word?) through my Klipsch Heritage speakers!  I couldn't be more thrilled!  Now I can skip all the obnoxious YouTube ads without jumping up every three or four songs...awesome!  Get you one now before Trump finds out, buys the company and ruins it!  :)
