Excellent laptop!!! I was seeking a laptop after my Asus ROG screen started going out. I know I wanted a fast processor with at least 8 gbs of ram. I saw this baby for $870 that came with an I7, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. I had to jump on it. I got the extra memory to up it to 16GB of ram and so far so smooth. As soon as I turned the laptop off it recognized the ram. The computer holds a battery life for about 6 hours when just surfing the web. The keyboard takes a little to get use to as it's doesn't feel as premium as my Asus ROG, but that's a very minor issue. Get this laptop if you need an on the go / gaming/ editing computer!
