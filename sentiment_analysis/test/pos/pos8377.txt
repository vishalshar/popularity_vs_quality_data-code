This is a great way to keep your workout clothes clean. I fought the musty smell in my running clothes and got tired of vinegar and baking soda washes and knew there was a better way. After some research, I learned about HEX and am a convert. So easy to use and leaves a faint clean smell without clogging the fabric at all. Great solution to stinky clothes problem.
