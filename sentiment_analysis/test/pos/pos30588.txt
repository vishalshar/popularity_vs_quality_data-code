I got this for my husband to use with his new iPhone 6 because he had enjoyed using a quadlock case with his iPhone 5 so much.  He was happily surprised that this one has an even better design than his old one.  The back is totally sealed up so that water cant get inside and that was the only thing that worried him with the one he had for his old phone, even when he used the poncho on it the back was still not totally protected. The quad lock company website has a video that describes this improvement in detail.  By introducing an internal cover plate and soft microfiber lining they were able to seal the rear of the case.Hubby uses this with the quadlock system armband for running, and also on the Bike Mount Pro.  He even uses it for a phone mount in his car because he can strap the bike mount to his steering wheel.  Personally I prefer my phone to be mounted elsewhere, but he loves it - and he does a lot of traveling with his job.  He doesnt like any of the suction cup type mounts or vent clip style either.  To each their own, right?  So anyhow, no matter where he goes or what he is doing, he always has a way to keep his phone right where he wants it with the quad lock case.I'd like to add that I had no trouble at all removing the case just now when I was getting pics, and it was easy enough to put it back on too.  I didn't even worry that I might chip a fingernail.  I had noticed that at least one other reviewer had said it was difficult to remove, and so I was surprised at how easy it was.  Of course it is secure enough that it definitely will not come off unless you are really meaning to remove it.
