I love this soap! Made in the US from ethically sourced ingredients (I emailed their customer service and asked about their palm oil) I feel confident using this soap. It works well for me, but like they said, definitely use a moisturizer after because it can dry out your skin. It doesn't turn everything black either like some people might think because it has charcoal. Overall I've had a great experience with this company (and their recyclable packaging!)
