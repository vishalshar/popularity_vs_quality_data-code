Love these caps!  Makes my third one and just use it for everything!  I make my own home brew cold coffee and this works great to pour into a glass.  The only problem I guess is two fold.  It is a bit hard to open/unclick and when you do the whole thing comes unclicked - both ends - where it attaches to the cap itself and the place where you pour the liquid from.  Second problem is after you click everything back on and tilt the jar to pour the cap falls back down and somehow you have to hold the cap part up enough to pour while holding the jar itself.  A bit difficult to manage BUT this stills works for me so I am happy with these caps.  I have bought 3 - two wide mouth and one regular mouth so although I might be a bit disappointed, they do the job!  Also, glad they offer these in so many colors!  Love the choices!
