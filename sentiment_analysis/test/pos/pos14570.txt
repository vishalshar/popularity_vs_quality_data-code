I'm very satisfied with this purchase.  I have curly hair and need the diffuser on the days that I don't straighten my hair.  I was nervous to order this diffuser because I ordered the Elchim 3900 on the same day based on ratings and reviews.  I noticed other buyers reviews stated this didn't fit the blow dryer so I was hesitant.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out it fit perfectly! I'm very happy.
