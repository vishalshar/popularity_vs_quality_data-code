I bought this set for my 4 and 7 year olds upon a recommendation.  Right after opening the box, they dove in and created an alien monster and a rocket ship with no instruction.  It's always great to see your kids use their imagination!  The pieces are easy to put together and pull apart.  They are also quite sturdy.  My 7 year old wanted to build the pictures on the box, so I opened up the Yoxo website which is where you're instructed to go to find dozens of downloadable instructions.  The website is great and easy to navigate.  In no time, she was able to follow the instructions and put together the "cruiser."  We look forward to building some of the other things from the site. I highly recommend this product.
