I've have my Sansaire for about a year and a half at this point and use it weekly.  I absolutely adore it.  I buy meat in bulk, sear it off if I want to (or not) and seal up meal sized portions in vacuum sealed bags. I thaw them in the freezer and drop them in the pot and go about whatever I need to get done and in about an hour I've got an amazing, easy to clean up, meal.  Not only is it easy but the food is sooooo much better (and better for you since you don't need additional fat to cook depending on what you're doing).  I bought mine directly from the site but wanted to leave a review and a few pics. I even use it to keep a water bath the right temp for making and stretching mozzarella!
