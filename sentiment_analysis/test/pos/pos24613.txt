My husband and I have gotten the Bare Fruit fuji and granny smith apples before from our local grocery store, but have never had any of the other options that are available in this box. As soon as it was opened he immediately opened the apricots and proceeded to eat them all! Very yummy and healthy snack options that are great for kids too!
