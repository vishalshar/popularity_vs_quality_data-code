I like it but it is so small I seem to have lost it. Also not a fan of no recharge or battery replacement option. My worry is that if I do use it the battery will get drained diminishing its capabilities and when I need it in a pinch it wont have enough Battery juice to do the job. It needs a rechargeable option.
