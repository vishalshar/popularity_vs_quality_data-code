A lot of these reviews are not for this mouse. It was not released till 12/04/2013.[...]Great mouse though. ADNS-3310 gaming grade optical sensor, best optical gamingmouse right now! All reviews are excellent everywhere for it!Some mouse pads can be a problem though. The Steelseries 4HD or 9HD work great!A Xtrac ripper does not work. Analyzer Tool (S.Q.A.T tests the surface for you.9HD/4HD test 100%. Anyway, very comfortable. Excellent FPS mouse!Much better than an old Deathadder.
