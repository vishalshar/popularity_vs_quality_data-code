Love these headphones! I have been searching for a good pair of headphones to take to work and these are perfect. They are noise cancelling and comfortable on my ears. I work in a classroom where on my planning time another teacher will have students in the room, so these will be perfect to tune them out. With separate cords for iPhone and Samsung to have the best sound quality these are perfect for anyone who loves to listen to music.
