Canary is a great product. I started with one but currently have 4 Canary cameras in use for 6 months now. One of my cameras malfunctioned after a few months but this was promptly RMA'ed and replaced with a new one when I wrote in. Customer service was responsive and excellent. The combination of wide angle vision, environmental sensing/logging, video history on the free plan and phone geolocation-based activation puts the Canary above the Dropcam and Foscam, both of which I also currently use but have limited subsets of these features. I have accessed my Canary cameras from multiple geographic locations around the world during work travel without any problems. All things considered, it's the top contender in its class.
