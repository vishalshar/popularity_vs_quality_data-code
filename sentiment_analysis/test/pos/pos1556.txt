I bought this for my 11yo son's birthday.  I was afraid that many people here complained it got bored easily after a while.  Fortunately my son is having fun with it still after a few weeks. One down side is.... his friend from neighborhood keeps coming to our house to play with it. Several times a day!  :)  Overall it's a bit pricey but kids love it.[Pros]- Fun!- Built sturdy. My a year Spaniel tried to ruin it as she always does with other toys, but she failed![Cons]- Fun! (Dinner time intruders seeking Ollie fun from neighborhood) :)- A bit pricey
