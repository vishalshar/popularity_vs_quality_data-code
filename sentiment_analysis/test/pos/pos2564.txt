This thing is super cool! I am a huge geek anyway and was recently looking for a way to open / close my garage door remotely. Our exterior-mounted control panel eats batteries like it's been on a diet for too long. ;)There were several other options out there that gave status updates as well as remote control for phones, but they all required a separate (battery-operated) unit that spoke to the control unit. I didn't want to have to fight with another battery-operated unit. A couple other options used bluetooth, but I wanted something I could control remotely if someone needed to get into my house when I wasn't around.This uses a laser beam and a reflector (that's on your door) to determine the door status. It connects via wifi and the cloud to let you get updates and control it.I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could because even this is not perfect: getting it installed took me quite a few days because my garage door opener manufacturer had a setup that required an adapter (I purchased on ebay). And I do get occasional false notifications from the app.BUT - the customer service/assistance from the Garadget designer/inventor himself (via the help system and website) is extraordinary. He's extremely responsive and goes out of his way to help everyone who asks questions.Plus there are other geeks on the website who have found other crafty ways to integrate this device with things like location services on your phone - so that it opens when you pull on your street. So happy I bought this thing. You should, too. :)
