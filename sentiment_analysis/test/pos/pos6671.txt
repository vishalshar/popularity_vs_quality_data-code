I've owned the Enclave CineHome for several months now and love it!  It was incredibly easy to set up and while I didn't actually time myself, I think I was up and running in less than 20 minutes with half of that just unpacking all the boxes and figuring out where I wanted to place the speakers.  The quality of sound was a absolutely incredible...hard to believe it's wireless.  I've used Bluetooth speakers and I've tried speakers over wifi, but they both traded audio quality for lack of wires and I had constant issues with syncing the audio to perfectly match the video.  With WiSA, I cannot tell the difference in audio quality compared to wired speakers...and quite frankly I think they're better than most wired speakers!  In 4 months, I've had zero syncing issues.  I will be purchasing again for another TV in my house.
