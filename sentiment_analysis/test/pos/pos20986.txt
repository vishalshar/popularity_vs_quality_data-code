Pros: For such a small device, the RIF Cube packs a punch! Pictures dont do it justice. Was a little skeptical after taking it out of the box for the first time, but that was quickly put to rest. The quality is amazing. Even the sound works great if youre watching a movie in a hotel room.After using it multiple times for work, the RIF6 Cube has worked flawlessly. For longer presentations, Ill use the power source plugged into a wall. Havent had an issue when relying on the battery for 45-75 minutes. Love that you can use it with phone, computer, iPad, and even a gaming system! Ended up using an old school NES with it (using an AV to HDMI converter) this weekend and was a huge hit! You have not lived life until youve played Battletoads and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on a 90.The packaging was phenomenal. I wish every company would have labels on all the cords!Cons: Bluetooth and keystone addition would be great additions to future models, even it cost a few extra bucks. Some of the cords were for older phones so had to purchase a lightning to HDMI adapter, but knew that going into it so wasnt a big deal.For $300, the RIF6 Cube is a great purchase! Cant wait to see what the company comes out with next!
