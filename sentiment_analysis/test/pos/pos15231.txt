We love the Canary Flex.  Beautiful packaging and product design.  Extremely fast and simple setup.  The addition of bluetooth makes installation even faster than the original.In addition to the new magnetic base, wall mount, and the fact that it is resistant to the elements for use outside, the Canary Flex offers all of the features we have come to love about its older brother including crisp audio, hi-def video resolution, and the peace of mind that comes with having a constant eye our our home while we are traveling; all in a sleek, portable, wireless shell.
