Fitting these was easier than I was expecting. After getting both sides set, my  right side felt a bit open. Instead of reboiling the mold, I heated it with a hair drier (as suggested in the directions) and pushed them in a bit harder. Now both sides fit 100Â‰ Great noise isolation, I can't imagine these falling out either. Love how they fit custom to my ears.Sound is OK- a bit bass heavy. I listen to a lot of ska music (every gen) and these maybe aren't always ideal. Using a few songs by The Slackers for an example, if the bass guitar is playing, it really overpowers the vocals and horns (these are wompy headphones). My several hundred dollar pair sounds better. But these are perfectly fine for listening,  I've been enjoying my music from them as long as I don't try to analyze the quality.I don't like bringing my expensive headphones everywhere (can't take them out on the bike trails either!), and these are such great-fitting cheap headphones. I like them a lot so far, music isn't as clean as I'd like, but they're better than the cheapos I recently tossed. Hard not to recommend them unless you're just really picky about sound quality. If you're interested in or used to headphones at this price point, you will probably like them just fine.Would love decibullz to build a version with better drivers, I would definitely be interested in a better quality version!
