Let me just say.. I hate peas. I refuse to eat peas. I can't eat peas in a stew, raw, in a dish, any way. But let me tell you... bbq peas are my all time favorite snack. If I could buy these by the pound I so would. They're not salty like a potato chip. They are smoky, savory, little pieces of happiness.
