"Non-chafing fabric provides long wearing comfort, Nylon/Poly/Spandex blend for ease of movement" - Yes. The fit is snug, but you still don't really feel them."Quick-drying for ease of wear from surf to sand" - No. It took almost 12 hours to dry from soaking wet handing on a line and was obviously still wet after 6 hours. I don't consider that quick drying. It's not a big deal because they are so light, but I was hoping for something I could wear around a water park and not be damp all day.
