I got a sample of this in one of my Ipsy subscriptions, not really expecting much. But after using just the small sample once or twice a week, I really did see noticeable improvement on my acne scar-ridden, discolored skin. My pores shrank a good deal and I really feel like it has helped even my overall skin tone quite a bit. I have extremely sensitive skin, so finding something that didn't harm my skin at all was a relief. I'd recommend it.
