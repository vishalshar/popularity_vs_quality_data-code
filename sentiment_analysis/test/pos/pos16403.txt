I have oily skin and large pores and this along with the SUCTION tip (separate) is amazing! The sebum literally sucks right out. You have to wash your face first and them use a steamer so you can loosen the dirt. If you dont have a steamer you can you a warm towel on the face for a few min. Make sure when you use the suction tip your fsce has some water on it(very little) makes gliding over skin easier and not damaging. I use the highest power. I put Vitamin C serum on after. I used it once with microderm crystals and It works ok. Saw minimal peeling.
