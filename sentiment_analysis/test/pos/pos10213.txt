Fairly easy to install. Sometimes the camera occasionally puts out false positives and incorrect movement type classification. I would prefer if the mounting angle was wider, and some UI issues, but not a deal breaker. Requires some finesse with electrical wiring and if your junction box isn't recessed inside the wall you can mount Presence on top just fine. I recommend assigning a static IP to Presence through your router using the MAC address. Cuz even if Presence loses its WIFI connection it can still reconnect relatively fast when the WIFI is back on.
