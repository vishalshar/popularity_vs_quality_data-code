I see a lot of people talking about weight loss in the reviews but I wanted to bring up a different point. Not to get super soul-baring but my eating disorder recovery has been pretty rocky. Several years later it's still a daily struggle and it's only just starting to get easier. There are some days when I just can't deal with food, when the whole process of preparing it and feeding myself, despite being such a simple task, overwhelms me. It gets really easy to fall back into old habits and just talk myself out of eating at all. Having Soylent around the house stops that whole train in its tracks, because there's nothing difficult about opening a bottle and drinking 14 ounces of liquid instead of standing in the kitchen having a slow nervous breakdown over the steps involved in microwaving a pre-packaged macaroni and cheese. I don't even have a chance to get started on the freakout. If I'm hungry but I'm too tired or drained or just plain lazy, I drink a Soylent and then I don't have to worry about food for several blissful hours, which is an amazing feeling and one that I treasure, one I haven't felt in a really long time.So, yeah. Soylent's pretty cool.
