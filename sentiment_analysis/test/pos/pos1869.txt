I recently purchased the newest model of MacBook and I did so online. I knew it only had the one port for the charger on the computer but I did not occur to me at the time how annoying that would really be until I finally received the laptop. I knew I couldn't live like that, with one charging port, how was I supposed to do anything!! This little device saved the day. It matches the color of my laptop perfectly and it allows me to do all of the things I need to when it comes to plugging things into my laptop. If you have this computer this is a must.
