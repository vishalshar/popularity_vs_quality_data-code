I bought this for business and personal use. I tested this in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand when I was on vacation this month. It was easy to operate. It was instantly connected to network as soon as ready. Speed were good but based on locations like smart phone. I am going to test it in eastern Europe coming week when on my business trip.
