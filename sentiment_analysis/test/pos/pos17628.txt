Nice, images are crisper than before on my Phantom 4. Note that these lenses replace what is on the Phantom 4. Unscrew the original lens, screw on one of the new, that simple. Too me, this is a must have for the P4. I also ordered a case Anbee Camera Lens Filter Case Bag Storage Box for DJI Phantom 3, Phantom 4 Quadcopter Filters to keep things organized while adding a replacement lens (use as a backup) of the original Anbee Multi-coated MC UV Camera Lens Filter for DJI Phantom 4 Quadcopter. Note that the P4 gimble is also working fine with these lenses as well (not to heavy).
