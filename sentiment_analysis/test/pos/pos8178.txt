A nicely designed product, functions well. The app might be better though - for ex. I don't want the background service to run at all - no option to disable this.Be sure to follow the bold red text inside the package which says "make sure there is at least 10mm gap between sensor and other motorcycle parts". I did not pay enough attention to that, which resulted in rear sensor being damaged by suspension and brake calipers right after I attached it and moved the bike a bit. My fault, luckily the thread on the sensor is softer then on the stem, so I only had to re-pump the tire. The sensor is a waste now though. I will be looking into in-wheel sensors now.
