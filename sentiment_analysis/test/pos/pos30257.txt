I have been very pleased with my purchase. The Robin is a high-value device - lot's of phone for the money.  Nextbit has been active in the support of the product and software and is readily accessible from Twitter, Reddit, and from their website.  The security updates and feature improvements are frequent.  The Robin is scheduled to be among the first non-Google Android phones that will receive Nougat (reportedly to become available in 16Q4) and, because the phone is unlocked, you'll get the updates as soon as Nextbit pushes them out.  I also own an iPhone 6S and I prefer the Robin as my daily driver. While the iPhone costs hundreds of dollars more, I perceive no real added value that justifies the added cost.
