What an amazing concept.  The case claims to stick to any flat surface.  I have found this to be basically true.  If you stick it to an extremely smooth service it will stick so well it's almost impossible to remove.  Great for having a recipe or watching a game while I'm cooking in the kitchen.  I do find that it doesn't hold as well to walls painted with eggshell paint, or if there is enough surface area.  I have an almost smooth as glass surface in my car that it won't hold on because it isn't wider than two inches.  The case is about the same size as your normal rubber case.  I find it useful to use when I need to have my phone stuck to something, but if not I use my slip case.
