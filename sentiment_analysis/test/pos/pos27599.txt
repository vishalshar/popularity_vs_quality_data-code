Had this computer several weeks.  Took it on a work trip across the country.  I really like it.  Great price.  Quality feel.  For about a week, was thinking that the monitor was a bit disappointing, but then I realized they ship it with the default brightness turned way down.  Once I bumped up the brightness, completely acceptable and pleased.  You'll probably find some better for more money, but I would purchase it again.  With the GEFORCE GTX 960M, I am able to play World of Tanks on the maximum settings with no issue.  Nice!  The fan does get a bit louder while gaming, but only then and not too bad.  Nice to have a gaming ready computer, thin, light, that looks like a business computer.  I would not be embarrassed to break this out in a business meeting.  The computer I was looking for.  Only thing I would change would be to have this same computer as a 14" model instead of 15" but not a deal breaker.
