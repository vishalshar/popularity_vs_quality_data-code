Very excited to get this for Christmas!  I had been wanting one for months and was so excited to get it!  It was extremely easy to set up, and the instructions were very straight forward.  My only complaint about set up is that the power cord is short. I was limited in where I could place the cube because I needed it connected to power.  For $200 would be nice to have a few different cord lengths so that it was less of a limitation.  Aside from that I love the product.  I love checking in on my dog when I am at work, and while he doesn't really care about laser pointers its a cool feature.  He also really responds when he hears my voice!  I definitely recommend the product.  I was borderline between a 4 and 5 star, just wish the power cord was longer.  Great product for all those out there that can't be with their pets 24/7!
