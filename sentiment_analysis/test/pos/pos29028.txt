Wanted to take some time with this scale before writing a review and I must say after two weeks of use it's become a solid part of my routine. For starters it's durable and well calibrated which makes it better than half the digital scales on the market I've owned. Most are off by as much as 3 pounds which can make a huge difference if you need to be a certain weight and need to monitor your progress. Speaking of monitoring your progress this scale is awesome for that, it is backed by a very lightweight app you can use on your Android and iPhone, where it'll show you a fair approximation of your BMI and, more importantly, chart your progress on weight management, things get real when you actually see those peaks and valleys on your weight, making this scale not only a tool, but a great motivator to stay the course. I thoroughly recommend it.
