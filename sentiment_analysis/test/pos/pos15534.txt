So here it is...I've been through the smartwatch gadget phase. The poking, swiping, the buzzing and the charging, and charging and charging. In the end I had to sit down and truly analyze what was essential. Specifically, what would help me the most, without having to touch the thing the same as I do currently with the phone?The watch has two dials: the time and the get-off-your-butt progress dial. With either, I can instantly see where I am based upon my goal of getting off my butt.I set the goal--in my case, training for a half marathon--and it shows my daily progress toward that goal. It's that simple. And I can honestly say, it's that effective.With an 8 month battery I'm liberated from yet another thing to charge. And, I'm no longer need to be concerned with whether my tank of gas will get me home.The accompanying app tracks/does all that I need:  Exercise, sleep, alarm, etc.I guess I am throughly enjoying the simplicity of an elegant watch that also possesses truly smart features with automatically tracking, without interaction.Brilliant.
