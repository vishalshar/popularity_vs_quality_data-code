Does what it says and has lots of potential and is worth the price, but app could use some improvements.  No obvious way to stop test alarm so it keep going (very annoying).Also no way to local device from phone other than map level.  Need a way to make decide make sound or have a "local detector mode" to sense how close the device is to help find it.App interface could be more intuitive.Could use more options, like triple-click.Overall I like it and am happy, I just would like some updates to the app.
