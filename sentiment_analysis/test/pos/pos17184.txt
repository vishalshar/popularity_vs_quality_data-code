Okay. I do not write reviews often. I think I have written 3 maybe 4. I am one of the very few that contract eczema as an adult. It started with a bunch of what I like to call "hand pimples" when I am living in a hotel room for months at a time. Immediately I say "must be poison Ivy/oak/sumac. Because I must have been stupid and got into some. Go to the quick clinic and they say "Oh, yep that must be it!!" Get some steroid shots, some pills and I am on my way!!But like Die Hard, it came back....with a Vengeance. So now instead of all over my hands, its on my neck, stomach, backs of knees, and elbows. I say "Well S***, You must have been lazy and didn't wash your jeans or something". HELLLOOOO Quick Clinic. "Yep, poison Ivy, give me steroids"Healed...for nowSo it happens again. I go back to the quick clinic tell them I have been on steroids more or less for the past 2 months. Apparently this is bad. They will not treat me, tell me to go to a Dermatologist. So I pay unreal amounts of money to go. She takes a chunk of my skin (still have a scar btw). They determine its Eczema. Freaking Super.So the Dermatologist gives me this great list of things I have to change about my life such as:Shampoo: Johnson's baby shampooSoap: CetaphillLaundry Detergent: All Free and Clear (Crazy Expensive)And all other kinds of stuff. Like I can't wear polyester etc.I do all of this. Yet it still comes back. Horribly. I go to Amazon (Cause I think I am going to outsmart the doctor psssshhh Stupid)I get this stuff called Calmoseptine, Metaderm, etc. Basically I spent like 150 bucks on Eczema Treatment.Calmoseptine did WONDERS for the itching, and it seemed like it slowed the spread of my eczema (which is now all over my body). But as far as getting Calmoseptine off your skin and clothes its impossible. Well I ran out of it when I went to Denver and Eastern Colorado aka the driest place in the USA. Only had this stuff called "Metaderm" Which says 12 weeks to cure Eczema (Which is why I never used it...I want the quick fix!! Screw this stuff!!) So I put it on my skin.Longer story less long. This stuff somehow works. I do not know how. I do not know why, I really do not care. But holy S***. I am without topical steroids, Elodil or whatever it is for the first time in a year. This stuff works better than steroids people. I cannot tell you how lucky I am to have found this. I have ordered it recurring monthly. I will order it forever.I got back from CO 6 days ago. Eczema was all over my arms, face, stomach, legs, and feet. I have been using this after I shower and before bed. My eczema is completely gone from my arms, face, and stomach. Its still on my legs and feet, because it was on there for like 6 months prior and never fully healed but for once...its healing. Give this stuff a shot people. It really changed my life. I CAN USE HEAD AND SHOULDERS AGAIN!!!
