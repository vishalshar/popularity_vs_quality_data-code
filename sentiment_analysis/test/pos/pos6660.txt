Bought this for my grandson. I looked at about 50 bikes before making this purchase. Bike is made of high quality material and built very well. My grandson is a rough and tumble child, might be a linebacker some day. I refer to him as "leads with his head". This bike will last until he outgrows it and it will be handed down.
