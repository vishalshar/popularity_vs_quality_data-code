I was traveling for a race and needed a wipe for my gear check bag.  I sweat a lot when running, plus, I have sensitive skin.  Regular wipes felt like they stung my skin.  I heard about this product from a fellow runner and decided to try it out.  I loved it.  No noticeable scent upon opening the individual pouch.  I wiped my face, arms and legs and no stinging at all.  I would highly recommend this item and plan to take it to future events.
