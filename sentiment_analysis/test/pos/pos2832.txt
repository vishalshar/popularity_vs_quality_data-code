I bought this one by accident. I was looking at a few different WiFi plugs for my AC and for my lights. I had added a few to wish lists so I could check them all out but somehow this one ended up in the shopping cart. I went a little crazy shopping on Prime day and checked out with this in the cart. That night I went back to look and see what all was coming. I tried to cancel this item but it was to late. I had bought 3 from a different company for different appliances in my house. Today I got up and tried to set up one of those but I couldn't even get the App to set up let alone give me an option to start something up. Needless to say I was not a happy camper and have the items boxed up to go back. Then while I was sitting here pouting and angry I remembered this was in one of the boxes. I figured I may as well try it and if it didn't work it was going back as well. I should have bought 3 of these and run from the other company. This literally took me about 10 minutes to set up on my Android phone. Part of the reason I thought I couldn't use it was because I don't have Amazon Echo well it works with an Android and was extremely easy to set up. I will be ordering 2 more.One thing I had to play with a little was when I tried to set it up it said to push a button on my router I didn't have so I clicked on the manual set up. When I did that it turned the light green but then when I tried to sign back into the app it wouldn't do it, I realized I had to go back into my WiFi and sign back into mine instead of whatever it was doing to set up the device.
