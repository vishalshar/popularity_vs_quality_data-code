I dog-sit for a friend on occasion. He doesn't walk his un-fixed Lab very often and he is a real handful. Walking both dogs on two regular leashes often results in a sore arm and them tying you up. What the dog coupler does is take the jerks and jolts of the one dog pulling and transfer it to the well behaved dog and away from you. Since you can also set the length between the dogs, you can also make sure that they have to really try hard to tie you up. This made my dog sitting much easier.
