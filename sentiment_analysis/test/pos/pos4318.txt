Post April update the phone is substantially better. It is also the deciding factor in getting the phone. Coming from the 5c it's really nice hardware wise and Marshmallow is as silky smooth as iOS. Easy to transfer between the 2. The phone is perfect in mint but if you work in a more serious setting then I recommend the midnight. Fingerprint reader is super quick and easy, that which is one of 3 physical buttons.Battery life is designed for casual use and not gaming. If that's what you want, you were better off with a handheld gaming device like PS Vita. Keep in mind the default for cloud storage is while charging and on wifi, leave it there. Speakers are amazing and do exceptional work for music. Camera is decent not a DSLR but a functional easy to use camera.
