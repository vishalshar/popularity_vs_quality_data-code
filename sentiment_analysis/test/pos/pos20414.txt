Our mixed breed dog learned super fast. We use the sound as a warning to let him know what was coming next (the zap). He learned in no time. Now, if he is having a bad day, we use ONLY the sound warning and he knows to stop the barking. We didn't want to get to the point of having to use this kind of training, but given that it was that or surrender him to the shelter, we used it as a last resort. We would have never let anyone but us decide how often or how strong to go with the intensity of the zap. The zap is not painful (both my husband and I tried it on our neck) but it is uncomfortable.
