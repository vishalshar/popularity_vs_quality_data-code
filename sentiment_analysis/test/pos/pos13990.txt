I bought this mousepad, because I wanted a low profile plastic or aluminum mouse pad. I didn't want a mouse pad too big or too small, and this one is in that mid range size that works well. I was a bit concerned about this product not working with certain mice, but my G500 tracks smooth as butter. The surface of this mouse pad is peppered with what appears to by micro sized metalics, and the resistance is just enough to keep your mouse from sliding out of control, but not enough to restrict any movements. It's hard to explain this all, but this mouse pad just works 99% perfect. Good tracking, good resistance, good size. The only thing, I must say that's wrong, is the mouse pad is 1-2 inches horizontally too long for my desk. My CMStorm keyboard(with no numkeys) still overlaps the mouse pad.
