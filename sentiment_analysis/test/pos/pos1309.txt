This is my second Canary device  I purchased the original back in 2015.The product & service is perfect for what I am looking for: passive monitoring of my home (now office too) when Im not there, and Im not particularly interested in a monthly service plan. The algorithm theyve built to identify suspicious movement that I can verify on my phone is exactly what I was seeking.Canary Flex is an improvement on the original model in four areas:1) Built-in battery  long-life, dont have to plug in if you recharge weekly2) Outdoor usage / weatherproof3) Flexible magnetic base allows for vertical (up/down) movement4) Long power cord A+++++++++++The battery is certainly the most useful addition and its built-in  this is critical for me, since I have a battery backup on my internet & communications it will continue to work even in the event of a power loss.Key for me was integration into the app that I already have on my phone  seamless set-up connecting to the wifi and all set. Now I have monitoring capabilities via Canarys software both at home and my office.Considering another unit to watch the back door as well.Overall a quality device integrated with a great service that connects directly with your smartphone.
