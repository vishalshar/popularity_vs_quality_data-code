This stuff is awesome! And I could totally see it being addictive. Bought it to make my own wax seal stamp for some packaging since having a custom one made in metal was soooo pricey. Just rolled it in a ball and squished it on a bottle end and carved my design in with a clay carving tool I had around the studio. Now I'm wondering what else I could do with this!
