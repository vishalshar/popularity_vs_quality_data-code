My first worry was that it was going to be more of a toy than a tool. I'm a paranormal investigator and upon field testing it the first time I can comfortably say this is a great alternative to the expensive Flir units. While a contractor or someone in the building trades may want a more sophisticated device, speaking for the paranormal community as an internationally known investigator, buy it...you'll love it!
