This little cap is fantastic. I attached it to a quart sized mason jar and I keep that jar filled with quinoa. This cap makes it so that I can easily poor my quinoa into a measuring cup for cooking and keeps my food fresh. I'll likely be buying more of these in the future so that I can store all sorts of other goods, like lentils and dried beans.
