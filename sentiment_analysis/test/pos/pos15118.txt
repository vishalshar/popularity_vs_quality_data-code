This product solved my billow-y, clingy shower curtain in one shot, and now I'm just sorry I waited so long to buy it!  Now that I have it installed, the shower curtain stays right where it should be.  In fact, due to the way it pulls the curtain outwards a little bit, there's an extra 1-2 inches of space that wouldn't be there if the curtain just hung straight.Installation seemed tricky at first, since it was a little challenging to place both pieces on either side of the curtain in the correct spot at the same time.  It became trivial, though, when I figured out that you can just snap the pieces together wherever, and drag it into the proper position afterwards, since the magnets don't pinch hard enough that you can't move it around.
