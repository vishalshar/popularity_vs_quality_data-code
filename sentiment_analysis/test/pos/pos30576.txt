This mounting rig is a worthwhile addition to your GoPro mounting kit. I shoot primarily on my Canon DSLR and use an over the shoulder bag to hold my lenses. It is great to be able to have another camera running while shooting my primary footage. I have used the footage from the backup camera mounted with this product several times. This is THE most solid clamp for mounting on straps I have yet used.
