I've had this case for several weeks now, and I can truly say that it was money well spent.  It is rugged yet attractive looking.  Also, I have to give kudos to the company for including a extra couple of the tiny screws that hold the case together.  I didn't follow the instructions properly and didn't adequately tighten the screws that hold the case together.  When I discovered that one side of the case was coming apart due to one of the loose screws falling off, I figured I'd have to write a mea culpa to the company and ask them to send me another small screw.  Lo and behold, when I looked in the box to get the company contact info, I discovered that they included 2 spare screws in the plastic bag that contained the small allen wrench used to tighten the case.  That was a very pleasant surprise.  Since this case only covers the sides of the Apple Watch, the front and back are exposed.  There is no problem resting the watch and band on a charging stand.  Even though the face of the watch rests below the sides of the case, I highly recommend getting a good glass screen protector to put on the face.  I have had a glass screen protector on the face since I put the watch in the case and it still looks like new.  If it isn't already obvious, I highly recommend this outstanding case for your Apple Watch.
