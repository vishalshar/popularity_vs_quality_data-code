I got this computer for college a month ago and so far I am very satisfied. Battery life is reliable and lasts a good 4 hours of high performance use, extending way beyond that for low power use. Besides, you cannot get what this computer has for the price tag. A real bargain! Finally, this laptop has minimal bloatware and is great for gaming.
