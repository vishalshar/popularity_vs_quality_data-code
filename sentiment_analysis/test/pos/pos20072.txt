I had been looking for a Smart Sprinkler controller for a while but when I noticed that this was both compatible with Wink and Nest I went ahead and took the plug hoping that greater integrations were on the way. Even without Nest and Wink integration, this is a great smart controller.The install was simple. I just moved my zone wires over and plugged it in. I installed the mobile app on my android phone and went through the setup wizard which was simple enough. Connecting the controller to my WiFi was as simple as holding my phone screen up to an "eye" on the controller. The phone does a series of white/black screens to "program" the wifi setting to the device. After that, all the controls are made by the mobile app or "automatically" using the "Smart Cycle" and "Weather Sense" features.I have had the controller in for about 2 months and it has already made several adjustments to the watering times and skipped numerous cycles either b/c of current rain or forecasted rain.The best feature for me, that I didn't know about when I bought it, was that it can use personal weather station information if it is published to  MADIS, HamWeather, and PWSWeather networks. This allows me to use rainfall information of my exact address.I would recommend this controller to anyone who wants to save water.BTW, the Nest integration is rather simple for right now. It turns on all sprinklers when the alarm goes into alert.
