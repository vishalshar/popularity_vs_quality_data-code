This is the 3rd digital thermometer I've used that is integrated with Apple's HealthKit and it's by far the best.How accurate it is, remains to be seen, as it seems there's a bit of a learning curve to get consistent measurements. However, I'm starting to get better at taking my temp and getting consistent results.The Swaive was very nicely designed, but I could never get consistent results.The Kinsa seemed nice, but had a HUGE drawback if having to be plugged into the phone. Which brings up a HUGE issue that it's not compatible with the iPhone 7/7 Plus. If you use the adapter, you get an error saying that the left/right balance is off and needs adjusting.
