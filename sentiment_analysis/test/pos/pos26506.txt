Works well.  I got two of these (red and blue) to differentiate my cold brew coffee from my husband's cold brew decaf.  They work well overall.  The only frustrating thing is that when you pour the liquid out, the cap doesn't stay up on it's own, so it's a two-handed operation - one to pour and one to hold the cap up.  Otherwise, it doesn't leak, it serves it's purpose, and keeps us organized.
