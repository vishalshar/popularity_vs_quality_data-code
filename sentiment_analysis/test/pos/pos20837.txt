Been using these for a month and a half and I have to say that 90% of the times I would have reached into my backpack or pocket for my cheaters I now reach for these instead.  Most of the times I need cheaters, I need them for 30 seconds or less and for that these are perfection. As an added bonus they can be used easily with regular glasses due to the armless design.  The only fault I have is with the weak tape provided.  I would prefer a better tape and be allowed to install it myself.  The tape provided was not able to affix the case to my textured case.  I added 4 Velcro dots to the case and matching dots on my phone so it can be removed.  In phones with smooth and very flat or just slightly rounded back plates the provided tape should work fairly well.The ThinOPTICS stand up to cleaning well but the interior of the case has at times collected some grit that could possibly damage the lenses.  Whenever I run the lens cleaning cloth over the lenses I run it through the case on the tip of my knife to make sure it is clean in there as well.
