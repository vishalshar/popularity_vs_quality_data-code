Pros:- Lots of fun- Very fast on a smooth surface.- It actually can drive on thick carpet. (I was very impressed as the sphero 1.0 really sucked on thick carpet.)- Trick mode is a big hit with younger kids. They love seeing it bounce all over sporadically.- Powerful enough to even drive up a 20 degree inclined driveway.Cons:- In a house the ollie gets stuck along walls and chairs a lot.That is ok since there is a tricks mode that you can make the ollie spin and flip out of control and that usually gets the ollie away from the wall. I wish there was a button to make the ollie try to quickly move left and right until it doesn't hit any obstructions letting you resume your driving experience.- Will not reconnect after going out of range.I have not had success with the app reconnecting to the ollie after it gets out of range. I am sure this is a software issue that will be resolved but right now it is annoying.- No Stop button. Sometimes the ollie gets going quite fast and you need to stop it. It would be nice if there was a quick stop button to counter rotate the ollie in the opposite direction it is drving to slow it down quickly.Overall:Overall the ollie is quite expensive for a remote control car, but for those who want a cool new toy, or love to play around with new gadgets this thing is great.Don't let all the negative points dissuade you from getting the ollie. I was just pointing out a few annoyances to the product as it is now. I am sure some of them will be addressed with a software update in the future.
