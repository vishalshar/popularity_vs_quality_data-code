Love this. I threw away our other openers (the ones we didn't already lose). Quick and easy install and works perfectly. I bought two of these, one for each garage door. Range is good, works from about 2.5 car lengths away from door which is plenty. I have it simply mounted to the underside of the opener housing, so if you put it in another location away from metal the range may be longer. Can't beat not having to carry goofy openers or having to swap them between cars. A+
