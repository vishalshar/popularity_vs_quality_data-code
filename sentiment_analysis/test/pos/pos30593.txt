ABSOLUTELY love the Quad Lock series of products. I have the 6 plus case that works with my armband, bike mount, and car mount. The 6 plus is a big phone and it sits big on my arm. But that's no fault of the case or band and I have no doubt the phone is perfectly secure. I docked one star for this reason: I have a Tech Armor tempered glass screen protector on my phone. I notice that where the protector ends bumps right into the edges of the case causing the protector to lift. I wish the case would overlap the protector by just a smidge so the protector would lay suctioned to my screen.
