I have used every sleep aid under the sun (& moon ;) from Ambien, Lunesta, to Diphenhydramines, natural remedies and more.  None were effective, and unless you enjoy the bizarre side effects from the prescription options (personally I found rather unpleasant and gave a hangover) nothing got me to sleep or stay asleep.As a huge skeptic I considered "Dream Water" to be another load of over promises, but bought one anyway, probably because of the neat packaging and weirdly appealing "Snoozeberry" flavor.  Well in short, I am writing this review because after a week, it has worked for me.  Though I do not feel particularly tired by midnight, I am able to fall asleep and stay asleep with this product.The ingredients listed (Melatonin etc.) are nothing new to me, so I am unsure why it is effective or the mixture of their "Proprietary Sleep & Relaxation Blend 150mg) but I cannot complain.  Zero calories and tastes nice too.So overall, I give it 5/5.  Should it stop working (fingers crossed it does not) I shall revisit this review later.  Best of luck to the other insomniacs out there, and sleep well.
