What a great purchase for gaming. Got this for the Xbox 1 s to play battlefield 1 and chat. Wireless to the Xbox but cable to the controller in order to chat. Would have been great to be 100% wireless but the year things are very comfortable. I have  a very large head, or so I'm told,  and this thing fits and is very comfortable for long periods of time. If you are considering this get it. Great feel, construction , control locations are simple and intuitive. Definitely recommended
