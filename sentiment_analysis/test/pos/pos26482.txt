We got this because of the small thermos and the hot/cold lunch option. But we can't get it right. If the stew is still warm enough, so is her fresh fruit in the adjacent compartment. Sometimes it is cool already. So we have to be careful what we choose to send with the hot food. But we use it on a regular basis without the thermos. It's a very flexible arrangement and I like that. The left side can fit a small banana, the big center area can fit a small canister plus e.g. Cheese and crackers or fruit and veggies, etc. there is a leakproof compartment that works well. And the mineable divisor for the left side -- that isn't leak proof though. We learned that the hard way.
