Good product but I was expecting to be able to make a lot more coffee for how much it cost(How strong and how much I drink a morning may be more than is intended. I would have to use a lot of the concentrate to make it stronger). Originally, I got the product because of the convenience, but I will probably be going back to cold brewing myself because of the cost per day. I used all four bottles in ten days and I only drink one standard thermos cup per day.
