I'm 100% satisfied with this phone. If you are looking for simplicity in a smart phone and great customer support from Great Call you can't go wrong. The coverage and reception is so much better than my previous carrier. I actually like the size of the phone. When I first received it I wasn't sure if it was too big but it's better than expected. For the price, quality and customer service you can't go wrong. Get one, you'll be happy. I would recommend a case from Amazon to protect your phone.
