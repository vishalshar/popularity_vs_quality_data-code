I'm a professional studio / live guitarist and this wireless unit is one of the best investments I've made!This is the simplest and most easy to use wireless guitar device I've used, just charge up, plug in and you're ready to go for HOURS!The amount of range you get on this is insane. I've played on some very big stages and this holds up just fine with no drop outs. I've also stepped off stage and walked to the mixing desk and beyond - absolutely no drop outs in transmission. However at that kind of distance there is a delay in what you play and what you hear from the PA. (this was in a very big auditorium) In any case this gives you more than enough range you'll ever need.I've used this unit while recording in studios and it helps clean up the sound a bit and I'm free to move anywhere I want to.I've tried this on Electric guitar, Acoustic guitar, Bass guitar, Ukulele - all of which sounded fantastic through this unit. I've tried comparing the sound with a high quality platinum cable and to my ears there is no difference.However a bass player friend of mine couldn't use it on one of his basses. I suspect this has something to do with the particular jack on that bass.It could be a simple fix by simply replacing the jack with one that is compatible with this device.I dont see myself playing a gig, be it a big or small stage without this unit. Highly recommend the Relay G10!
