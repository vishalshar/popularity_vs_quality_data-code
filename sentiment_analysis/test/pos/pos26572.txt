I set up my Roost Smart Batteries today and I was very pleased with the whole experience. The step-by-step instructions in the app were very helpful, and ensured that I installed my batteries correctly.  Even though some of the sounds coming from the phone and battery during set-up were loud at times, it was nice to know that the connection was working. The battery fit into my smoke alarm easily, and the test sent a notification to my phone as promised. Well done Roost!
