I love how sturdy this charger cable is.  My reasoning for only 4 starts is the length.  Yes, I knew when I was ordering it was shorter than most but I do find it irritating at times.  Bought for the sturdiness of the cable.  I would definitely buy another if it was offered in a slightly longer length.
