Smart alarm clock with a long list of capabilitiesI backed BEDDI as a Kickstarter. Its jam-packed features is attractive. I have been playing with one for a month already, and yes I got quite a number of issues connecting with my HomeKit just like others. But their customer support is REALLY great and guide me step by step to solve every problem promptly! After following their instruction, most of my problems are solved, and thus I am now buying another one for my family.
