By far the most useful accessory on my key ring.I'm constantly out and about and instead of carrying a cable with me everywhere I just clip this to my keyring.It's absolutely perfect to work with my computer because it's just about the right height from my computer to the phone.  The flex in this cable is just perfect to make that connection.  Charging from the wall is a bit of a task when you need to hold the phone up but in a pinch is what it's for so that's to be expected!Wonderful little gadget.
