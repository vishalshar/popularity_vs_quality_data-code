Very fun to play with, conductivity is excellent. Minus one star for flexibility though: once this dries it appears quite prone to cracking, as was the case when trying to use it to light up an origami crane with traces drawn over folds sporadically failing. Overall very cool and seems to last quite a while. Price is high but difficult to find this product here in Canada!
