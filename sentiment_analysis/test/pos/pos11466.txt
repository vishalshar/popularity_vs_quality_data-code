This product really works well once you have it set up and at 70, it challenged me a bit, so I had to call D-Link's support.  I got to talk to Mr. Cantillas who knows his stuff.  He was patient and he listened to what I was trying to do and he walked me through it one step at a time and he never rushed me.  All tech support's should model after Mr. Cantillas; he is the best.  Anyway, I like this product and it will allow me to detect motion in my mom's house giving me assurance that she is moving about her house each day.  Right now it's working at my house and Mr. Cantillas has explained what I will do when I move it to my mom's house; but if I do have trouble, I have confidence that Mr. Cantillas will put me back on track with smiles.
