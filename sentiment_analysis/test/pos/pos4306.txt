As a meditator working in the field of health care and wellbeing I really like the idea behind Spire. I find Spire accurately identifies periods of calm, focus, and tension in relation to my breathing patterns. The 'stone' device is easy to wear and seems to be durable. The battery is supposed to be good for 5 days. I tend to recharge it overnight every two or three days and have never had it run out on me. One issue is that you must sync every 6 hours or your recorded data is lost. Everything works by bluetooth so this is not a problem... unless you are away from your phone.... something I suggest as a matter of practice. Also, breathing information is only recorded when at rest. The stone has a number of different vibrations to notify you about your breathing. Ultimately, I found all the buzzing to be a distraction. I used the Spire app, available from the App Store, to deactivate all notifications except 'no deep breaths for 30 mins'.
