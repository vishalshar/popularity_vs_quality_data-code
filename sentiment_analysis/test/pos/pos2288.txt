Edit (April 8th 2016): It appears after a few days of use the mouse has started to have big issues, mainly with the Mouse 3/4 buttons as well as the left clicks, resulting in an unresponsive Windows 10, affecting video editing and gaming. I have since contacted the manufacturer, will update on their feedback. This shouldn't affect the rest of the original review.Edit 2 (April 11th 2016): The mouse has been returned back to massdrop and the fixes through Mionix support channel (which was awesome, thanks Marcus) didn't help alleviate the issue. Thanks to the refund policy at massdrop hopefully everything gets sorted out a hundred percent. Such a shame for this to happen. Will be waiting for their next mouse in dev nonetheless!I've owned the Naos 7000 as my daily driver for a couple of years. Having already owned Rapoo and Razer in the past, the Naos just did everything right. The build quality, the simplicity, the "clickiness" of the buttons and the ergonomics are top-notch.Then I tried the Castor. Initial impressions were mediocre. I quickly realized the "rubbery" plastic material is a step-up from the Naos 7000. With an 18.5cm hand from middle finger to my wrist, here's what I liked and what I feel could be improved in the next iteration of Mionix's mice:What I like:* Super uber quality on the mouse surface. Bests even the Naos 7000* Sensor is right up there. Tracks well on my cloth mat.* Minimalist design* Buttons are not mushy and feel tactile* Lightweight* Braided cable doesn't pull the mouse weight down (less than the Naos 7000)* Super comfortable (more on this at the conclusion)What I feel could be improved:* The overall acoustics; sound of the clicks are kind of loud, and doesn't really complement the overall minimalist approach here.* The scroll wheel feels uhh.. okay, but each "step" of the scroll is audible.And that's it! There's isn't much to fix when it isn't broken. The formula Mionix has implemented in their mice is impeccable. However, if you have used the Naos like I have and you palm grip (with my hand size; 18.5cm top to bottom), then you will quickly realize that the Naos can be palm-gripped with superior comfort. Not by much, but it's noticeable. I still like the lightweight nature of the Castor much better so I'm using it as my daily driver at the moment.It's an amazing mouse that handles performance, design and ergonomics seriously. They don't even put RGB as the main selling point, now that RGB is blown over the water to appeal to gamers. Props to Mionix for that. If your hand is not large by any means, you're right-handed, and you wish to have a simple mouse on your table top, you can't go wrong with the Castor!
