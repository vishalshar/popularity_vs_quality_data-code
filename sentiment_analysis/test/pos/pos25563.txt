My daughter (1) and I are in love with these squeeze pouches! The consistency is perfect for my daughter to feed herself, as I don't need to worry about her squeezing it all over herself. I can just open it up, give her the pouch, and she will neatly and easily suck it out herself without making any mess! Its pretty wonderful. I also feel really good about the company and ingredient list, I'm not worried about anything inside. I'm considering having these automatically delivered every other week because we enjoy them so much.
