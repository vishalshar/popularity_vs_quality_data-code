This stylish electronic stylus is available in diffferent finishes. I opted for Walnut, which is very pretty, pleasantly tactile and as advertised is gaining depth from use. That said, know that the wood is only a very thin veneer--the bulk of the Pencil is the metal tube full of eletronics inside. Others have said the metal versions have more "heft" and this is why. Pencil has a rubber "point" and an "eraser" which approximate those of a carpenter's pencil. Both are soft and easily replaceable.When paired with Paper, Pencil is in its element. Users of Paper will be pleasantly surprised to find that Pencil opens up a few options unavailable with a generic stylus. The chief advantage of using Pencil is responsiveness when using various options in Paper. The "erase" function is very helpful when sketching. Pencil is a fun adjunct to Paper without an outrageous price.Pencil is equipped with a magnet which willl allow it to "snap" to iPad smart cases,, but it should be noted this is not secure; in fact there is no clip or other way to attach Pencil to anything so it's advisable that the user have some type of case to keep it protected and convenient. Pencil comes nicely packed with spare point and eraser. The device charges by simply plugging the "point" section directly into a USB port without need of charger or cord. There are no switches or lights though there is an indicator for charging. A charge lasts for weeks of normal use.This item is great for anyone who uses Paper regularly and seeks to expand their capabilities with that program. I enjoy using mine and definitely feel it has enhanced my experience with Paper.
