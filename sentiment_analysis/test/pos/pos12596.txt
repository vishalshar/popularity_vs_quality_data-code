I bought my first home and was able to install this in about 15 min. Works like an expensive alarm system. I can arm and disarm it from my phone while at work and set auto-schedules to arm and itself. I have it set to disarm before I get up in the morning so I don't have to remember to disarm it when I open the door. It appears the company can provide this cheap by not advertising and not making any fancy packaging. If you rent an apartment or just don't feel like spending over $30 a month for a big name security system I would get this, it is surprising well designed and effective.
