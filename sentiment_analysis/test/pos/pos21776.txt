I'm using this robot with my Robotics and Progtramming club as a starter. It is a good starter robot. I am working with high school girls and it has really peaked their interest. To see a robot come to life and then do quirky movements with a light shined on a sensor, they are learning about input and output. We definitely need more parts!
