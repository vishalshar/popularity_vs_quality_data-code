Not a bad phone and a great deal for the discounted price.  Android works well on it and the apps seem to load quickly.  Call quality and speaker sound seem good and the fingerprint sensor works great.  The camera also takes good photos.I was a bit concerned for the first few days as battery life seemed poor (I was barely getting 1/2 way thru the day) but for whatever reason (software update or maybe a rogue app that was draining power) the battery life is much better now and I'm getting thru a workday without having to recharge.The phone is a little heavy (compared to my previous phone) but is still comfortable to hold.  The screen is a great size and easy to use.  I do miss a removable battery and SD card for easily adding music files to the phone.  I was unable to simply transfer files by connecting to my computer like every android phone I've had.  I was finally able to add music thru an app AirDroid, but what a hassle that was.  Also not having the option for a dual sim is disappointing.The phones main feature: Smart Storage, that moves photos and apps to the cloud when the phone fills up works Ok, but like others have said, seems to be a solution in search of a problem.  Also you can't upload music or video which is exactly the sort of thing I would want to use it for.Over all it's a good phone for a great price.Pros:  price, specs, quality build, good camera and speakers,Cons:  no sd card, no dual sim, no removable battery, no uploading music or video to offline storage
