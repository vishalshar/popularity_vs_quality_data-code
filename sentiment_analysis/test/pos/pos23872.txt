I initially bought the longer sock version and did not like it, so I returned them. Then I purchased the lower cut version and after the initial washing of the socks, it had a hole in them.THE COMPANY DID WHAT I EXPECTED AND REFUNDED THE SALE. Then I purchased another low cut version and I am awaiting their delivery.
