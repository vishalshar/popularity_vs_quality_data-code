My sweet girl, a great dane/german shepherd mix, has been suffering with bouts of vomiting for the past year or so, and they began to progressively get more intense. At one point she threw up between 25-30 times in one day. She underwent some minor testing, but without the ability to fund an endoscopy, she was given the vague diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Basically, my vet implied, I would be dealing with these random bouts of vomiting forever.I am somewhat against the use of steroids for my girl, as the side effects are atrocious and I feel that when I used to see a traditional vet, the over-prescribing of these meds is what has ultimately caused most of her problems. The typical treatment for IBD would be steroids and possibly antibiotics. Without these options, my vet gave me a chinese herbal supplement that immediately stopped the vomiting. The problem was it was going to cost $70 to maintain this treatment over the long term. Too much! I looked everywhere for similar supplements and could find nothing. I started her on slippery elm and marshmallow root, and supplemented some psyllium seed. I also went to a diet that I cooked (I can't afford the raw diet), and all of these things helped, but didn't eliminate the vomiting entirely. Then I found this Superfood, and it was the last product that I was willing to purchase before I just gave in to either a long term low maintenance dose of antibiotics or steroids. I bought Superfood and said I would give it three days to work.Within two days she stopped vomiting. It has now been almost two months, and not a single problem!! I'm still supplementing the slippery elm/marshmallow root as I feel that it's a great GI soother, but I think the Superfood helps aid her digestion. I would highly recommend this to anyone whose dog suffers with food sensitivity, or especially problems with vomiting or diarrhea. To be a little bit graphic, her poops are a little smaller but not rock hard like they used to be, and she is very regular. This makes me think she is probably absorbing more of the nutrients in her food, thus producing less waste. Either way, the difference in the quality of life for both of us is remarkable!FYI, she is about 90lbs, and I started her on 3/4 of a teaspoon twice a day for the first two weeks, then 1/2 a teaspoon twice a day for 3 weeks, and now I have her down to 1/4 of a teaspoon twice a day. Sometimes when I'm able to feed her three times a day I will add a bit to all three meals just for added assurance.And sorry to anyone that is dealing with this problem. It's terribly frustrating and exhausting.
