This is a great product. Too bad it is so expensive. I have these lights in several places throughout my home, and plan on getting more at a better price. The best part is using these with my Echo. It is at first a challenge to set up, but gets easy and is well worth any effort. We control any and all lights with a voice command. I see many good things coming with Amazon Echo and Lifx!
