The Natural Freeze Dried Chicken Breast looks very appetizing. My cat loves it. It has become the snack of her choice even though sometimes she likes it mixed with some other dry treats. Sometimes some pieces in the bags are a little dark, almost too dry and hard to chew. In general I have luck and it looks excellent even if pricy. I wish the price would be more accessible for other pets to be able to enjoy pure protein not found in any other commercial product.
