I really like these turkey sticks and have tried several different flavors including the Ancho Pepper and the Turkey Pepperoni. I DID NOT find any of the ones I bought to be mushy like some other reviewers had.They must have received a bad batch or something but mine were perfectly fine, very tasty and I have added these to my regular purchasing list. Excellent snack for those of us on a low carb diet. The big plus is that these are not preserved with nitrates and the turkey meat is antibiotic and hormone free and low in calories.
