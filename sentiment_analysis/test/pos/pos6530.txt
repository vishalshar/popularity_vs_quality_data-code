First you must own the case that it is designed for, after that its greater than any battery case to carry around. It is much designed for the Iphone 6, but use it for my 6plus. Snaps right into and fits with a quality snap, the connector goes into the lighting, can charge over mini USB and can also pass music though that connection as well. It mentioned somewhere in the area of a 75% charge, but see 60-70% real world, not a compliant as like the build of the battery. Has a nice read out on the battery, a button to choose when to charge or disable all together to charge one or the other, or switch back to charge both. I really like the ability of releasing the battery pack when you dont need it. Its way better than carrying a stand along battery with a cable to keep your phone charged. Its very light weight on it's own, but add the weight of both and feels a little heavy. Not terrible, as sported in shorts before but you do feel the weight pushing. Has a nice feel on the pack itself, defiantly would want something similar for the newer iPhone when ever purchase that.
