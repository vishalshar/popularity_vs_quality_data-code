I Heart Keenwah are so delicious and addictive. My family fights over who can finish off the bag first. They have a really great, strong crunch and a wonderful cheesy flavor. They really do satisfy that salty, crunchy craving. And the best part is that they are all natural, have no dyes and have some protein. I will certainly purchase these again, likely in bulk.
