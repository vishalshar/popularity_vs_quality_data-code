I love it! I drank chaga intensely while I was revising my dissertation for final submission, to avoid getting sick at such as busy time. Now that I'm a professor in the midst of a busy semester, I have it in my office so that I can have some whenever I suspect that my immune system needs a boost. When my schedule is really hectic and I think I'm not adequately caring for my health in other ways, chaga steps in to fill that gap to still keep my immune system strong.I also like the taste--I can't drink caffeine, so I crave that deep, pleasantly bitter coffee taste that I can't get through regular coffee. I treat chaga as my coffee, and drink it black or with cream and sweetener as the mood strikes.Thanks, Four Sigmatic Foods!
