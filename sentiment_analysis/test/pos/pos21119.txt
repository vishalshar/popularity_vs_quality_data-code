Let me start by saying I am not a music or tech nerd. I just like to listen to things - mostly podcasts, sometimes music. And I make a LOT of business phone calls (I work from home and travel for work a lot, so I don't have a desk or a headset). These headphones make me feel like a classy, semi-hip professional. The sounds is good, audio quality for calls is good, and I haven't gotten any complaints or issues about the mic and people not being able to hear me (which used to happen ALL THE TIME with my old, cheap headphones). Like others have said, I really like the carrying case too, given how much I travel. Also, like others said, super comfy. And pretty good with noise blocking when audio is on - I can happily ignore my husband while in podcast land :)I have one, very petty qualm: as noted by others, the headphones come with cables for both android and iPhones. The android cable is the same beautiful burgundy color of the headsets. The iPhone cable is a nasty, white color (kind of like the iPhone charger). It makes me feel sad that my beautiful headphones are being cheapened up by an ugly white cable. Why, Plugged, why?!? Can I get a burgundy cable for my iPhone?
