I bought this item mostly to manage my vitamin D intake. Now I know exactly when to start applying sunscreen, and the days when Vit. D supplementation is necessary.It is super easy to use, and the information is right there on your wrist. No need to check an iPad or phone. Just check the lights on your SunFriend and you know when it is time to get out of the sun.Finding my skin sensitivity was pretty straightforward, but takes a little trial and errors. 1 being ultra sensitive skin and 11 not sensitive at all never get sunburned.I think it is useful to know that SunFriends calculates your Vit. D and UVs based on the fact that your face, arms and part of your legs would be exposed to the sunlight. I always wear sunscreen on my face (make up or hydrating cream) and I like to wear pants so I crank the sensitivity up one number. (instead of a 5, I would be a 6).I NEVER had a sun burn since I am wearing it, but I haven't been under tropical sun yet with it.Afraid of the sun no more, less messy sunscreen, less Vit. D to buy, this thing pays for itself.
