I've never written a review before, but this product deserves one!  The BEST Paleo-friendly pancake/waffle mix on the market.  I typically add a small amount of honey or stevia because I like my pancakes/waffles sweet, but it doesn't truly need any additives.  My husband and twin 2 year olds loved it too.. which is extremely rare! When I make pancakes for my family of 4, we typically use at least 1/3-1/2 of 1 box.
