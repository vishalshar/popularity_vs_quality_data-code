Saw these recommended on America's Test Kitchen (PBS cooking show) and decided to try them.  I had always had a problem with cheeses getting slimy or moldy after opening the packages.  The cheese bags completely solved both problems.  They keep the cheese dry, yet protected.  They're a little pricey, but a heck of a lot cheaper than throwing out unused, moldy cheese.  I highly recommend them!
