I cannot say enough about the Kuna. We bought it after reports of our neighbor tresspassing, going through our mail and trash, and acting like he lived there while we were away at work. We installed the Kuna, it was just as easy as they say... I was looking for issues with it because I thought it was too good to be true.We installed it, hooked up the wifi, and it is CRYSTAL CLEAR. It's like I am right there at all times.We were so happy with it even without having neighbor problems, but just yesterday I got a notification on my phone and immediately I could see our neighbor rummaging through our trash on our property and trying to open our door. We have filed a police report and if it wasn't for the footage I downloaded, we could not prosecute him.The image is crystal clear. the sound quality... it is incredible. Again I thought it was too good to be true, but it works just like they say! and we got ours for $179 + 2 weeks free trial of the camera footage which only cost $50 for the year.Amazing.The only thing I would say is you MUST have a good wifi connection. Ours was a little spotty at first so we moved our router closer and it works amazing now.WORTH ALL THE MONEY
