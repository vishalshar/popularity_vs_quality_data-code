Bought it to help nighttime hunting for coyotes.  It is effective but using your iPhone gives a lot of reflective light and kills your night vision.  Given the small size and cost you are constantly making sure it's still there in the dark when your phone is off.  My brother in law has an older lab an you can clearly see the inflamed joints from the arthritis.
