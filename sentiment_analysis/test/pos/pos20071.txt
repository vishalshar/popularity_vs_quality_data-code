Overall, 4 stars.  I give the hardware (the Rachio IRO itself) 5 stars. You can't ask for much more in a sprinkler system controller.  I give the Rachio App 4 stars. I highly recommend the Rachio if you tweak your own system and do its maintenance work. Even if you are hands-off, I still recommend the Rachio because it could save you water and $$$.The app still lacks a few refinements but there is no doubt it will be continually updated.  I believe $250 is a fair price for the controller and app because they can potentially save water. I usually spend about $600 a growing season for watering my front yard so I'll have to wait until next year to see if there is a difference.Here's an email I got from Rachio today which prompted my favorable review-"In order to keep your landscape looking its best, we have updated the watering durations for your watering time (Every 4 Days at 3:00 AM). Since your last adjustment, your seasonal temperature has changed from a range of 57-74F to a range of 54-72F, and the average daily rainfall has changed from 0.01 inches to 0.02 inches. Other factors, like length of day, wind speed, etc. may also figure in to this update. Based on these changes, your updates were:Zone 1 front west has been updated from 44 minutes to 41 minutes.Zone 2 north side large has been updated from 39 minutes to 36 minutes.Zone 3 south small side has been updated from 29 minutes to 26 minutes."It's outstanding that my sprinkler system adjusts itself and tells me. I mainly bought the Rachio to have a smart sprinkler controller that adjusts for weather and so I can conveniently make watering adjustments from my phone. The Rachio definitely has gone beyond my expectations.-- Some details --Setup - It was fairly simple to remove my old system and install the Rachio. I only have three zones and a rain gauge so the rewiring was simple. My garage wasn't dark enough to program the Wi-fi so the literal flashing didn't work until I closed the garage door and turned off the lights. After the internet connection worked, I was able to verify that each zone worked.I do my own end-of season air purge and I make adjustments to my sprinkler heads during the growing season so it was great to be able to turn off and on the zones while outside using my phone. I smiled while I was outside doing the zone tests. :-)Operation - I give the app only 4 stars because while it does work well some of the information is cryptic. For example, I'm unsure of how the app figures out the exact watering times based on the season, expected rain, etc. according to the watering minutes I enter for each zone. I can't tell if the minutes I enter are for getting 1" per week based on the number of waterings per week or as an absolute.What's great is I have clay and the controller breaks the watering session for each zone into 9 minutes periods or less. This alone might save me water because I could have had subsurface runoff that I was unaware off. Hopefully this will give me deeper watering and use less water.A small gripe for the operation: I have a water submeter for outside so I can measure and calculate how much water I need for my lawn.  I can run each zone and see how much water is being used and then I can measure the size of the zones. A manual calculation will give how many minutes per week of watering my lawn should get. But the app doesn't allow me to put in that information. I can do the math myself but it would be nice if I could put in for each zone the size (in sq. ft) and flow rate (in gallons per minute) and let Rachio figure out the watering schedule.The website and miscellaneous - I am very happy with my Rachio's ability to be refined through software updates (whether by the app or the controller itself). I realize many changes have been made already and I expect more changes to be made in the future. The website and videos are helpful for information and for instructions but were lacking slighting on some specifics I was looking for (of course I could always send them an email but I was curious on how specific numbers are determined).So far I'm very satisfied with the Rachio.
