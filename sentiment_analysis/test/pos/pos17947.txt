The Leaf is just beautiful!  It is my favorite accessory. When worn as a bracelet, it seems to be very good at tracking steps when compare to the iPhone pedometer. I love the feature that reminds me to get moving if I've been stationary for too long. I also like that this feature can be adjusted by length of time so that I'm not constantly prompted to move when it is inconvenient for me. I've worn my Leaf at the beach all week while on vacation, and it's held up wonderfully in the sand and while be gently splashed by the ocean. Additionally, the sleep tracker has helped me realize that I don't get enough sleep on a regular basis!!  I did not want a standard fitness tracker because I knew I would not want to wear it when I was dressed nicely. This device is so beautiful that it not only compliments my regular clothes, but adds some style to my workout clothes as well. It can be a bit bulky in the wrist, but no more so than a larger wristwatch or bracelet. Definitely recommend the Leaf if you want a stylish fitness tracker for everyday use!
