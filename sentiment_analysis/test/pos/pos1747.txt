Really like this camera - is was so easy to set up (a joy after my terrible experiences with the Pet Cube - big thumbs down), and works really well. The picture is clear and I love how I can talk to my cats and shoot out treats for them!Improvements I'd love to see to make it even more awesome:1. Two way sound. Right now you can talk to your pets but not hear them.2. When you are viewing on the app, any notification that comes onto your phone (email, message etc) automatically shuts down the camera, which is kind of annoying.
