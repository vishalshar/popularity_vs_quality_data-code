The Peanut Butter & Co Dark Chocolate cups are the perfect single servings on the go. Well my kids eat two at a time but the convenient size is great. Not too strong a taste in either chocolate or peanut butter, but the combination is very addictive. I have already ordered more online and hope Amazon cariries this in subscribe and save program.
