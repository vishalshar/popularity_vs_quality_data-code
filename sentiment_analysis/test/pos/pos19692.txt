UAG is by far the best case for any phone on the market, If they make one for your phone there is no reason to even look for any other case. Don't waste your time and money on any Otterbox product. This UAG case for the M9 is no exception, fitting, feel, protection beats them all. . When installing the phone all you have to do is put the volume, power side of the phone in at a angle first and just push down on the other side. Removing the phone just pull the top left corner of the case off of the phone and remove from the top and comes off very easy. But while the phone is installed in the phone it is very secure and will not come off or slide around.Other reviewers have stated it is extremely hard to remove the phone, however it is very easy.Lastly, if you need a holster buy the Seidio dilex hoster, fits perfect.
