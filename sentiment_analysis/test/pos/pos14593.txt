PROS:App is very handyBuilt-in charger works greatSmaller sized carry-on, perfect for me.CONS:built in scale isnt super useful for meinner cloth material of a lower qualityblinking green light cant be turned off (i think)Just purchased this bag and took it on an SFO <> NYC trip. Was fantastic. Had a bit of a delay at SFO, and the built in battery charger was a life saver. One main thing I didn't think would be that useful but was surprised by was the "You're leaving me behind" push notification. I only had one moment with this but I was at a coffee shop and completely forgot my carry-on. Luckily I got the notification which saved the day.Some people have commented on how it's smaller than other carry-ons but I pack very light for weekend trips so haven't had any issues. I think some of the interior material could be a little nicer, but it's pretty minor complaint.The wheels, overall case construction, and handle are pretty solid. In general the case is light enough that Im not going to be banging it around too much but so far I think its up to the challenge of a typical New York transit commute :)Minor quibble: The blinking green light on the top while its charging is very bright for me. I like to leave things plugged in at hotels so I know theyre charged but I tend to unplug this before sleeping.The bluesmart carry-on is definitely not the cheapest carry-on, but if you're traveling often I think these little amenities really add up.
