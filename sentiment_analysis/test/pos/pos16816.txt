I've been using this mouse (Mionix Naos 7000) for a few weeks now, and I have nothing but good things to say about this mouse. Word to the wise: peripherals, especially mice, are usually very subjective and are rife with gaming-oriented marketing to make the product more enticing. Note that this review will be influenced by my personal preferences for a mouse. For reference, I am a 6'0" male with relatively long fingers. I also mostly use claw/fingertip grip due to the length of my fingers.Pros:1) Very smart design. It definitely looks odd in the pictures, but if you've ever questioned why mice manufacturers seem to completely ignore ring-finger and pinky-finger placement, this mouse is your answer. It definitely looks odd and took several days to get accustomed to the different shape, but it gets more and more comfortable as time goes on. Mionix emphasizes craftsmanship on their website, packaging, and other marketing material, and I'm pleased to say that the mouse delivers on those promises. I'm also a big fan of the completely rubberized finish on the mouse. I almost got a Sensei with the rubberized finish, but I found this mouse more appealing after reading the reviews on how comfortable it is. I don't know how well it will hold up or look after long-term use, but so far it stays pretty clean and feels very nice to grip.2) Comes with the right features. This mouse isn't overloaded with tons of buttons which likely won't be used by most customers. You have your standard left, right, and scroll-wheel clicks as well as two rocker buttons for the thumb and two DPI-switching buttons on the top. I have minimalist preferences, so this mouse suits my needs much better than other gaming-oriented, high-end mice. I haven't used the DPI-switching buttons yet, but thankfully they're pretty small and never get in my way, so their presence doesn't bother me.3) Simple software. I had no trouble figuring out how to customize my mouse with my preferred DPI level and setting the RGB lighting to match the rest of my computer. Again, I have minimalist preferences so I've only used the software once or twice, but those experiences were easy and painless.4) Satisfying buttons. the Omron switches in the left and right click buttons aren't the easiest to press, but they give a very satisfying tactile feel and corresponding sound. The scroll-wheel click is not too difficult to press without rolling the wheel. The DPI and thumb buttons aren't great, but they're good enough for how frequently I use them (not very much).5) Very high-quality sensor, but ONLY IN THE 7000. If you want this mouse, get the 7000 - it is well-known to have the best sensor of the series. The Pixart sensor in this model is very accurate and is very highly acclaimed.Cons:1) Shape isn't for everyone. I haven't verified this myself, but I understand now why users with smaller hands would not be able to adjust to the shape of the mouse. It does have a fairly large footprint that may be too long for short fingers. To those users, I would suggest the Mionix Castor for a similar mouse with equally great quality but a more accommodating shape. Obviously, it's not for lefties either.2) Sensor can't track on glass or white surfaces. This is pretty unfortunate because I would've liked to use my white desk, but I'll get a nice mousepad instead. Note that this isn't unique to this mouse - all infrared (IR) sensors will have this negative feature.I'll follow up with a few comparisons to other popular mice.1) Mionix Naos 7000 v. Razer Deathadder 2013: I'm fairly sure the Deathadder hasn't changed much since then, so this should be pretty representative of all Deathadder mice. I've used that mouse as my primary driver for over 2 years, and although I've gotten used to the shape, the high arching back simply never suited my grip to my liking even though it's touted to suit claw grip very well. Although the Deathadder had nice rubber grips on both sides to allow for easier liftoff, the Mionix has both a rubberized surface and better contours so the user can truly hold the mouse. I'm very happy with my switch.2) Mionix Naos 7000 v. g502: I gave the g502 a chance after I saw it on sale at Best Buy recently. The g502 is a massively popular mouse, so I couldn't help but give it a chance. Subjectively, I wasn't a huge fan of the aesthetics of the g502; it seemed like a toned-down version of the ridiculous Mad Catz gaming mice without the modularity and adjustments. I actually did enjoy the feel of the g502 - it was well-designed with good rubber grips and fit a fingertip grip very comfortably. However, the sheer number of buttons on the g502 is what killed the mouse for me, especially the placement of the "sniper" button for the thumb. In order to hold the mouse comfortably with my long fingers, my thumb was resting on the sniper button, and I simply didn't want to hold a mouse with my thumb resting on top of a button. I didn't really have a use for the 11 programmable buttons and adjustable weight (even without extra weights I thought it was heavy), so I returned it to Best Buy. The g502's greatest strengths turned out to be the aspects I liked the least.I think the current pricing at $55 (as of early 2016) is a very fair price for a mouse that can compare to mice that cost much more. I encourage you to give this mouse a try and return it if it doesn't fit your needs and preferences.
