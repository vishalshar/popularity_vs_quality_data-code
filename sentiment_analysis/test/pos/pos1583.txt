These are great bread crumbs.  We decided to go mostly gluten free some time ago, and it has really made a difference inn most of my problems.  I have severe arthitis and ibs, and eating gluten free, believe it or not, lowers your pain and your digestive and elimination problems.  And, being able to get a gluten free bread crumb without having to make the bread, which I am not that good at, is a blessing.  Sherrill Schoeffel
