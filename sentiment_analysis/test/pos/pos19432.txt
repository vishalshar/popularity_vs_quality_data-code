NO exaggeration -- THIS TOOL IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD. FREAKING FANTASTIC MASSAGE TOOL!!!Watch the videos on Youtube before doing anything. These look deceivingly simple that you'd just do it out of the box. DO NOT. The efficacy of it can be had only by watching how it is best used. In doing so, it does exactly as it promises -- give yourself a trigger massage in the comfort of your home. The cost is NOTHING compared to all the money I've paid for massages. I used it on my back, my feet, my forearms, my hand (OMG, AMAZING!), my glutes. And, I can stay in spot for as long as I feel I need/want it. This would cost you a bundle if you did it elsewhere.Most people look at massage as a luxury. In actuality, it is as important to one's health as eating the right foods, taking supplements as needed, getting exercise. Some of us go to massage only finally when our body is in pain (yours truly). But really, using it this daily is the best -- an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. I'm looking forward to using this for many, many years.I'm grateful to the inventor (Eric) for making this. His bodily pain is all our gain. This is a very well made product and the videos are also well done. EVERY HOME SHOULD HAVE IT, JUST LIKE A FIRST AID KIT. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
