Intriguing design, amazing battery life and sound that is incredible for what it is.No portable Bluetooth this size can produce large amounts of bass notes, so skip this if that is primarily what you are looking for, however, comparing this to other portable speakers such as the one my dad owns.. This produces far more adequate bass thanks to the passive bass radiator on the bottom. Enough to rumble a table.The highs and mids sound great, and acoustic music sounds perfect. I listened to Bob Marley and Cat Stevens in FLAC audio codec and couldn't be more pleased with the results.This works very well at the cottage and the beach, and you can rely on it getting damaged due to splashes of water or some sand.
