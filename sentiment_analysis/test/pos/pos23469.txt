I cannot say enough about how much I love both the product and the company. First - the product: if you do a little bit of research, you'll find that most vitamins on the market are a total waste of money and time because the ingredients used are not readily bio-available -- that is -- easily used by your body. (And now, if there is ever a time when you want your vitamins to get absorbed, it's while you are pregnant!) SmartyPants creates their vitamins, and sources their ingredients, in a whole new way, resulting in a much higher nutrient absorption rate. Plus the taste is so much better than any other chewy on the market!!! Second - the company: they support the really cool non-profit Vitamin Angels with every purchase. Vitamin Angels is wonderful organization that is super effective at helping at-risk populations in needspecifically pregnant women, new mothers, and children under fivegain access to lifesaving and life changing vitamins and minerals. A WIN for your health, a WIN for your tastebuds, and a WIN for underserved populations. BRAVO!!!!!!
