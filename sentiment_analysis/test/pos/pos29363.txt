I ended up purchasing the Feed and Go after my dog, Humphrey, was diagnosed with bilious vomiting syndrome over the summer and our doctor recommended that we break his meals into smaller portions and feed once every 4 hours or so, instead of the 2 larger meals 12 hours apart that we had been feeding until then. I'd spent a considerable amount of time researching other devices and finally settled on the Feed and Go as it seemed to have all the features I was looking for, including a webcam and remote management of the feeder schedule, as well as a rotating tray so i could feed both kibble and wet foods if I wanted.There was a mixup with the shipping on my order, and when I reached out to Amazon about it, I was directed to Feed and Go and they were absolutely fantastic in helping to resolve the situation.Later, once we had received the feeder and set it up, within a week we began experiencing some difficulties with the feeder. Alex at Feed and Go was more than happy to spend a tremendous amount of time both over email and on the phone with me, helping to diagnose the issues with my feeder and walk me through some fixes. After those fixes seemed to stop working, Alex had us send the feeder to him for further diagnosis. It turned out it was user error - we had inadvertently spilled some water on some of the electronic components, causing damage to some of the circuitry. Even though the problems with our feeder turned out to be our own fault, Alex continued to provide us with the best customer service I've ever experienced, and has since kept in touch with us and helped us in getting a replacement.I cannot recommend this machine and this company enough. Very few companies would bother dedicating the amount and time and effort to helping a customer who has inadvertently broken the product (as we did, embarassingly). Alex is truly kind, caring, and incredibly hard-working business owner who believes in his product and goes more than the extra mile to ensure his customers end up satisfied, no matter who they are.
