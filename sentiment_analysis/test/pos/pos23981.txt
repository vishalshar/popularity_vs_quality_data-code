I had some frustration with my unit.  However, the customer service was spot on!!  My problem was promptly and patiently taken care of.  I even received a follow up to make sure I was still happy.  The new design "slide" clasp does seems to fit our needs better than the older style unit.  The battery life is longer and I like the new features on the app.
