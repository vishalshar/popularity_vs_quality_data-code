My dog was having dietary issues on everything we fed him. Everything. We were spending about $90 every two weeks to home make his dog food (jasmine rice, veggies and chicken)... He was eating far better than us and still having issues. He was unable to keep on weight and had HORRIBLE sores on his belly no matter what we did. This was recommended to us due to the probiotics in it. His sores are gone, his coat is beautiful, he is at a healthy weight and he loves it! Highly recommend this food. My baby is healthy, and the $90 a week has turned into about $60 a month.Update: We have been ordering this regularly from Amazon. We recently received a bag that had been torn and much of the contents missing. I contacted the seller, who responded almost immediately and sent a replacement bag. I am so impressed with the level of customer service that it has ensured my customer status and has lead me to increase recommendations to my friends and neighbors. We live in rural Alaska and rely heavily on both receiving supplies via shipping, as well as word of mouth to promote products and companies. Huge thanks to the seller!!!
