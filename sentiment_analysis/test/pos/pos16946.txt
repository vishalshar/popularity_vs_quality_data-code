I am a 61-year-old woman and I have no clue about these stuff and how they work but I thought I buy this to see if it helps my asthma. It does help to reduce my breathing issue but not entirely and I think it is because of the size. I call ibaby and they said the concentration of the ions are not that high so it is ok for me. I had my son to set it up for me because I do not know much about internet. It seemed easy. I like the visual color of the app that changes based on air status. Wish it had a battery.
