Love this product! I originally saw this on The Grommet and was looking to buy it at a later time, but then saw it here and had to snatch it. This is great if you are doing small jobs (like tables, wood, and other small distances; only about 16ft). I wish they would make a larger one. This complements a laser range finder if you are doing jobs basically by yourself. Great buy!
