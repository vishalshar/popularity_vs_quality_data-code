This thing is awesome. I do have to complain that the resolution is a tad low, and there is a bit of lag in the picture. It's not like looking at your screen with the camera app on or taking video. You have to hold the phone still to really prices the information. But come on, it's a two hundred dollar thermal camera! I use it fairly often around the house and at work. Sometimes just for fun. You can watch people walk down the street at night, find the cat hiding somewhere, see if the cat was in your bed, the uses are endless! The carry case is small and sturdy. Comes lined with some dense foam material that fits the camera snugly. Even came with a key chain split ring and is probably small enough to carry on your keys.The app seems pretty stable and I haven't had any issues with it. Also have had a couple app updates which have added features so SEEK seems to be supporting this hardware well. You can change the color schemes which is useful for different applications. Like the temperature displays on screen. I highly recommend this little camera.
