Great sound for a mini speaker. Before I've relied on Bluetooth at home for wireless speakers but to have it connect to wifi is a plus. Since it's on wifi I can find it on my airplay options on my iPhone. My Spotify account plays seamlessly as the speaker app (yes, there's and app for it!). The advantage of streaming Spotify on the Libratone is that music can play and not interfere with calls or texts ... it won't broad cast them. Several unique features a mute function called "hush" buy just putting your hand on the top. On wifi it will stream internet stations and will save 5 favorites. Charging is somewhat fast and lasts for a few days. The leather strap is convient for toting around. Having an external speaker vs. tiny phone speakers is the way to go and the Libratone mini delivers.
