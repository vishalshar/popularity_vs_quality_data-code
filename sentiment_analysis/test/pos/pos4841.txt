Cool kit. I hacked it to my own purposes and planted Basil seeds instead. The Mason jars are really small, and if I'm doing this again I'll buy bigger jars to hold more soil and roots. I've put these pots next to my Aerogarden so the plants benefit from the grow lights. I have no windows with enough sun to grow these otherwise. It looks really neat, but you could easily put together a kit like this yourself. If you are Arts and Crafts or DIY challenged though, this kit is pretty handy and would make a good gift.
