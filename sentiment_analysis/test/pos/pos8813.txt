Pros:  1. easy to put on  2. durable  3. nothing to step/trip on like with lacesCons:  1. too tightI love the idea of these and the material seems great, I just wish they were a little bigger.  I don't have wide feet and they are way too tight.  All of the "shoelaces" that come are the same length; I think perhaps it would make more sense for them to be different lengths depending on what part of the shoe they go on because the top (near your toes) laces are usually more narrow than the back (near your ankles).  These fit well for the top part of my shoes, but are too short for the bottom so I removed the top "laces" to alleviate the pressure on top of my feet.I have attached pictures demonstrating how tight my shoes were initially with 4 laces and how I wear them now with the top lace removed.
