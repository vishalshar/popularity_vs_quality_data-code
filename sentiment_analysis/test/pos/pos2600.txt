We have a 12 lbs maine coon cat and he had some weird growth in the area of his last vaccine. Thankfully it wasnt a tumor but we still had it removed. At this time, I started looking for an immune booster to help him heal, and I found this one. He has been on it ever since. Our cat in generally is the 'complicated' type and he got much healthier, stronger and mentally more stable. He was fighting urinary infections on a regular (stress) basis. We added this supplement to his diet, as well as Cosequine. He is healthier than ever, has a beautiful coat and has plenty of energy. It defineltey helps him to stay healthy.
