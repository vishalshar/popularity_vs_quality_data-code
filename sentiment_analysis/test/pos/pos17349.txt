I saw a recommendation for this in my Cooks magazine. We LOVE cheese around here and cheese is SOO good with wine and I cook with it too. We have a great deal of cheese and even tho my cheese drawer in the 'fridge is pretty good, the cheese can still get pretty darn icky in a week or two or when you find some chunk a month later you forgot about. I have tried several methods and found none of them works so with the holidays coming I knew we would have loads of it around and figured this was an excellent time to test this paper out.It comes in a box much like wax/parchment paper with the sheets already cut and they include cute little name stickers with places to mark whether its cow or goat cheese. The length is enough for most cheeses although were I to have a big wheel it might be difficult to wrap.We had a party on the Winter Solstice  Dec 21st and we had lots of cheese. We had leftovers and I wrapped them in the paper.  I used a single sheet and did a very light wrap and placed a rubber band around the open ends not very tightly, these cheeses were soft and would have been squished.That was 18 days ago and today I found several in the cheese drawer that had not been eaten. A Havarti,  Camembert and a Brie. The Havarti was EXACTLY the same as the day I wrapped it! The Brie and the Camembert had some VERY slight soft spots but they were completely edible (and they were immediately eaten).This stuff works! I haven't kept anything any longer than 18 days (so far)  but hey! That's not bad. So I'm going to buy more and keep it around. Why 4 stars? - I wish this came in a roll so I could CHOOSE the size of my sheets.
