The Zus charger works exactly as described, it's also one of the fastest iPhone 6 car chargers that I've used. The fact the I can charge two high wattage devices with this thing is great! Its modern design compliments my car really well. I love the fact that it can pin point the location of my car in the lot with the help of its app which is really straight forward to use. The LED lights at the top and on the side USB ports are very helpful, especially when Im trying to pinpoint the ports in limited light. Another major improvement that I see compared to the first version that I got from the IGG campaign is that the packaging is now much improved - making it easier to take ZUS out of the box.But one caveat, ZUS wont charge Qualcomm Quick Charge devices at the rapid charging mode. Had my significant other try it with her QC phone and it didnt indicate charging rapidly, so this charger would not be for QC smartphone owners.
