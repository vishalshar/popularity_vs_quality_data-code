Thermal Image Cameras are really expensive. This entry level model tries to make this technology available to everyone at a price that is agreeable. The Seek Thermal Camera is small, lightweight and pretty intuitive to use. It is not a high powered, sophisticated model that some professionals use. The images can be a little difficult to interpret if the temperatures are all relatively uniform. However, I have found water leaks and gaps in insulation are easy to spot. If you're a homeowner or beginning home inspector, this should meet your needs well. If you're a nighttime hunter or home energy specialist, you might need something a little beefier. I would give it 3 stars for overall functionality compared to higher end models, but I'm bumping it up to 4 stars because of the entry level price. It's probably the best option out there for the price.
