We have a dual purpose for these bars, my 21 year old daughter is training for 5K and Zombie Runs and she is Type 1.  The carbs in these raise her blood sugar faster than her gels but more importantly, it lasts!  No few seconds of energy and back to low blood sugar, these carbs stick around while most gels do not for very long.  Not crazy about the taste, but this is a tool not a candy bar.
