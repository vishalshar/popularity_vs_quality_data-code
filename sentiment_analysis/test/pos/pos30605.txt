I love the Kano.  The product itself is very well designed.  The hardware, the documentation, and the custom KanoOS seem very well designed for children in their target age range of 6-12ish.  Unfortunately, my son isn't as interested in it as I wish, he's only played with it a couple of times.  Still, I don't think that's a flaw with the Kano, just part of my son's personality and short attention span.
