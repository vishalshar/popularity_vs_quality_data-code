Never heard about this device or company.  Devices was a pain in the Ass to setup but once it's setup works perfectly. App have been improve a lit have more option.  Would like to see what else the make these device do.  This is perfect for window ac and mini split.  Other similar controller needed a wired connection. These is wireless and should support bluetooth soon.
