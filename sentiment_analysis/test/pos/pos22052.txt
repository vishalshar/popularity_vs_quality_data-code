This mount is a quick and easy install, what takes a little time is adjusting it to your vehicle and to suit your personal needs. I could not access my seat track bolt, so I used the adapter to mount it on the end of the seat rail as suggested. It took @ 15 min. to get the base attached good and tight and who knows how long to move and adjust the whole thing to where I wanted it. This mount is quite flexible as to where you can place it. I was surprised that as stout as it's made that it still bounced a little bit when the car was moving but I haven't seen one yet that doesn't. I bought the optional brace but haven't decided yet if I'm going to use it. What I did do is adjust the mount where the last elbow rests on top of the center console and put a small piece of foam under it so as not to allow any wear. VERY stable now!I love the way the bottom and side retainers adjust to keep the computer in place; I can assure you it's not going anywhere. There is an option of buying additional fixtures to hold your screen in place but my HP notebook doesn't need it. THE ABSOLUTE BEST PART is how quickly I can remove the entire mount with one release lever and in one piece without disturbing the position I set it in. Monday morning I can put it back, in literally 10 seconds and I'm ready to go. Worth your money!
