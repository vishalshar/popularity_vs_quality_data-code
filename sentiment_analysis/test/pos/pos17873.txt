I am generally pleased with the product. I am using/testing it as an example of assistive technology that might assist a person with a disability or a senior who lives alone. The unit allows for remote locking and unlocking if used with the August Connect product (which is an additional expense). You can also check to see if the door is locked from a remote location. The system also allows for multiple users to have access to the locked door thus eliminating the need to get additional keys made and worrying about who has one. I particularly chose this product because it can be installed in a rented apartment (assuming you have the correct type of lock on your door).Reason I did not give it Five Stars: First, the unit is much larger (almost 3.5 inches wide)than I imagined from the picture. Even with my big meaty man's hands, I can just barely span the side of it to turn to lock and unlock manually. This might be a BIG problem for some, particularly seniors who might have some dexterity issues. Yes, the point is that you can use you smart phone to lock/unlock, but this gets to be an inconvenience when you just want to go out for a few minutes. I hope August fixes this.Second concern is the use of the auto-unlock. Something I just discovered today - perviously this was my FAVORITE feature... If you unlock the door, and walk down the hall with your smartphone in your pocket and then return a few minutes later, the auto-unlock feature activates thus LOCKING the DOOR. Not a big deal because you have your phone and can unlock it, but this should not work this way. I'll be reporting this to the company as a possible bug.
