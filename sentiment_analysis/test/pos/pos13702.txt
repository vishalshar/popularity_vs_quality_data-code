These rings are way better than the standard Busy Buddy rings. They're not made in China, they don't smell anywhere near as bad, they're not nearly as stiff/stale, and they come in a way more convenient ziplock bag. The dog likes them, and they fit the Busy Buddy toys.Definitely worth the extra few dollars.
