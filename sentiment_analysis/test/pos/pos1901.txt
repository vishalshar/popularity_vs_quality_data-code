Trying to be more eco-friendly, I got two of these sporks to replace the plastic utensils I used to take to work for lunch.Pros: Great size and durability for travel.  Dishwasher safe in the silverware section.  Food tastes / odors don't linger after washing, so today's salad doesn't taste like yesterday's pasta.  Can cut softer foods like fish or potatoes.Cons: Not great for cutting tough things like chicken, but it's plastic so I wasn't expecting that.  Eating a soup and salad at the same time is a little awkward, since you basically use the other end of the utensil as part of the handle when eating, but as long as what you're eating isn't super greasy its not the end of the world.
