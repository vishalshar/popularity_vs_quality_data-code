This has been a no fail game for any group I've brought it to, whether or not they were experienced board gamers.  This is the kind of game that your friends will ask you to break out again the next time they come over.  We love all trying to put the murder into a narrative and telling each other how we think it happened.  Everyone has these elaborate stories because there are lots of clues, some of which matter and some of which do not.  The best way to weed out the clues that don't matter is to work in all the clues into murder story, and see which clues change in the next round. This way, the climax of the game is not like the anti-climactic board game Clue, where you would say, "I think John committed the murder with the scarf and left behind the playing card." It's more like, "Ok, I think John was playing a high stakes game of poker in an abandoned factory with someone he met on craigslist. Everyone was dressed warmly because the factory did not have good heating.  After winning a big hand, his opponent attempted to argue his way out of paying the debt.  There was a scuffle, and in a fit of rage, he strangled the deadbeat to death with his own scarf."  These stories are  the highlight of the game.  It's the best when the murderer has a really good alternative story that the other players buy into, and after he gets away with the murder, everyone goes back to the clues and realizes how they were duped.
