Yes! This is the best idea ever! I was still having a hard time lifting months after having baby, and he was peeing and spitting up like crazy! No more lifting the mattress in the middle of the night when baby poops all over the place! I have had two of the top halves and we managed well! Three would probably be perfect! Invest in this sheet set!! Soft too!
