For the data it provides, it is a great buy at $25. Battery included. Take it out of the box, put in the battery, tighten the cap with a quarter, slide the bottom half under you shoe laces, twist the bottom and top until you hear a click. Download the MilestonePod app from the Apple App Store. I signed up with my FB account. Added the pod to the MilestonePod App. Synced effortlessly. Went for a short run. Synced and downloaded the run data. Best $25 I spent.
