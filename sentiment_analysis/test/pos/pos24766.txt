I have three kids, and this is our second Starling for our youngest daughter. Weve really loved having it as our babies have grown up. When we first got it, I was really amazed how much variation there was in how many words they heard per day. I didnt expect to like the Starling as much as I did- its just a great motivator every day to stay on track and talk a ton to my kids, and getting the daily activities through the app is super helpful When I check the score in the afternoon and see that Im nowhere close to my word goal, I make sure to step it up at dinner time or read an extra story before bedtime. We were worried at first that my kids would just rip the Starling off or start to cry when we put it on, but it really hasnt been a big deal. My youngest kind of fussed with it for the first time we put it on her for about ten minutes, until she forgot about it and went back to playing.Overall, great product and great experience!
