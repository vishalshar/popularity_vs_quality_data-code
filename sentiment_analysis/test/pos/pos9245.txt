I absolutely love it! I was just as excited to play with it as my girls were. I was surprised at how quiet it is and love that it is also battery powered so that I can take it out to the back yard.  Its quite powerful even at the lowest setting which brings me my biggest concern and the only reason I can't give it a 5 rating. This ifetch model is made for smaller dogs so the design is so that when the ball shoots out it is at the same level as my dogs face and I worry about just that, her getting shot right at her face. They get so excited when waiting for the ball that they put their noses up to the hole and I have to quickly tilt it upward. I'm possibly being an over protected mother but I'm a little apprehensive about leaving them alone with it.It comes with 3 balls and you can order an extra 5 pack but they are expensive. I've found another seller by the name of Midlee that sells a pack of 12 for the same price. Other then the 2 things I mentioned, I really love the ifetch! Also, if you need help on the training you can go to goifetch.com which I found very helpful as well.
