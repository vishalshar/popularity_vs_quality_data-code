I just got my mighty mug earlier today, and it works great! It is really helpful with my three year old daughter because she is constantly knocking everything she can over and sometimes spilling my coffee over our rug. With this tightly sealed cap and the suction on the bottom it makes it a great product for family's with young toddler or kids
