At first i never knew that not washing your makeup brushes for a long period of time, can cause acne. Well that explains it. But after watching a video in youtube, cough cough Michelle Phan, i decided to change my ways. I ordered my product, and expected it to come in about a week or so, but it didnt. almost a month passes, and i still didnt get the package, so i decided to contact the seller, and she was very nice and polite about it, which is a great help. The other day i received an envelope with TWO packs of brush guards, and used it instantly. Im very happy with the product, it helps a lot. I will definitely buy from this seller again. without a doubt, FIVE STARS.
