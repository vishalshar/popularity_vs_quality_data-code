Ive had Eero now for a couple of weeks and I am very impressed.  Prior to purchasing I had a pre-sale question.  I contacted Eero via their website.  Most companies seem to answer pre-sale questions within a day or two.  I had a response from Eero within an hour.  They needed some follow-up information from me in order to completely answer my question.  I responded and got their reply five minutes later. Impressive.We received the Eero 3-Pack and went about doing the installation.  It was a snap.  We made a few mistakes along the way (rushing too fast and not going step by step)  but the installation process always let us recover and keep going.  We did use a new Network Name so we had to go around and reconfigure everything.  Didnt realize how many connected devices we had:  phones, tablets, e-readers, streaming devices, thermostat, smoke detectors, garage door opener, security cameras, home automation.  I only had problems connecting one device  our Wink hub.I knew from reading on-line that there have been a lot of software updates to the Eero and that the Eero would update overnight after it was installed.  Next morning I woke to find our network down.  Our two secondary Eeros had upgraded, but our primary Eero had failed during the update.  I unplugged it, plugged it back in and it came up on-line.  The network was working but I checked the version number and found that it had no upgraded.  Called Eero support  10am on a Saturday  no wait  immediately connected (happy dance).  Explained the issue.  They were able to force the update  took just a few minutes.From that point on  things have worked flawlessly.  After the update the Wink hub  the only device I could not get connected before, would now connect.  Our WiFi speeds have never been this fast.  Coverage is great.  Example: I like to listen to streaming music while mowing.  Weve had several routers in the past, tried different WiFi extenders etc. and nothing really worked.  The internet would cut in and out as I moved about the yard.  Now with Eero  the music keeps streaming and never cuts out.I highly recommend the Eero  just give it a day or two to get settled in.  Make sure youve updated to the lastest firmware.  If you have update problems, call support and they will help you.  Easy to setup, works great.
