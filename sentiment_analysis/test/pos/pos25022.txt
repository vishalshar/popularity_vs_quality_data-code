The creopop pen is really such a cool device. It's a little tricky to initially figure out how to use. My 9 and 12 year old girls each needed 10-15 minute of messing with It to start making little 3D objects like cubes, letters and simple flowers, then we're making more complex items and changing between colors after a couple hours.We learned on our first day that when opening a new ink and installing the proper tip, its helpful to press on the top of the ink until a little comes out the tip before installing it. Then you need to run the pen for 15 seconds or so to "prime" it.  It's also important to line up the top and bottom properly so everything makes good contact.  It was a little frustrating till we figured all that out but once we did, everyone, including me, had a lot of fun.To take full advantage of the pens capabilities and make more complex objects, you really need to toggle between speeds, tips, colors and fill / drying light only modes.We looked at some other 3D pens, but the fact that this one uses cool ink is a huge benefit in my book. Most of the others are like handing your kid a hot melt glue gun!Get the creopop, be patient and take the time to figure it out and you'll love it.
