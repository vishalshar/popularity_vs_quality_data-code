This is a great case if you enjoy being in the outdoors. I've had external crank generators but the form factor of this case makes it much more convenient. I'm surprised to see that it works pretty well too as advertised. Great little thing to show off to people and have started a few conversations. It's a little thick on the back but it's about the same exact size as other battery cases I've seen.Pros:-Works well to charge the battery-Can be clutch in case of emergency-Only one of its kind (so far)-Well engineeredCons:-There are slimmer cases out there (none that can charge your battery though)-The handle pulls out for extra grip, but I do wish it was a little larger
