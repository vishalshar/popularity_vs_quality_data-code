This seems to be the ideal gun safe for responsible and prepared parents.We like the biometric only option to open the safe. Curious two-year-olds can find keys, both mechanical and the RFID kind, and gain access to guns. By requiring a fingerprint we are assured that they will not be able to open it even if they find the key.We were concerned about the reader's speed and reliability using the fingerprint reader. We swipe our fingerprints to access our laptop and phones. This can be infuriating and would be unacceptable during an emergency should we need to access to guns while under stress.Reading our fingerprint is not instantaneous. It takes a second to identify our finger and release the spring loaded clam shell. We are able to have gun in hand in under two seconds. This is acceptable to us. We rely on a home alarm to alert us to an intrusion if one were to occur. We should have ample time to respond.During the first month of ownership, we thought the biometric reader would prove too unreliable for us. It only opened for us about three quarters of the time. We discovered two possible culprits, dry fingers and relying on the battery. The first is solved simply by moistening our finger before placing it on the reader. The second is solved by leaving it plugged in. We have had no problems since.We would like to see a larger model offered. It will not hold two full sized semiautomatics and related accessories. We would like to store two full sized guns and four magazines. As it is, it holds one 4" Springfield XD and one Walther P22 with only enough room in between them for one spare magazine. The width is fine, it is just not deep enough.The interior is lined with a rubber like material. But not all surfaces are covered; there is exposed bare aluminum. When we go to move the safe, our inclination is to carry it like a laptop. The guns move around and their finish has been scratched as result. We would prefer high density foam found in virtually all gun cases to secure them from movement and damage. We would also like a handle or some grippy surface treatment to make it easier to handle.The safe looks like some sort of electronic device and our non-gun owning friends probably just assume it is a WiFi router or cable modem. Their presumption is enhanced by the two USB ports in the rear and by the fact that it sits next to the laptop during the day on our kitchen counter. This is fine by us. It saves having uncomfortable conversations.We withheld a star reluctantly because we like it so much. There is nothing on the market that matches it. But the cumulative weight of the negatives prevent us from giving it an enthusiastic 5 stars.
