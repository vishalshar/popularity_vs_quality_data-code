I Love it.. I was a little worried at first when i saw all the postings about it not working or falling off.  But i wanted to try it, since my 5 year old loves things that glow and always wakes up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom...It works great.. Love that it turns all different colors. I have had no issues with the suction cups yet. HOpefully i wont ever have issues. Will see.but so far its great.UPDATE 4-5-16.  I guess the reviews were correct.:(  The suction cups started falling off.:(  Its still hangin on, by the insude suction cup, but the one for the main box that hangs outside the toilet, is definitely not working.:(  sucks, becuase this was a great product/idea.
