I really wanted to like Automatic, I really did, but I just don't.Let me start by describing why I wanted it, and what I was trying to do with it. I am a huge fan of linking smart devices together and having mundane stuff automated for me. If there is a smart version of somehting, I want it. I have a smart garage (Garageio), smart thermostat, smart lights, Alexa, smart remotes, etc. So the idea of making my car smart was awesome. I figured I'd grab an Automatic Pro, set up a bunch of iFTTT applets, and I'd be golden. Not so fast.....So here's the problem, applets do run....eventually. And that is useless. Here's a list of what I wanted to do:Open my garage door when I turned into my neighborhoodTurn the wifi on my phone off when I started my carTurn the wifi back on when I turned off my carMute teenaged daughter's phone when her car is startedAlert me when teenaged daughter's car left a predefined areaTurn my lights on when I get homeThere are more, but those are the main ones. Each and every one of those are completely useless if delayed. Sitting in my driveway for 20 minutes waiting for my door to open is not practical. Neither is sitting in the dark, or having my daughter's phone muted 10 minutes after she's already done driving. And this is exactly what happened. I got home last night to a closed door, so I opened it. I went inside, got changed, made a snack, sat down, watched some TV, then my door reopens itself. Not only is that not helpful, but it;s extremely unhelpful. Had I not been in the adjacent room to my garage, I may not have noticed the door opening and it would have been open all night. Useless.Aside from the total iFTTT failure, the app is less than good too. There is a persistent notification you cannot get rid of (sounds annoying, but it's way worse than it sounds). The app was clearly build with aesthetics as the priority over function. It looks great, functions at an average at best.I hope that this is a work in progress, but I am giving up on it for now. As it stands, I actually prefer NOT having it in my car over actually having it.Update:I updated my rating from 2 stars to 4, as Automatic worked with me and made some tweaks on their end that seems to have corrected the IFTTT delays. So far so good.
