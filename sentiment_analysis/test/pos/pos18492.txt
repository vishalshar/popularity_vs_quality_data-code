Blumoo installs quickly and easily.  I purchased an IR Repeater ($8 on Amazon) to enable me to put all my boxes in an enclosed cabinet.  I was up and running within minutes.  I have the mobile app running on two iPhones and an Android tablet.  I like the fact that I can deal with the TV from any room in the house.  I could even use the app from out of town if my wife ran into issues using the remote!  Absolutely love it!!
