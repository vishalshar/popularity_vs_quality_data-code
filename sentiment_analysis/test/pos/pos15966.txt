This espresso maker is amazing! I bought it for my husband and he is a coffee junkie, so he knows good stuff right away. Espresso that he made me was rich, full bodied, and had a generous layer of the softest foam on top. It is easy to use and take with you wherever you like. It takes some effort to squeeze the drink out of it and more than one session if you're THAT into coffee. Also, there's a cleanup, lots of details in this thing. But everything is made to last, nice solid material. I will probably buy more as gifts for my friends. Be aware that the same rules of choosing the roast and the grind apply here as with the regular espresso machines. I like my coffee softer, not overly bitter, so I usually go with the light roast with low acidity and it's a win.
