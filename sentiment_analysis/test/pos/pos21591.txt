This ring is amazing and is a must-have for people who are constantly on the go and don't want to be glued to their phones. I work as an event planner, and my team uses cell phones to communicate all day. However, it's easy to miss a call or a text if I'm moving things or talking to guests or helping a venue contact, and I constantly have to check my phone to see if I've missed something. This ring has been a game changer! Now I can leave my phone in my pack and not worry about missing anything. If someone calls or texts, a subtle vibration lets me know and I can immediately respond. I don't have to stay glued to my phone and can actually get work done! Some reviews have criticized this technology by saying it shackles people to their phones, but it's actually the opposite. It has allowed me to stop worrying about my phone and focus on more important things without any concern that I will miss a call. I LOVE this ring and can't wait for the bracelet line to come out!! Worth every penny!
