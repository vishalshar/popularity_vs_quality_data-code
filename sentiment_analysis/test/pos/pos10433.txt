I love these so much! I use them all the time for use with my existing mason jars. They fit very well and I like using them as water bottles or to hold items I've made (like roasted pumpkin seeds). I'm hoping the price point goes down a bit because they are a little spendy, but they are made so well that I anticipate they will last years and years.
