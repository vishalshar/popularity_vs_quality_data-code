I know I am going to sound like they paid me, I promise they have not ;) But I love this product. First it tastes amazing! Second, I realized how much they helped when I ran out, and I felt wicked bad. You need to take 6 of them totaling 60 calories. I find them a great snack during the day. Don't let them get hot though!
