I bought these laces because I have a bad back, and tying my shoes has become difficult.  I use these laces on my bowling shoes, I'm a size 5.  When I first laced them onto my shoes, I thought they would be too loose for my shoe size.  I went bowling with them the other day and the laces provide a nice, snug fit.  Also, as my feet expand during the league, the laces adjust accordingly.  My bowling shoes are very comfortable now, and I no longer struggle to get my shoes on.
