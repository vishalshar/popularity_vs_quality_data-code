I am new to the hobby of flying drones. I bought a cheaper drone with the joystick controls and did not like them very much. I looked at the reviews on this quad and decided to take a chance. This is so easy to fly, the app that you download for free is amazing. The best thing about this quad is that you fly it with your smartphone. Who doesn't have their phone with them at all times. The phone works off of the wifi box that comes with this product. I would highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for a great quad that flies very easy. I would also recommend the goggles that you can purchase to get the birds eye view of where the quad is. Registering the quad with the FAA is so easy too. That is only 5.00.
