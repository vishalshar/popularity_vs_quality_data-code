Definitely my favorite camera. A I have tried Foscam and Dropcam and I like this one better. Easy setups and app is easy to deal with. I do like standard connectors so - micro USB rocks and i can connect to a power bank and move it freely around for shorter times. It doesn't drop wifi, which some cameras do.  Completely happy with cheap $40/year cloud storage and recording.
