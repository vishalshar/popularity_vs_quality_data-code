Let me start by saying, this battery pack performs very well, especially considering its type being fairly new to market. I have seen some bad reviews for this and similar products, and I think that they are by people who don't know what they are buying.If you are expecting a portable wall outlet, then you are living in a fantasy. If you need some portable power for a low power AC device like a laptop charger then this is going to work great for you.Pros:-Compact for it's capacity-Sleek looking-Fairly efficient (for a modified sine wave inverter)-High sustained AC power output for what it is (~90W on my model)Cons:-Can get quite hot if left in an enclosed space (like a bag) while in use. This could be a big problem because there does not appear to be any thermal overload protection for the inverter (or it is set quite high)-Use of CR18650s (I assume based on dimensions) vs prismatic cells leads to a larger device than needed and lower energy densityTechnical Overview:Note: I do not work for the company, so my statements on the internals of this device are educated guesses.This pack seems to be build from 8x3000 mAh CR18650 cells likely placed in a series-parallel configuration of two strings of four. This would allow for the pack voltage to be 12-15V which is ideal for most inverter technology on the market. The overall pack is quoted as 24000 mAH due to its 8x3000mAH cells. This means that the total pack energy is approximately 90WH. This means that if you are using the pack at its full power capability of ~90W, expect it to be unusable in approximately 40 minutes (if you include some losses due to inefficiencies).In practice I have been able to charge my Surface Book from 5% to 60% while the laptop was in use on a full charge of the battery pack. My laptop has about a 70WH battery capacity which means that the pack was able to give it about 50WH (if you include a little for being in use) worth of energy before it quit. This means that battery to battery power conversion efficiency was around 50-60% which is not unexpected considering the type of inverter and various stages of conversion that happen.Overall I am very satisfied with this pack and I will continue to use it as a portable expansion to my laptop's internal battery for quite a while.I plan to update this review with pack wear and product life information when I can.
