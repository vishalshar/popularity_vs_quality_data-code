Couldn't tell you how many times I have needed a cable for my phone and not had one with me. With this clip I've always got one at the ready. My only complaint is that the cable is bound to the clip on the back by a small layer of plastic in the middle. I wanted to be able to fully remove the cable from the clip ( so I didn't have any extra weight on the connection ) a couple good tugs with a pair of needle nose pliers and I had that piece removed then it was just what I wanted.
