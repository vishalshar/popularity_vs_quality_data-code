love this case. rugged and tough-looking.  read reviews about insert making it hard to press buttons so i contacted rokform customer service on same day I bought.  They shipped a replacement out same day that arrived 2 days before the case did.  Apparently, though, the one I got had already been fixed since both inserts work well.  Another big plus is that it fits with the bodygardz pure glass cover and the edges come up to protect the sides of the glass cover (that has chipped on my iphone 5 in the past.  Highly recommend!
