These bars are amazing! So simple and so delicious, they make me feel good about snacking. Kuli Kuli bars are perfect for when I need that afternoon pick me up and before or after the gym. Definitely better than Larabars, which are similar, but don't have that moringa kick. I swear, the moringa gives me an energy boost. Also, these are green bars so the moringa has a little bit of a green tea taste, but it goes beautifully with the dates, almonds, and agave (yes, those are the only other ingredients in these things!).
