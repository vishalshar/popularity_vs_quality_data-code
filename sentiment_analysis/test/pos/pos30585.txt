So far this tracker works great! I can set my home range, and when she leaves that range it sends me a text on my phone. I can look at the map on my phone to see where she is and it gives me a comparison of where she is compared to where my phone and the base are located.  Those are nice futures! As written in some of the other reviews, it does take a few minutes for it to update, which is not a big problem.  I have only had it on her for a few days, but so far I like all the statistics it tells me about her sleep and activity habits, and for a dog who seems to wander around the farm, it is nice to know where she is.  Now I am just hoping that it can withstand running through tall grass and water on a daily basis.
