I bought the Automatic for my newly bought car. In the day I have used this it has already helped a lot, I have started to drive better breaking and accelerating slower. My favorite features have to be the trip tracking and the gas tracking, seeing the real MPG of my car is great and is going to help me see how much MPG I get driving certain routes. The combination of these features allows you to see how much each trip costs you which is really useful.Sadly with my iphone 6s+ the syncing is off a lot, and doesn't sync for a long while after. Which is why I gave this product 4 stars instead of five.Another thing I like about Automatic is the packaging doubles as a cup. Now the lid on this cup is not suctioned on the best, but the cup itself is still a great idea and other than the lid isn't half bad.Overall, I could recommend this device for use in your car, but I would make sure your car is compatible first and realize syncing may take some time.
