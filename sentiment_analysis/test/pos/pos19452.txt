There are no reviews of this machine and the reviews for other scanners were mixed.  I decided to buy one from Amazon, try it and if it didn't work, return it.  It works!  I'm only giving it 4 starts because I don't know anything about this stuff.  Long story below.Got interested in 3D printing and I have been researching printers for the past year or so.  I notice that they seem to keep getting better and cheaper.  I have not bought one because I can't figure out what I would do with it.  Also - don't know how hard it will be to create 3D images.So I downloaded a copy of Google Sketchup.  Watched all 4 of  their training videos on a wide screen so I could replicate what they were demonstrating on the actual software.  I can now make a cube with a pole sticking out of it.Then I got curious about scanners and decided to try this one.  It came in two days.  Everything was well packed and it was very easy to connect.  Instructions to set up and use are very, very simple.  My first scan was a disaster because I did not calibrate the system.  Also it took about 4 hours.  I have been using SketchUp on my firm issued laptop, but after this problem I connected the scanner to a much better PC out in the man-cave.I put a little basket about 2" tall on the scanner, scanned it.  Then I laid it on its side and scanned it again.  I used the software that comes with the scanner to 'clean' the images, then combined them.  Then I used their software to 'output as an "STL" file".Then I did something to  SketchUp that enables it to import STL files.  I had it import the basket.STL file from the scanner.  It took about 40 minutes (I'm back on the lap top - don't ask why).  When it got finished a very dense image is in SketchUp.I'll try to add some pictures.Some things you should know:  1) there are no real instructions.  Go to Matterandform.net and click on HELP.  That's all the instructions.  Their software lets you do 'advanced settings' but they are baffling.  One document that comes with the unit says there is NO Warranty.  Period.  It says this in about 10 languages.  Be sure to buy from Amazon.  I tried several different scans and it seems to work the best when there is a LOT of ambient light.
