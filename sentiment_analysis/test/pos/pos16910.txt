The stock iPhone earbuds are actually really good acoustically speaking, as long as you sit completely still so they don't fall out of place. This is an absolutely brilliant and deceptively simple solution for an annoying problem. No fancy bells and whistles here! Holds my earbuds in place even if I shake my head violently and keeps the sound in the "sweet spot". Genius. Highly recommended until you can drop $70 on some Ostry KC-06a earbuds.
