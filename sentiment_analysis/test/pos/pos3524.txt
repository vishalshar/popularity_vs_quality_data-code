An excellent tool for growing your own mushrooms. The mushrooms are delicious, however, I was only able to get one crop out of my farm due to another fungus growing over the growth medium - I was unsure if this would be safe or not, so I disposed of my farm. I would, however, buy another as I am confident that this was a fluke!
