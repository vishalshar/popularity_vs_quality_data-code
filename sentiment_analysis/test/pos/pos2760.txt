So far, I really like these. They sound great, and I love the ease of adjusting volume or muting the mic. With my old headset, I had to fumble around to find the mic button to respond when my wife was talking to me mid-raid. Battery life seems good so far, though I haven't figured out how to check how much power is left. I love the voice monitoring, and my friends say the chat quality is an improvement from my last set.Only complaint is that I wish the mute mic button was on the side with the mic.
