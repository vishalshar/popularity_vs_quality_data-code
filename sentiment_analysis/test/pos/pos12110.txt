We trained our pup to use this on the deck. although she still gets plenty of walks outside, sometimes she needs to go when it is inconvenient. We trained her to use it when she wasn't even potty trained yet, and once she figured it out we had no accidents. Now that it is cold, we just wait for poop to freeze and flush it down the toilet.
