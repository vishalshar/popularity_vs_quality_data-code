Amazing device. I thought this was just a sprinkler controller that used rain predictions to decide on wether to water or not, but is so much more then that. This device looks at key information (kind of sprinkler heads, soil type, what kind of vegetation) zone by zone and designs a custom watering plan in addition to gathering weather information and determining on if a zone needs to be watered or not.The science behind it is very interesting. So you will water some zones on some days and other zones on others. Now you can set up manual watering and do it the old fashioned way and just use it do water if it has not rained but I don't understand why anyone would do that.You can also start any zone up directly in real time from your phone. The phone app and the web portal are great and contain lots of information.Their employees seem to really enjoy what they do and I had all my pre-installation questions by their cheerful phone support.
