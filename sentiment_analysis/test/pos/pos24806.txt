I like my misfit shine 2 a lot and use it every night to track my sleep. The replaceable battery lasts for about six months. The strap leaves a bit to be desired. The misfit disc pops out of it very easily. I was grocery shopping once and the disc popped out in the frozen food freezer. It took a while to find it but I did.
