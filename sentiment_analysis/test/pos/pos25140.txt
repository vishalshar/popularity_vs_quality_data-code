Possibly they greatest thing to happen to haircare in decades. If I were capable of offering a guarantee for this product, I wouldn't hesitate to do so. The company itself is conscious of all the damaging chemicals on the market and has a mind to use only natural solutions in their products. This moisturizer has a nice fragrance that isn't overwhelming, it hydrates my hair without weighing it down, and I don't have to worry about doing long-term damage to my hair and scalp.
