I've had this for a few days and I already love it. It's a terrific idea and if connects in Colombia, Panama. Costa Rica, Mexico as easily as it connected at my house in Miami I'll be ecstatic.About the only quibble It's have is that the display screen is pretty low end and the viewing angle is pretty restricted. From the looks of the device and the microphone, speaker and volume buttons I'm guessing they have plans for a world phone. If that's the case they'll have to upgrade the display quality (and probably the size). But as a data access device it's no problem.Highly recommended[UPDATE 1: 20160417]GlocalMe just provided me with a free Unlimited Global data package for my use on several upcoming trips. I plan to update this review as I make my Spring journey through Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Mexico and Canada so come back later for updates. I fully expect "spotty" service in parts of Central America at least but one never knows, on prior trips with AT&T international service I had quite good success.This Fall we will be traveling to(Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Malta, Turkey, and Israel so I expect excellent results for the most part. Come back in November for the update.I see that GlocalMe is now offering a bundled version of the device with the global package. Great idea for frequent travelers.[Update 05/02/2016]So far I've had occasion to use it in Cartegena, Colombia where koo bit a solid 3G connection are a wait of about two minutes. I used it in Colon, Panama but was never able to get a connection. I did not have occasion to use it in Panama City.Over the next several days I'll be trying it in Costa Rica and Guatemala and will update the review again.[Update 05/05/16]Successfully used this in coastal Costa Rica at Puntarenas and coastal Guatemala in Puerto Quetzal. In both cases the device provided a solid 3G connection within about two minutes of starring up.One observation, it either be nice to display the band of the connected carrier on the screen.[Update 20160522] Used it this week in Nanaimo BC, Victoria BC, and Vancouver BC. As usual it connected without a problem but the best service level was never above 3G.
