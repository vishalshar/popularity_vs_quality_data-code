I love these things! I changed the decor around my house and switched ugly or leaking soap, hand sanitizer and lotion dispensers around my house with these, attached to my choice of various shapes of decorated mason jars. I even used them (without the large base) on glass Coke bottles.They work very well and I am very happy with my purchases (I bought quite a few of them)!
