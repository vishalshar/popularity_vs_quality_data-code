5+STARS!! I've used this uKeg64 for over a month and refilled 5-6x's. Overall, highly, highly recommend this product. The uKeg design is very well thought out. It's easy to use, clean and fill. The stainless steel used seemed to be of high quality with looks and feels nice. Unit uses two types of CO2 cartridges (8 and 16). The smaller holder comes with the unit to fit 8 size cartridge (food grade) but I also ordered the larger holder to test. IN use, I was able to hold beer over a week with no pressure loss and beer remains fresh. Once the PSI pressure is set, the unit automatically adds pressure to keep PSI constant.The best part is the response I've received from customer service. I had a few question so emailed support. The response came back with times within same day.My sister ordered a copper version for me as a gift. I am excited to get the product.A must buy item for beer lovers. Enjoy....
