Love this! Use it every time I wash my hair. Allows me to wrap my hair to dry after the shower without causing it to dry out, become super frizzy/unmanageable or extremely knotted or tangly. The diamond did fall off after a few uses, but I simply double reinforced the diamond back on with the original string as well as my own string. Cannot say enough great things about this item.
