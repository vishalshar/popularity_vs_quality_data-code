This is exactly what I've been looking for for lunch boxes for my 2 and 4 year olds!  Having to send multiple different containers when part of their lunch needs to stay warm (requires a thermos) is a pain for packing lunches and for the poor preschool teachers having to deal with it.  This is the perfect solution!  The only complaint I have is that I only ordered 1 initially to make sure I liked it and now I'm stuck waiting on the 2nd one I ordered since it appears to be on back order.
