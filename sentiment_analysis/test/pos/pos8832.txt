Great Product.I have used this for a few days and truly like it, no more Cables cluttering my desk.Pros:  Sturdy, flexible, works with my IPhone 6+ just fine.  I like it.  Once plugged in and charging , if you get a call/text/post  it disengages quickly so you can answer etc...  I find I just leave it plugged in, even when I put my Laptop in my bag. Nicely compact.Con's:  They need to realize most corporate users have a docking station. It would be nice if it was designed for this, a bit longerI showed this to my co workers, and this was their only negative, but then again, I love the lack of no cable.That said, It works fine on my Laptop Docking Station at work, it keeps the phone out of the way.I love it and would by it again.
