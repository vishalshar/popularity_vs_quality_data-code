I really love my Bellabeat! I like the meditations that it offers, which I didn't even realize I needed before buying it. It really helps calm and center me when life can be crazy especially around the holidays. I also like the sleep tracking and activity tracking. I don't wear it into hot yoga for fear of messing with the battery, but I can still easily manually enter my workouts and also I can, just as of recently, manually enter meditations done without the use of the app, which I really appreciate.
