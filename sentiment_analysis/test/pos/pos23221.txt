As others have noted, the lack of battery power is the biggest drawback. Others have cited lack of consistent power, but for me, the issue is that I live in a really old apartment with a sever lack of outlets, which limits the locations I can put the feeder and also adds to my power strip / extension cord situation (which is something I have been trying to minimize because it is, of course, a safety issue).But those issues overcome, the feeder itself is quite good. My cat is notorious for figuring out how to break into feeders, and I've had to Jerry-rig solutions before to prevent her from doing everything from prying lifs off to pawing at the open dish until it moves over enough so that she can wedge her paw into the next bowl that contains food, which she proceeds to eat with utmost diligence, one tiny pawful at a time. She tried her hardest to move this dish but it wasn't going anywhere, and after a few days, she gave up trying. That in and of itself may be worth the expense.I would like the option to completely disable the webcam. I know some people may like this feature, but I don't have a use for it and have taped over it in the meantime. Like the baby monitors that can be hacked into, I view this as more of a gimmick/security risk that isn't worth the ability to see a few chair legs and my cat's giant head when she's actually shoving her face into her food. But tape will suffice for now.Overall, as a feeder it is excellent, but could do with fewer gimmicks and a battery option. Maybe less tech bells and whistles could also reduce the price.
