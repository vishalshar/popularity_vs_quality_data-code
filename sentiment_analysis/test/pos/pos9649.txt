It's a really great product. This stuff really works! I own over 5 pairs of football gloves. They obviously lose grip after a few games and with this product it really helps revive the grip/stickyness. Just apply dime size on your glove and smear it around your gloves and let it air dry for a bit then, BAM! The grip is back, you can now go out and catch everything.. lol
