My main reason to purchase these was out of lazyness and a hatred of wasting time tying my shoes, I'm not a runner or anything extreme. I've used these for about a year now and purchased a second pair for another pair of shoes. Before getting these I was on the fence about them but after wearing them in my shoes for an entire year I can recommend them. NOTE: Try several different lace patterns to get your fit right. It took me 3 tries to get a good feel that was tight and lose where I wanted it to be. They also get a little looser over time so you might need to readjusted the pattern after half a year like I did. I've had a couple of them rip due to wear and tear but they give you several extras in the package. I admittedly don't take care of my shoes or laces at all and they may have failed because I have a tendency to rub my feet together or clumsily smash them into rocks, steps, branches, and other sharp things. One of my initial fears was they may look goofy but they look just like normal laces with a tucked in bow, nobody has noticed them with out me bring up the topic.
