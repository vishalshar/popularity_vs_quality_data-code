InSANEly small and snappy! Great for projects that need a small Android device to do something entirely different than calling people. It does, however, call people just fine. WiFi works swell and it's a 4G phone when you need M2M comms.Great tech support, they proactively called and emailed me to solve my small issue the next day.
