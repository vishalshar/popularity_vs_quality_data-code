Well made should be great as a money belt. Holds passport and phone and key. I only wanted it for passport and money so they stay concealed. I didnt realize that the pockets were padded. I think it will be better in the long run to keep things from falling out but Im fairly thin and i wanted it to blend in under my clothes when on buses in central america but you can see the lines of it under my clothes. it probably wouldnt show up under a jacket or if you are a heavier build. It would be good for jogging and moving around it has a low profile and doesnt bounce. My only worry is that it would look like a fanny pack if too much stuff was put in it while out jogging or something
