The mouse is great.  It has a very high quality feel and performs really well.  The mouse is better suited for those with medium to small(er) hands.  The profile and height of this mouse is smaller than most.  With that said, the ergonomics are really nice.  The mouse feels natural.My downgrade was because my front mouse button is not as snappy as the back and for a company that's all about craftsmanship this seems incongruent.  Also the price is high for the feature set when compared to other premium mice.Update 1 Jun 2016:I have been using the mouse for almost 2 months now for well over 100 hours.  All I can say is "Wow".  I have never liked the advice to "wait until you get used to it".  However, in this case, it is relevant.  The more I use the mouse the better it feels.  The slight adjustments made over time make a big difference.  The combination of comfort and senor make using this mouse very enjoyable.  I have found myself purchasing more FPS games just to enjoy it more.  And even replaying old favorites (Half Life 2 and Thief 2).  I still think it's a 4-star rating due to my previous justification, but I felt it important to update this review after some time using the mouse.
