I own a small insulation company. And I recently purchased this to show customers  where they have cold drafts or hot spots.  I used it on my phone and it works great. But when I plug it into my Tablet the actual image is sideways. I tried to change the settings and rotate my tablet but every time the image is still sideways. I would have rated this a 5 if it worked on my tablet.  Some of my costomers are older and cant really see my phone screen that well. I have even called and talked to their customer support  and they do not have the software update to change that yet. Hopefully soon.
