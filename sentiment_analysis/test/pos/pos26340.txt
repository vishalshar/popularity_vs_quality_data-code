Received mine yesterday and felt I should do like most kids and play with it a bit. I charged it as well as loaded up a micro sd (32gb) with around 25 movies mostly in mpg4 format. The quality of the movies played back through the projector was awesome. It was comparable to the quality I would have gotten from the same movie being played on an HD Led TV. The only thing that I did notice was that it did not show all the movies within the movies folder. I'm still playing with it to figure out why and will update this review accordingly when I find out what the issue is. I honestly have to say that being someone who travels constantly with my work. I'm not always able to carry a tv to some of the remote locations I travel to. This wonderful little cube is most definitely the answer to said problem. The brightness of the projected picture is decent enough that on a shadowed area (by shadowed I mean out of direct sunlight) at around 4pm. I was able to display a near perfect picture on the ceiling of an entrance to the building I was entering with a screen size of around 65". The sound is a little low one this unit so I would recommend an external speaker for movies or music. This has been a very good purchase and I personally have no regrets whatsoever.Now on to future improvements that could be made:1. Make it bluetooth capable so a wireless speaker could be connected.2. Wifi would be nice but not needed since connecting devices could be done through BT.3. Add a few more types of connection possibilites, IE: HDMI and usb.Other than that, awesome product!
