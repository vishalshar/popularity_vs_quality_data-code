Great little comb.I've always feared growing out a beard due to how frizzy and out of control mine sometimes gets. However, the go-comb is awesome for keeping my mountain man look in check.It's far more sturdy than cheap, plastic ones, and its size is perfect, fitting in my wallet for easy access and convenience. Only complaint is the tines seem a bit on the sharp side, but whatever. A tough neck is manly.
