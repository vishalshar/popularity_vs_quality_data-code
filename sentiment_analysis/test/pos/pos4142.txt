These lids are both practical and stylish.  We'd backed them on Kickstarter, and found we used the 8" size so much we wanted to get another (and once it arrived, we immediately put them both in use).  They're fantastic for covered storage on the counter or in the fridge, and terrific for microwaving.  They are available in a wide range of sizes and fun colours--we have almost every size (including the mug-sized, perfect for keeping tea warm) and are getting a lot of use out of them all.
