I bought this for travel to drown out background noise when staying in hotels, and the fact that it's Bluetooth enabled is a huge bonus.  Haven't traveled with it yet, but the sound machine function seems to be adequate and should do the trick.  The Bluetooth function is incredibly high quality - I was pleasantly surprised.  Happy with this purchase.
