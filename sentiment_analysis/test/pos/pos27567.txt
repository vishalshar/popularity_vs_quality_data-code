I have had a chicken pock scar right on the end of my nose since I was eight years old. I've been self conscious about it for as long as I can  remember. No matter how much I try to live an enlightened life and try to accept it, I can't. I gave in a couple years ago and tried to have it lasered and subcised (sp?)  a couple of times. but after a few hundred dollars and multiple days off work to heal it left my nose looking worse. i was desperate to find something, anything to cover this problem as it was in such a conspicuous spot on my face. I came across this stuff on the internet and decided to try it. I am soooooo glad I did. I will use this stuff on my scar (hopefully) the rest of my life. For me and my particular scaring, Dermafledge is perfect. I take that back, it's not perfect. It lasts no where near as long as it says it does. Frays around the edges at the 6 or 7 hour mark now matter how well you put it on. But a little hairspray around the edges can make it last a few more hours. No, it's not water proof, can't wear make up over it, takes practice "getting it right" and is NOT cheap. But for the first time in my life I can be around people I know, met new people, be face to face with customers at work or in social situations ALL DAY long with out constantly (in the back of my mind) be thinking that all they see is my scar. And that to me is worth all the negative things about this product. there are plenty of good things too: One applicator lasts a while, anyone can find a good shade for their skin color I'm sure and with practice it only takes about 3 MINUETS! to apply, if I get it right the first time (which I usually do now). You don't even need makeup cause it looks very natural, maybe a little underneath if you want. Product is exactly what I had been looking for for a long time. I'm not a review writer. Only because I want this product to still be around 20 years from now did I write this review.
