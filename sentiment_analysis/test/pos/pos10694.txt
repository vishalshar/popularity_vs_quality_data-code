I bought two of these for my small dogs because one of them needs to lose weight. Originally, I was a bit disappointed when the instructions said it should be worn on the collar vs a harness, but my girls only wear a harness. After some testing, I basically get the same results on a collar or harness. I was surprised to see how lazy my dogs are!! The points seem accurate based on different lengths of walks we have done. I use the app on an iPhone 6 with no issues with Bluetooth or uploading.I have noticed the length of your battery is dependent on how often you you upload the information throughout the day. When I first got the device, I kept uploading like every hour and it only last about 2-3 days. I download 2-3 times a day now and it lasts 7 days. My dogs have gone in the water wearing the device.I love the weekly updates which compares your dogs to others (See Photo)Only complaint is the emerald green does not look like the photo.
