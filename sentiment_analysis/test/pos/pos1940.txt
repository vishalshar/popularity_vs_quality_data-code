I bought this genius piece of technology for my daughters cat whom I've had staying with me for the past 6 months while she was abroad in London. I fell head over heals in love with the little guy. I don't work outside of the house, so needless to say the little angel got spoiled rotten with endless affection and three meals of wet canned food a day. I'm pretty sure it was like a vacation to Disney Land for the little guy. Definitely a 5 star experience. Well, as the time drew near for him to return to his mama, I fell deep into a depression. Black bear's mama is a classically trained bartender, and she goes to school. How is my angel going to keep up with his new routine?!  Well, everything turned around the day I read the words Feed and Go. A light at the end of the tunnel. My grand baby angel could still get 5 star service in his very own home, 3 wet food servings a day, and I could watch him while he dines, and know with certainty his belly will be full. It's absolute brilliance. It works like an absolute charm, and the owner of the company Alex is on top of everything 110%.  5 star all the way.  Literally never have had better customer service than this. Alex, you're a genius!!!!  Thank you for bringing me peace of mind.  I hope you get more success than you know what to do with.
