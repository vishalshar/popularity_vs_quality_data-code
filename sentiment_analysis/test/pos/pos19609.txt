The feeders are great.  The only issue we have had is they will randomly go offline which than changes the feeding schedule.  I emailed the company and they have been very responsive.  The offline thing could be a router problem but the odd thing is everything else is online in the house.We have two feeders and only one goes offline at a time, they do not both go offline at the same time.  The feeders are about 30 feet from our router so distance should not be an issue.  Again the company is working with us to resolve this issue.  Our dogs love them...
