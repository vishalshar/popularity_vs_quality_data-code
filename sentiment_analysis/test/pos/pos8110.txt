I have purchased 5 of these light switches over the past few months, every single one has worked flawlessly. Let me preface this my saying i have a background in IT so that helps me better understand how the setup process works. As far as the setup process goes, I would highly recommend using an Apple device to run the initial setup. The android version of the wemo app is a little buggy UNTIL you apply the latest firmware update to the switch. After the firmware is applied, either app works perfectly. I have all 5 of the light switches setup to turn on\off with sunset\sunrise. To date it was worked every single time. I have tested the functionality of long distance control via my cell phone while at work with good results. The only "issue" i have to report is that sometimes there is a slight delay in the application recognizing that the light is turned on. This can be remedied by clicking the refresh button on the top right hand corner of the screen. Most of the problems that people are having with these switches can be remedied by properly configuring the WiFi in the house. These switches need a good signal that is not on an overcrowded WiFi channel. If you've got all that sorted out, these switches are completely problem free. They just work...
