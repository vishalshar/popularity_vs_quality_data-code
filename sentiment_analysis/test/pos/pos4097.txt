I can't say enough about this product or the company that produces it. You can read the following about an issue I had with the shipment. The company acted quickly to resolve my concerns.Also, in the meantime, I HAVE tried all the flavors, and they are delicious! The label on each jar recommends how best to use them.Anyway, when I agreed to try these, I was really looking forward to this variety pack. All the flavors sounded delicious. I couldn't wait to try it.However, out of the five jars in the pack, only ONE arrived with the depressed button on the lid--the other four had apparently been opened (or jiggled enough to break the seal). I was gravely concerned about the safety of consuming this product.I contacted the company: I called but got voicemail, at which point I opted to send an email. the website said to allow 48 hours for a reply. Well, that was several days ago, and I was getting discouraged.Today, I received a phone call and an email from the company--the spokesperson apologized profusely for the delay, but explained that, since they are a small start-up and the person who handles emails was out, they did not get back to me as soon as they had hoped.She assured me that the butter is SAFE even with the button popped up. They way they package the butter doesn't necessarily create suction in the lid. However, the clear plastic collar around the lid indicates whether or not it has been tampered with. Since that was intact, the butter was properly packaged.The product does not need to be refrigerated, and regular butter doesn't typically come in pressure-sealed containers. So I thought that maybe the jars were chosen for packaging appearance but not necessarily for any intrinsic safety precaution. As it turns out, the button doesn't have any bearing on the integrity of the jar.IN THE MEANTIME.....Regarding the regular flavor, the texture of ghee is sort of hard to get used to. It's like wax. But it does soften up.The flavor was very subtle, but it was the original recipe with no added seasonings.The texture was a bit oily, but again, that's probably something I could get used to. I don't think this has to duplicate traditional butter, so I have to get past making that comparison.Again, if you are hesitant or have questions, this company does seem to really believe in their products and they are very nice to deal with.
