I already wrote a similar review for the lavender shampoo, but I thought I'd give my two cents on the conditioner too because it has no reviews as of yet.This product has nothing in it that could possibly hurt your hair, scalp or other systems in your body, and most other hair products do (sulfates, alcohols, formaldehyde-releasing ingredients, the list goes on). I bought this product because of that, and found that it makes my hair nicer than every other hair product I've tried, including Aveda, Davines and Sudzz. It also gets rid of itchy scalp and dandruff.My hair is fine and dry. This shampoo/conditioner combo keeps it strong, moisturized and prevents it from splitting, and I don't have to worry about long-term damage to my hair or scalp. I will most definitely buy this shampoo/conditioner set again.
