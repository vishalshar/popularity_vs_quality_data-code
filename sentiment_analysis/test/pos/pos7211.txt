This litter tray is good quality hard plastic, only received today it was Fast delivery it only took 5 days to Australia. Will review again with first change of litter!! I went reusable as I was buying disposable ones every 1 1/2 weeks as I had 2 cats and was getting expensive! The pet safe scoop free automatic litter tray is fabulous and only having to touch the litter once every 1 1/2weeks sure bets cleaning the litter each day
