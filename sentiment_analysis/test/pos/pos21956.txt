This is great as a weekend tinter, but it's much lighter then expected. I have very blond lashes, with very blond eyebrows, and very blond hair. It's all also very fine so they get weighed down easily. this is great for just a little color if I'm going without makeup, or with very little. I also use it on my eyebrows. Its the perfect shade for them. All in all, I use it way more on my eyebrows then eye lashes.
