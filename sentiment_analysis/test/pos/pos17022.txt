Kuna light is easy to install and link to my iPhone and it looks great. After I installed the kuna kight fixture after only one night  i caught an individual aproach my home at 1:30 am with a sock on his hand he climbed my stairs and stole my light bulb. And he stole several more in my neighborhood with video i had we posted this on facebook many people saw the video . The story was picked  up by a local radio station whose dj was also a victim of this creepy man it was then  broadcast on wbz tv 4 in boston this thief is now known as the "charlestown light bulb  bandit" if you google this charlestown light bulb bandit you can see the video. Well done kuna i will be installing more of these light at the other entrances to my house.
