I just received it today. Had to read the instructions and splice the wires to extend them. But after that it wasn't too difficult to install. I had a craftsman garage door and they had color coded only the red. But I got it working the first try. Once the wires were in place, the glink light turned blue. Then I held the tiny button on the glink for 10 seconds and the light came back on. Next I downloaded the app, tested it and it worked like a charm. Small delay from instruction to execution but the convenience is worth it. Installed it on all 3 iphones in the family and now we feel like we are set. Worked fine on all three phones after following instructions on how to set up additional phones. Very pleased with the purchase especially because I got it on a lightning deal!
