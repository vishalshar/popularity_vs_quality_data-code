It's not often I take the time to write a review but I simply had to for this product.This is one of those things that makes you say "WOW why didn't I think of that?" It's simply brilliant design and it's simple purpose and operation is amazing. It is built very well - extremely sturdy and stable/solid there is no worry about it falling off or damaging any smartphone on the market, or your car. You can even use it while a CD is in the slot, it doesn't insert far enough to affect normal operation. (!!)It is more than adjustable to fit even a Galaxy Note series down to the tiniest of smartphones. I couldn't be more excited to have purchased this product. It has plenty of room and adjustment to not only plug in my car charger but also my headphone jack to connect my phone (RAZR MAXX HD) to my car stereo's AUX jack. You have full side-to-side adjustment and just squeeze the clamps down where you want it to stay, and it will stay.The CD mounting part is also brilliant utilizing a reverse-clamping mechanism. You adjust the thumbscrew and the CD mount portion you slide into the slot opens apart to clamp against the opening for the CD player so it doesn't slide out or move around whatsoever. Then of course, you have full swivel for the phone portion of the mount that also has a very large, solid screw that will hold it in place wherever you decide to angle your phone. It tilts up and down and side to side and if your CD player opening is down low, you simply install the mount upside-down to bring the phone higher. If your CD player is near the top of your dash, install it normally so the phone hangs-down below your dash if you wish. Plenty of flexibility in such a small, sturdy package.Really, just an amazing product. Whoever invented it should become an instant millionaire, it's that good. The suction cup, windshield mounts and airvent mounts are junk compared to this thing. It's thin enough to be able to be inserted in many "factory" gaps found in dashboards/consoles of most cars today so you don't even have to have a CD player to use it with.This product is truly one of the most functionally exceptional purchases I've ever made, no matter what the dollar amount. I'd gladly pay $99 for this so for $25 it's a steal!
