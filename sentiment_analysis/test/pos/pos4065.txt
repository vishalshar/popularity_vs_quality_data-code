I love this keyboard.  I bought it knowing the layout would be a little cramped, but there's not much you can do about that given the iPad mini's form factor.  The main keys are all pretty close to regular size, but the outer keys are squished in, but are for the most part still easy to use.  The keyboard itself looks like an Apple quality product, the keys themselves look like the ones on my MacBook Pro, and the finish matches my iPad perfectly.  Hinges are sturdy, and it holds the iPad firmly.  My only issue is that the bottom 5% of the screen is pretty much inaccessible, which makes getting to the swipe up menu difficult, and can sometimes make tapping things like text boxes difficult.
