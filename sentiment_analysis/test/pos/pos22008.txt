The instructions for setting it up it were so simple I frankly did not believe they would work. They did! Flawlessly!  First router I've used with truly hassle free set up and configuration - finally!!!  So far Portal has delivered on being lightning fast, even with heavy use. I have a big house with WiFi hogging teenagers and over a dozen devices connected at a go. Netflix in HD and Spotify are usually running simultaneously. Portal has handled all this with zero problems -  much better than my  Nighthawk, which needed an extender to get to the back office. No more dropouts - Yay!  Teenagers stopped complaining about Wifi - Yay! Worth adding that I dig the clean look of the router.  No idea how it can work so well with no funky antennas sticking out, but it does. I connected the free app that let's you monitor the network and do some configuration things. It's clean like the hardware, but haven't really explored it yet - haven't needed to since everything just worked out of the box. Seems simple enough.  Bravo Portal!
