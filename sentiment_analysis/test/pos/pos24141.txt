This camera came exactly as advertised.  I bought it for a very anxious cat, and she was a little nervous at first because of the noises it made when it fired up and dispensed treats.  However, she got used to those sounds, and now they are the very things that alert her to come to the machine.  And she does almost every time.  The camera is great for my purposes, and overall, I am very pleased.
