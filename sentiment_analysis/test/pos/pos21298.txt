Great tape measure. Since I'm not any good at reading an old fashion tape measure, I thought that I would give this one a try and it did not disappoint. I've had it for a few months and it's still working properly. I'll double check it every once in awhile with a regular tape measure and it is still accurate. Great  price for such a great product.
