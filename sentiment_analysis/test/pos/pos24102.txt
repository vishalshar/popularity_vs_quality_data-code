Ive been using the remix for several months as a multimedia player.  I have ethernet hard wired and bluetooth keyboard/mouse.  With ES file explorer I have no issues accessing windows file shares and playing them with VLC or MX Player.  Bother players output DD5.1 and DTS.  The Netflix and Amazon Video apps both work.  To get decent performance, you need to change the settings to high picture quality.  There are also OS settings to make the apps run full screened vice in a maximized window.  The Mali-400 GPU is not going to do much with cutting edge games, but it is more than satisfactory for the OS GUI,  and decoding HD video.  It also supports h.265 HW decoding (4K UHD video).I played around using it as a desktop,  using firedox,  chrome,  and WPS Office.  A few stutters here and there but completely useable provided you respect the limitations od the HW.
