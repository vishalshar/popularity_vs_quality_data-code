I had the original pebble for about a year and absolutely loved it. I heard the pebble 2 was coming out and figured I'd pick one up (my original one got a big scratch on the screen.) I've been wearing the pebble 2 for about a week now and love it even more. It's everything that I enjoyed about the original made better. It's a more comfortable, slimmer, and better fit. It last a whole week on one charge. It still has that easy to read display. Waterproof. And now it has voice message!! The point is this watch is simple and just works. If your looking for a 300$ fancy touch smartwatch then this is not for you.Thanks again Pebble for another great productOn a side note I had to return my first original pebble smartwatch bc it didn't work right and they sent a replacement in 2 days. (Again this was my original pebble, not the pebble 2)
