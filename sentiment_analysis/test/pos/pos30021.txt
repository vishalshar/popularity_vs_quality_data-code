I originally bought the R1 from Robo 3D and have had it for a year. That being said I've been able to have a lot of experience with this machine. All-in-all, it's a fantastic printer and worth every penny.Do realize that 3D printing has yet to become consumer-minded. They are trying to make the printer as plug-and-play to the best extent but if there is a problem, having some experience in electronics could be worthwhile. That being said, I had no experience. These things aren't perfect and can have problems from time to time. 3D printing, especially desktop printers, are still in its infancy. Give it time.I've printed out a ton of things. Ranging from completely stupid models off Thingiverse.com to printing business prototypes. It's quality for price is magnificent. I've also modded the crap out of my printer- almost all entirely printed by the printer. Except for switching to Cura instead of MatterControl and some new wiring, fans, LCD, and lights, all mods have been printed. Things are limitless!Customer service wise, Robo 3D has amazing customer service. The guys over at Robo 3D genuinely care about their customers and what they need. I had accidentally snapped a wire on the printer, got a response from customer support two hours later. They're awesome (after warranty, the parts are pretty cheap, too).Honestly can't say enough about these guys. At first was nervous throwing $800 down on a printer but I dont regret it.Picture attached, currently out of order due to me snapping a wire.
