Over 1000 lumens of colored goodness :)  I have had connectivity issues with the Lifx bulbs but the new iOS app and bulb firmware have been working great. My bulbs are finally working properly and I can connect to them all of the time now. The remote connectivity feature is also working very well. IFTTT also works great with the bulbs.
