November 30,2016 - connected charger to iPhone 7 plus when battery was at 20 percent charge and left on it for about an hour and a half. All 4 indicator lights were out and the phone charge was 89 percent. Left connected about another 15 minutes to see if more charge was available but the charge stayed at 89 percent. I like the size and output cables of the unit and plan to keep it even tho it only added a 70 percent charge to the iPhone 7 plus. Undecided on purchasing 4 more for Christmas gifts; but a 70 percent charge is good when you need the convenience this unit offers.
