We live in the Desert Southwest and it seems all sprinkler controllers out here are outside - making this a required piece of our Rachio install.  The box protrudes from the wall a bit farther than the Irritrol it replaced.  Install is simple enough if you know what you are doing.  The plastic feels a bit rigid / brittle and thin compared to my old Irritrol Rain Dial.  Fingers crossed this lasts in the brutal heat/sun we get here.  The closing mechanism is a bent plastic clip - which would likely be the first point of failure if the sun does destroy it - and would require replacing the whole box - which would be a hassle to be sure.Note: the cover that you would normally place on the Rachio Controller is removed permanently when you use this enclosure.Rachio - if you read these reviews - PLEASE stick with the current wall mount screw pattern for future devices and enclosures - I would have to drill more holes in my outside wall to install the next generation!
