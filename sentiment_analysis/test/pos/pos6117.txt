The item is exactly as described 15.6 inch screen, back-lit keyboard, aluminum body and comes with Win 10 already installed with an option to try the new version of MS office. I am not to technical when it comes to laptops but it is extremely responsive with your regular programs like MS W but I haven't tested it yet with a graphic intensive game so I can't judge gaming performance. The  GeForce 960M has a 2GB size with 7.87 GB of usable DDR4 memory for the system itself. My primary  reason for purchasing was to upgrade from my desktop PC  (which is almost 6 years old) without bursting the bank and so far it seems to be a great decision.
