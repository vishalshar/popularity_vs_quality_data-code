Best gaming headseat I have had. I went from turtlebeach px51 $265 to these. I like these way better and the aluminum fram is sturdy, no worries like turtlebeach with the plastic cracking. Sorry for those who have had issues with these but I have had none, enjoy not having cable attached to controller. I like the simplistic feature not a bunch of unecessary features.
