unwrapping my URB-E I could instantly smell the smooth, creamy texture. tasting the sweet lines, curves, and springs, I knew I had stumbled onto a delicious solution to my transit woes.I live in a tiny little state wherein the saying is that any car ride longer than 30 minutes is a day trip. this is only sometimes a bit of an exaggeration.I don't drive, so most of those day trips are by bus or train to a nearby state. I was looking for something compact, electric, and with a top speed of 15 miles per hour. what I got was not a plastic "hoverboard" which I'm sure would eventually have had me picking teeth up off the side walk. nor am I worried that a fault in the voltage regulation circuit will cause it to explode mid-charge it. now when I get lost in boston or new york, doubling back won't as often add twenty minutes to my ETA. now there isn't a real question of finding bike friendly trains or buses, this neatly folded package feels like I can fit it anywhere.it feels repetitive to say in a review, but it usually isn't for the "last mile" usually it's the last three or four miles in the sun with a heavy backpack. a bike retains the quality of requiring some amount of exertion proportional to things like topography, and I'm not a big fan of sweating through my clothes before I get to my destination. even when I'm going someplace on a bus route, chances are good that if it's approaching midnight I'll have to wait somewhere between one and 6 hours for the next bus home. at which time it's not like I want to peddle the distance.anyway, back to how smooth the acceleration and braking is.I haven't gone up and down every hill available to me yet, so I won't comment on that, but the precision control and quiet operation already has me plotting for a second.also, it was always going to be this over a vespaupdate the first:my first extended ride was full of uneven pavement, potholes and weaving. none of these things caused legitimate concern for Three Threes.  I spent more time going down hill than up, but in either case it was almost spooky how light a touch I was able to use on the throttle.so far I can't really complain I'm planning to get the strap to remind myself that it's easier to just carry it across busy intersections.fair warning. I broke several nails, but that was when i slipped in new shoes carrying it, so I suppose this is a non sequitur about how I should have worn more familiar shoes.one more thing, I'm 6 feet tall, but this feels completely different from riding a too-small bike. over the length of today's ride I slowly became more comfortable putting my feet on the pegs( I wore shiny new shoes to log wear from riding). my balance isn't great, but this has been easier and more comfortable to ride than a bike for me. it really is a bit nerve wracking at first how much acceleration it gives you. another reviewer compared it to the jump to warp speed, which I have to agree with. I'm skittish, so I'm probably going to get a motorcycle helmet before I push it past cruising speeds, but, unlike warp, acceleration feels buttery smooth and much more linear. which is fine, I don't need to evolve gills yet.I think I should be documenting this better. next time maybe I'll venture out for a night ride by street lamp.
