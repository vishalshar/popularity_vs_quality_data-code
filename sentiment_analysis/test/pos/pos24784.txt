Adore.  Is there any better word than that?!?  These gluten-free, organic, non-GMO, amazing crunchy strips of goodness are so versatile!!!  I bought a case of them (saves money!) and do not regret it!  They're awesome on yogurt and fruit; they're great crunched up and used as toppings for things like cakes; they can be eaten as a snack; and I'm sure there are a thousand other ways to use them that I'll figure out over time.
