I wanted a fitness tracker, but I wasn't keen about fitbit because I didn't think they were stylish. I heard about the Leaf and read many positive reviews. It's very versatile to wear as jewelry, or simply clip it on your bra. As a person with insomnia it's helped me to track my sleep quality and I really enjoy the meditations. The app is easy to use and sync with and bellabeat is constantly innovating. I would definitely recommend it to all my girlfriends. You don't have to be a gym rat to glean so many benefits from this tracker.
