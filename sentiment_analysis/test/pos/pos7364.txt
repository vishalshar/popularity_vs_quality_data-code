Pure Android simplicity on a desktop.  I bought this to replace my aging Linux box on my workbench down in the garage; which I use to watch DIY repair videos, stream Pandora or stream the news while working on something.Based on several reviews, I was originally skeptical of this unit; but after watching a few Youtuber's explain that Jide pushes updates on a semi-regular cadence I knew what to expect.  After all the updates completed and I set up the Google play store (super easy)  It's been a pure joy to use...And that's after using it almost daily for six months!  I'm thinking of getting another one for my office upstairs.
