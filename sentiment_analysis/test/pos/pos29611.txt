I got these food pouches because I had been giving them to my stubborn toddler who we worry about nutrients with, my local store stopped carrying them. I tried the other flavor but there is just a level of comfort with the variety of healthy ingredients in this blend. I was so pleased to find them on here with a decent price. They definitely were missed and I will be buying a bigger quantity or doing subscribe and save next time. My son is very happy to have his balanced dinner back. As surprising as it might be, he LOVES the flavor of this! I add a teaspoon of melted coconut oil to it but he will eat it plain too. I will just add that the first time I ever tried this I hated it because I thought 8 tablespoons of water sounded like too much, but trust me you need the full reccomendation of water because otherwise it will be lumpy and the baby won't like it as much.
