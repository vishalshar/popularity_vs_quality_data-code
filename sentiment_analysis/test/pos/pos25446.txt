This really adds a lot to music, games, and movies.Pros:Portablerelatively quite in room with ambient noise (up to about 1/3 power which is plenty)Not as goofy looking as I thought it would be.  Looks kind of like a water pack.Cons:* it CAN be heard in a quite room except for when it is on very low power (barely able to feel).  Don't plan on wearing this to the Library!* Very expensive for a tactile transducer (granted, its the only portable one I know of)* Bluetooth has white noise.* The headphone in/out connections have this same white noise* No charge light indicatorThe biggest negatives  where the fact that it effected the audio of your headphones, however a headphone amp or a simple headphone splitter fixed this.  If you plan on using the Bluetooth option just be prepared to listen to white noise in the background, or turn up the volume over half way to cover it up.If you plan on using it for home use only I recommend getting a different tactile transducer like the Aurasound bass shaker which is only about 30 bucks and out performs this in the low sounds like explosions in movies.  Overall, Great for music when your out and about.
