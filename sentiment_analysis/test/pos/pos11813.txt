Bought this for our 5yo for his birthday and he loves it.  Just the right amount of challenge and entertainment.  I had high expectations for this product and I'm certainly not disappointed.  Osmo in general is great - but this is definitely my favorite, and my son's as well!  If you don't have Osmo at all, I recommend just going all in and getting all of them!
