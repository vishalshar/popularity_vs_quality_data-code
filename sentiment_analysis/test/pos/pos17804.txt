When I first opened the package I was surprised at the size of the bag.  It was smaller than I had expected.  Once I started to put stuff in the bag, I realized that it is not small at all.  Expands so all items fit well.  Perfect size bag with many pockets and very well made.  A little more expensive than other bags, but willl last a long, long time.  Highly recommend.  I ordered the black and love it!
