After I bought the starter kit, this and Thermo were the two first add-on cards I bought.  This is not the fastest car but I's a cool car to have.  It's got a great area blast which is easy for beginners and has good defense.  It's also one of the coolest looking in the bunch which i a nice side-effect.
