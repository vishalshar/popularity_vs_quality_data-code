Buying more for my daughter!  We love cheese and I like a variety but it was getting too expensive to have any spoil before it was eaten (dogs were getting more than we were sometimes)  Started using these and the dogs are the losers! We have had no moldy cheese in 5 months. Hard cheeses, softer cheddars, all have done well!  And we have reused them with similar cheeses.
