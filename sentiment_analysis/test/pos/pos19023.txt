The stock gimbal lock will not work with the PolarPro filters, so this is a must have if you frequently shoot with them.Pros-It is significantly easier to put on than the stock gimbal lock.  The ability to quickly remove and replace it is invaluable.  Every second you can cut out of setting up for a shot adds up!It fits with all PolarPro lens filters, and some other brands.Cons-Fits way too loose around camera with the stock filter threaded on.  It didn't have much room to move, but I don't like the gimbal bumping around the inside.  I almost always have a filter on so this is a non-issue for me, but if you frequently shoot without filters you may wish to stick with the DJI gimbal lock.The nature of the way this cover mounts is less secure than the stock gimbal lock.  I often find the gimbal rotated slightly from where I left it when I get the drone out of the case, but not enough to cause any concern.  The only reason I mention this is if you are carrying the case where it may be exposed to excessive force this gimbal lock may not remain on the drone.  I only have had it fall off once and that was when I was riding a trail on an ATV and the drone was in a backpack case.
