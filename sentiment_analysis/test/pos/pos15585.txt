I bought this for my accident-prone neighbor for hey birthday, and she loves it! Now she doesn't have to worry about spilling her morning coffee or afternoon tea onto her important papers or craft supplies.I've had one of these mugs for a couple of years, and it still works just as well as the day I bought it! One tip: make sure there are no crumbs or wet spots (or a layer of dust) on the surface you want to put the mug on; little obstructions like that can cause the bottom to not "seal" to the surface properly. Also, make sure there's no water under the rubber ring on the bottom after washing, as it can cause the same problem.
