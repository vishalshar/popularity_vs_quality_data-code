Got this but was a little hesitant as it's not as easy on/off as the sport bands. But, installation only took a minute or two and the fit is nice. Seems to protect everything but a direct strike to the glass, but the glass is recessed a few millimeters so I can't imagine a problem.Only thing I would change on the case would be having the bottom edges rounded. They are 90 degree corners where the are next to your skin. Not horrible, but not as comfortable as the watch itself against the wrist.
