The first unit they shipped was defective, which would normally make me give a low rating. However, the chat feature on their website was really helpful, and the phone support was top notch. I had a replacement in two days! I'm using it to run an aquarium pump I hacked to convert it to a vacuum pump for collecting groundwater at sites where I don't have easy power access. It runs the pump for hours, and I wasn't even close to draining the battery.
