I'd give this 4.5 if I could. It's definitely the best solution I've tried for the poop bag carrying problem. I love the pocket for a roll of bags. I love being able to clip this either to my leash handle or to my dog's harness. I love not having to use a free hand to carry a smelly bag. The only drawbacks are that the elastic closure isn't great at keeping the bag 100% closed, and the clip that comes with the bag is too small & poor quality. (I replaced it with an S-biner which works great.) I'm keeping this in mind as a gift for every new dog owner.
