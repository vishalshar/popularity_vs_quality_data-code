Before purchasing this item I had seen a relatively negative review regarding this item's sound quality and was almost scared off.  After all, this product carries a premium price--I wouldn't want any reasons to regret my purchase.  However after using the Skybuds I think that review completely misses the mark.I've been using my old Moto Hint for over a year now--waiting on a solid stereo replacement option to emerge.  Time and time again a new product would come out only to be met by consistent reviews citing the same problem over and over: bluetooth connection issues.  The Bragi Dash, Motorola Verve Ones, Samsung Gear Icon X and a dozen other no-name chinese alternatives have all come and gone with reviewers citing that same issue every time. Bluetooth connectivity is essential to the primary function of any bluetooth earbuds--so to say that this is something important is an understatement.  To date, I've seen only three products which consistently garner positive reviews for their connectivity: Skybuds, Bragi's new "The headphone", and the Apollo 7's.The Headphone is not currently shipping and has only been pre-reviewed.  When it does ship at $150, it's charging case will not have its own built in battery to charge your earbuds while they are in your pocket.  The Apollo 7's are $300.  Given that these are these are the only other options right now--I think it's fairly safe to say that this product category is still in its infancy.  Accordingly, for any product you choose in this category you will be an early adopter.  And, as such, you really should not expect things like "audiophile quality" regardless of the price.  You can't make a 1:1 comparison between $200 wireless earbuds and $200 wired earbuds.  It's just not a fair comparison.  So let me just say this about audio quality: No, it's not audiophile quality and it doesn't need to be.  It's above average and good enough for 99% of us.  It's all you can really expect from a product this price at this stage in the game, but I have no doubt that prices for these sorts of earbuds are going to go down rapidly over the next couple of years for those who would rather wait.Moving on, I have very few quibbles.  The ear-locking twist really does work, but it can get uncomfortable after a couple of hours.  The connectivity is pretty darn good.  It's not quite as good as my moto hint was (I tested by walking away from my phone and seeing how far I could get and by covering my pocket with my hand while streaming music from my pocket), but it works.  It works well enough to walk outside with your phone in your pocket and your Skybuds in your ears and not get any cut outs.  To me, at this point, that's the gold standard.  The fact that the volume and sound quality are much improved over a device like the moto hint is just a bonus.I will say that the provided software (which goes on your phone and is optional, but is the only way to know how charged your earbuds are) is finicky.  I find myself closing it and relaunching it to get an accurate reading on earbud charge percentage as it doesn't seem to want to update otherwise.  I also would have preferred to pair my left earbud to my phone and have it be the "primary"  since my phone is generally in my left pocket--but this doesn't seem to be an option.  I also notice that the right ear bud (as the primary) drains much faster.  If both could share this responsibility and trade-off, battery life could be significantly extended--but as is, I can use them for about 3 hours on a charge and they do charge rapidly while in the case.Overall, its not perfect, but its the first product I've seen that appears in every way to be good enough, and to me that makes it *almost* perfect.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, but if forced to round, I feel more comfortable with 5 than with 4.
