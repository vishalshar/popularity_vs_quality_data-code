Received the bag today I was surprised there was a set of motors guards in the box .not sure if it's a added bonus but happy to have them . Now on to the rest.the bag is very well constructed plenty of Velcro dividers to arrange the drone and battery's, controller for a secure ride.space for a small lab top or tablet and other pockets for cords ,wallet,phone,keys or other gear etc.
