I bought this fence after we spent a whole weekend and over $1000 putting in a chain link fence to keep my daughters cat safely in our yard when not so much as a week went by she was climbing the fence even after being declawed. So I ordered this fence and got it the next day, then I decided to return it unopened because after reading how you must train your cat I thought uggh this will never work. Then after I printed my return label I thought what the heck, if it zaps her as she comes close to the fence she will never go ahead and climb it, so the next day bright and early I ran the cable along the new chain link fence, hooked it all up and put on the collar, thats it. At first she acted like it weighed a ton and her head drooped to the ground, after about 15 minutes she was fine, and she is a small built cat, We went on out to the yard and within 15 minutes she approached the fence and what do you know, it must have zapped her ( on the level 2) because she jumped up in the air and ran to the deck. After this she made a few more trips to the fence but it gets her every time and she has not once gotten out. If this changes in the future I will do a new review but so far if you have an existing fence, this is a great and easy way to stop your cat from climbing it.
