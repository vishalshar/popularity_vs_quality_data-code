This is indeed a great little product to help keep your cosmetic brushes in good shape.  It is certainly necessary to use this when you wash your brushes.  I had a large kabuki brush that had spread out so wide that it didn't fit in my powder containers anymore.  After washing and drying it in the Brush Guard, it is now nice and compact again.  These are also great for traveling to protect your brush's shape.
