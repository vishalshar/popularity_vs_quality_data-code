I originally purchased these after seeing reviews stating the MK802 sounds very similar to the 1More triple driver. I was split between a these, a set from Polk Audio, and a set from Audio Technica. I was able to try the other two at Frys, and I know I could always return these in full with Amazon, so I gave these a shot. Now that I have them, I can confidently say they are keepers. I find myself wearing these even outside the gym, usually in situations where I'd prefer my wired IEMs.I know that BT doesn't come close to wired headphones within the same price range, but these really show how much bluetooth has improved. I've tried on the Beats Solo 2 and Skullcandy Hesh wireless and I couldn't stand the muddy bass. Those headphones were a bit louder on bass, but their bass wasn't defined and distract from the mids and highs. The MK802 on the other hand produces bass notes you can clearly differentiate. The MK802 sounds pretty similar to my wired Skullcandy Aviators (the only pair of Skullcandy headphones I haven't thrown or given away). I don't really have audiophile level headphones yet. My Sennheiser 598 and Ostry KC06a IEMs are all I have that come close to audiophile level. No contest with clarity and sound stage of the 598, I expected that,  but I'm not taking those to the gym. However, the MK802 does very well with instrument separation.The battery life is plenty for me. Not sure what today's standards are, but after 5 hours they would still be over 50 percent, which is all I really use before recharging. Haven't used these for calling yet.My only issues with these that weren't in my expectations is the initial clamping force and the bass vibration tickling my ears. I still have some stretching out to do, but wearing these becomes bothersome after about an hour, regardless of the plush earpads. The bass vibration is a bit distracting when I'm trying to lift. If I'm listening to trap and a beat drops, the chill I get is enough to make me drop the weight. So if you're ticklish but want bassy headphones, you may want to consider that.Im currently looking into buying larger aftermarket earpads to not only raise the comfort but have something that my ears actually fit into. I'll probably update on that soon.Update: I held off on the aftermarket earpads and tried stuffing the underside with a rolled up paper towel. SUCH AN IMPROVEMENT. It's ugly looking inside, sure, but my ears no longer touch the grill and they actually fit inside the cup because the stuffing raised the pads slack, resulting in a wider opening. Just a simple bolster raised the comfort tenfold. Hope 1More updates the earpads on their next model. I have some pleather fabric and foam lying around so I'll just replace the paper towel with that.
