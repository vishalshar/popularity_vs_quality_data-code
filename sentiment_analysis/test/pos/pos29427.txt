These work really nicely, and I love that I can just through them in the washing machine (on a delicate cycle) to get them clean.  The only two caveats I have are that these bags are not easy to seal - you really need to put some strength behind it to get them to close properly,  and they don't turn inside out easily (washing them outside right doesn't get them entirely clean all the time)
