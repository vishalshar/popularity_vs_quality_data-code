TrackR Bravo is an amazing product! It is worth every penny :)Bravo has already been a life saver for me - no more looking for my misplaced keys or my iPhone. I got the device in the mail and set it up within 5mins (downloaded the App on my iPhone and attached Bravo to my keys). It has already helped me locate my keys once, and my iPhone twice. If you are like me - you misplace your phone, wallet, and keys all the time. It is such a PAIN to look for my things when I am on my way out the door... and it happens to me every week.Bravo is so easy to use and the ringer function is a complete game changer. Being able to ring your phone (even while it is on silent) is AMAZING. On Thursday I couldn't find my iPhone... little did I know if had slipped between the cushions in the couch. I started my regular routine of looking in the usual places and then I remembered that I could ring my phone from the TrackR Bravo attached to my keys. I picked up my keys pressed the button on the device and I could hear my phone ringing in the living room. This thing works really well!You got to get several of these TrackR's they will save you time and money.
