I bought this product for its obvious advantage. The first cons I saw was that the case has no lip on the sides (unlike what is advertised), probably in order to keep it as thin as possible. The screen is hence totally unprotected. However, this is not the primary deterrent and I have added a screen protector to address this issue.The biggest problem in my view is the real battery capacity of the product. The ThinCharge Case is marketed as allowing at least one full charge of the iPhone (2,600mAh which is greater than the iPhone 6/6s's battery) but mine is barely recharging 30% to 40% of the phone. Also, the charger indicator drops to the minimum level very rapidly. The case still has its usefulness though but fells short on its promise. It is possible that I received a faulty case and that the product works well but I can only comment on what I have and tested.Finally, it is important to mention that I haven't contacted the seller about my charger's low capacity issue so I can't make any comment on the after sale responsiveness of the company.This is my second review of the ThinCharge Case: After communicating with the after sale team, it appears that the case I bought was indeed faulty. I am now using a new case and I can objectively say that the case is up to its promise. Obviously, the team has listened to the complaints of the users and the new case has now a more pronounced lip that protects the screen that is no longer exposed when you place the iPhone face down. The other good thing is that the charger is working efficiently. It charges the phone slowly (probably a good thing while using it) and gives the user enough juice to finish the day without worrying about going out of battery. To give a better idea of the extended battery life of the iPhone, I started using the phone at 7am. At 12pm, it had 35% of battery remaining. I started charging it using the ThinCase while extensively using it. It was 100% full by 4pm. At midnight, I still had more that 60% of available battery. This is exactly the reason why I bought the case, and I am very satisfie using it.One thing the team has to think about is to have the software upgrade/update using the Mac OSX operating system instead of Windows or even have an App to manage it. But as no other charger I know of has even this option, i don't find it very important.In conclusion: Great product that every iPhone 6/6s user should have.
