Excellent product. I am very pleased with the performance. The adjustable focus enables much better images. The associated app appears to need some work as it hangs occasionally, or gets in a mode where it can't return to imaging and needs to be terminated and restarted, but I expect seek will come up with an update soon. Overall I recommend the seek imager.
