The camera works great and, for the most part, has good quality. Unfortunately, our cat became scared of it pretty quickly since on the first use it SHOT a BLAST of treats at her. There were treats all over the floor, and even though she liked them, they weren't worth going near the camera. Bummer. Still, it was great being able to check in throughout our trip and see our kitty hanging out. I wish it had a 2 way speaker, so hopefully that'll be a future improvement. Also, it's really large, much bigger than I expected. No matter, it's still great and works very well.
