I have had no issues with this product.  I does everything it says it will do.  I seldom give a five star rating for anything.  But I can to this.  A co worker has a $99 fitness band.  One of the well known ones.  And it is nice looking although it has no display, it is all on the phone app.  Sorry, but I like this $15 one better.According to the website, there are further improvements coming for the app.  And I would anticipate better models of the band in the future. I would like to see heart rate tracking at an affordable price.
