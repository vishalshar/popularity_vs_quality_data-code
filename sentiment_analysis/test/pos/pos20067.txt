I absolutely love this device. Not only does it make it much easier to control my drip system, but it gets weather updates and modifies the watering schedule automatically. It also modifies the watering schedule automatically based on seasonal weather patterns. Really loving the intuitive interface and the fact that it is already saving me money in water (and, of course, reducing my water utilization).
