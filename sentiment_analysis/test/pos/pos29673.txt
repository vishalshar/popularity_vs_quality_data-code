I absolutely love this bag. It clips onto the leash and holds the bag of poo so you don't have to. Very simple, very attractive, very useful. I bought a ton of products for our new dog and this is easily my favorite. It's also why I love crowdfunding - products you wouldn't usually see from big companies, but a product that serves a distinct and welcome purpose.
