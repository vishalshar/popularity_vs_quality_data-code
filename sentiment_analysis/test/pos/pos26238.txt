All three of my Chihuahuas love this fishy-flavor food, despite it being called chicken-flavored.  I have two senior rescues who've had to have teeth pulled, and the kibble is tiny enough for them to eat without difficulty or discomfort.  My 1-year old likes it too!  The price is right and the food appears to be favorable to their digestive systems.  I have had my pups on this food for a couple of months and intend to keep them on it, pending any issues at their future vet visits.  Would recommend.
