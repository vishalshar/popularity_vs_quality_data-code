This kit was such a great purchase.  I used to rub the brush head with brush shampoo on the palm of my hand to create a lather which made my hands very dry and the lather was not that great.  The brushes that I used with cream or liquid make up had to be washed two or three times with this method.  With this kit, the textured washing cup made a great lather that really broke up the make up and even the got rid of the cream and liquid make up in one wash!The drying cup is nice, but to me it is just a cup with holes which is always good to me :)  The blotting cloth is very soft and absorbent.  The brush guards are awesome.  I love the shape that it gives my brush after it dries and it is a great tool to dry my brushes upside down.  I can't comment on the brush shampoo because I didn't use it.  I wanted to finish using my Sephora brush shampoo first. This kit is awesome.  I would recommend it to anybody that likes to wash their make up brushes regularly without over drying their hands.
