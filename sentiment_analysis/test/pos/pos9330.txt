I'm not gluten-free. In fact, I eat a TON of pasta. Real pasta. Pasta made from flour that was made from grains. And yet, something about this stuff intrigued me enough that I was willing to pay $5/box (that's $10/pound as another reviewer has pointed out, and $9 more a pound than the organic penne you can buy at Trader Joes) to give it a go. And you know what? It's freaking delicious. The texture is pretty spot-on for noodles and not grainy at all (though do yourself a favor and cook them al denteÂ—they turn to mush soon thereafter. Also, for the love of cooking pasta, please, please salt your water.). They don't have a strong chickpea taste, either. And, while it takes a sizable portion of white flour pasta to fill me up, I think the high protein content of these guys made me feel full faster. Will I purchase again? Probably not as often as I stock up on the aforementioned TJ's stuff, but the next time I decide to drop $30 on a case of noodles, this will be the case I buy.
