Hi,Being completely new to personal 3D printing, I thought I would share my thoughts on the Robo3D R1 +PLUS printer.First off, I am COMPLETELY NEW to all of this and havent even really seen other 3D prints or printers aside from the expensive prototyping printers used at places I have worked.  I have never used a 3D printer before!I have spent 30 years working for big-name defense contractors but was laid off over a year ago and have been looking for work. I decided I needed something to keep my mind busy and happened to come across some pages for 3D printing prosthetics for kids.  Seemed like just the thing!  So, after many weeks of research, and limited funds, I settled on the ROBO3D R1 +PLUS.  I wont go into my reasoning as everyone seems to have their own.I ordered the fully assembled kit from Amazon plus some additional PLA and ABS filaments.  They arrived in excellent time and condition.Unboxing and setup:Pretty straight forward and simple.  I took everything out of the box, set the printer up, put the included SD card into the computer and watched the quick setup guide.  I then downloaded the latest matter control and installed it.  Connected the printer to my laptop via usb and established communicationsall good.  Fumbled around a little installing the included PLA filamentwasnt sure what to expect or really how to do ita little you tube searching and ready to go!!!First Print:At first I was a little confused using the MatterControl software but quickly found the library and included models to print.  I selected the calibration ring and said print.  Off it went and printed the ring!!!  That simple, that quick!  Basically, right out of the box!!!  Total time to this point was about 20 minutes!!  Of course, the print didnt stick and was screwed upbut then I found out what the included glue stick was for!!!  Need to put glue on the print bed for the initial print layer to stick!!! Cleaned the bed, put down glue, restarted, and done!!!First Month review:So, Ive had the printer for about a month now and have printed 30 or so items using PLA, WOOD PLA, ABS, and Aluminum.  Currently playing with PETG and T-GLASE filaments.There has been a HUGE learning curve but I can say that the printer has done EVERYTHING I have asked it to do.  The only problem is that, initially, I didnt always ask it to do the right things!  Many trials - and errors - with printing ABS, PETG, and Aluminum However, the printer prints what the slicer software tells it to printand I am supposed to know what to tell the slicer software to tell the computer!The PRINTER works FLAWLESSLY, the chair/keyboard interface (me) is learning what to tell the slicer software (MatterControl) to tell the printer what to dothings like:Extruder Temperature,Bed Temperature,Print Speed,1st layer height, and many others!The initial settings in MatterControl allow you to print PLA filament right out of the box (with the glue stick), but beyond that, you will have to learn the best slicer setting for your printer and environment.  For example, I had to add configurations to MatterControl for PETG and am still trying to get the right parameters for a good print.  The good news, Robo3D has a GREAT community forum to help you get up to speed quickly and there are many other 3d forums where the 3d community will help you get you printing your model with the material you want the way you want it!I love this little printer!p.s. After a couple of weeks tying my laptop to the printer I decided to take my raspberry pi and set it up with the octopi software.  Now, my raspberry pi is connected to the printer and I can control the printer and print over the network - freeing up my laptop.  Plus, I had a Pi Camera so I can remotely VIEW the print in progress!!
