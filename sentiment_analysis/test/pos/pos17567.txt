I have had my Leaf for about a month now and I never want to leave the house without it. It is a beautiful, small, attractive piece of jewelry that is so much nicer than a bulky FitBit. Whenever people ask me about it and what it does, my favorite way to explain it to them is to tell them it's the "hippie version of the FitBi"!The compatibility with the App is smooth, is visually easy to understand, and it has all the same features as the FitBit, plus some! Along with menstrual cycle tracking for women and breathing exercises to help you through all different moments in life, the Leaf is a smart little device perfect for becoming more conscious about how active you are in everyday life.I give the Leaf 5 stars and would highly recommend it (even above the ever popular FitBit).I hope that as the Leaf develops, they will be able to add heart rate tracking as well. I'm excited to see where this company will go in the next fees years. Come join the Bellabeat team and grow with us all!
