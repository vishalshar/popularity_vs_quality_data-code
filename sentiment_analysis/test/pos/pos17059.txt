This was by far the best bike phone mount I have ever owned. Snapping my phone on to the mount was so quick and easy. Once mounted on, I was confident that my phone would not fall off. I even got into an accident once where I fell of my bike but my phone stayed locked in place. I'm sure that with other phone mounts, my phone would have shattered. The case is nice and slim too, sure it has that hole in the back but the case does feel sturdy enough to protect my phone from a drop. One thing I forgot to mention was that I used this during the summer as I was working as a bike messenger and was exactly what I needed.
