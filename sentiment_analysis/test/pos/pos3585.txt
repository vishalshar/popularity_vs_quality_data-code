EcoQube C is an excellent entry-level aquarium. I was a backer in the Ecoqube C Kickstarter campaign last year and learned almost everything I needed to know about set-up, maintenance, and trouble-shooting by watching professionally-made videos and absorbing excellent information in the FAQ section and campaign updates in the months before I received it - these guys left nothing to chance! I followed the set-up instructions to the letter, and Evan from customer support has patiently and comprehensively answered every single question and concern I had since. I've stocked my EcoQube with 3 white cloud minnows, 2 small zebra danios, 4 nerite snails (THEY KEEP MAKING BABIES!!!), and 2 amano shrimp. I also added 4 different types of fresh water plants and they've grown fast and healthy with no additional chemicals. Over the past 4 months the basil plant that sprouted from the supplied seeds has already reached the fully-extended LED bracket and is now due for a trim. The plants, snails, shrimp, and UV-sterilizer accessory have kept the water crystal clear from day one without a single water change, and all the fish are energetic and healthy. My EcoQube C is set up in my office, away from direct sunlight, and I can leave it and the livestock alone for the weekend without worrying - I've never had any issues. I definitely plan on purchasing another complete set-up for my 6-year old daughter over the next year so she can learn from and enjoy the experience.
