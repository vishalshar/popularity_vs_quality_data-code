This worked great on the first side, but we struggled keeping the second side wet enough to start the mushrooms. it looked to be properly seeded, I think it may have been user error. But the first side was covered in mushrooms, I placed it in my kitchen window which gets very indirect light all day. it was a neat, fun experiment that we very promptly ate, they tasted great! I would probably try it again for a lower price.
