Bought this for my dad for Christmas and he likes it a lot. He says it can be tough to remember to tap after every hole, so not all of his shots in a round will be accurately tracked, but he still gets a large enough sample size from each club over the span of a couple rounds to start honing down on the distances he actually hits his clubs and get a better idea of what clubs he hits best, as well as how he plays certain holes on the course he has a membership at. I think it is a very cool product that is easy to set up and requires minimal maintenance.
