I've only had these lights for a couple of days but I am already SOLD!  So much so that I am going to return the Wemo/ Osram bundle kit that just arrived today.  There is NOTHING else on the market that can do what Stack Lighting does in one sleek, cohesive package.  W/ the return $$ from the Wemo/Osram setup, I plan on ordering additional Stack BR30's.The shear motion sensing autonomy of these stand alone bulbs is what initially piqued my interests.  Every other manufacturer's bulb requires an additional motion sensor plug, for an additional price; & an additional outlet requirement.Also, the ambient light sensor & circadian rhythm algorithm are pretty boss!I cannot wait for the Stack Classics to hit the market in September!!
