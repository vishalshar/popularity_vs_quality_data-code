I am a truck driver and I needed a solution to packing and unpacking my laptop a few times a day. I decided to give the Mobotron Car Truck iPad Laptop Mount Stand Holder a shot. I've been using this product for 3-4weeks now and have not had any problems. The assembly was straightforward and pretty simple. The overall quality of the materials/construction of the product is good and solid.I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a secure and sturdy place to hold their laptops in vehicles.
