I purchased this item for when I rent a car I can use my iPhone 5 as a GPS.  Installing the mount on the windshield was easy and it held my phone with it's Otterbox Defender case on it no problem in either a horizontal or vertical position.  The phone did not fall out of the holder and the holder held fast.  The open end is great for connecting the lightning cable to a power source in the car.When I returned the rental car, getting the mount off the windshield was very challenging.  Even the rental car employee asked if I glued it on as they never saw a suction that strong.So to summarize, this is a great item in a vehicle where it is primarily going to be used.  If you plan to move it a lot from place to place, it may not be ideal.
