My spouse and my 3-year old daughter take vitamins on a daily basis; even our 1-year old dog takes his vitamins every day.  While I believe in the benefits of vitamins in people and other creatures lives, as an adult I have been unable to take vitamins on a consistent basis due to my aversion to pillsThis is with the exception of prenatal vitamins during my pregnancy, which amazingly I was able to take without any issues while pregnant.Now thanks to SmartyPants I am able to take vitamins, and incredibly to also look forward to taking them every day. I would highly recommend SmartyPants to anyone who does not have an aversion to sweets, to those who in addition to vitamins see the benefit in taking omega (all in one), and particularly to people who have difficulty with bad taste and/or pills. AND these vitamins are not only smart and delicious, but also ethical. Very exciting product. Great job!
