Simple setup. App seems to be functional so far and all of my tests of the alarm have been successful. Of course, it really only matters if it works in an emergency, but everything points to this being a solid product. No connectivity issues so far.The one feature I would like to see is the ability to send alarm alerts via text message. At the moment, you need to install and sign up for the app to receive notifications as a family or friend. For one, my parents do not use apps and I would like them to be notified when our alarm is sounded. Two, some apps in the past have been unreliable with push notifications. While the app has been fine so far, you really have to keep your fingers crossed that it will go through in an emergency. If you could also receive a text message on top of the push notification, that's just added security that the alert will be received. It shouldn't be terribly difficult to add since the app already has our phone numbers. It's a feature that I really hope to see added.I will absolutely update this review with future updates. So far, I'm happy that this product exists. Much cheaper than a dedicated smart alarm and much simpler installation!
