This product works quite effectively.  Keep in mind that it's not black magic -- it's just a very effective way of delivering the standard herbal sleep remedies.  What I've found with Dream Water, however, is that it really kicks you down a notch in your REM sleep.  My dreams are akin to watching a movie, and I daresay this stuff puts me on the edge of lucid dreaming (calling the shots as I'm dreaming).  Bear in mind, I've had similar effects using Onnit's "New Mood," which has a similar chemical composition and works on the same principle.  The only (slight) drawback to this product is that it's really not a "knockout."  It works similar to melatonin -- if you're amped up or stressed out, it won't put you down the way a traditional sleeping pill will.  If you're looking for something to really level out your sleep, however, this is the ticket.  It doesn't taste too bad either.
