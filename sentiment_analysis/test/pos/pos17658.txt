I have a Dodge Ram 1500 and the brake dust on the front two rims is insane! After I just purchased new chrome rims last year, I needed something to keep that gunk off my shiny new wheels. This wand helped do the trick. I started with Meguiar's Chrome cleaner, let it sit for :30 sec. and hit it with the brush. What I could't get off with scrubbing came right off with that combo.While it has a quick connect feature, I didn't bother to learn how it works yet. I just screwed the want directly into the hose. It has an on/off switch, so I flipped it on and went to work. It is water powered and actually has a little rotating power considering it is just water. It also shoots out four small streams of water at the same time and that helps wash the residue away.Bottom line: My cynical old neighbor walked over, took a look, and said the rims looked like new again. That's what I wanted.
