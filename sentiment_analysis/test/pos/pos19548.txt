Great customer support. I had some technical difficulties with a re-install. Customer rep emailed me back within minutes. After a few minutes, the rep offered to help remotely.  This was done and we were able to correctly install TarDisk. Great personal care - Wellington Sartori made me feel good about what I could do--he did not look down on my technical ability! Thanks again---I wish all my interactions with help desks were this good.
