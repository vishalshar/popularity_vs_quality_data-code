I use on half gallon glass jars of raw goat milk. No leaking. Do not put them on too tight or they are hard to get off. Open the cap before trying to remove the lid from jar and it's much easier. These are expensive but worth it!  Get different colors to color code them like I do. Silver means drink this one first red means goat stuck her foot in the bucket so this one goes to the dogs etc
