My husky is very a picky eater. I put this powder in her food bowl, pour her dry food over it, add a little water and swirl it around, and she likes it! I started adding this to her diet after she developed 2 papillomas within a very short time and the vet said her immune system 'needed to mature.'  So far so good; no recurrence, and no new problems either. She actually asks for her dinner now!
