The unit worked as advertised. Easy-to-use, excellent Wi-Fi reception, and easy  to connect the zones. I purchased the rain sensor and temperature sensor and they work very good with the unit. Having the option to have the system to detect the local weather is great to control the water irrigation. Accessing the unit via the web browser is very easy and intuitive. The main box can be painted so is easy to integrate in the event of the box been visible.  I bought the unit with the LCD but I'm using for the most is the iPad or iPhone. Looking at the web browser in the iPhone is kind of difficult. It will be good if you can have a mobile browser option or APP. Also a good idea would be to have e-mail notifications  to inform of operation of the sprinkler or when a particular threshold has been reached.Excellent product.
