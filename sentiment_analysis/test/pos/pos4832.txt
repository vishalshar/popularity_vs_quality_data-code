I became an avid canner several years ago and often had unused portions to store in the fridge after I opened a jar of tomato/spaghetti sauce, ketchup, salsa, applesauce, or canned pears and that yummy juice!  reCAP is awesome because it doesn't rust and is easier to identify by color in a full fridge of jarred items.  Traditional canning lids and rings can also get stuck and be hard to open during storage and I haven't had any issues with my reCAP sticking.  reCAP would be helpful for someone who had arthritis or trouble opening jars, all they have to do is flip the top.
