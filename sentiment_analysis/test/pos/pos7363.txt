I bought this to hook up to a TV we have in the kitchen. It's small enough to velcro to the back of the TV and you would never know it's there. We use it primarily to look up recipes, play cooking videos, listen to music and occasionally watch Netflix/Hulu/Youtube. It performs well on all fronts. I have a wireless mouse and keyboard hooked up to it using the Logitech Unifying receiver. The mouse and keyboard work with no problems.The remix OS is pretty nifty. It allows you to multitask with ease. It's intuitive regardless of what operating system you are coming from. I'm docking a star because it does get sluggish at times, especially with multiple windows/apps open. Web pages load a little slower than what you are used to on a desktop PC. It's honestly not a hindrance for me, but it's worth noting. I also found it sometimes disconnects from the wifi and you have to re-enter the password, but this only occurs after you have shutdown and re-start it. An insignificant annoyance, but again worth noting.  It has the performance of a decent Android tablet but the output is your TV and you get some neat desktop features.I'm happy with it. We previously had a Gen 1 Intel Compute Stick running windows 8 on the TV. This performs better for our needs. I would buy it again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it if you have similar needs.
