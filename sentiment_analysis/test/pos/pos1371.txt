Wow, I have a relatively very good skin at 42. There wasn't much gunk after I'm done. Nonetheless, my skin was baby smooth. I'm very impressed! Next, I tried it on my not so baby smooth feet. Oh my goodness! Gunk on that little black round thing that collects 'em. Took a few years off my feet.I'm very HAPPY with my purchase. Never tried demabrasion micro or large ever, this is my first. I can feel all the lotion I applied on my face penetrating more than it did before.Thank you!
