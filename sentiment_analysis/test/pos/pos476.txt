do not have an automatic cleaning box, but bought this to use in a standard box. This is by far the best crystal litter that I've tried. it took both bags to fill mr fatty's box, but in over a month there is still NO urine/ammonia smell in the box, nor is there any type of of "slush" in the bottom that I've experienced with other crystal litters. Bit pricy, but for how it's outlasting any of the other types I've tried that state they should last 2 months & I end up having to change within 3 weeks, I'll say it's worth the price due to less changes.
