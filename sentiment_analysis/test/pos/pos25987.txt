I love that it runs on propane and CARB approved.  Zippy and well built.  Very light weight and can carry easily.  It's just as loud as a gas engine and there's not much power.  at least not at the low end once it gets moving it's pretty fun but the engines going to take a lot of tweaking seems to be very sensitive and often idles roughly .  Less powet than I'd expect out of a similar sized electric scooter. I would recommend this product but just don't have any high hopes for crazy amounts of power.  High points on the coolness factor, easy transportation, low-cost fuel and  well built.
