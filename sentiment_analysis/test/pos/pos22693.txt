I was impressed with this lifter.  If you shop around there is really nothing else on the market like it.  Other lifting setups either require huge motors, are big and bulky, or are manual and look like a pain to use.  I rigged this up with a second lifter to lift one of the mylifter 3X3 platforms.  I was impressed at how much was included in the box.  I half expected to need to go buy hardware to install everything, but was thrilled I didn't have to.  Install was a little involved, but well explained in the instructions.  I was being very careful to make sure I was mounting it to studs in the ceiling, that it was right where I wanted it etc.  Once you have installed one, the others will be really quick.  I accidentally dropped one of the lifters on to the hard cement floor in my garage from probably 4 feet up.  I thought for sure I had damaged the unit as it took a pretty good hit.  I was pleased to pick it up and see nothing seemed to be damaged!I know this is a review for the lifter, but I need to mention that the lifting platforms are very very sturdy.  They were a little heavy, but I don't hesitate to lift the 200 lbs with it.  I thought about building my own.  I'm glad I didn't.As far as the app goes, I honestly didn't even read any instructions on how to pair it and set them up.  I just pushed the button on the lifter after installing the app and it showed up.  Easy.If you have stuff kicking around your garage that I would highly recommend this.  I love that i'm utilizing space that was just wasted before. On top of everything else its just cool and high tech.  Feels like the future.
