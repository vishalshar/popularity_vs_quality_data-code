I have flown remote controlled aircraft for a few years now but I had never flown a quadcopter.  I was looking at the dji 4 but it really didn't look like they put the quality build in it.I am amazed in the quality of the x star premium.  The case is great quality.  I took a chance with this drone and its so much better than expected.DON'T BELIEVE THE POOR REVIEWS THIS DRONE IS AWESOME!Tip: get at least one more battery
