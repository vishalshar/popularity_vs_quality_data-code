I have only used this a few times since purchasing it. For one of the bags I used it on, a 40 lb. bag of salt, I think the longer model would work better and I may purchase one. The downside for me is that I would have preferred a padded carrying handle. The hard plastic is not all that comfortable carrying 40 lbs. I probably will make my own padded handle for it.
