The headphones are pretty great. I go skiing by myself a lot and music is a necessity.  Since they're not earbuds, assuming you're not a jackass and keep the volume at a reasonable level you can still here your surroundings for safety.  They sync with my phone easily and the controls work great.The only negative is that they cut out pretty severely at exactly the temperature range listed (I can't verify this, but I believe windchill also contributes).  Fair enough, thanks for shooting us straight Outdoor Tech, but unfortunately some of your skiing may very well be in that low range, at least out here in the Rockies.  I still prefer them 100% to my regular headphones.
