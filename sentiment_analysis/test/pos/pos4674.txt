The stuff is amazing.Pros: Goes to work instantly and puts me to sleep within 10-15 min usually.  Love the powder.  YES, you can take it without water.  Tastes like candy.  In my opinion the effects seem to start quicker without water.Cons: Kind of a sluggishness feeling the entire next day, despite the statements on the box.I've tried this and the liquid version (Snoozeberry) and prefer this one for convenience sake.
