OMGI was able to fix Apple Mac and Air cords that would cost me 80.00 to purchase and I know as I had to buy one but fortunately kept the very frayed on hoping I would eventually come up with a way to fix it. I did and this was the product. I came across it on UTUBE (I think or an add pop up)when I was looking to see how to repair an Apple cord (they had other ads on very complicated ways to repair the cord yet this was a quick clay like fix that require zippo tech skills) and found out Apple has quite a reputation for their rather fragile cords. So I ordered it and now have not only fixed my cord but fixed on at the office and now am using it proactively on my new Apple air to prevent such breakage by putting it on the cord on both ends where they attach to give them a very strong/sturdy support so they will never bend and it makes it easier to put into the computer actually. It keeps well in the frig and is ready to use as soon as i need it. A little goes a long way.
