This arrived ahead of scheduled delivery date.  The shipping container was in excellent condition.  I have used the Paint Bucket and it makings working on a ladder very safe and you always have paint available without having a bucket of paint in one hand, a brush in the other while hugging a ladder.  The brush is held out of the paint in a readily available position.  One can use a gallon freezer storage ZipLoc as  a liner in and rapped around the red paint bucket and NO cleanup required.  After several usages my bucket is spotless and clean as new.Â Big Boy Ind 5210 Buddy System Paint Bucket Holder with Dripless Paint BucketBig Boy Ind 5210 Buddy System Paint Bucket Holder with Dripless Paint Bucket
