I have bought a couple of sets of these laces and really like them.  The only downside is that they can unfasten themselves occasionally and, after major back surgery, it's awkward for me to bend over to refasten them.  I've experimented with a couple of different types of elastic laces and, so far, these are the best ones I've tried.
