It is a better deal than the more expensive version mainly because of the new design that prevents gas from escaping and makes it easier to change gas cartridge.  I have got more than 15 glasses from the first argon gas cartridge.  I hope it stays this way.  I am an early adopter of Coravin and bought its first model.  The most serious design flaw of the first model is the loading mechanism for replacing spent cartridge.  If you do not tighten enough, gas escapes.  If you tighten too much, it's very hard to unscrew.  Worst of all, it appears that the air lock wears out after about three years of (infrequent) use.  Since the fancier model costs more than $300, it annualized cost is $100.  If I assume that the air lock wears out again in three years, then I "save" $100.  But this is a problem Coravin should address seriously.  This is a good system, but it is also a very expensive system for most wine-lovers.  Coravin will do well by giving them their money's worth.
