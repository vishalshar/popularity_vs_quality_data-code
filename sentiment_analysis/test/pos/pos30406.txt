The turtle shell has a great sound.  It's great for when I instruct water cardio classes.  I am just having some difficulty with the volume switches on the side as they don't seem to work.  I always have to stop and adjust the volume on my Ipod. Maybe I am doing something wrong.  Other thenthe volume switches, this is a great little speaker.
