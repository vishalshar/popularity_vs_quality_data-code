I have started using Sugru Moldable Glue for all sorts of projects.  I first got it to attach an ornament onto my mailbox so people could find my house among my subdivision look-a likes.  Worked great!  It is easy to work with, is very forgiving, and holds any two objects firmly together.  It's a little pricy, but you don't need a lot for most things and it really holds.  You can also fashion useful custom fixes out of it, too...cord restraints, notched stands for small items, etc.  If you change your mind later you can always remove it with an Xacto knife.  Quite a handy find!
