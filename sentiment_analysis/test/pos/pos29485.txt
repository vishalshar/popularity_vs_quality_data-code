While I know that this product is mostly for football gloves, it also works wonders on soccer gloves. My son is a goalie and if the ball even touches his hands, he can stop it with this stuff on. We forgot the bottle at home once and my son made us turn around and go back to get it. It's given him the confidence to try and stop any ball that is kicked at his goal too. It doesn't take much at all so the bottle should last us a good while. But when it runs out, I'll just use my Prime and get it in 2 days anyways! Great stuff.
