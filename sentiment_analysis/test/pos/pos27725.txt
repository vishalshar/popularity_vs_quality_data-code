I love these! I have only had it for a couple of weeks, but the cheese I have in the paper is still fresh, so: so far, so good. I actually cut these sheets in half because I buy a lot of smaller cheeses.This is a paper lined with a thin plastic (seems thinner than cling film, but also a different texture). The stickers that come with the paper don't peel up and re-stick very well, though. That's my only complaint. I'll deal with it. :) This stuff is great, so I'll keep buying it.
