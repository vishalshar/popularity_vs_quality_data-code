I love this device.  It helps me improving on my personal goals and an effective coach. My only regret is that this does not sync my sleep into Apple Health and does not give real time feedback on heart rate monitor which i have to manually monitor. Also it would be better if it can sync with Myfitnesspal directly.  Despite this i am giving 5 stars as this has helped  me to improve on my speed and time while workout.
