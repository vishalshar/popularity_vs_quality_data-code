I had never heard of cheese paper, but I bought it because Cook's Country recommended it.  I have had a block wrapped in it for several weeks.  Another block of cheese came in a zip lock, so I left it that way.  This was not an experiment, but it might as well have been.  The cheese wrapped in the cheese paper is still OK, but the other one developed mold. The paper comes in pre-cut sheets and stickers are supplied to seal the package. These made it easy to use.
