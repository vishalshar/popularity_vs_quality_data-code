This is my first coffee press. I researched quite a bit before making a purchase and am really happy that I chose the Espro P5. The 18 oz. size is great for a couple of cups that will be poured right away. I have tried brewing with and without the paper filters and both methods produce great results. I did go to their site and order some extra filter papers and also the tea filter (which is NOT included with the press). Some components are replaceable by the way, the glass and filters can be purchased separately if damaged, so you won't need to purchase a whole new press if something bad happens. The press is easy to disassemble for cleaning and seems to be very sturdy and well made so far. The coffee only stays hot for a short while in this model. The stainless model should keep the temperature much longer than this glass model. I plan to buy the 32 oz. stainless model soon so that I can make larger batches of coffee when necessary.
