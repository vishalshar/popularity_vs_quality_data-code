Flew it about 12 time's flew great then the last flight  it went crazy and crash.called Autel and told them what happen they said send it back to them and they will take care of me.they told me once they receive it the turnaround would be two or three days!!! Well they had it for over a week now so I called to see the status of the drone they told me they haven't look at it yet and the turnaround time would now be two or three weeks ,wow!!! Iam not happy about this I told them I need it back for some fall color video.were it peak color now guess I'll miss the shots.will up date. Here's my up date after I wrote the review Autel called me and apologized for the mix-up on the time frame for fixing it. Rich the technical support leader of Autel said that he sent a new x star package out to me next day delivery in witch I received it the next day. I was blown away that he would call me personally about this matter and how fast he fixed the mix-up!!! Now i know that Autel does care about us and want's us to be a part of there family thanks Rich and Autel.
