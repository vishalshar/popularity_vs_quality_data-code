I love this thing. Works great and customer service is amazing. Had to replace an old one that the dog ended up breaking the piece that holds it in and lost the gps itself. But had it for about a year and a half before that happened. For how the dogs play that is pretty amazing. I also have one for the cat. It is kind of big for him but not terribly.
