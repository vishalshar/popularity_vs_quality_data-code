Grip Boost makes my gloves stickier than a third grader's hands after an art project.All I used was one quick squirt on the palm of my hand and rubbed it in over everypart of my gloves. After about 20 seconds it dried and my gloves became much more stickier!Quick tip: clean the surface dirt off your gloves before hand before applying the gel for max stickiness.
