I purchased this on a lark to support a new company.  I didn't think I was going to like this face wash because of the texture of the cream and the weird chemically smell.  Sometimes the absence of fragrance makes things smell weird to me.  That being said, I'm not longer using my Lancome face washes.  This cleans really well with no traces of make-up left and without drying my skin.
