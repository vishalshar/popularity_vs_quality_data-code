works very well. i contacted support because i'm a bigger guy and need a bigger cuff and they expedited out one for me within a few days. the unit and software worked really well and i did the whole setup using my small wifi android tablet which then had me taking measurements and uploading them to my records within minutes ... so it does what it says it does!
