I am in sales and often in and out of my vehicle. This case allows me to pull my phone out and throw it up to the magnet mounted on the dash. It's so strong that it pulls the phone in without much effort!I highly recommend to anyone.Oh - and the case itself is light enough yet designed well to protect about as well as an Otterbox Commuter case.
