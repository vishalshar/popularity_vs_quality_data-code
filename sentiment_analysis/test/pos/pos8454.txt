This laptop is awesome. It's cool looking (after you remove all the stickers), light and does everything I need it to do. The only qualm  I have with it is windows ten which forces you to connect to the internet when you log in greatly increasing the log in time This computer games very well and runs Skyrim at a solid 60 fps on very high settings with some mods running and without heating up too much. The mousepad is a little iffy so an external mouse is very nice to use with this computer.
