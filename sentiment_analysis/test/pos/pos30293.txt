We love our Omiebox! It's been working perfectly for my 5 year old. The compartments are great and the thermos bowl has worked well, too. As long as you preheat it with hot water for at least 10 mins, it keeps the food warm enough until lunch time (not piping hot but warm enough). No complaints from my son! We even had an issue with a part on the thermos bowl and Omielife sent us a replacement immediately. Two thumbs up!
