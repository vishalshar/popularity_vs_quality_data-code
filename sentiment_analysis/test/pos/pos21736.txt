My iPhone works out really well as a Nav system so I wanted a mount so I see it on the dashboard. This fits my phone well even in my thick Otterbox Defender case for my iPhone 5 and would fit many other smartphones too. I have full access to have my phone charging and even outputting the audio to my tape-cassette adapter for listening to MP3s. Also it is easy to tilt or rotate and looks nice too. For my previous Nav system I had one of those bean bag mounts and was never happy how it sometimes slid off the dashboard with a sudden stop. This suction cup is superior and holds the device very firmly on my dashboard when driving, so it is safer.
