Received this five days before I expected it!  Great!!  I wanted a charging/syncing station for both my iPhone and my iPad, both of which have lightening connectors.  The EverDock Duo fits the bill perfectly.  It took only a couple minutes to slide in the adaptors and the lightening cables and lock them in place.  My iPhone connected with no issues whatsoever and, with the case I have for it, I don't need any spacers.  I do have to take my iPad out of its Snugg case, which won't fit at all.  That's ok - I only need to charge my iPad once a week so removing it from the case also prompts me to clean the screen the same time I'm plugging it into the charger.  And, for the iPad, I do use the thinner of the two spacers.  A solidly built unit that sits nicely on my desk.  I didn't remove the extra backing on the base, the suction is quite adequate with it on.  The unit stays in place for putting the device on and taking either device off.  Good work Fuz Designs - great duo dock!
