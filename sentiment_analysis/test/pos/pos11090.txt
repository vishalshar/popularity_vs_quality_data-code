This is perfect for seniors!  My grandmother is extremely technologically challenged.  She can't Skype.  She barely understands the phone.  However now all of her children have the ability to see her face to face all over the country.  If she doesn't answer the phone, I can video call her to make sure she is ok.  I call and the camera comes on without her having to do anything.  This is absolutely ideal for seniors.  Additionally the staff is extremely attentive and works hard to answer questions personally and efficiently.
