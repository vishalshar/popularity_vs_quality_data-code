I usually don't write these things, but then I thought.. why not.  I just got this thing in the mail today and for the past 30 min I've been using it I can say that the shape is almost perfect for all kind of grips.  It is a relatively short mouse so depending on how long your hands are it may be more or less difficult to palm/claw, but it's gonna be hard to find a mouse more contoured to a right hand than this one.  For the fingertip gamers, it's basically the perfect weight.Build quality is excellent as are all mionix products.  Rubber coating is fantastic.  It grips better as your hands perspire more.  The clicks are crisper than they were in the avior's and the middle button not so hard to press down.  Side buttons feel good as well.  Personally I'd rather not have the textured rubber part for the thumb as it feels more slippery than grippy, but that seems to be the thing to do now for some reason.  More of a thing to appeal to the masses I guess.The cable housing is braided, but done so excellently.  Unlike some mice (coughsenseicough), the braiding isn't made out of dicks.  It is very flexible and isn't a nuisance.  The braids are finer and look like they will pass the test of time in terms of fraying as well.Honestly I don't know what to say.  I've owned a lot of mice (logitech 303, sensei, kinzu, da, avior, fk1, ec1a, abyssus, etc) and this one is pretty damn good.  Shape, build quality, sensor, ease of use - I mean it's all there.  It is plug and play, so you only really need the software to configure to your liking and then it saves it to the mouse.  Plus for the people who liking saving a thousand different dpis on their mice, it's capable of saving 5 profiles with 3 different dpis to each profile so there you go.  You also can't go wrong with some RGB lighting, which is done very discreetly with a touch of that mionix finesse.  I mean the mouse literally sells itself.There is one thing that bothers me about the mouse a little bit though.  And that is the thumb side cambers in a little too much for my liking.  I feel like it is to offset the wide arch in the bottom right where the pinky goes, but it just feels off to me.  It's kind of like my thumb just keeps wanting to push in for a better grip somehow, but you can't push too much or the bottom will push out, but then it doesn't feel right there, and then you look for a better place to grip, but then the rest of your hand is off, and then boom your mouse is sideways.  I mean it's not really that bad, but it is something I think about.  Of course this is all based on some one who games competitively with a fingertip grip, so for my brothers out there this maybe something you think about.  For general use, its like holding charlize theron's butt in your hand.
