I would give it 5 stars but the logo at the bottom right is really annoying. I expected a clean look with it being clear but the logo at the the bottom detracts from this. Other than that it sticks well to my textured drywall. Erases fairly cleanly. Would recommend it on a smoother surface than mine though as I can see the texture bumps from the drywall.
