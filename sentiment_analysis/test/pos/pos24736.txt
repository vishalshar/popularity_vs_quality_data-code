I was first introduced to the up and coming company by my father's coworker's wife who was one of Barnana's regional representatives. She gave my family samples of the plain, peanut butter, coconut, and coffee flavors to try. They. We're. Delicious. My favorite by far was the coffee, put that's probably my own bias! All of them provide a sweet and delectable, healthy snack that's not only tasty but also fun to eat! Barnana is one of the companies leading the way for healthy snacks that taste great too! I highly recommend trying them and for any new customers, try the peanut butter or coffee first!
