Small, black, light-weight cell phone/MP3 player/GPS holder that mounts to your car's CD slot. The device works on almost every vehicle, is easy to mount and adjust, and doesn't impair the driver's visibility. The center console and media controls also remain easily accessible depending on the location of the CD slot. Although the back and side handles of the mount have a rubbery texture to hold items securely in place, my phone has fallen out on a handful of occasions.Apart from being unable to insert/eject CDs with the mount in-place, our only major gripe about this product is that it tends to cause our phones to overheat due to the lack of ventilation.My husband and I like this product enough that we have purchased several for friends, family, and co-workers. However, as it may work better on some cars than on others, we recommend checking the design of your car before purchasing.
