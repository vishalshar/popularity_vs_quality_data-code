This is a great mascara substitute. It's dark enough for me. I have naturally long and full lashes and just need a little bit of definition. I like it because it doesn't smudge, flake, clump or feel heavy on my lashes. I should probably stock up because every time I find a mascara I like, it get discontinued.
