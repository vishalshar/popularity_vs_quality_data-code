The Whistle GPS has been great! I almost didn't buy it because of all the negative reviews from Tagg users, but I haven't experienced any issues what-so-ever. The battery life has been great (seems to last 5-10 days or so, just depends on how often you're away from the home base station).The app is really easy to use and I've found the GPS to be accurate and to update quickly. The activity tracking is a nice add on, but I don't really care too much about it, just got it for pet safety.
