I use my ball mason jar as a soap dispenser, so this product is the perfect alternative to to the standard metal mason jar cap that invites rust. It comes with a long plastic tube that can be adjusted as needed and a lid that fits my ball mason jar perfectly. I've had no problems with the pump dispensing liquid soap.
