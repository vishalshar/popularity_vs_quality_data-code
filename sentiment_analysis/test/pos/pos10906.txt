I have seen this all over the internet, and when I got an amazon gift card for Christmas I bought one of these. I wasn't sure if the mug was really that strong like some reviewers such as UnboxTherapy had shown, but it is! You can hit it with a baseball bat (not recommended) and it will stay in place. I have spilled many drinks on my desk, but now there is a solution!
