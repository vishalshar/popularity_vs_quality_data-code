how many sweet snacks can one person stomach? Of course anyone who knows siracha knows how great it is. But this combination of nuts, chi, flax, spinach, kale, even carrots, combined with siracha is terrific for those times you don't want something sweet.It's perfect. I could go on but I'd rather just eat one now.
