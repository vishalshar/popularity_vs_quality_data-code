I Ordered this product because I owned the prior model and enjoyed its performance and durability. My purchase was made in June 2016 so I have been using it for 2 months. I had a problem with the first one of the fulcrum screw tightners handle cracked and made it unable to tighten. I notified iOttie immediately and had a new screw tighter in my hand in three days that's pretty good knowing they are based out of New York and I am in California!
