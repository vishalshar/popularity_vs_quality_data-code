These are exactly the same as the adult version of this vitamin. The only difference is that the serving size on the bottle is 4 for these instead of 6 for an adult. Each individual gummy is exactly the same. The other difference is that the kids version comes in a smaller bottle that costs more per gummy. Do yourself a favor and buy the adult version and give your kids a dosage of 4. Do the math from the nutrition information if you don't believe me.
