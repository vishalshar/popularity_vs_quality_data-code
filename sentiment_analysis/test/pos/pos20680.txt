It works like a charm. The Bluetooth connects really fast with my phone, and the selfie is just within a click. Another reaction I bought this unit is because the Bluetooth clicker can be detached from the stick, so I can use it as a shutter remote control while my phone is mounted on the tripod. I would say it is a good purchase.
