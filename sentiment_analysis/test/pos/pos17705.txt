This enclosure was simple to install and allowed me to install this controller outside right above the wires coming out of the ground.  I put the wires in a piece of pvc about 1" in the ground and right up into the knock out on the bottom.  Very clean and I love the fact that the plug in for the controller is right inside the box.  Highly recommend!
