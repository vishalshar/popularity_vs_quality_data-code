Usually I don't write reviews .. If ever. But this was too good not to rave on. I'm someone who has tried every expensive brand to save my hair when this was the answer. There's something to be said about going back to the earths roots - this truly left my frizzy, unmanageable hair smooth and weighted down (in a good way to reduce poof). It also took half the time to dry my hair. So proud of this local New England product and the powers of the Atlantic! I never thought something so natural would get to the roots (literally) of my problem
