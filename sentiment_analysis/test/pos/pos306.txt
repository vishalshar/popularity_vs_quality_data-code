The Coravin works just as advertised. My wife likes white wines, I like red wines. With just the two of us in the home we do not drink enough to open two bottles of wine. The Coravin system allows each of us to draw a glass of wine from two different bottles without opening. I have not noticed any degradation in the wine when I have taken a glass out several times on different days.
