Getting better, but still a long way to go. Very early for me to write this review, but wanted to mention that it does work as advertised. There are few issues -1. On couple of iPhones, when that person walks into the home - the device Deactivates even though I have set to Armed. Does not happen when the other 2 iPhones. Have the same settings on the App for all iPhones - yet only 2 iPhones cause this.2. The siren went off just like that without any warning and could not turn it off and it shut down by itself. There was no activity during that time other than me watching sports,Lot of good things to be said - Great camera and even the night vision is great. In my case I have a auto-sense LED turn on device which makes it more clear to watch the video. It has stayed online the last 4 days expect 3 times which disarms itself when a person walks in.There are more things for this device to make it prime time. Would like to have1. Access to Canary Cloud via the browser as well.2. Able to download the video from the app or store elsewhere.3. Ability delete old activities when the videos are not needed(Timeline). I see that Delete activity is available.4. Able to self-zoom the camera for better close picture, if any person/pet has walked in5. Not to be able to Disarm(I think more options are needed)6. Able to restart in case of shutdown. Yesterday not only did the device Disarm when I walked in home, it shut itself off. I saw the activity of me walking in, next was Disarm(Privacy mode) followed by a complete shutdown(powered off). Had to pull out cable and re-power it.7. Occasionally it activates to other noise in the kitchen(False alarm) such as mixers, loud noise. Very sensitive.8. I am not sure when and how the Siren goes off.I sincerely hope, the fixes will come soon.
