I purchased several of the littlebits base kits for the makerspace at our elementary school and the students love them! I love watching the students figure out they have to have power,then an affect, then a green module that will do something. The instruction booklet is very clear and colorful.  I really like that they hook together magnetically and will only fit one way. I introduced these to my grandchildren and great nieces and nephews over Christmas also. They were fascinated (as were a number of the parents). Hopefully I will get funds to purchase other kits for our school!
