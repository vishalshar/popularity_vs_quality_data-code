I had given up writing reviews for Amazon right after I received a non-polite invitation to do so by some fellows in one of those countries over there for having the temerity to insinuate that their sucky product did, in fact, suck. That and my extreme disappointment at having been passed over for the Amazon In-House fake review Vine Program.However, I am once again available for dancing and singing about the Nextbit Robin. It's great. Especially at the price I paid, which wasn't much. I realize the raison d'Ä™tre of this phone is the cloud storage thing, but seeing that 32 GB was plenty big enough for what amounts to a burner phone, I promptly loaded Nova Launcher and set it up as a "Normal" android device (See photo). The screen is a bit washed out and hard to use outdoors in sunlight, but as I live in Cloudyville, it's not a problem. The battery life is less than what should be considered acceptable. I am getting about three and one-half hours of screen on time during moderate use (Web surfing, texting, e-mail and a voice call or two) and it lasts me all day. A heavy user would need to recharge it before the end of the day. I also own and operate a Nexus 5x which has a similar processor and one less GB of RAM and the Robin seems snappier. It is running a version (Robin's Own) of Android 6.01 and an upgrade to 7.0 Nougat is promised.I intend to use this phone solely as a modem for tethering, with occasional "smart phone" use. I have a car full of kids usually and a cellular WiFi connection and earphones for all hands keeps the noise and fighting to a minimum. For this purpose (with it plugged into a car or with an external battery pack) it kicks butt. Whoever put the t-mobile bands in this thing gave them super sauce. I'm in a Band 12 area and I get fast speeds up and down.So buy it. And thanks to the guy who didn't use it and returned it in mint condition so I could pay less than the prevailing rate, which is still so much of a deal I may buy another.
