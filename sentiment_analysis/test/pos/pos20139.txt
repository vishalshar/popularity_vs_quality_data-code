I really like this tracker. I bought it for my Chihuahua, Hercules. He's about 12 lbs, so it's kind of bulky and heavy for him but he runs away at least once a week so he had to just get used to it. With the collar, as soon as he goes outside the "Whistle Zone" my phone starts to send me alerts that he's gone and I open up the map on the app and it's surprisingly accurate on his location. The collar flashes red and blue when he's outside the zone so that helps to find him at night. I don't really like the "Tracking Mode" because it takes too long to update, it works better for me if I just use the map and hit "Refresh" constantly. I like that it logs his activity too, I didn't know that he wasn't getting enough exercise before, so now at the end of the day if he hasn't hit his goal we'll get some more activity in. So worth it, and I would recommend it if you have an escape artist too.
