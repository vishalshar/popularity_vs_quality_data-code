As a first grade teacher, my students love Osmo and the Osmo Coding game is an awesome addition.  It starts very basic so that a 6 year old can understand and then challenges them to go on. Our second and third grade students love it as well.  We work in groups of 2 and 3 and I love to see them collaborate as they problem solve to the next level. Osmo coding is a great addition to the Osmo kit to keep students engaged. We love Osmo!
