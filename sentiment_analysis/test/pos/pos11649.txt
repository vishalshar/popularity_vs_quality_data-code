I did some research on foam beds and settled on the ghost bed. The bed arrived several days earlier than scheduled and well before the frame. Getting it out of the packaging and on the frame was easy. The first night it had not expanded and was a bit uncomfortable, but subsequent nights it is great. I got a hi loft mattress pad which isolates you from the mattress foam. All in al very pleased with this mattress
