It's large, which I was so happy about. Both dry erase markers and the dry erase crayons work wonderfully and clean off with elbow grease and the cleaner spray that comes with the black marker. The only cons I see so far is the rather large logo at the bottom right corner and the spray leaked a tiny bit in the bag during shipping. My package was damaged at delivery but there was only a small rip at the top corner. I did like another reviewer did and tacked the board to the wall instead of peeling it and sticking it. This worked best for us since our walls are a tan yellow and the paint is crappy. I'm worried it wouldn't stick properly or if I wanted to move it, if it would continue to stick well. It works perfectly for what it is. My son loves it and is happy being able to draw on the wall.
