This is my third case (on my third iPhone) that I have purchased from Rokform.  I believe the quality and craftsmanship is usually superb, not to mention they are durable as hell and sharp looking, too boot.  I wound up picking up the cheaper model for my dad (he's in construction) and he loves it.However, I have to dock this one a point because after having it for a few weeks, I STILL can't get the aluminum part to attach correctly to the rubber part.  I've tried everything short of taking a hammer to it, but I'd prefer not to do that for obvious reasons!  The case for my iPhone 6 was snug as well, but nothing like this.  I've been looking online hoping someone can offer a fix, but at the moment the model is new and I haven't seen any.
