My kids (8 and 9) love this kit. They have built odd little vehicles and machines with it, and really understand the circuitry required to make them work. The instructions are super easy for kids to follow and the littlebits web site has some great project ideas, too. It's interactive, creative, and tactile. As one reviewer said, this is the new Lego. I've got a couple future engineers on my hands now.
