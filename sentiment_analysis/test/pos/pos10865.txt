EDITED 5/4/2016:  The new updates have made the bulb work EXACTLY as it is supposed to. Thanks to the Lifx representative who posted a comment on my initial one star review!ORIGINAL REVIEW :  It worked intermittently at first and now won't connect with our wifi at all - even after going through all the troubleshooting tips, resetting, etc. It is being used as a plain white incredibly expensive light bulb. I should have returned it week one.
