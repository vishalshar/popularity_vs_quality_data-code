I love the product!  The size of the motion sensors is great and they work very well. The door sensors are a bit large but the same size as comparable versions. (I only say they are on the large side because I am used to the micro sensors) the siren is surprisingly loud. Set up is a breeze and anyone can do it. The concept is great and very economical if you just want a local alarm that you can monitor yourself. The ability to add some basic home automation to the system is a huge plus!My issue is with the app. I have had issues with the app causing my phone (iphone 6) to freeze. The app just seems to be a little buggy. It is easy to navigate and straight forward but just doesn't wow me as far as its visual design. It is super simple to make changes to the settings. One thing I would love is if you could re-arrange the order of your sensors on the app. They currently show up in the order you add them. Not a huge deal, but it seems like a simple thing that would really be nice.The system has worked flawlessly, and I have no issues with the sensors showing open when they are actually closed or vice versa. The rage for the sensors is excellent.  I currently have 5 motion sensors, 2 door sensors and a key fob installed.I would really like to get a second indoor siren, but at this time skylinknet is sold out so that's kinda a bummer. I totally would give this system five stars if the app was just a bit more refined. I'm sure eventually the app will get some updates but right now it just didn't rate five stars.
