I like the jitter bug flip phone alot.  I was able to get the plan that I wanted without all the other things included with a phone packag, such as texting, using internet storage and the five star button.If I choose to use the other ootions I can easily add them when I need them.  The camera takes nice pictures an the magnifer works great for small print.
