Why didn't I know about this with my first baby????? This is a dream come true for changing crib sheets.  I change sheets on a daily basis due to a little one who seems to mess up her sheets all the time!! This has made such a change in my daily struggles of taking care of two little ones.  Mommas have enough to deal with, make you life easier and buy this product! This is something I will suggest to all of my friends with babies or who are expecting and will be my new "go to" baby shower gift.  If you are worried about the price, just think about how much you would spend on the amount of sheets you would normally keep for your child and don't forget the mattress covers, those things aren't cheap.  It really does all come out about the same.  Totally worth it.
