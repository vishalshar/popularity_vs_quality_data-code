My boyfriend and I are long distance so we use these all the time! I record videos of myself traveling, doing regular daily routines, cooking, or other cute messages . I stick a few on a letter and mail it to him. It's so much more fun to receive a video or audio message than a text. We love them!The app is easy to use and I haven't had any problems with it.The only negative is I bought 100 for 10$ about a month ago and now the price has jumped up to 40$
