Air purifiers are so expensive, and this one is no exception. I have been using mostly ionic filterless purifiers, because I hate paying a lot of money for a unit and then repeatedly digging deep to replace the filter, but I wanted something I could put on a flexible schedule, and this one fit the bill.This was super easy to set up. It has a sensor, but it doesn't give specific readings. That's okay for my purposes, because I have a Withings Home upstairs where this is located. The Home gives readings on PPM and VOC, and it was the high readings on the Home that led me to buy this filter.  I'm running it without the ionizer for now, because ionizers can raise the VOC level (weird, huh?).It works great on PPM, and the air smelled better right away.The WEMO app gets better all the time, and with IFTTT adding more rules as well, the WeMo stuff is getting easier and easier to integrate with other companies' security and home automation devices. Belkin/WeMo's willingness to let that happen makes life a lot easier.
