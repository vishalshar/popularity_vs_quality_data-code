I bought this to use to keep track of my distance, speed, route, etc. while biking. I also love that I can easily add the rain-cover if my ride is interrupted with precipitation.I've also found it super helpful to keep my grocery list open on my phone and attached to my grocery cart handle. Just make sure you don't walk too far from your cart or forget your phone when leaving the store!
