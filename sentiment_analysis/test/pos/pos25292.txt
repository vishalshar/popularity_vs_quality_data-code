This is a wonderful product that works efficiently and is a joy to use both visually and physically. I have had no problems with leaking, dripping, or the pitcher tipping over while filling, and it filters pretty quickly. It is a great size, not too large but enough water to use for several different things (filling my water bottle, the dogs' bowl, topping off the keurig) before refilling. I love that the top depresses on its own during filling and pops up when full. And it looks beautiful sitting on the windowsill above my sink!
