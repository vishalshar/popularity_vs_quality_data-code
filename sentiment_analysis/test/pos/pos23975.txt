I love this camera!  I saw this camera idea a few months ago...before they were out...and knew I wanted one!  It is the only camera that can dispense treats...and I have an amazing rescue dog, that sadly, has separation anxiety and so the treats are really helping me to leave and keep her busy while I am gone.  I just now need about 3 more cameras...for all the rooms that she goes into!  :)
