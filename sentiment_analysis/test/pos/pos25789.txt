UPDATE2: Back to 5 stars after receiving amazing customer support from LucidSound. It was discovered that my headset and dongle were running an older firmware that had some bugs with battery level indication, where it would give no indications until the battery hit a critically low level of 10%. There is also an issue where the driver/coil can become stuck to the magnet if you press the headphones against your head. this is due to air pressure trapped between your ear and the driver. This new firmware adds additional support for PC's now creating 2 playback devices. one for stereo audio/music/game audio and one for mono audio/communications. in windows you can set this secondary playback device as your default communication device and then take advantage of having separate volume controls (control rings on the earcups) for voice and game audio in games (like overwatch) that support using a secondary audio device for comms. Overall, it's very liberating not to have to worry about getting my headphone cables tangled on the armrests of my chair and ripping out my audio jack on my PC. I love that it automatically switches between my PC speakers and the headset when I power on the headset.UPDATE: I knocked this back from 5 to 2 stars because of inferior battery life, a very annoying and incessant beep when the battery hits 15% and lack of a good battery level indicator. my comparison? the sony MDR1-RBT which has very close to 30 hour battery life and indicates charge level in three increments. As for actual battery life I'd say roughly 8 hours in the real world, you must charge these after every gaming session or risk being tethered via a charging cable while you're gaming. I didn't charge them last night and only an hour into my gaming session today, they started beeping non-stop. My sonys can handle 3 days of normal use without charging, the problem with them is latency because they are bluetooth. in addition to better battery life, the sony's are also lighter and more comfortable, these clamp your head rather tight like an aviation headset.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I use this on my windows 10 PC and it has been amazing for playing overwatch competitive mode, even though only consoles are officially supported, it works like it was made for PC.Some gritty details that took me a while to figure out before I purchased these are listed below and hopefully can save someone a bit of time.-on pc you only need the USB connection, no funky optical audio cables required.-on windows 10 the drivers install automatically. no funky hacks or software to download, it just works.-when you power off the headset, it will disappear from the playback device list (and recording device list) and windows will automatically switch to your speakers. it does this instantaneously, there's no waiting for the headset to connect when you power it on.-latency, there is none. at least not enough to be perceptible. I did an unscientific test with 20 rounds of an auditory reaction time test and the average of those tests actually put me at 10ms faster with these headphones vs. my onboard audio. 10ms is easily human error. for comparison, I have to delay audio to these headphones by 150ms just to watch movies on my 4k tv and have proper lip sync (compensating for input lag on the tv).-recording format maximum quality is mono, 16-bit, 48,000Hz-playback format maximum quality is stereo, 16-bit, 48,000HzAs for the controls:-the ring on the left ear controls microphone monitoring/feedback gain (not the final output to the PC, that can only be adjusted in software).-the button on the left ear mutes your PC audio-the ring on the right ear controls the audio level from your PC and is the only way to control the audio level (changing the output volume or muting in windows will not effect it at all, sort of like when bitstreaming audio in a home theater).-the button on the right ear mutes your mic (the feed to the PC and the self-monitoring are both muted).other notes:-in the windows audio enhancements I use a 6db bass boost with a 60Hz low-pass and leave the headphones in normal EQ mode, they sound amazing.-they clamp my head a little harder than my sony MDR1-RBT bluetooth headphones, but not bad. My sony's are by far the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned.-my only gripe is that the headband could use more padding. maybe a bit of memory foam.-I can also use these seamlessly with my LG 4k tv (65UH8500) because the TV has USB and optical audio output built right in. Great when you live in an apartment, but want to equally enjoy the quiet and lound parts of an action movie. the optical audio cable is included with the headset.FINAL THOUGHTS:I was so put off by all the 7.1 surround, programmable button and LED lighting non-sense of most gaming headsets that I held off buying a wireless headset until I found these. 7.1 surround in a headphone is a total gimmick, you ears don't work that way, I wanted 1 decent quality driver in each ear and these headphones give you just that.If you want a good-looking gimmick-free wireless headset for serious PC gaming and decent music listening, get this headset!Just make sure you are willing to charge them every night religiously.
