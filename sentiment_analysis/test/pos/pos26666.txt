I've had these bulbs for a couple of days now and I love them. The only thing I really hate is the fact that the app limits you to set up a specific occupancy timeout time per room. So for example let's say I want my living room to turn off automatically after a minute from leaving the room it would do it, but that will be the bulb's behavior for the entire day regardless of the schedule you set up. so if around 8pm, you're sitting down having dinner, the bulb will not recognize your hands movement while eating and you're just siting down, meaning the bulb will turn itself off after a minute  and you'll have to get up, make some kind of significant movement to get the bulbs attention, or open the app and turn the bulbs on, which again will turn off after another minute unless, you change the Occupancy timeout settings to 15minutes. But this again will be annoying because now once you're done having dinner, this means every time you pass by the kitchen that bulb will remain on for 15 minutes unless you open the app again and change the settings. This will get really annoying, specially if you have one of this bulbs in your office. it would be easier to allow the user to set their own Occupancy timeout settings based on the different schedules created throughout the day. That way you could set the timeout settings to 15 minutes from 6-8pm everyday as your "dinner time" schedule but the rest of the day to 1 or 2 minutes. That would be amazing!!!! it would help the user to completely avoid flipping any light switches and constantly opening the app.
