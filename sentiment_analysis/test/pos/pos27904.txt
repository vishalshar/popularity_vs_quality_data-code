Really quickly became the game my group plays the most! It's a great game that brings good deduction mechanics and most importantly a big laughs&funs!I played about 10 games so far (6ppl & 4ppl) and here are my impressions:- It's really fast (15-30 depending on no. of players) and non gamers can easily pick up and also be really good at this game.- I love the components and its quality. Though I still used card sleeves to protect the role cards. If murderer card has some distinct damage or fold it will kill the game.- It's easy to swap away your Forensic Scientist role without affecting the game (if you don't like the role).- Murderer has much less pressure compared to other games like Resistance. It's really hard to tell who the murderer is from their behaviours as everyone's cards would match some of clues given. Also guessing the murderer won't finish the game as you have to guess the 2 cards completely correctly. So it's much more proper deduction than sniffing out the bad guy(s) which I really like about the game.- I would say it's slightly easier for murderer to win. It's mainly because some of the clue tiles cannot help to guess some cards at all (e.g. weapon is a poison and clue tile is weather). And you only get to change 2 clue tiles only.- Definitely would be more fun with large number of players (I think 6-8 would be perfect).I really really really hope to see an expansion for this game as there are good room for improvements such as adding more cards, roles, events, mechanics. I am not saying this game is not great yet but I can see that it can become even greater game with more stuff. Please make an expansion !!
