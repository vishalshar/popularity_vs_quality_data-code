Printing at 210/50 on my Flashforge Creator Pro. I have the standard .4mm nozzle, and it works with this filament. It's also compatible with a kapton tape platform. It feels very dry and rigid and prints beautifully. It has no odor, but the fumes do give me a bad headache. So rigid care must be used not to snap the filament during loading.Oh, this stuff shrinks a little. I make x and y 104% larger to make make parts that fit.
