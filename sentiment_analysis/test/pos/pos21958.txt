Love this stuff!  I hate mascara (it cakes, it runs, it smudges and doesn't stay put).  This product stays on your lashes and conditions them.  My lashes are actually healthier, thicker and longer since I've been using the product.  It won't give you that dark "pop" like mascara, but if you want something more natural looking that's actually good for your lashes this is for you.
