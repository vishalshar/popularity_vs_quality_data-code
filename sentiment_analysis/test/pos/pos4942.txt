Absolutely love the new Bike Mount. Fits so much better on cluttered handle bars than the original mount by not taking up hardly any room at all. Easier to disconnect a phone using the tab versus the other mounting system. Don't get me wrong I really like the original Annex Quad Lock Universal Bike Mount Kit - Black as well, but this is a great redesign for a specific purpose.
