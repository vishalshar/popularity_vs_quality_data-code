I love this watch!  It combines the classic elegance of a well crafted timepiece with the convenience of a smartwatch.  This is the third smartwatch I've owned.  Stopped using the iWatch because it was a hassle to have to charge every night. Then tried a lower price alternative that didn't work well.  Neither was very appealing to look at, and looked out of place in my white collar job.  This SmartWatch by Vector looks like an expensive timepiece.  The charge lasts 6-7 weeks! with the second hand turned off.  I have also realized that the most important thing for a smartwatch to do is to tell you the time, and to give you your notifications from your cell phone.  That is ALL that this watch does, and it does it very well.  The watch vibrates with every notification (calls, texts, etc...). This vibration is very noticeable on your wrist. You won't miss it. The watch face is VERY customizable.  First you can choose from hundreds of watch faces on the Vector app (I use the Omega SeaMaster face), Then within each face there are 2-3 locations for info. You choose what info you want to display in each location. (Date, steps taken, battery life, weather, events...).  You can store multiple watch faces that you have customized, and switch between then with just a touch of a button on the watch. When exercising I switch to a different watch face, when in the office another, when at home another. It is really many watches in one. Well worth the price.
