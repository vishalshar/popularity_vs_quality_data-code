UPDATE:So they did release a new app and the thermometer does connect to it. It does seem very clunky for Android, at least so far. Syncing has been giving me some trouble, I have done it once, but I haven't found out the trick to connect it easily.Also a note on the thermometer itself, as far as accuracy, etc. I will say that it gives super fast readings, however depending on how you hold it, you get different temperatures (I've gotten variation of up to 2 degrees). Who knows, maybe it just takes some getting used to.UPDATE:Kinsa customer service on their quick chat service let me know that they expect the android app that supports the new ear thermometer will be live by the end of the week (its 11/17/15 now). Will update then.ORIGINAL:I purchased this product after having the stick model for a long time. It is really fast, but I haven't done any testing as far as accuracy. What really bugged me was that users reviews said how easy it was to set up with the app, but they all must me apple users. I uninstalled the app after not being able to set it up, thinking that erasing all data from my old thermometer and starting fresh might help. When the app opened, there was a selection of two things. The one on top was the ear thermometer, but it was grayed out saying "COMING SOON!"...Nowhere does it say anywhere at least that I've seen that says that you can't use this with the android app yet.I wanted to make sure to post this asap that will hopefully be helpful to others out thereI'll update my review once I can finally use the app.
