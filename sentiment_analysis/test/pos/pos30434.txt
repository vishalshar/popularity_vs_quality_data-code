I have been feeding this with their vitamins, to my dogs for the last year and I have found that they no longer have fleas.  I have one dog that had a severe seizure and I put him on this Immunity because of every thing I read about this product.  When the pups came along I put this in there food as well as the vitamins, they are very healthy.  I feed my dogs raw and I also give them kibble, the best I can afford.  The benefit is no fleas and no parasites.  I have 6 dogs and 3 cats.
