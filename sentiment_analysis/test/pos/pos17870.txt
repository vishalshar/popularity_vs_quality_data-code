So the August Lock... Where to begin..First off, stay away from buying on Amazon Warehouse deals unless it says like new. I went for the one in "good" condition, which had already been coded to someone's app with their phone, and could not be removed other than buy them on their account (kinda like an icloud lock so to speak). So that one went back, and I got the like new, which usually is just damaged packaging. It came with a dent in the box, but sealed, so I know it was good to go.First impressions.. You think it is going to be metal, but it is a plasticy feeling metal, its a lot lighter than you would expect. It is huge haha. Like it will quickly dwarf your door knob, but if you are me, I like to explain to people what it is when the ask, and the size makes it something to ask about. Its pretty straight forward as far as the batteries go. They are pre-installed, you just have to open the front of it and take out the plastic restrict-or that is keeping the connector from touching. Anyway, it comes with everything you need, and the instructions are cake, however install probably won't be, unless your door is brand new, never used ;).You get to keep your existing deadbolt, and the key half (that is on the outside of your door), you just have to remove the inside half. Usually just a coupon screws and its off. The painters tape it comes with to hold the outdoor part from falling is a joke, so just have the door open and keep your other hand on that side to avoid it falling to the ground. All you really have to do at this point is pick a bracket (3 it comes with) that will fit your screw shape well (I say well, because any of the three will pretty much work). Now, the super annoying part is getting the correct adapter. It is a cylinder piece of plastic (3 of them) that mate with the long metal piece that connect from the tumblers (I assume) to where the old turn knob was. Now there is one adapter that looks like this D, if that fits your door great, the other two are a cross(+) and a single line (-). You will be tempted to use the cross as it is probably what the previous knob used and is easiest for install, however... your old knob may have had that style adapter, but it was made of metal, this thing is thin plastic. Immediately after installing August, I noticed the lock already started to slip. This was because the cross did not have enough structural integrity to keep the metal adapter from grinding the inside of it. I suggest using the line one, which I pretty sure was the yellow one. It will be hard to install August, but you will thank yourself when you are not locked out because the key nor August can get the deadbolt back.So after install, you probably thing "hey let me just open this app and program it"... NAH. First you realize August only can connect via bluetooth, and if you want a wifi lock you need the special August wifi adapter deal (49.99). Is it easy to install, you bet. The only reason I can think of for August doing this was so the lock would not constantly connect via wifi, as when in the app, everytime you use it, you must click the wifi button in the app and it connects. If constantly connected to wifi, I am assuming the AAs would be changed every day LOL.Anyway, back to setup. So the app will use bluetooth to connect to your lock, then it will want to be calibrated. You most likely installed August not at the neutral position, so you may need to take it back off. They made this easy, it just flips up on two side and comes right off. For most dead bolts, you will need to use August's full rotation. So against what the instruction manual says, I suggest taking the lock off and manually twisting it all the way to the right to set the lock position (you will not feel any resistance, then you will feel some as it gets close be sure to keep turning until it goes halfway, you will hear the motor turning and when you hear it stop you have turned as far as it will go), then tell the app it is lock mode. It will then tell you to put it in the unlock position. Simply turn it all the way to the other side (counter clockwise). The august will do a full 180 degrees from the left to the right, no more. Once calibrated it should be good to go.Snap it back on, which can be a real pain with the yellow adapter, but so worth it once its one. Sometimes you have to angle it, or turn it to a certain position to make it work, but you will figure that part out depending on your door.Now its calibrated, and installed, time to unlock your door right? Nope.. Most of you probably have aging front doors and dead bolts, so what really helps (and forgive me if another material should be used) but WD40 was my friend. I sprayed the inside of my deadbolt, this made it slide a lot easier and August quit giving me resistance errors. That was the end of the problems for me, and the lock works great now.A green indicator on the App tells me its open, and red tells me its locked. I have the wifi cube too, and it works well over wifi. The auto unlock works great, it sends me push notifications when someone enters, and I have it set on a schedule to auto lock at 10 PM. The app is easy, intuitive, and pleasant to look at.Some issues you may run in to. This was not the case for me, but note resistance is what kills August for most people. This isn't some pneumatic cylinder that'll push past resistance, it will tell you there is an error and not lock. Where this could be a problem? Do you have to push your door in while locking it to lock the dead bolt? Do you have to use some sort of force in anyway to get that deadbolt locked? If so, these errors need to be fixed before getting August. Another one is that this product WILL NOT work on wifi as is. You need that little august cube (49.99).So does it meet my expectations, it sure does! Could my mom install it, no she couldn't. It is just too difficult and has too many variables for the typical person to install (IMHO). If you have trouble getting the batteries out of the front, I suggest maybe just calling someone in to help you install. Save yourself some time :). They fix that issue, they  get 5 stars.
