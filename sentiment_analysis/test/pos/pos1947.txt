Ever since we started utilizing Feed & Go Pet Feeder our early morning wake up calls to our cat's meows' soon ended.  Our cat is currently on a diet per our Vet's guidance & therefore needs to be fed 3 times a day.  Setting up a schedule beginning at 5:30am was very easy after setting up a userid & password on the Feed & Go website.  Everything is done over WiFi but once everything is downloaded it is saved directly on the device.  So even if your router or web service is interrupted the feeder won't miss a beat.  One word of advice when your unpacking everything make sure you also remove the piece of felt under the feeding tray.  After a couple of weeks of use our feeder tray got stuck between serving trays.  Luckily I was home when it happened & noticed the problem.  I went onto the website but it was after hours & so the live chat wasn't available.  So I decided to send an email as the message suggested explaining the situation.  I never thought in a million years' I was going to hear something before the next day.  I heard from a gentlemen named Alex within a 1/2 hour of my email.  He asked if I could supply him a contact number so he could do some trouble shooting with me.  It was during this process that we realized that I had accidentally left the shipping material under the feeding tray.  This interrupted the gearing mechanism.  During the rest of the conversation which lasted about another 20 minutes I found out that Alex is the inventor and the owner.  I have to tell you in today's day & age where customer service has taken a huge down turn it is so nice to see this lost art isn't lost on people like Alex.  Bravo!
