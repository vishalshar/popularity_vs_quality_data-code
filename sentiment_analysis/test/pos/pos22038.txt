Fun introductory remote control robot toy.  The battery life is indeed pretty poor (exhausted the batteries after just 1 day of heavy use), however... so we bought rechargeable batteries.  Would have been nice to have a quick release to the battery compartment ... you must use a Phillips screwdriver to change the batteries. Also the hand motion mode allowing you to direct the robot to move did not work very well... still fun though.  we liked the dance modes and music.  My 12 year old daughter enjoyed playing with it every day for about a week, but then, alas, has not really used it much since then.
