Given some of the negative reviews, I was reluctant to make the purchase, but we absolutely love the Petcube.  It does everything as advertised, and we didn't have any trouble at all accessing the camera/wifi with our iPhones.  We've been using it for 2 days, and it's been very exciting.  We have a special needs cat, so it's been great being able to watch over her and see the fun she has all day long.  Two-way sound works well (had a conversation with my wife early this morning), and the laser is a cool bonus.  Can't say enough honestly.
