It took me a few days to get the feel of this smart remote, and I must admit that on several occasions I was ready to return it and continue  juggling the 4 or 5 other remotes that I was trying to get rid of. I'm really happy that I stuck with the AnyMote. I can now use Alexa to control my Samsung Smart TV , Xfinity set top box, and Sony Blu Ray by voice! I plan on working on the macros to simplify some commands but overall I am extremely happy with this product
