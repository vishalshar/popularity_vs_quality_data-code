Fantastic open source 3d  printer, which worked straight out of the box!  I printed 12 different items before I accidentally jammed the hot end, which I ultimately replaced. (Shouldn't have been so stupid!)  I wish the company had more documentation in the box, though there is plenty online.  The Matter Control software is simple and easy to use.  The fact that the printer is open source means one doesn't have to worry about getting parts if the manufacturer goes out of business.  Very highly recommended!  I love it!
