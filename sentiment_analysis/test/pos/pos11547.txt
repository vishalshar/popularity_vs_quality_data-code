I'm not a professional photographer or pilot. This is the first quadcopter that I've purchased with all these functions. I usually fly race quads LOS so this is a completely different method of flight for me. It is both a lot easier and at the same time a lot more complex. So far everything I've tried has worked exactly as advertised. The forum at RCG for this product has helped me to understand its capabilities. Autel also has published some help videos on YouTube that are very helpful. Lots of new competition for this market is driving down prices. I'm happy with my purchase but if I had a choice I'd keep waiting to see how the market responds to the competition.
