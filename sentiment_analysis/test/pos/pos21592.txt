I like this product a lot. I have been wearing mine nonstop since I got it. Only issue I have is that it eats up my phone battery quicker than I would like. BUT, being a bluetooth connected device, that's pretty much to be expected. I love how I can create custom settings for all the different notifications I choose. I can even assign certain settings to individuals to differentiate who the message/call came from. It's a great conversation starter as well. People will notice it light up and are immediately interested! I like it a lot!
