About 12 days ago our dog Maisie went missing for 26 hours. It was completely uncharacteristic of her, a complete shock, and a very worrying time for us.We had no idea where she was, and despite the odd sighting, some incredible local support and help from friends and complete strangers, communications on Facebook, Twitter, text messages and alike, we searched tirelessly for her and were unable to track her down.Amazingly after 26 hours missing we got a call from the police who happened to be driving past our house and found this loose dog on our driveway. Maisie had found her way home from an area that she had never been to before, over 10 miles away. We were stunned.Fair to say that as a family we NEVER want to experience that kind of traumatic situation again. The feeling of completele and utter helplessness when trying to figure out where she might even have been.So I went and did what every self-respecting man in my situation would do. I went out and got a gadget to solve the problem. In doing so I scoured the market for a GPS pet tracker that could provide the kind of immediate information that, God forbid, we should ever face this situation again, would give us some greater hope in pinpointing Maisie early on and save us the agonising wait and worry.I opted for Pod Tracker which seemed to tick all the boxes, and then some. It was small, compact, waterproof, had a decent looking app to support it, and a few clever extra bits of thought in product design that made me decide on this one.So here is my review of the product, installation, and use of the Pod Tracker GPS Pet Tracker.The product packaging as you can see is very neat. This looks like a proper product. None of this cheap knock-off Chinese GPS tracker nonsense that you can find on the web. This wouldn't look out of place in an Apple Store. So far so good.The GPS unit itself (with the battery attached) is 5cm long and 2cm in diameter and doesnt weigh too much, but feels solid, reassuringly so. Its pretty compact and really would be suitable for most sized dogs. I cant vouch for cats, but it is sold as a dog or cat GPS tracker so I am guessing it is suitable for all but the tiniest of cats.The unit itself comes in 2 parts. The main unit which is entirely concealed and the battery which screws on to the unit.This design allows the unit to be waterproof and is clever. My only comment is that its actually quite hard to screw and unscrew the battery from the unit. I guess this helps with the waterproofness of the unit but it was a bit of a struggle. Having said that, its reassuring to know that its highly unlikely that the battery will fall off on its own accord.The next stage was to pair the unit with the app. This was frankly such an easy process that again I felt that the product quality was just getting better and better.I turned on the unit (after charing the battery for 2 hours) outside. It took about a minute before all 3 lights had gone green. Power, GPS and wifi. I then hit find pod on the app, the pod was detected, it confirmed the wifi that I wanted to use (I didnt even need the wifi password) and hey presto the pod was set up. Simple.Attaching the unit onto the collar was another example where brute force was required. Thankfully the clearly laid out user manual gave a great tip and suggested putting the plastic strap in boiling water for 15 seconds before threading it through the unit. Its a really tough job and I really thought the plastic strap would snap as I was pulling it through, but it didnt and despite the effort, again I really dont think the unit is going to become detached from the collar without some kind of scissor intervention. So thats a good thing too!The next stage was to setup Maisies profile on the app. Again here were some nice touches where I could add a photo, her birthday and ther information about her. This is great for dog walkers who might want to use a single pod on multiple dogs. The information editing takes about 60 seconds so could easily be updated to reflect different dogs. Another nice touch is that you can set daily goals. You seen this isnt just a pet tracker but also an activity tracker. More on that later.So how about it in use? Good question! One thing to note, which again goes back to the detail and thought that has gone into the product, is that this product uses 2G. Not 3G or 4G. Nope, it uses 2G.Wait a minute! I hear you say, 2G - thats old skool iniit???.Well, technically you might be right saying that BUT, and its a HUGE BUT, 2G has greater coverage that 3G or 4G everywhere, so whilst this unit might be using older technology, the rationale behind it is 100% sound.We live in a rural area where quite often the data coverage gets lost but where there is still a phone signal. Well this product benefits from exactly that scenario. And as far as I am concerned Maisie would be far more likely to shelter in woods and rural fields than sip lattes in town centers, should she ever go missing again.With that in mind however, it does mean that when you attempt to locate the animal when they are out and about, there is an overhead or l time lag between initiation to find and actual location (about 30 seconds in my experience but it can take up to 2 minutes apparently). I guess this is for the app to call the unit and to do whatever necessary handshakes are required, and for the information to be passed back over that old 2G technology. However, once located the information will then be updated automatically for 2 minutes.I should probably add that locating is also done using wifi and bluetooth so if the pod is detected locally (i.e. at home) then it uses those capabilties first, before reverting to 2G. This is probably more useful for cats than dogs as Maisie doesnt have a tendancy to hide in our walk in wardrobe.The app itself places Maisie on the screen on the map (you can choose between road map, satellite or hybrid) and you can zoom in or out depending on your needs, using the standard pinch and zoom on the touchscreen.3 other main features that are a bonus.As I mentioned, Pod Tracker is also an activity tracker so you can get a daily summary of your dog or cats activity levels including sleeping, walking and running. Its like a fitbit and it shows everything nice and clearly on the screen.Secondly is the ability to setup a safe zone around your house. This means that you can receive an alert if your dog or cat leaves the safe zone. Its turned off by default, but activitaing it is very easy indeed. In my case its based around our home wifi but you can edit the centre point.Another nice feature is the Adventure tracker. This records their trail and syncs it back to the app upon their return. This does wear the battery out faster (6-8 hours of continuous monitoring) though so should only be used for fun.On the subject of battery life the Pod Tracker quoted battery life is 6 days. This seems great and with the extra battery and the ease with which you can switch them over, this feels entirely reasoanble and very manageable. You get a battery indication in the app so you know how much battery life is left on the unit. Re-charge takes about 2 hours.The other aspect of the Pod Tracker solution which swung it in my favour was the cost itself. Whilst the initial up-front cost was slightly higher than other units, the annual cost was significantly cheaper than some other solutions, meaning that in the long run it is much better value for money.I would recommend this product very strongly. The attention to product detail and the practical challenges it has managed to overcome with thought and design is a credit to the team behind it. It is certainly providing me with peace of mind, whilst also providing some extra nice touches that Im sure well use going forward.
