The cats that live here love this product.  I appreciate that the Whole Life people do not add fillers just to avoid the powder.  Having dried foods and cooked things, I think the occasional hard bits are to be expected.  I have ordered the 21 oz. box the last few times and 85+% of the well sealed bag inside contains large pieces.  I move them to a new bag and use the small flakes and powder to sprinkle on the dry food.  I soak the few hard pieces as the older cats like them.  I have very little waste with this product - way less than the waste with my human food.  This provider has answered all questions I have had promptly and professionally.  If a return was necessary, I feel certain it would be replaced without delay.  The clowder gives Whole Life Pet Products 24 paws up!
