These keep hard and semi-soft cheeses for quite a few weeks in the refrigerator. They don't work well for very soft high-moisture cheeses like fresh mozzarella, though. The bags are easy to use and can be re-used. One minor drawback is that you can't see what's inside.The only method I've used that keeps cheese longer than these bags is vacuum-sealing, which can keep cheese for months in the refrigerator. However, you have to cut open the package when you want to use it which makes it a bit impractical when you don't need all of the cheese, but of course you could then transfer it to a Formaticum bag.
