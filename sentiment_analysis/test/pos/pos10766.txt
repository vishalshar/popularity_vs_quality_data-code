I have been using the Foscam series of monitoring devices for indoor home surveillance.  They worked well, I liked the panning feature, and the 1-way audio (receive only).  However, the setup was a bit of a challenge trying to get all the web ID's synched up and the product often dropped the connection requiring me to set up a new URL.  Very frustrating.The OCO:Pros:  Waaaaay easier to set up and use on my iPhone and iPad (and computer of course).  Very little latency on the feed.  Detects on both sound and movement.  Easy to take snapshops of a scene in progress.  Had issue with 1-yr free cloud service, customer service fixed it in 1/2 day.  Free one year cloud recording (1 day retention) is a great way to test the system if it to your liking.  Can connect other cameras to Ivideon service including a DVR, but I have not tried it.Cons: Audio subpar (while the mfg claims two 2way audio, it is a stretch).  No remote panning.....once you set up the line of sight, that is it unless you change it physically.  Black camera face with silver base (prefer a black base to further render incognito).  Indoor use only recommended, but I can see how it might be wired under an eve for example).All in all, a very good product, worth the investment.  Got my first one, on to number 2!
