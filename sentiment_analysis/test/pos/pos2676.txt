After reading several other reviews, it looks like these are a love 'em or hate 'em snack. Personally I love 'em.They are not as sweet as typical fruit strips, and that is one of the things I like about these. The one's I've tried in the past were almost too sweet. Are they tough? Yes. They are dried fruit & veggies. Real dried fruit is going to be tougher than something made from juice.My daughter will happily eat one of these instead of those chemically-laden fruit snacks that she's always begging for. This, makes mom happy. Are they for everyone? Probably not, but it can't hurt to try. They are a healthy choice with 1/2 serving each of fruit & veggies in each strip.I like the variety. The combinations are unique. I like the Carrot Ginger, and the Cinnamon Spiced Beet. Will these replace candy in my 'diet'? LOL no. But, if I am hankering for something sweet, I'll *try* and remember to grab one of these instead of a bag of bad-for-me gummies. Every little bit helps, right? ;-)I received this product free in exchange for a fair & honest review.
