Incredible air freshener. It keeps the car odor neutral, even after eating or going for long drives. I cannot express how fantastic this guy is. I was definitely skeptical, but not after using it for 6 months or so. I'm going to buy one every year because it truly works. Only two complaints though:I wish the rope that secured it was black or a more neutral color. The blue is a bit feminine and seems out of place in my car.Also, everyone that gets in my car asks why I have a diaper attached to my headrest. It kind of does look like a diaper. But it works so well, those two things barely bother me.
