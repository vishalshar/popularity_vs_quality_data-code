This is a fun game and a good mix of education and entertainment (edutainment). I've learned things and been reminded of things I knew long ago. I dropped a star because I think the "game board" really needs to be laminated or coated like a trail map. This was a good purchase and I recommend it. Lots of good info but I would like to see an expansion pack of additional questions maybe for advanced survival skills or trail geography. The kids loved it too!
