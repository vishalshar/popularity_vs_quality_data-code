For someone like me who's just lazy enough to not want to tie his shoes but still wants the comfort of knowing your shoe won't easily fall off your foot, this is the answer. It's a creative way of being able to have the security of a tied shoe but the leisure of being able to slip it on and off easily. I also love that there's no compromise in style. If anything it adds a flavor to the mix that you don't normally see every day. I've had mine on a new pair of Nike's for a few days now and don't have any complaints. It was a little weird at first but only in the sense of "will this elastic band REALLY be secure enough" to which I have so far seen, YES.
