I would like to note first that this is not a Flagship device, but for the class of phone that this falls in it is perfect!. The big selling point for this is the 100GB of instant cloud storage for media and app (which is unique to this device). The 32GB of on board storage is plenty for most users and having the cloud backup makes it a bit more than just having 32GB. It is very snappy and in my use of the device is was smooth with no stuttering or slow downs. It works great with basic games, but I don't think that this for someone who enjoys playing any graphics intensive games. My favorite feature is the look! It is different from any other device that I have owned and feels extremely premium and durable. The camera is average, but I wouldn't have noticed a difference if I hadn't been using a higher end phone camera prior to this one. For the price, in my opinion it is the best phone in it's class.
