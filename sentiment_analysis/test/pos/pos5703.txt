Works Very well to give illusion of thicker hair by adding color to thinning areas. Start with a light spray and build by repeating. I have red hair and find auburn a bit bright red but still good. I now use the brown as the first coat and then use auburn over it. Lasts a long time but washes out easily when wanted. Will continue to use. Lasts a long time.
