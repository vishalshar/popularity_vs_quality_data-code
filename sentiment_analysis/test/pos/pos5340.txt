This is now my second Casper mattress I purchased.If you'd like $50 OFF (disclaimer I also get $50 off up to 5 times) leave your email in the comments and I'll send you a link.The mattress IS definitely different. I've had a serta icomfort (DONT buy!), pillow tops, spring mattresses, and costco version memory foam. Casper's mattress is firmer, and I was stiff the first couple nights sleeping on it but got used to it after a week. I sleep on my back so I can't sleep for side sleepers, but the mattress gives me the perfect level of support. I did request the memory foam topper at the end of my first month because I wanted a tad more cushion but could have been fine without it. My first casper i bought 4 months ago, and still like it a lot. This next one is replacing a terrible icomfort in our guest room. If my caspers are still great in a couple years I will be shocked and thrilled, I just don't expect longevity out of anything anymore. crossing my fingers!! definitely good enough to buy a second at this price point.***update: it's 6 months and I still love the mattress (WITH the topper). Thinking about buying a pillow.
