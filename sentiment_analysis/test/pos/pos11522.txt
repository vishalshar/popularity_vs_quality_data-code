Wow, might be the best $35 I have ever spent on a shirt... too bad no one can see it! The fit is skin tight however by no means constricting at all.  The sleeves or waist don't bunch up and the v neck is cut deep enough you can have the second button undone without seeing the t shirt underneath. It is so lightweight and has a very silky feel to it, you don't even realize your wearing it. On a recent business trip I realized I forgot to bring another undershirt so I washed this one in the sink with some shampoo, wrapped it in a towel and wrung it out to dry. I hung it  near the PTAC and by the next morning it was dry.  Needless to say the rest of the undershirts will be replaced one by one with these... Just placed an order for two more, one for me and one for a friend that won't believe they are as good as I say they are.
