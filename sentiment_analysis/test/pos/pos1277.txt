Sooo, this case is absolutely amazing! I pulled it out of the package and immediately stuck it to my wood paneled wall and just like magic it stuck in place! Im most excited to use this product in the kitchen. Im constantly looking at online recipes and instead of running back-and-forth to my computer, I just stick it to my cabinet and voila, I (hopefully) wont mess up more recipes. I'm really impressed with the quality of this product and I highly recommend it.
