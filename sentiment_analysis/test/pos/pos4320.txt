I was talking with someone about getting a new, mid range phone and I'm so glad this IT dude recommended me the Nextbit. I was going for the Nexus 5x and I'm sure I would've loved that too but the Nextbit was cheaper. Honestly for the price this is 7/5 stars. For me personally I just needed a phone that can do the basics (email, internet, news, some apps, reddit...) without slowing down. Sure it doesn't have the best camera, the best battery life, or even the fastest phone. But for $170 why are we even trying to make comparisons to $600 phones? This is serious quality right here.Pros:- Fast, at least to me. My old phone started going to a crawl. I haven't noticed any slow downs.- Fingerprint scanner. This is neat. It's fast and works well.- NO BLOATWARE. This phone is SLEEK, hardware and software wise. Very minimal in both regards. And I love me some minimalism.Cons:- Battery life is alright, but this phone has Quickcharging and I always have a portable battery so no issue.- Camera is alright, but I don't take that many phone photos and I have a DSLR if needed. But for the price it's a decent camera.
