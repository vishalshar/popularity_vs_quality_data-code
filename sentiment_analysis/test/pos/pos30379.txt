TIP: Have a LOCAL PROFESSIONAL licensed Irrigation contractor install this controller and monitor your water usage. Great controller! Works excellent.  My grass looks healthier than ever and my water bill is lower.  Do not try to install this yourself if you don't know what you're doing.  I had a PROFESSIONAL do the install and he was done in 30 minutes. My advice: Leave it to the PRO's and spend more time doing what you love! ;-)
