So to give you a little bit of background Im the type of kid that never took care of his skin growing up. My beauty routine consisted of showering and brushing my teeth. I suffered from acne but essentially thought it was going to go away with age. As I grew older I started understanding the importance of taking good care of my skin. I experimented with various products and managed to get some good results. This specific toner from Eben is by far the best toner Ive tried in the past 4+ years. For those of you who are familiar with Witch Hazel and its benefits  this toner has plenty of it and you can feel it immediately. The other prevalent ingredient seems to be cucumber which is an excellent skin conditioning agent and emollient. I If you want to give your face a soft, clean and smooth appearance look no further. This is a fantastic toner!
