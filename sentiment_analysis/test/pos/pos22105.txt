Well I have had this since January 20 2016 and I absoultly love it. I am doing my first 5 k this weekend and I have been using this to see my progress. This is so much more than a pedometer. It's shows a map of my run and shows me where I ran vs where I walked. It also lets me know my stats and how long it takes me to run a mile and my speed. It corrects my form and let's me know how I am doing. If I'm board at work I may break out into doing some jumping jacks well despite I didn't register a work out it knows I was more active at that moment.  I am attaching a photo of today's progress
