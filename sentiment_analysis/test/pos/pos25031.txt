Nice not to have to carry a cord around. More flexible than expected, and it does put the phone in a slightly awkward position next to the computer, but that's the nature of a small charge device, I suppose. I'm only leaving 4 stars for now, because we want to see if it holds up with use, but if it does, I"ll come back and modify to 5.
