This is my first personal VR. After trying the Samsung Gear VR, I decided I wanted a VR of my own but as I didn't have a Samsung Galaxy phone, I couldn't get the Samsung Gear VR. I got this for my iPhone 6S.In comparison, Merge VR is okay. However, the price isn't. It's blurry sometimes and there is no way to focus the device, so for the price that's a little disappointing. That being said, it works fine for most VR viewings. You can't play many games with this, but apps like VRSE work great. If the focus is right on the video or game, it looks really good and is immersive. The website that they have [...] is a great way to find apps that are well focused.Note for iOS users: DO NOT get a controller as they don't work on iPhones.
