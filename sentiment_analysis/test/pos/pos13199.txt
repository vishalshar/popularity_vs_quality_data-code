Perfect! Highly recommend this product! We have a cat who prefers to use this system than her litter box. This is the best version of this type of pee pad that we have ever found. Easy to clean (as-is without any modification), setup and maintain. We use cat litter inside the 'catch box' instead of the granules, because it is cheaper and actually works better for cat urine. We also use plastic grocery bags for the liner... cheaper and works perfectly as we can just lift it out (with the clumped litter inside), tie it off and toss it in the trash.
