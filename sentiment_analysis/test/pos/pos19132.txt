Small, sleek design and easy to set up.  I put this on 2 days ago and have used it twice already.  I have a key fob for my car and with 3 drivers it ends up in someone's pocket, purse or jacket.  This device has helped me keep track of my key!  I just wish I could find the other key and when I do, I'm putting TrackR on that too!!!!
