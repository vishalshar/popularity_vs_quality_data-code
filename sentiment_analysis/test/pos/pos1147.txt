We just bought osmo creative set along with all the other sets for my 4 year old. We are so impressed with these games. It is the best thing We have seen in a long time. My son loves it and so do we!! recommending it to anyone with kids ages 4 and up. Some of the games are a little challenging for him still but he will definitely grow with it.
