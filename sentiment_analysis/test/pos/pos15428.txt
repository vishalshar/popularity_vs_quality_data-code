I keep finding good uses for this stuff.  I've used it to build bumpers around a baby monitor, which was purchased because the last one cracked excessively after a few drops.  Well, the Sugru-protected one has been dropped repeatedly and is in perfect shape.  I've used it to cap sharp ends of metal on a wall sculpture, used it to hold the hands of a clock after the screw that retains the hands fell off and disappeared, and will soon be making pads for some metal chairs that have been gouging the floor.Once this stuff dries it is just hard rubber that sticks like mad to whatever you've put it on.  Just to see how gentle I needed to be with it, I stuck some on a cheapo metal figurine I had, and ended up throwing it away because I could get the Sugru off.
