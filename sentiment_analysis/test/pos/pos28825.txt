Purchased 2 for our golden retriever puppy. We lived where we had no yard and this was very handy especially teaching him to go potty. I got 2 large ones to make him feel like he had space to go cause I knew he would grow fast. Glad I did and now that he's almost 4 and we've moved to a house with a yard I've still got them. Holding up well and only bringing them out when we know well be gone all day and can't find some one to let him out to go pee. (This has only happened 1 but it nice to know we've got a back up.)
