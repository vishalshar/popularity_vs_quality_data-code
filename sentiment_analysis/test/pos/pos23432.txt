I purchased this item to control devices through Alexa voice control, and it works great!  So far I control my lights, TIVO, TV, and receiver.  For example, I have a macro to turn all lights off; I just say Alexa tell AnyMote to Lights Off when I leave.  I also used macros to go to specific channels, and turn the TV on/off (which also requires turning the Receiver on/off); I just say Alexa tell AnyMote to TV On. Not everything needs to be defined in macros, to change the channel I can Alexa tell AnyMote to Channel Up, or Alexa tell AnyMote to Channel Up my TIVO the first time to set the remote.Almost gave it less stars because I was surprised that it requires the controlling device (i.e. cell phone) to be there.  Since I only cared about voice control, I synced it with an old unused (cracked) iPhone that is running the AnyMote app.  The iPhone is always there (in the background) and charging, so the whole system always works (which would not be the case if it was synced to my Cell, and I was not there).  It also took me a little time to train myself on how to control it (Alexa tell AnyMote to <Macro> or Alexa tell AnyMote to <Button> my <Remote>).  Overall, however, it is so cool and useful, that it deserves the 5 stars; I love it.
