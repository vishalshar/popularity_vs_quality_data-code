I've had irregular periods my whole life. I started taking this following a miscarriage and it put my cycles on track right away. It mixes so easily and is completely tasteless. It has not only regulated my periods like clockwork, but I am sleeping better too! I will continue to take premama, until I get a positive pregnancy test. Fingers crossed its my next cycle.
