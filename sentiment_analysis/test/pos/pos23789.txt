We adore our ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box - our only point of contention is buying these refills. Yes, the refills work fine. We love the whole concept of this system, the crystals are awesome at absorbing the odor, the tines never clump. However, it is pricey to buy in essence a cardboard box with some crystals in it for this much money. So we experimented and found a solution.Instead, we take their cardboard box and spray it with a regular spray lacquer like you find at any Michael's store - a few coats. That makes it waterproof. Then we buy standard crystals at a WalMart. We get a ton of uses out of it, and just wash the box itself out every few weeks. We have two cats - one an 18 pounder, so rather large. He doesn't have any issues at all with this. I'll note that he doesn't have his front claws, but our smaller cat (8 pounds or so) is fully clawed and hasn't had any issues with this either. No "claws through the cardboard" or anything.  I imagine if you had some sort of tear-happy kitty you could reinforce the bottom with a sheet of plexiglass very easily, which would be quite washable and durable too.For us, however, that wasn't necessary. Yes we might have to buy one of these every number of months to get a fresh, clean box to start with, but other than that you can certainly "create your own" without having to buy their units.I'm not sure how to rate the unit then. I'll give it a 5/5 because it is an awesome idea and you should get one or two to start with. However, keep in mind that you don't need to keep buying them if you don't want to - it's just as easy to make your own once you understand how they work.
