Pros:1)  The hard plastic case is great, fits like a glove.  Slides on and fits perfectly.2)  The hard plastic case has some kind of material inside that the phone is actually touching that creates a sturdy, tight connection.Cons:1)  The part to attach to your dash doesn't work great at all.  It isn't really that sticky, especially on specific types of surfaces.  My dash has a rougher kind of matte finish which it didn't stick to at all.  I tried it on a smoother part of the dash and it would stick, but still not that great.  I basically just screwed it straight to my dash and it works fine, but I have an older car that isn't real nice so it isn't a problem.  If you have a newer car or care what your passengers think I don't plan on this method.  And maybe think a little harder about this item specifically for this purpose.2)  The rubber part of the case, the outside protector, fits pretty loose.  When I put my phone in my pocket and move around a lot this rubber tends to stretch and pull away from the case.  Overall it does provide the added protection that they say it will, but I have a feeling that it will wear out and be so loose I will have to take it off.Over all it is a pretty great product.  I love being able to pull up directions to somewhere and just click it into the dash holder and go.  I don't need to pull anything out of my glovebox or remember extra equipment.  It is always there when I need it, especially since I always have my phone with me.
