Overall amazing experience with my Bluesmart bag!Usability:Its perfect for travelers who are looking for a bag that enables them to be quick and efficient with their packing and trip (multiple pockets, pouches, and of course some technological perks). The charger alone is worth it! Ive walked, cabbed, bussed, trained, and flown with my Bluesmart  its really easy to transport and carry around.  The compartment for the laptop is amazing. Soft padding, multiple compartments, some with zippers, feels safer in there than in my briefcase. Id say ideal use would be a week-long trip, particularly when there are transit and/or space issues involved. Its the ideal carry-on for the frequent flier.Features:Quality: The quality of the bag is excellent, and love the sleek design. Lightweight (weighs about 10 pounds) yet durable, and feels modern. The materials and plastics all feel very sturdy and well made. Front pocket is perfect for a laptop, makes it easy to pull out at security (if not already TSA pre check of course).Tech:Charging: There are two charging ports, works great, (a solid charging cord is also included), and is a much needed feature  I find myself using it at some point on every single trip I take. The battery is 10,000 mAh, (the little amazon powerbanks are 2,000 for reference), solid amount of charging time.Locking: Remote locking feature is cool, theres a slight piece of mind there (2 keys are also included with the bag in the front pocket). The locking mechanism itself functions very well, theres also a feature for it to auto-lock when youre a certain distance away from the bag. TSA approved, nothing but love.App: Havent gotten super into the app as of yet, but there are tons of stuff you can do here. Aside from locking, theres also a distance alert feature (tells you if youre leaving your bag behind), digital scale (you just pick up the handle and it tells you the weight), GPS location, and flight itineraries/alterts you can sync.Customer service: The customer service was fantastic, completely seamless  arrived within 2 days of ordering, nice packaging, positive consumer experience.All around a cool and innovative piece of luggage. Definitely looking forward to more products by Bluesmart!
