This is a incredible technology, I like this gadget.I have several cameras (Canon 5D MII, Canon Elan 7, Canon AE 1, Canon EOS M) and several lenses... and if you want to buy this camera, don't think to print the pictures from Lytro (or maybe can you print with a little post process like onOne Perfect Resize software), but you can use this camera to learn Photographic Composition, with excellent results... another interesting thing is you have the option to use this camera in Manual Mode (Speed, ISO, and a real ND Filter included in this camera).For sure this camera is not for all people, if you want to use this camera to print photos... this camera is not for you... but if you want to challenge your mind with another photos and explore your creativity... this is for you!!!
