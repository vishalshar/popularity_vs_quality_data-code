I love that I can make ice tea so fast. These are so great to take when traveling too. They are so easy to use, just tear open and add to a glass of water. I then add ice and some sweetener. The taste is just like I brewed it from a tea bag. It has a mellow non-bitter flavor that even tastes good without sugar. This is my new on the go drink to get the healthy antioxidants of green tea into my body.
