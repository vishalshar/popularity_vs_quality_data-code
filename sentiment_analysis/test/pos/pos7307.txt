I heat by woodstove all winter and occasionally get wood that needs a little boost to really get burning hot. InstaFire factory seconds do just what they say they do. They light quickly and burn hot fora  long time to get the fire going.  It does not burn down to an ash but rather looks similar to the unused product; however, the packaging says it's non-toxic and acts as a fertilizer. Highly recommended to keep on hand for frontcountry campfires (I wouldn't want to see the left over bits in a backcountry firepit), woodstoves, etc.
