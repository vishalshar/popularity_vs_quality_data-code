Like fruit roll-ups but with fewer calories and a more sophisticated flavor. Pricey but worth it if you're watching your weight. They're great between-meal snacks and super portable. (You can probably even slip one into your wallet!)  I would buy these again. (I also tried one other flavor. Spinach-carrot-something else and that was also tasty.)
