I have purchased each version of these vehicle mounts, from the original mountek to the Snap, to the Snap+. I really enjoyed the original Snap, however it kept slipping out of the CD slot and dropping my phone. The "blades" the used on this version are plastic and have a slight angle on them that dont allow the blades to grip that well. They do have some sort of rubber infused into the blades, but it is not enough.I researched the issue and came across a few individuals that were having the same issue. I looked into the Snap+ and realized it used the same type of "blades" as the original MounTek (Metal blades with rubber coating). I purchased immediately and havent had an issue since. phone is stable and doesn't move one bit. Have had it mounted in my car for a few weeks and havent even had to adjust it.For reference I own a 2011 Chevy Camaro and the CD slot is a shiny chrome plated plastic bezel.
