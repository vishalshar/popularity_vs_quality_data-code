Bass MusicWob wob wob wubble woom wooom woom woomIf you miss the feeling of bass rattling your whole body (post concert)This is for youIf you tend to listen to folk music or other genres without sub bass. This will probably not meet your expecations.If you tend to listen to bass music where most of the song resides in the low end, think: Big Gigantic, Pretty lights, Excision, Griz, Space Jesus, Bass Nectar,This will ...This will do more for your wellbeing than I can possibly describe.I don't write reviews. So I don't trust that I a completely coherent concise review.But I do listen to bass music a lot and have have always tried to recreate the feeling of being in front of a wall of subs at a venue.Spent over 600 on a KRK sub and that doesn't even get used much anymore, unelss friends are over.I wear it everywhere except work, I can't take it in since they don't allow outside electronics.On lunch breaks I go to my car and dance my butt off until I have to go back in.I wear it even in bed it has a very thin profile and I've already slept with it on twice.I wear it on the toilet, while making breakfast, while I'm brushing my teeth, I literally wear it everywhere. Except the shower. I don't know for sure if this thing is waterproof and I wouldn't trade this for anything. It is my baby.Give me some feedback as a reviewer on this. I've haven't been this mindblown since the iphone rocked my world.Edit 9/16/16After everyday use for 3+ hours a day I guess this thing has seen the end of its life. Now it shuts off the sub while still playing music in the headphones. Restarting and reconnecting bluetooth doesn't help. Before it would just randomly shut off with a freshly charged battery. I would restart it and it would work 100% fine...Paying more than $300 I would expect more from the manufacturer.I haven't ever dropped it and its never been near water.It works. Sometimes.Amazing innovation. Needs some tweaks or something because I treated this product like my child. Now my child won't do as I request and it's incredibly frustrating.I don't want to discourage anyone from buying this. You will smile A LOT. I suppose I just feel I need to rant about how much I miss when it worked perfectly fine.
