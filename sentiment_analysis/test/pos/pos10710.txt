It works great.  I wanted these to put my tablet on my kitchen cabinet so I could pull up recipes for cooking.  The NanoHold worked well and although it was a little hard to remove the first time but I was able to take the tablet off and put it back on and the they didn't mar the paint on my cabinets at all.  Very pleased with how well the NanoHold works!
