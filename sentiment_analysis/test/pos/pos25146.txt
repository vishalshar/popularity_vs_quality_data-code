Fine classic looking watch with extra gadgets! Works quite well with GPS and Bluetooth to connect with your phone and sync your activity data. It easily recognizes running from walking so far and is comfortable to wear. There is no heart rate meter, no touch screen and it is not a smartwatch. Perfect for just activity tracking while staying classy;)
