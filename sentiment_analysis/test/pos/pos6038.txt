Ive had a remarkable time with this bag. It is a machine of poise for short trips and comes loaded with features specifically tuned for business travel.My first trip with Bluesmart was a two day flight to Seattle from San Francisco.Packing: The capacity of the bag is pretty optimal for short trips. While it wont fit a weeks worth of clothes, I had no trouble loading what I needed into the main compartment. I packed a tablet, notebook, and laptop into the external pocket and filled the inner lining with my various odds and ends for freshening up at the hotel. The bag is very light to begin with, and loading it up with only essentials kept the weight very manageable.Airport: Admittedly, I was skeptical about the charging functionality at first  I have made it this far with airport outlets. But theres a lot to be said about the way having your own charging station makes you feel in a terminal. Outlets vary between gates, but I had the distinct pleasure of not even checking where they were. I sat by the window (my favorite place to be) and kept my phone charging when I stepped over to get coffee.Hotel: I didnt spend much time at the hotel, so I was thankful to have my things in an accessible place. The battery in the bag lasts quite a while (10000 mAh or about 6 full charges), so I continued using it at the hotel if only to keep the momentum.The Bluesmart bag fills a specific use case very well. I would expect to get value out of the airport experience on any trip, but the collection of features really perform on trips like my Seattle flight. The capacity, locks, size, weight, build quality, tracking, and even the look all come together marvelously.Shipping was fast, packaging is great, and Im persuaded that any business traveler (or tech enthusiast) will really resonate with what Bluesmart has to offer.
