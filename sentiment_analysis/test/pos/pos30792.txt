Best body wipe ever!  I used this during the Ragnar Relay (2 day race...no showers) and it kept me feeling fresh and clean the entire time.  The size is great, NO STICKY RESIDUE!!!  I did use two after each leg of running, but I suspect all female users would.  The scent is really fresh, no floral scent here, just fresh and clean.  If you are in need of an adult wipe for use on the go, you won't go wrong with the Shower Pill athletic body wipe!
