Instructions are incomplete, you have to go online for additional instructions and the site is also buggy. After a full day still did not manage to get it to work. In contact with support and will update .Was it so hard to include a DVD with the Software?UPDATE: Managed to get it working finally!It is incredible and a fun way to exercise. Highly recommended. I just wish they made it easier to setup. However after the initial hiccups I would definitely buy this again. Better than Prop Cycle arcade from my teenage years and definitely the future of exercise
