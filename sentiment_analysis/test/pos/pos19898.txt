I bought this camera to monitor our new puppy while we are at work. This is a versatile camera that swivels and covers several angles. It has a fairly wide view, enabling me to see most of a room. The picture is very clear and it includes audio. Very good camera for the price!Lastly, you can get an app, which is easy to set up, and monitor this camera from your smartphone.ProsClearAudioSmallSwivelsLightweightMonitor on my iPhone (easily set up)ConsNo recording (it says this clearly: you can hook this up to a external hard drive if you need to store video).
