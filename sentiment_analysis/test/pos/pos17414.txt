Bought these for my nephew for Christmas. He's 11 now and old enough to pick out his gifts (thank goodness) this was his big gift this year I always get him 5-6 things for Christmas one big thing and a few smaller things he picks out. He's spoiled what can I say. Anyway he loves this. It was such a hit Christmas morning. For him to spend 2-3 hours on Christmas playing with these cars was a huge win. My brother in law loves these almost as much as he does. I'm most likely going to be buying the track and some add ons for his birthday in February. Sturdy little cars works great with his iPod and my BIL's iPhone. No issues connecting with the Bluetooth. They bought rechargeable batteries for the cars they expect to get so much usage out of them. My niece loves them too. I spent more on her ugg boots than this car set and she wishes I bought a set for her too. Her birthday is in mid January so it's coming soon. Maybe she can get the cars and he'll get the add on set
