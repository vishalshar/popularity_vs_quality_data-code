This feeder is just amazing!  I use it not only for feedings, but for giving treats too.  I have scheduled feedings, and also used the "feed now" option.  The web cam is also a great feature.  I get a text message and email letting me know that my girl has been fed, she is a 68 pound pit mix.  This was money well spent.
