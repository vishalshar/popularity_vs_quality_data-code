This is a great product. The hand lotion is thicker, but absorbs into hands well. It does not leave your hands feeling greasy. You can use this hand lotion on it's own, or with the Peter Lamas Spa Sensuals Rejuvenating Hand Cream (which is step 1 in their Spa Sensuals Hand Treatment line - both work great!). Peter Lamas products are effective.
