This is a great, affordable alarm system.  Really easy to install and setup in minutes.  No tools or complicated instructions.  The best part about this system is the customer support though.  Any time I had a question or needed help with something, there was someone there to help.  The response time was great and the advice was spot on.  There's an app that lets you monitor what's going on at your home and remotely turn the alarm on/off.  There's also an option to add friends or neighbors to your Security Circle, so they get a notification if an alarm goes off.  I used to pay an alarm company for a security system installed at my home and it required a 2 year contract and $40/month.  I feel just as safe with the Korner System and there are no monthly fees! I recommend this system. It would be great if they had cellular backup for when your wifi goes out but other than that, it's great!
