I love these products! The apples are crispy and naturally sweet tasting (the cinnamon is a bonus). The mangoes are chewy. The apricot I found to be a little sour and too chewy, but not unpleasant. These snacks are all natural and organic without additional sugar added. Fruits are naturally sweet so the sugar content in the nutrition box is from the  natural sweetness. Overall this is a great natural snack that satisfies my sweet tooth and diet requirements :-) The only downside is that the bags are small!!
