Original Date: 10/31/2015Short to the point Review:Do you drink coffee? Are you a coffee maniac/lover/drinker*? Do you feel like every energy product you've tried just doesn't work? Tired of being sluggish through the day? This product is what you NEED! I tried a sample of Vita Perk Energy and a few hours later I bought a month supply I was so impressed! Within no more than half an hour I was 'perked' up and getting things done that I normally am sluggish to accomplish. I just poured it into my coffee, stirred it and drank. There was no ill taste or any adverse taste about it.. just tasted like my normal coffee! I am thankful to have found this stuff because as a new mom finding this feels like I won the lottery or something LOL!(*- I think VitaPerk only markets this as putting it in your coffee but I am also going to try it in bottled water and will edit/update this to confirm or deny my hypothesis)Only 5 calories, NO ADVERSE TASTE! (Tastes just like your regular coffee) and WORKS QUICK.I love a product that actually works, not to mention the 15 extra vitamins and minerals added to it!The varieties are Energy(so far my favorite), Vanilla, Hazelnut, and Original of course.I also really like the perforated box too :DI know as a mom and new parent this is sooo helpful to me it was crazy how great it worked. I am not being paid to write this.. I am not getting anything in exchange for writing this.. I just love this and want to share with all the people out there slugging through their days too.. This is 100% my own honest opinions and my own words.-Lindsey Spencer xx
