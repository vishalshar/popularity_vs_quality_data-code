Ok, I agree with some of the reviews, it is a bit tricky to get working with Alexa. However, after about 15 min, I was able to get it going and it works great.Tips, You must add the "Skill" LIFX to Alexa, then you must authorize both Alexa and Lifx to work together (that is 2 different approvals) one through the LIFX app and one through the Alexa app (or online) I did have to authorize about 3 times on one to it complete. Lifx then showed up in "Device Links, Use Alexa to control cloud-connected devices on other services". You then need to click on the "Skill" LIFX and log in to you LIFX account. Then Alexa will be able to find the device. once all that is done, you are able to say "Alexa, Turn on Kitchen light" and it will work, or turn off, can change % of brightness. I have not found the right phrasing to change color yet without using the LIFX command (Alexa, tell LIFX to change kitchen color to Blue.) Since I currently only have 1 bulb, I have a simple IFTTT command. I say Alexa, Trigger bed time, and it will slowly dim the light over 30 seconds to give you time to walk to you bedroom not having to be in the dark (IFTTT has many more options for timing, color ect.)Also, if you only have it working with the "Alexa, tell LIFX to turn on kitchen light" you have some options to learn. You can say, Alexa, tell LIFX---- and then just stop talking. Alexa will then ask you some options of what you want to do with the LIFX item, and you can pick one of her suggestions, as she stays listening for you answer, you don't have to say Alexa again before completing the command.I have also found that when using the tell LIFX command it is very important how you say things.Alexa, tell LIFX kitchen light blue, does not normally work, butAlexa, tell LIFX to change the kitchen light to the color blue, will workAlthough they both say the same thing, it is a computer trying to understand what you want, and it is learning, and so to must we learn. I think of it a speaking to a child. if it does not really understand you, try to say it a different way. I often find that it is not that Alexa does not know what you said, more so she does not understand the command in the way you said it. In learning, i will use the app, to see what way I structured by question or command, and use similar format for new things (I have only had Alexa about a week, and only 1 connected item for a few hours but see you have to learn how to talk to her. Not sure if any of the books for sale really help with that)I love the Themes that are on it, was not expecting that (have not yet figured out how to change themes or effects with Alexa yet, but I have only had a few hours playing with it so far.
