I love it. Gorgeous mirror, lots of light and with a bonus power outlet. I can see every detail during my makeup application and even have an extra spot to plug in my flat iron, curling wand, phone charger etc. It's ridiculously convenient! I use it EVERY day and can't imagine my routine without it at this point. One con is that the lights do get a bit warm and I can feel the heat on my face, but it's not a huge issue. Upon receiving one of the bulbs was defective but Amazon CS was amazing and comped me for the price of a new bulb. This mirror is quite large and heavy! If it weren't for that it would have been an absolute breeze to put together. All you have to do is screw in the bulbs and attach the mirror to the base. Highly recommend. :)
