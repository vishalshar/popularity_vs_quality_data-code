The product is very light, and easy to adjust the size and shape.Shouldn't bother you at all as long as you keep your posture straight. You can customize the strength of vibration, time, angle and etc. so you can change everything as you wish. I thought it was cool how it keeps track of your posture throughout the day using the app.But, it doesn't come with the charger head. Only a micro USB (not USB-C) cable is included (identical to old Samsung/LG smartphone cables). So you will have to plug it into your computer or use your phone charger head when recharging.Overall, it's a good product to improve your posture and prevent forward head posture. Wish I knew this product earlier.
