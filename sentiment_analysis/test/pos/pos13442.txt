as soon as i got these cookies and opened and taste them i had to write a review.  I have severe food allergies tree nuts being the worst when i was tested. i have not had a chocolate chip cookie in years , I found Mrs. Thinster they were good but to thin for real flavor. i was a little skeptical about the taste there are great, good taste and i love that they use whole wheat they are good for you and taste great. I will definitely buy them again and again thank you Skeeter
