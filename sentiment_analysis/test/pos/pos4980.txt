I LOVE these coconut chips in the honey, simply toasted, and the chile.  However, the "chocolate" coconut chips seriously taste like they took the burned chips that over toasted and decided to package and sell them as chocolate.  I was definitely disappointed.  The others, however, I go through a bag a day. . . I think I've become addicted!
