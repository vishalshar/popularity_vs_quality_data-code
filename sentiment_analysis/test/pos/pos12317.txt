One week postpartum and 4 days in my Mamastrut... Ok, a few things. We had a csection, in the hospital the binder that they provided was to be worn as a "mini-skirt" in order to support the incision and pelvic areas. I used the measurements from the examples online and ordered myself a large. I am 5'7" and pre pregnancy was about 154lbs. A large is just right!The cons: The mama strut is barely long enough to cover my incision but it will have to do. My skin is a bit sensitive and the coarse elastic fabric has resulted in a rash where my stomach is squished over my incision. The shorts aren't stitched at the bottoms causing them to roll up when I lift my legs or pull on pants.The Pros:After my first day in the mama strut there was a huge improvement in the size of my still very there baby bump! 4 days in and I look more fat than pregnant. I love that there are shorts attached to this so I can comfortably wear my mama strut under a dress (once I figurebout how to stop the legs from rolling up. The seam is seen on the innER thigh, so when the shorts roll, the stitching rubs my thighs, doesn't feel good. It is convenient to have it all together to say the least. Not to mention that after the csection and tubal walking without the support of this thing is uncomfortable.I'll have to update this after a few more weeks but for now I am happy with my purchase, even if it was $135.00.
