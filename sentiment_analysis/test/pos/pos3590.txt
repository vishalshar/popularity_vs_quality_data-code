The Ecoqube C was easy to setup and worked effectively. I had a hard time getting the included basil seeds to grow so I bought some starter bacteria, Betta water conditioner, and a few water plants to place in the gravel. Four months later and my Betta, two Snails and Sea Sponge are thriving.I tried to get the included basil seeds to grow three separate times, then bought after market ones, still no luck. I finally had to buy a mint plant and secure it in the included reservoir with coconut lining to secure it. Tip for the owners, find a better plant medium or seeds for the quick start kit. This is a problem with most of your reviews.
