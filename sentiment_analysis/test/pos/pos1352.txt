After reading the reviews on Amazon and other sites, I decided to buy 3 units.  Installation was easy since I have a mechanical background.  The installation kit comes with a stud length gauge not mentioned and is helpful.  The black bent wire item was also helpful to hang the light while being wired.  One of my outlets had the mounting surface that was not recessed so I had to press the provided mounting bracket into the outlet so the light would mount flush.  Linking my phone with the light was easy and took a couple tries on some of the lights.  Updating the software was easy to do via the phone app but there was no "upload complete" so I just waited about 30 minutes to try to adjust the phone app settings and all was good.  I am using 75 watt equivalent LED bulbs (they recommend lower).  My one camera I have looking down and to the side and is not impacted by the higher light output but my other lights that aren't looking down as much do have some glare but I plan to add a light deflector so the light doesn't shine into the camera lense.  By the way, the small parts bag has an extra camera hood that isn't listed on the parts list.  The sensitivity setting works well and if the setting is high, heavy rain can set if off if the rain comes close to the sensor.  When the sensor detects motion, the recording captures about 10 seconds prior to activation which is great.  You can also turn off the LED indicator so the camera is more covert.  The phone app is great and provides plenty of control.  We are glad we made the purchase!
