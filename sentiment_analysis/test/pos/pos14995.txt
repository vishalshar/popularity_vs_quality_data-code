If you enjoy an effective, light-level exfolition that is top quality...then this is the scrub for you.  We have used Lamas products over the years and every product has been high-quality.  My husband is addicted to this scrub!  It is the only one he has used since 2007.  Like most good quality products, a little goes a long way - so good value.  He uses about 4 bottles/year.  Hopefully Lamas will continue making this scrub for many years to come!
