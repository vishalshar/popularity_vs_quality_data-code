I have to give it 5 stars because I ordered it not knowing my Nexus 7 was pre-2013 and did not have Slim Port capability.  It was my fault and I received a prompt refund when I returned it. Check first with [...] to find out if your phone or tablet is supported.  If it is not listed, this will not work.  .
