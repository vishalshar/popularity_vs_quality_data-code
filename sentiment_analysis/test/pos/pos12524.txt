There are distinctive pros and cons to this little speaker. It has great sound for being so small, it sits by our pool and the kids move it to where they like and I don't have to worry about wires, water getting on it or it dropping on the ground. I do like when it's connected to my phone and we are listening to the music, if I receive a text or a phone call, it alerts me. While it does connect to bluetooth, we have the Amazon Echo and would love for it to connect to that but they are both receivers of bluetooth, not transmitters so they won't connect. We have found it has a very nice range however, you cannot have anything in between the 2 devices. So, with being connected to the phone on the table by the pool, if the speaker is over on the deck and a person happens to stand between, you lose signal. And, about half the time, you have to disconnect and reconnect. This is a great little speaker that could use a few tweaks.
