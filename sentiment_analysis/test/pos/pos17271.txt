As other reviews have mentioned, the big challenge with the Jet is getting the updates installed so that you can get out and use it. I struggled with mine on 2 PCs and a Mac before finally calling Recon's Support center. It's a call center in Oregon and they are extremely friendly and helpful. They got me up a running, with a minimum of curse words on my part.The product itself does everything it claims. Tracks distance, speed, elevation, etc (note: if you want miles instead of km you need to set that on your Recon Engage account AND on the Jet). When you first put it on your face you think it's going to fall off with use. But after a sweaty run with sunscreen on my face, and a 2-hour ride in the rain, it never even started to come off.The Heads Up Display (HUD) took a little getting used to, but not nearly as much as I expected. You can totally customize the display and it doesn't seem to block a critical sector of your vision. Note: while the HUD doesn't seem to block much, the battery (left) and processor (right) will block peripheral vision to a degree...for cyclists this makes rear view mirrors a must...no more "over the shoulder glancing" if you're using the Jet.For me the Jet has two big advantages over bike computers, fitness trackers, stand-alone phone apps, etc. First, it will pair with your phone (iOS or Droid) and give you text/call alerts on the HUD, let you control your music player, etc. This is huge for folks who like to have their phone with them on workouts but don't want to fumble with digging it out, unlocking it and staring down at a screen. As of now, you cannot take phone calls or use voice commands/dictation with the Jet, but since it has both mic and speakers I'm hoping this will change with time. Second, for folks who have multiple bikes or both run and cycle, the Jet keeps you from needing multiple fitness trackers/computers since it uses GPS and goes on your face.Two bits of info after testing the Jet in cloudy western Oregon: I highly recommend the yellow "fog" lenses (sold separately), and if you're going to be out with the Jet longer than about 2.5 hours, an extra battery (also sold separately) will be valuable too. I know they say about 4 hours for battery life, but I think pairing with a phone reduces it somewhat. Regardless, I find this technology handy and exciting, and I think there is a lot of potential with the Jet...it's already become my favorite pair of glasses.
