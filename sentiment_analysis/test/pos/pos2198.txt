I had my Beats in-ear headphones for almost 3 years before one finally died. It broke my heart to leave the Beats brand, but I simply couldn't afford another pair of them at this time. I'm almost glad I couldn't! These have been a phenomenal -- possibly improved -- replacement! I also really wanted the rose gold color, which is really lovely. The sound is impeccable, and the design of the cloth-covered cord is a nice touch, making tangles a non-issue. I use these daily and am very pleased with them!
