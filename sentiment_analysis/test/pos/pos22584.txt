Great product the sound is amazing its rugged tough the battery last forever. I compaired this speaker with bose mini and brazen brv-x , bose and brazen are louder but the fugoos sound is much fuller the other two are muddier . I'll tell you this thing is weather proof ,I bought this for my boat and it doesn't disappiont sound great out there and getting it wet is no problem . If you want a all around speaker this is the one .
