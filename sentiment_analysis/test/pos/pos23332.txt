Bought this for my 3.5 yr old son. We got the orange 12in bike.He's average height and with the seat post all the way down he has both feet touching the ground almost flat. I raised it about 3/4 inch to help him pedal since his knees were coming up too high.So far it's been great and he's very happy with his bike.Pros:Great quality, all parts arrived in perfect condition.Has front hand brake, bell and water bottle holder.Good looking vs. other kiddo bikes which look more like toysCons:Wheel base length seems a bit short. The 12" looks really small with him on it.Seat seems durable but a bit small and not as cushy as I'd like.Gearing is slightly too tall. Riding on gravel, grass or even a slight inclince requires strong pedalling. Since this is for 3-4yr olds, a shorter gearing would have helped a lot.
