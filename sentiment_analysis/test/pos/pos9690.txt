I think the people that whine that these leak are putting them on wonky. They are super tight and I've had no problem.  I store my homemade almond milk in the mason jars and use these to pour it out.  It's so nice not to have to worry about the milk leaking down the side of the jar anymore.  Just ignore the people that say these leak (unless you're someone who has trouble threading the lids on jars).  I was worried since there were all these reviews about it leaking so I bought a single lid first instead of the four pack (which I bought later).  They're kind of pricey, but I think it's worth it.  I'm tired of buying cheap things that don't work so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these.
