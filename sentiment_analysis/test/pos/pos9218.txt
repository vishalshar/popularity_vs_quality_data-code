I just recenrtly started my 81 lb 6 yo Labrador Pit mix on Solid Gold, grain free. She eats the "Barking at the Moon" dry food with some canned food mixed into it. I bought this WAY cheaper on Amazon than my O'ahu pet food store...it's $3.79 a can. My dogs health has been SO much better since so I switched to the grain free.
