Love these vitamins!  I originally bought the Smarty Pants gummies for children for my kids.  They went bananas over them so I had to taste one to see what all the fuss was about and OMG - they are better than candy!  Seriously they are delicious. And they met all my requirements for vitamin/supplements. Now I have my husband hooked on them too.
