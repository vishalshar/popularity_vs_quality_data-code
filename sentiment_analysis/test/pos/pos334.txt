I have it installed on my fireX monitor. Installation was pretty simple and the setup was quick. My monitor's battery pack doesn't pop-out, so I had to force push the battery inside the monitor, was a bit tight but sat in perfectly. The info in the app is straight forward and quick tap on the location of monitor summarizes all battery status and all the other details. Easy to use hardware and software. Looking forward to buying more soon!
