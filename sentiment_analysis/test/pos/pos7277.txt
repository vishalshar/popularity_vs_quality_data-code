RFID Warning: the tile [might] significantly drop in connection range if used in a wallet with RFID protection. It has a range of about 3-15 feet before dropping connection, and will not reconnect until directly next to the wallet. Outside the wallet the range was normal. Placing the tile in the most exterior pocket (furthest from middle) gave me an average 15 feet of range to reconnect, which is better.On that note, I would suggest using a wallet without rfid protection, though the choice is yours.This may not be the same for you but just a heads up. I contacted support and hopefully I can get more info on thisBesides the RFID matter -It is bigger than the original (area wise) but thinner. Still, it was smaller than I expected it to be which was nice. It fits well in my wallet with just a slight bulge (I have a one-sided wallet so it makes sense). Overall no noticeable difference when in my pocket.Thank you Tile for this it's once again a great device that makes me feel safer handling my valuables
