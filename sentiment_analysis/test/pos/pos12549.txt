I recently moved to a new place and if it wasn't for the pebblebee honey I would have lost my keys. I had no where to put them, but it didn't matter since I could locate it with my phone or locate my phone with my keys. It could use an update on the android system, and once it gets that then it will receive a 5 star rating from me.
