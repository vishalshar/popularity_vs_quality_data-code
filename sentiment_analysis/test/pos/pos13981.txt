I am not a musician but I'm learning to play the guitar.  I've had issues tuning my two guitars (I have a nice acoustic and a used electric guitar) and its been frustrating.  This device worked perfectly right out of the box.  I was able to quickly tune my acoustic guitar easily and its never sounded so good.  The iPhone App works great and easily connected to the Roadie Tuner.  I was able to easily set up the profiles for the two guitars quickly with no problems.  Overall I really like the Roadie Tuner and it exceeded all my expectations.
