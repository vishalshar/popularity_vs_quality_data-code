Interested in buying Piper huh? Let me tell you this, Piper is very fun and interactive with its users. So many different missions and tasks. It comes with some wires,breadboard,stickers,tiny-mouse,buttons,lights,speaker and sense of awe. Piper is great for young kids to start getting familiar with technology and building. Piper also has one of the most fun/creative kids game. And that is Minecraft! Yes it is not the complete version of Minecraft but still fun. You need to have wifi in some way to update your Piper. Piper in its finished crate form can easily fit everything in the space that it has. I would give it a 4/5 because one bad thing about Piper is to short and leaving us want more of Piper and Piper Bot to go on new missions.
