This is one of the best fire starting solutions I have purchased.  While the tried and true method of tinder kindling and wood is the best and proper why to a successful fire.  When your in a pinch for time and need to get a fire going fast this product is a Go To solution.  Stored in its own waterproof bag and its ability to even light even when placed on wet ground this product is a great add to your emergency kit, backpack or bug out bag.
