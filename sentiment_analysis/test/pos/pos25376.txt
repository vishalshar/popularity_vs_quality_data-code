We have 2 cats in a small apartment. I would say 5 stars for the litter box. 5 stars for the blue litter. 2 stars for the Clear.The litter box works perfectly. The litter box always appears clear & clean to me. My cats had no problems with it, even from the start.However, from using it, I learned that the only way this box is cost effective is to use  the perfumed/dyed crystals. Basically, this is because the system clears the litter box wonderfully, but since the litter doesn't clump, it won't clear the cat pee away, so unless you get the perfume/dyed crystals, you're going to smell the litter box very quickly.Basically, I started with the blue crystals that came with the litter box. Everything worked great. The trap was actually full before the crystals even started to smell. I just used the litter scoop to clean it out and used the crystals for the full recommended window for 2 cats. I figured getting 1 3-pack a month would be more than enough.However, I prefer dye free products, so when I started a monthly subscription for my refill, I chose the 3-pack in Clear. Bad decision. The apartment reeked of cat pee in less than a week, and the crystals were all already yellow/brown. I had to use febreeze in the litter room just to stretch the 3 pack over the month until my next subscription delivery (which I changed back to the blue crystals). If I were to continue to use the clear, I would need to go through at least 4 trays a month, which would be about $60 a month for litter?? No way.To summarize, this system is awesome, especially compared to much higher costing auto-litter boxes, but in a multi-cat household, you're probably going to need the perfumed crystals to make it worth it.
