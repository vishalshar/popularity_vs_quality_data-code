There's allot to be said about these ear buds. Overall, I've really come to love them after getting used to them. The fit is pretty good with lots of options. I went a step further and jacked on a pair of Klipsch double flange inserts onto the Bragi's by trimming off their insert. It definitely increased the volume and made the sound quality stand out with better isolation and because it's what I'm use to it feels a little more secure when I'm running/ biking, but anyone who doesn't like buds that fit deep into the ear will find my config less comfy. The inserts that come with the Bragi are probably sufficient for many. I used hem for a few days and was quite surprised they never dropped out even though I feared and felt like they might. They are quite good. I just like a tight seal. The downside is that they won't fit into the charging case with the klipsch double flange inserts and you'll have to pop the inserts off before you charge them . Not really perfect. But I put up with it.Small update. I noticed if you want to use the fitness tracker or the app features, in addition to music. Connect the app first. Then go to the music app. It seems the app will sometimes have trouble connecting to the dash's if Music connects first or at least if you start using music before you open the Bragi app.Still enjoying these things! More and more as I get used to the little quirks.Also. Don't be afraid to email technical support. They respond quite quickly and have been helpful so far. It took a little while to get used to the pairing process but once you have it set up, DON'T GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AGAIN. Don't long tap the left or right bud. You did it once. Generally, there's no need to do it again. It seems to cause more problems. Just pop the Bragis into your ear and let them do the rest. They should just connect once the sensors make contact with your ears. It's super simple and has worked without the fuss for a while now. Sometimes they still get wonky and if you drop them into the charger for a sec and let them reset, you can pop them back in your ears and it will almost always work. It's been allot easier than when I would try to pair it through my iPhone control panel (settings). It was painful at first, but once I started trusting the buds to do their own thing they just work as soon as I pop them in my ears.The workout sensors are great. I have never owned a fitness tracker before so I have no frame of reference, but I can at least i can see from day to day how my efforts compare. Waterproof was not a feature I thought would be handy, but it is. Been in the pool a few times. Some people would probably prefer a dedicated tracker, but anyone who wears buds when they run, bike, board or swim will appreciate the form factor and not wearing several devices. I hope they add a "meditation" or relax function to the tracker. Made my suggestion to the devs. Seems like an obvious fit for ear buds, music & meditation.Download the app. It's essential in many ways not the least of which are handing off the data to the iOS health app and setting the max volume. Now that I trust the buds more and have learned the touch commands I don't go into the app as often. Also. Update them and have patience. The update is a long process. I couldn't get it to work connected to my computer (although it think I just lost patience) so I downloaded the update and did it "manually". It still took forever. Probably almost an hour. That wasn't fun. But eventually the lights started pulsing in synch and it worked.Bluetooth range is quite good with my iPhone and I don't need an arm band. If you drop them in your pocket and turn your head to the left you might experience the drop out others are talking about, but that will be the case for many BT buds. Face it, it's still early in the game. Overall the range is quite good if it's unobstructed. 20 feet. Maybe a little more. I drop my phone in my backpack when I bike into work and experience zero dropouts. Around walls is an obvious no go, but that's not to say it won't work every time. Just know that BT has its limits.The touch controls took a little time to learn but once you have them for a while it becomes quite intuitive. For starters, right bud controls the music, left controls fitness and audio transparency. Take a quick look at the manual or the quick reference guide in the app under the help menu. Most of the gestures are obvious. A couple take a day or two to get used to.Audio transparency is pretty cool. Nice innovation, it still needs some work, but I'm getting used to it. It's annoying in loud environments or in windy conditions but in a quiet office where you don't want to be completely tuned out because your boss might be around it seems to be handy. I also use it to stay aware of traffic but the wind noise from a high speed bike run makes it unuseable. Maybe a way to set the mix in the app would be an improvement. I also suggested the option of adding "baffles" that one could drop into the microphone holes. Similar to what Weston does for their buds to "attenuate" and "tune" the sound. In this case it would be like a wind sock on the mic.The sound quality is quite good. My go to wired buds have been klipsch and westone. I'd say these are comparable to the westone's lower end models, not quite as good as the klipsch. They're still good enough to make me dance when the bass bumps and no one is looking. They are plenty loud, but lacking a perfect seal is what drove me to the double flange retrofit. Better isolation helped with volume. Depends on what you are used to. With a perfect seal. Boom! They are jammin. You might think about either going with a flat EQ if you want pure loudness, but I have to say at max volume and a good electronic, bass or loudness EQ the bass does stand out a bit better. I'm a purist and never use EQ, but with these guys, I find making adjustments for the surroundings and level of output can really help with overall enjoyment. Again I'd generally recommend going flat, but do know that sometimes a little EQ can be the better option  depending on your circumstances.Battery life is quite good. A few hours per charge and several charges from the charger as advertised, but make sure when you are done with them that they go right back into the box. Again this seems to not only "reset" them but it also tells them to stop trying to connect to your mobile, in which case they will run down without you realizing it since it's constantly pinging your mobile. Quick tip regarding the case. It's magnetized so when you drop the buds in make sure they click into place and the lights start pulsing. It can be tricky getting them in perfectly and can fool you easily at first, but once you get used to letting the magnets snap them into place, it'll be a no brainer.I think most of the harsh reviews are due to users who wanted them to work perfectly right away, but these buds are unique. You do have to get used to how THEY work. Once you do, I think most of you will really like them. I was worried at first myself, but after a couple of weeks I find it hard to want to use my go to  Klipsc wired buds despite the couple of things wires still do better. I wouldn't go back to cords and I would definitely want to have an activity tracker in place as well. It's just too good to have one device to do it allIn a convenient easy to wear (your wearing buds already) package.
