I've only had it one day, but I'm loving it so far! And even with my apple phone, I am able to voice reply to texts using my watch! The Bluetooth connection is great so far. I can go 2 rooms away from my phone and I don't loose connection, even on a different floor. I do loose connection if I go all the way to the opposite side of the house, but it relinks itself as soon as I'm back in range without me doing a thing. I can control my music (including Pandora) from the watch. I can read the screen perfectly indoors or out - haven't needed the backlight at all yet.I spent a lot of time reading reviews on smart watches and was having a difficult time choosing between Moto 360 2nd gen and the pebble round in rose gold. I wanted something that didn't just work great, but also looked great! My wrists are so small that the pebble time round really seemed to be my only option after trying the watches on.I like the simplicity of the pebble. (If you are someone that likes high tech and lots of extras, you might want a different smartwatch, but this one does seem to have all you need). It's really easy to navigate through the app options, it counts steps, tracks sleep, gives me the weather, shows me my calendar appointments, tells me who is calling, shows texts and let's me respond, sets silent/vibrating alarms, has lots of watch face options, etc.The watch looks great, but the watch strap looks kind of cheap. I'm happy it uses quick release bands, because I'm definitely going to be replacing this band, I just wish there were more quick release watch band options available in the 14mm size. I took one star off on my rating just because the watch band is such low quality and I wouldn't mind so much if pebble gave me more watch band options to upgrade to, but there is not much of a selection.So overall I love it! Can't wait to track my sleep tonight and all my steps tomorrow! Already ordered a sports watch band for when I work out and I love that the watch is water resistant so I don't need to worry about sweat or rain!
