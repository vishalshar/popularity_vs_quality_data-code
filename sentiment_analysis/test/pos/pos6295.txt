I ordered this at the beginning of April and used it every day for 3 months, training my English Springer Spaniel puppy. It was light enough for her to easily drag around, doesn't tangle easily and is easy to clean if hauled through mud. I had a problem with the brass clasp, emailed a polite inquiry to SportDog and received an immediate response. They sent me a new check cord along with a prepaid return label to send the old one back. Great customer service by SportDog.
