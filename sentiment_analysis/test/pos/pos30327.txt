The Nextbit Robin is the phone that I have been waiting years for. It has a unique design, a clean version of Android with no bloatware, an easily unlockable bootloader, and powerful hardware for an outstanding price.This phone is stunningly snappy. There is no transition time between multitasking, and apps open immediately.The fingerprint sensor placement is perfect, and able to have many different prints saved, making it convenient for varying grip styles.The only negatives are;1) The battery life: you would probably have trouble keeping a charge for more than a day with average use. If you watch YouTube videos for more than 4 hours or so, it will reach 0%.2) Heat: using the device while plugged in, or doing intensive tasks will generate a fair amount of heat. Though it doesn't reach dangerous levels.This is in my opinion the first phone to come around that is made by a company that actually cares about the customers.
