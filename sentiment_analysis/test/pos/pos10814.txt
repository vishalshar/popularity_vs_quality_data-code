Highly recommend this product! It does a great job accurately tracking my steps and general health. I bought it from Amazon because it was a little bit cheaper than from the manufacturer's website.I did have a random issue with this LEAF, as stopped working with no warning. I contact Bellabeat support and they were probably the best customer service I've ever dealt with (and for some reason, I end up dealing with many different companies). They were sooo helpful and when the problem was not resolved, they sent me a brand new LEAF set at no charge to me. I didn't even have to send the old one back. The new one is working great and I love it. I get lots of comments on it and people frequently ask what it is or means, which of course, I'm happy to explain.If you're looking for a classy alternative to the FitBit or other health tracker, this is definitely worth your money. With such great customer service, it really is hard to go wrong! If you have questions about it or what it does, feel free to ask! I love sharing this great find.
