Oh man, this thing is FUN! I have not had so much fun in YEARS! I could not stop riding it around my apartment complex! And the shipping was FAST, I believe i got it in 2-3 days ( maybe because it was shipped in CA )One thing that can be improved that I found out right away is the lack of reflectors ( it has one reflective sticker ) , my neighbor almost ran me over because it was dark and he told me that he did not see me since there are no headlights / reflectors of any kind. Obviously this inst a big deal but I am thinking of attaching my own reflectors/blinkers of some kind.Also it looks like 200 model does not have USB plug to charge your phone etc, which honestly I don't care about, however previous model 100 had one installed. Why did you guys remove it? Anyway, after I ride it more I will maybe come back and update my review.UPDATE 2.8.2016 == After riding it for quite some time I think one thing that could be improved is suspension. Hitting even small bumps is not fun. I learned to kind of jump over the bumps with front wheel though. I ride mostly on sidewalks however if you ride only on road its not an issue.UPDATE 12.15.2016 == So almost a year passed since my last update and I decided to come back and add a small update. So far I experienced ZERO issues! I am very impressed with the product quality and would highly recommend to everyone. PS i am in no way paid by the manufacturer - I simply enjoy this scooter and wanted to leave feedback again. Cheers!
