I bought the Piper computer kit for my 10 year old.  He love it and won't put it down.  All of his friends that have seen it want one and their parents do as well.  Best $300.00 I've ever spent on my kid.  He's learning and having fun.  If there are upgrades or add ons, I would happily buy them.  The funny thing is my 21 year old neighbor who is in the Coast Gaurd Academy came over to visit.  He recognized the computer board and said that's what he's learning on in the academy.  My son felt proud that the military is using a similar product to teach.
