Petcube rocks!!!! Set up is super easy and app is super easy to use!! I got Petcube to see if it helps my doggy from being bored and I also wanted to see what she's up to when I'm not at home. I didn't think she would love laser part but laser is her FAV part. I played with her for 30mins+ with the laser while I was away (See my picture for my cute baby chasing around the laser haha). I just want to say thank you Petcube for making my baby Bear happy and comfort me while I'm away from her!
