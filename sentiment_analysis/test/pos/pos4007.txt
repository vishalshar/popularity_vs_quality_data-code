I bought this chair for my husband as his old one was basically falling apart.  It is night and day from his old one.  First and most importantly it provides a lumbar support.  He has had chronic back problems and while he has tried to use various options to support his back it was always falling into the wrong spot. This lumbar cushion is adjustable and puts the support in the proper area.  Second, the height adjustment along with the arm rests allows him to sit back in the chair while typing.  No slouching required.  His favorite parts are the adjustable chair back and sporty design.  He can get into the most comfortable position possible.  Overall it is a great success.  It did take both of us to lift the chair onto the pedestal, but that is a minor detail.
