Very useful when you travel and need to eat breakfast in your hotel room.+ the set is very sturdy+ knife cuts and seems to be holding up (if you don't cut anything too hard - cuts steak and pizza)+ spoon is good size for yogurt and soup alike+ has little tooth pick included+ travel case keeps the set in good condition (maybe a little big)+ very light+ so far no TSA issues+ little beer opener is built into knifeIf you found this review helpful, please click on the "helpful" button below.
