I have two elderly rescues and my 13 year old chow thinks these are the highlight of her year!  She lets me know that it's time for salmon jerky every single night.  She is also missing almost all of her teeth and can still gum these and enjoy them without hurting her gums.  Lastly, other jerkies tend to really upset her stomach and these don't do that at all.  I buy a bag about once every three weeks.
