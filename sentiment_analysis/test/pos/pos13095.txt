Ok, I bought this for a seasonal rental property. The price was good and it looked nice. Well, this unit sounds fine. Actually it sounds much better then expected. We had it playing in our kitchen to check it out and found us enjoying the music. Around the corner is a much, much more expensive unit if it did not sound pleasing. I recommend this for similar situations.
