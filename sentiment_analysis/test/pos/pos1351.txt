Have had ours up for a month. Really happy with it. Not one false alarm, but turns on for all visitors and package deliveries. Light coming on makes night viewing simple. Two way intercom is understandable, if not great quality. Like that we can start video/light on demand from app, doesn't require motion trigger each time. Viewing angle is better than Video doorbells. There's a mild fisheye effect, but video quality is fine for this purpose. Just make sure you have a good wifi signal in the place where you'll put it.
