Not perfect. If it was perfect, the outdoor module would be waterproof. i solved that by putting in inside a Ambient Weather solar shield and hanging in in a tree. Doing this has given me very accurate temperature readings and it's still protected from the elements. I'm including a photo of the sensor in the shield.The biggest PRO for me is that I can get realtime temperature and humidity both inside and outside my home while I am away.The biggest CON is that there is no way to check these things at home without opening the app on my iPhone. It would be nice if you could have some kind of wireless display option.Overall, I am very pleased with both the look and accuracy of the Netatmo.
