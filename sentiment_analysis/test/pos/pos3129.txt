These things are amazing. They're a little pricey in my opinion but worth EVERY penny. I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to get them. They are a million times better than traditional mason jar lids. The metal mason jar lids are a pain to clean, they are messy because they're in two pieces and they rust. These are mess free, they fit well on the mason jar, open and close easily. Definitely recommend if you use mason jars regularly to make sauces or dressings!
