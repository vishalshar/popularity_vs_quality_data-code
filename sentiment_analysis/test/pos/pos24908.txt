While Anki Overdrive products are very pricey they at least do what they are supposed to to.  The speed expansion track set doesn't do anything special to make the cars go faster other than provide a longer straight road for the cars so that they are able to gain speed on the straightaway.  There are only two pieces of track included which doesn't seem like much when you open it but my son was happy with the amount of possibilities that adding just two pieces created in his track making ability and the cars were able to reach greater speeds.
