At first I was a little skeptical, but now I am a believer. You definitely feel this one, and even though it is not mentioned, it definitely helped me concentrate in the earlier morning hours. While in the gym, I noticed I was running longer, and lifting weights a bit more before hitting my peak and getting winded. While working in the office, i was power walking up and down four flights of stairs with a pep to my step, and barely working up a sweat. (And staying focused!)Taste: Can definitely tell it is Stevia sweetened, but it is hardly overpowering. You definitely taste the mixture of the licorice, rose hip, and ginseng as well, and helps make it a very smooth drink. (Both hot or cooled down) Morning or afternoon; you cant go wrong with this one. Give it at try!
