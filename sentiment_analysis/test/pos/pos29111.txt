Works great as long as you have proper expectations. I use these to keep track of various items. I stuck one to my laptop, one on my camera bag, another on product samples, etc. I have a tendency to leave things in random places in my house or office, so it helps me keep track of that bag of product samples I left in the meeting room across the office.
