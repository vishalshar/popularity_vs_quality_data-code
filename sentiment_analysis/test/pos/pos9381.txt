LOVE LOVE LOVE this petcube! Was a little challenging to set up (my wifi dropped it a couple times), but after reconnecting 4 times, it now stays  connected. My kitten is 7 months old and quite mischievous. Keeping an eye on him & scolding him when I see him doing something he shouldn't be doing is priceless!! I found putting the cube down low (on the bottom shelf of a side table next to the sofa) gives a less distorted view & gives me privacy.  I highly recommend.
