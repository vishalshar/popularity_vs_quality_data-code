Got the red one. Loved the look and feel of the headset in my hands. It came in a soft leather case that is pretty convenient and portable for hitting the road. The wifi connection setup was a bit complicated, and took me a while to figure out. Watched a movie with it. Really enjoyed the high resolution and clear pictures. Quite a refreshing feel compared to some of the other VR headsets with much lower resolution. Focus can be adjusted for someone like me who wears prescription glasses. Appreciated that. Sound was awesome. Overall, good temporary getaway from it all.
