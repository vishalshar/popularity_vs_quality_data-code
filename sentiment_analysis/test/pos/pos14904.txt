Three mature-to-senior cats.  One is finicky, and another throws up everything (sooner or later).  I've tried Wellness, many Science Diets, Spot's Stew, Blue Buffalo, Wellness, and the list goes on.  Until Solid Gold, I did have good luck, with the sensitive-tummy tom, offering Royal Canin Special.  But the picky princess would have no part, so this wasn't a complete success.  All three seem to like the taste of the Solid Gold for older cats. The kibbles are easy to chew [another problem I'd had with other dry food- tender teeth and gums].  The healthy ingredients are really important to me.  Especially the line-up of urinary-health ingredients. Yes, one of my cats has had urinary issues, which is who I actually bought the Solid Gold for.  This is not Purina-Cat-Chow cheap; but it is less than many "natural-based" cat foods.  We're on our 4th bag, and all seem happy and healthy!
