We used this after running a marathon because a) we didn't have any place to shower afterwards and b) didn't have time to shower because we had to catch a flight.  It does a great job of removing all the sweat and salt from your body without drying your skin out or leaving a sticky/filmy residue.  Quite the opposite actually, it left your skin soft and fragrance free.  I highly recommend this product.
