LOVE these! My daughter saw these on a you tube channel for someone and just had to have them. They are seriously awesome. There are 3 ways to wear them- the normal way, a loose fit way, and a tighter way. Perfect for kids to just slip shoes on and great for adults who may just want a slip on pair or those who struggle to tie shoes. They are rubber and easy to use. The instructions are in the package and show you how to attach them.
