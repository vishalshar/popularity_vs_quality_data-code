Ive been looking for a new office chair for sometime now, and Im so glad I didnt buy the first one I saw, most of these chairs are designed for gamers and have neon bright colors that dont go with my work space. I purchased the RapidX Ferrino chair, the blue on black, goes perfectly with my office. The design details definitely set this chair above a traditional black office chair; the diamond pattern looks amazing. Ive been testing the chair both with and without the neck and lumbar pillows, Im using it mostly without but having the option is a great feature. I spend more time than Id like sitting and this chair makes it easy to sit comfortably all day! Arm rests, back, and seat height are easy to adjust and add to the comfort.The chair was easy to assemble; it took me about an hour.  I highly recommend watching the video because it goes through the whole process, Im sure it saved me from making mistakes. My son helped me, which was good because he did the heavy lifting.I bought this chair because I like the way it looks; all the features that add to the comfort are added bonuses. Overall Im very satisfied with my purchase.
