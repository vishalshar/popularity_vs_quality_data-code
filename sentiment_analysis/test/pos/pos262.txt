The technology built into these wireless headphone is just amazing. My expectations of these were very high and over all they have lived up to it.Phone / music player - pairing is simple and when u put them in your ears they pair most of the time. The few times they have not I put them back in the charger for a few seconds and then they pair. The sound quality is excellent for me and there was lots of reviews about them being too quite, the update definitely fixed that. The right earphone operates music and phone and has a built in MP3 player, which was very easy to load - plug the charger with the earphones into the computer and the computer reads it as a drive, inside the drive is a folder with playlists, just drag and drop the songs in. If they had iTunes integration it would be much easier.The left earphone is sports trading and heart rate, I wear a Microsoft band 2 and the earphone heart rate matched very closely. The tapS to activate is very simple and every 5 minutes you get a run review. I have used the cycling and running but not the swimming yet. There is also on this side is the transparency function. When on it activates the external Mike to hear what is going on around you. I found it very noisy (wind noise) for running and cycling but when talking to people it worked very well.These are the best fitting earphone I have every had, I have always had difficulty getting earphone to stay in, the Bragi's have never fallen out and are very comfortable. Charging is a breeze, they click in to the charge very well. The charger is a bit big, but looks good and is very well made. Charging is quick and the carry case provides a number of refills before it needs charging. Because when you are not using them they sit in the charger they are alway charged and so far I have not had them go flat when hiking or running, unlike my other wireless earphones.Would strongly recommend them to anyone looking for truely wireless earphones
