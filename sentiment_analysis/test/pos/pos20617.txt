Positive:-Small, light and thin in size and weight.-Easy to activate and "claim" via the app.-Good sound-level on the alarms that can be adjusted.-I like that you can choose which alarm to use and different ways to locate the missing item. Even if you should lose your phone or it's stolen, you can still activate the alarm for your lost item connected to the Honey, via log in to your account via browser on another phone or laptop.-You can change batteries when needed and an item to unlock the battery-case is included.-you can activate an alarm on the app to remind you to bring the forgotten item when you leave the set perimeter.-the app and the Honey actually register eachother in my home despite surroundings/buildingmaterials like cement etc that likely can interrupt the signals to weaken them.-you don't have to constantly activate the app via internet or bluetooth, only when you need to, so it doesn't constantly drain phonebattery. So therefore, drains less battery than most apps depending on how you use it.Negative:-signals can weaken slightly by surroundings.-activation of app via internet and bluetooth does use extra phonebattery.-boring colour.
