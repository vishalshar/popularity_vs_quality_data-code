These sheets are awesome. Easy to care for (machine washable). Makes changing a crib sheet SUPER easy and quick. For me, it's worth the price for the convenience and time saving. If you have a waterproof mattress, I'd recommend just getting a flat, absorbent flannel mattress cover to go underneath and change that out when leaks happen. The under sheet will absorb and prevent pooling on top of the waterproof mattress.
