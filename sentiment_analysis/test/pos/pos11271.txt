I love this product as much as my Lock Laces.  The Hickies worked particularly well with my tennis shoes that had 6 eyeholes on each side, especially since I have a wide foot, and had to adjust them for Wide fit.  The Wide adjustment did not work too good on my tennis shoes with 5 eyeholes on each side. The Hickies look cool and I get people asking me about them.
