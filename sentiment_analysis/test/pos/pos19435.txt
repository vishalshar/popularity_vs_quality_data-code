Have used a number of self massage products over the years to ease the knots in my back that come about from golf, tennis and just every day stress. This product is by far the best that I have used. Love that it keeps the balls in place. I especially love the instructional videos that help me use the product correctly. I had a question that I emailed to the inventor. His reply was almost immediate. I purchased the entire body system here at Amazon. For me, it is worth every penny.
