Earlier this year I was at an art studio and got to play with a couple generic (Chinese knockoff) 3D pens. The concept was cool but the pens... sucked. Decided to go all in for the 3Doodler because it's the original one.Compared to the others I've used, the build quality on this is far superior. Feels tight and thoughtfully designed. Instructions are written by a native English speaker (looks like it's actually a US based company) and easy to understand.As for the doodling, it took me about 5 minutes to fully get used to the pacing and arm motions. It's akin to watercolor painting as opposed to oil, because of the quick drying/hardening time with the plastic. After that it was smooth sailing.Be sure to read the instructions thoughly as they go into really great detail about the different types of plastic, speeds, heat settings... there's really so many combos of how you can use this. So far I've done some 2D, 3D doodles and even fixed one of my fraying iPhone chargers. As a test, I tried to see how long I could make a line going straight up into the air. I got it to roughly 12" without tipping over. Going to get one for the nephew for xmas this year, as it's a great departure from being chained to a phone or tablet.
