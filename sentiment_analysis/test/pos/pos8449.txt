A friend told me about these "Hickies" b/c I am a kindergarten teacher.  I ordered a pair for my son and they have held up great, keep his shoes on his feet, and prevent me from tying his shoes every five seconds OR pulling out double/triple knots each day.  I now recommend this product to ALL of my kindergarten parents.
