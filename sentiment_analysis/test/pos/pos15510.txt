My son is allergic to nuts (mild- not severe) and we thought this would be a good safe option. It does have a warning that it may contain tree nuts as it's processed in the facility. We haven't experienced any problems. Again, his allergy is mild so it may not be okay for everyone.As far as taste, he and my daughter love them. It is a nice little treat when you don't want to make homemade cookies and as far as packaged cookies, they taste really great.
