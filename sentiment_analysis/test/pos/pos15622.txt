I almost didn't buy the pencil because of the reviews I saw about the stylus tips. After doing research on other stylus options, I went ahead and bought it anyways because I have been wanting it for almost a year. The tip is fine, you just have to be gentle with it. It's worth the smooth writing it provides on the screen. Everything works fine and I'm not sure why there are bad reviews and send backs for the tip purpose, they must have been writing rather hard. If you've been wanting this stylus, I strongly recommend it. I love it and it works amazing.
