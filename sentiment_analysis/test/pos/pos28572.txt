During hours or searching and reading up on devices to control lights/wifi/dimmer etc. I landed on Plum.  These do not need Vera or such.  Yes a bit more cost, but so far I am VERY pleased with them.  I ended up with 12, for different areas of my home inside, and operating exterior lights.  My home is new, and all my lighting is LED, from cans, to pendants and chandeliers and they work seamlessly.  One of the things that is important was ease of locations.  I had to make a few of my multi switch locations dead, as to not need a Plum for each location.  Which is fine, as I use my iPhone for these, and the app works great.  I did have my Professional electrician install them, and it took him only minutes per location.  By the time he was done with one, I already had the previous one added to my phone, which barely took a minute to do.  And worked perfectly. I look forward to updated from Plum and seeing what else these switches can do.  If I sell my home, which I will, I will take these bad boys out and with me to the next home!One thing I enjoy is the Scenes option, to set and adjust all the lights for a movie, entertaining etc.  I do hate that you can't push one button on the app to have all the lights turn off at once, or maybe you can, I will call customer care.  Also the ability to adjust the light color, and the timing of the light on the switch has been the most fun option.  The one in my master will come on if I get up in the middle of the night, and will stay on long enough for me to get back in bed.  The blue is my favorite.  It is super sensitive to movement, as it will at times pop on a second as I move around in bed.  But it is fine, as I keep my room in total black out.
