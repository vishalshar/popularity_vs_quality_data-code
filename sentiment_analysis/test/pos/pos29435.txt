I couldn't wait to open my Petcube and get it set up. The device is very sleek and fits well with my decor. Set up was easy and the only tricky part was figuring out the best place and angle to set it up. I love being able to see my dog while I'm at work. Now I can check on her and know that she isn't moping around and getting into trouble. :-)
