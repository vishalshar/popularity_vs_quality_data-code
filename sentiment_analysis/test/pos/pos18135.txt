Does as it says. Very easy to install. Much smaller than the pictures make it out to be (which is a good thing).The only thing that disappointed me about the product is the fact that you can't customize WHEN a guest can use their code. Once the guests have the code it's 24/7 access until you take it away. I wanted to have guests only have daytime access.
