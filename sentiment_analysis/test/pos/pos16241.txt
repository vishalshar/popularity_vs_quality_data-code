I bought 3 for me & a few young family members. I tried it out and it's pretty darn loud and WILL draw attention if you are near people. That's why I bought these. If anything, it will help alert those around you if you need help and I would hope it would scare off anyone trying to attack.  I tried it out in my living room around my three little dogs and although they found the sound a bit upsetting, it did not make them run away or leave the room. So i don't think this would help if a dog were trying to attack. Maybe my dogs just love me too much to tuck tail and run :)  .. who knows.  I feel it's worth the sale price they are asking.
