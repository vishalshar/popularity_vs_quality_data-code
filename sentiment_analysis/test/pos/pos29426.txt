Unbelievably fun.  Only negative I can state is I wish the cars would magically return to the starting line after a race.  You really need more than 2 cars though and the cars are a bit pricey.  Besides that I'm happy I bought this and will definitely be purchasing the Anki Overdrive set when it comes out along with additional cars and track parts.  Extremely fun for kids and adults.
