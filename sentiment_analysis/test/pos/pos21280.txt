Silky soft skin after bath, but only until next washing. I'm trying to figure out how much to put in the bath, since bag doesn't say, but I found half of the bag gives good results. That leaves only 2 baths per bag, and reusing the seaweed didn't prove to do much actually...this does not smell bad, but the net u put it in broke twice on me now.
