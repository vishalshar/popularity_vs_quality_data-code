This is my first gaming headset purchase.  I'm the gamer that usually uses the headset included in the system.  This definitely was worth every dollar so far.  I've been playing Overwatch, Destiny and The Division with these things on and have not had a complaint on my mic picking up every background noise or me being too softly spoken in chat.  Pretty comfortable and being wireless on the PS4 is so nice.  I haven't tried them on the Xbox One yet but I'm sure I'll have no issues there as well.  Also looking forward to using this on the PC.
