I have a portable oxengiater, I was short an hour for my travel time. At a loss I called the company who suggested that that I buy a battery for 325. I was not happy with that idea as I am renting the machine and felt that could change, like everything does.  So I started looking for something like a battery pack. I was checking the battery  cosst on amazon when up poped the Charge tech 27000. with mucfch caution and checking with an electrion friend I decied to get it. My thought was if it didn't work I could use it for other things like phone pad computer.  Well Guess what it works I an thirlled not only did I save money but I can do what I wanted it for plus. I am a happy camper thanks amazon and charge tech, By the way the tech people are great too.
