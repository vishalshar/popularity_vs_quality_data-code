Replaced a Hunter 12-Zone Pro C with a 2nd Gen Rachio with the outdoor enclosure.  I'm in IT and I love the ability to schedule, run and do everything landscape irrigation from my phone or the web.  I'm using fixed schedules right now, since we're a few days away from an app upgrade which replaced flex schedules with a quasi-fixed/flex.  This thing is awesome, get one now!  In terms of cost, I paid $275 for the 16-zone controller with the enclosure.  Between the rebate I'm receiving for $145 and the eBay sale of my Hunter Pro-C, the Rachio only cost $80 out of pocket.I used a pigtail to plug my Rachio into a GFCI outlet near my pool pad.  So if you are not hardwiring, I'd recommend the following parts for the cleanest install:Strain Relief (also seals the plug port):1. Home Depot - Halex 1/2 in. ACC Non-Metallic Strain Relief Cord Connector / $1.98 ORThe Hillman Group 58246  0.875 Diameter  Round Strain Relief Bushing, 5-Pack2.Â 18 AWG 3 Prong AC Power Cord, Pigtail (Open End), 10 Amp Max, 6 ftMy next project is to get exact precipitation rates using catch cans (I ordered the orbit 12 catch can set on Amazon) for my various zones so I have close to exact water usage numbers and moisture level data.I love this thing.  And I'm glad I waited for the Gen 2 system!
