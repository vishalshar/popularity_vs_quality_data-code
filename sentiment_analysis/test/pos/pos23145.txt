I was so tired of the mold build up in my other bottles that I couldn't reach to clean either because the opening on the bottle was too narrow for a bottle brush or the bottle was too tall and the brush couldn't get to the bottom. If I get a bottle sitting with a little water on accident for motored than a day, it seemed a spore would take hold and I had a problem even the dishwasher couldn't fix. The Clean Bottle is perfect and solves all those issues. I haven't had any problems. The bottle openings are plenty wide, I can access the bottom of the bottle since the bottom comes off and I haven't seen any mold at all. The bottle also holds tons of water so I'm not have to constantly fill it up at work. I have had tons of complements too since the design of the bottle is unique.  The handle makes it easy to just grab and go. I'm very pleased with my Clean Bottle overall. No complaints.
