The reishi mushroom is incredible. I came into this a little skeptical. I am not a huge fan of mushrooms but love the ideas of ayurveda. The tea is super bitter (even with honey), but it is totally worth it. It relaxed my muscles and helped give me one of the best nights of sleep I have had in a long time.
