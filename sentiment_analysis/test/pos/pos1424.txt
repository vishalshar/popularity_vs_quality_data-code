I have pretty bad anxiety, so I decided to order the Spire to help keep track of my breathing.  More out of curiosity than anything else.  Once I received it, I set it to notify my by buzzing when my breathing became tense.  I quickly found out all of the triggers for some of my tension.  After buzzing, I could quickly focus my attention on my breathing and take a few breaths to bring me back to a relaxed state.  It has been very beneficial to me by adding to my awareness.  It is another tool I now use everyday in a addition to meditation and conscious breathing.  I feel naked whenever I forget it at home.  It also has added benefits by letting me know how much I activity and focus I got in a day.  The customer service department at Spire goes above and beyond to help resolve any issues that may arise.  I would highly recommend Spire to anyone who wants to add another level to their awareness.
