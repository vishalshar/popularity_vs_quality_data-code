After freaking out at going through a long period of my long hair falling out at the roots, I learned it was called. Tellofen Effuvium. Whatever the name, I tried everything, as my scalp was also itching, but no one could find the cause.  I spent so much money of hair and scalp serums, but they either had ingredients that gave me side effects or I didn't like they way they made my hair feel, etc.  I tried at least 10 other highly recommended hair growth serums, not counting. Minoxidil or other Rx products, which I won't use.  I wish this serum weren't so expensive, but I will keep paying for it.  It is the only one I have found that makes my scalp feel amazing, isn't greasy, smells great, but mostly- I have new hair!  No topical treatment can stop the progression of the condition I was suffering from- I believe my hair loss finally stopped on its own.  But I needed to see if the hair would grow back around my front hairline, my neckline, and all over.  I honestly have a TON of new hairs lower on my neck line, lower than I remember having hair before, and in front of my ears, I also have hair growing more forward and lower than before, plus my front hair line has filled back in!Besides the cost, I also am. It wild about the dropper applicator- it doesn't lent itself to practical application- maybe if you are only treating a few spots.  I use this serum usually once a day- either morning or night.  I love this product!
