I have a dog that runs away a lot. Free spirit so to speak. I read the reviews for the Whistle and was a little concerned. However, I thought I'd go ahead and give it a try. I've never had a problem with it. Every time my dog decides to follow his nose, the tracker leads me to his exact location. It's worked amazingly well. Further, I've never had an issue with the alerts on my phone. The whistle provides me with the assurance that I'm going to find my wandering dog without a worry.
