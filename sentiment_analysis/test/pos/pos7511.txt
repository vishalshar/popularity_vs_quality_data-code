I purchased this for my Genesis Coupe to keep it nice and refreshed. So far it has been working very well, my interior doesn't have any smell to it. It is kind off putting at first because there is such a lack of smell to the car. I think if I combined this with a "Smell good" scent it would work wonders. I haven't tried it yet but I am curious how that would pan out.It was easy to hide under my seat and does its job there. It is the silent killer of odors.So far my only complaint is that there is no indicator that the it needs to be recharged. I wish that it had a tag that would change colors to show that it needed to be left out in the sun. Other than that it does the job very well!
