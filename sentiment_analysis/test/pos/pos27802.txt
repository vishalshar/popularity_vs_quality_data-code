I love this helmet. I have a problem with forgetting to remove and charge the lights on my bike, but for some reason, it's just easier to remember to charge a helmet. I feel like it really improves my visibility to have some light higher-up, and I get compliments on my Torch T2 almost every day. Highly recommend.
