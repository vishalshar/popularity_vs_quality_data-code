I bought the 27000 mah battery for $150 on 12/17/15.  It was a Holiday sale or something.  It arrived via Amazon prime the next day.I think people should know the watt hours of this device.  Ah can be quite misleading because the voltage of batteries can be different.  This pack has 27 AH * 3.7V (lithium batteries) = 99.9 Watt hours.Observations:-Using a kill a watt meter I can see the unit by itself draws up to 0.7 watts an hour when the inverter is turned on.  Not bad for DC to AC inverter being turned on.-The product has the same power supply and manual of the HIS Gear Up Portable AC and Enerpad portable AC outlet which is made in China or Taiwan.  In fact, the power outlet products look exactly the same besides having different branding labels.Pros:-Roughly 99.9 watt hours of power.-Will deliver up to about 85watts/hour to most devices.-Portable and decent product.-Will even charge my 17" - 150Watt/hour -  i7-5700hq, geforce 6gb 970M -  Gigabyte P37wV4 laptop with low brightness settings in balanced power mode or turned off.  (Power draw is typically 30w to 65w)Cons:-no LED percentage indicator for more precise battery levels-no Sine wave inverter;  Power transfer efficiency can be better.  But overall it is good.-85w max output.  I'd like to see 125-150w Max + additional peak, even if it is a 99.9 WH battery.-no USB C / Thunderbolt 3 for Dc to Dc charging of Intel 6th generation devices that.  I don't count this against Chargetech as it is fairly new for 2015.-Price:  Even at the Holiday price of $150+ tax for 27AH or 100 watts, it still costs about $5.56 per Amp Hour.  There are other lithium ion AC power outlet  products out there that will cost less.  Right now the HIS Gear UP Ac outlet has a cost point of $3.50 per AH.  They are on clearance.I paid $32.50 for 13 AH.  The 20AH costs $60+tax to $69.99.  These products look exactly the same as the Chargetech products.Conclusion: Overall, I am quite happy.  I just think the price needs to come down more as other companies have competitive Portable AC outlet products for less.  That is why I give this only 4 / 5 stars.
