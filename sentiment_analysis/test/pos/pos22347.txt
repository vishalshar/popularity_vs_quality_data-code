I bought this on the advice of my instructor - the plan is for us to review my rounds together.  She can't be out with me on the course, so having a history of every shot and every decision that I have made on course will be really cool.I paired the sensors without any issues - that process was super easy and really pretty cool.  It took me all of 5 minutes to get set up.  I wasn't planning on playing today, but I headed out to the course 'cause I was too excited to test drive my new toy.  I played 9 holes and the system worked flawlessly!  I can't wait to dig into the stats.
