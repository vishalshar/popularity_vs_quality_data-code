I love the idea of this charger. Solar powered and will charge your smart phone battery as well as provide light. It does all of it and well. I bought it for a long walk through the night I was planning. I wanted to be able to run a couple programs during the walk which I new would be big battery eaters. My Waka Waka charged my phone and still had power to act as a light source. Also love the idea of the company giving a Waka Waka to someone in an underdeveloped country for free when one of their Waka Wakas get purchased.
