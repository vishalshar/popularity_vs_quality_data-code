I thought this was a great idea, and probably would be IF... It came with some instruction on how to teach your dog/puppy to drop the ball in the hole. I haven't given up yet ~ but she has trained me well.  I know how to drop it in as she waits for it to shoot it to her. It's better now that after she catches it, she doesn't run away (trying to make me chase her) ~ but now she brings it back to me (sometimes). She also is afraid of the growling sound it makes before the "pitch". As I said, I'll keep trying ~ but if you can be of any further assistance it would be appreciated. ;)
