These turned out great!  We have a new puppy that ate my shoelaces and I had just ordered these to try them out.  They arrived just in time and they are quite comfy and I'm able to slip my shoes on and off and no more fighting the puppy for trying to eat my laces!Shipped quick and arrived in a timely manner! Going to order some for my husband and some more for me!!
