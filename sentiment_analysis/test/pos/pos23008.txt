My first impressions were pretty poor as it was not broken in. Turning the dial to all the presta valve spots and oscillating the ring made it much easier to take on and off. It's also much easier if you only open presta valves slightly instead of all the way.It's also worth noting that to do it one handed the tire needs to be turned such that the valve is on the bottom so you have something to push against. This can be a problem for tubeless users as inflating the tire in this orientation can clog the valve with sealant, as well as shoot sealant everywhere while putting it on...The pump head is expensive and needs a lot of break-in, but it's easy to use and is much easier on presta valve cores than lever-type heads.
