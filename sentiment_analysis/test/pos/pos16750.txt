This game is a lot of fun.  My son is nine years old, and he, my husband, and I play this game together.  I was at first skeptical that it might be difficult for my son, but it is not difficult at all, and it makes him think about saving money, planning for retirement, investing, etc.  You can never start too young encouraging your children to save money for their future.This game is optimal for 3-4 people to play.  It takes about an hour to play the game, which is a good length of time.  We love it!
