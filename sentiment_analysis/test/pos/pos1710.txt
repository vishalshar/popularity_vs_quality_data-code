This is my fourth or fifth easy walk harness. I started with them when my dog was just a puppy so she quickly outgrew them. I've always loved them because they help her not pull so bad while walking. For some reason, I've had problems getting this one to fit correctly. It could be because the material is so thick it's hard to adjust. I think I've finally gotten it to a good fit or as close as I'm going to get.I do CONSTANTLY get compliments on the glitter. 5 stars on appearance.
