A must have for anyone with little kids!  This shelf solved our major problem with my kids getting water all over the floor from putting their bath toys on the ledge of the tub.  I have one for each bathroom because they work so well!  We have 2 different size and shaped tubs and it works great on both because the suction cups allow you to place it where ever you need to.
