I am updating my review, as I have been using this item for a couple of months now. (which is why its got so many marks in the photos, this case does some serious protecting!)i would absolutely recommend this case to anyone! the first time i put my phone into the case, it was pretty snug but it assured me my phone wouldn't fall out of the case. I am able to fit 4 CARDS in this case with ease! (could probably add another card with non with raised numbers) that to me, makes the case worth buying. I carry my work ID, my orca card, drivers license, debit card & a 20$ bill. My case closes without difficulty, and has NEVER ONCE opened itself. I have dropped my phone too many times to count (this case isnt going to save your screen, so dont think it would) but it def has helped saved the corners of my phone. The hand strap is very helpful as well! The mirror is a cute little addition too. I never thought it would be so useful, but I find myself using the mirror in this case more then any other mirror I have.three downfalls to this case (nothing major)1. Material is REALLY slick, if it wasn't for the hand strap I would drop my phone constantly.2. The case is really thick. But if you want to hold 4+ cards, its got to be this way.3. You have to remove the bottom piece to plug into an AUX cord or dock.
