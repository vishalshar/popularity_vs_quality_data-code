I am totally obsessed with my new office chair. I didn't want an ordinary black office chair, I'm so happy I waited! I saw this one, Ferrino by Rapid X with much better color choices and ordered it immediately. I am absolutely in love with the pink trim along the sides and the pink stitching.Not only is the chair beautiful, it's also incredibly comfortable. There are two adjustable/removable pillows attached to the chair for neck and back support. The back pillow works great for the arch I have in my back. After eight hours of sitting at work, I dont experience the slightest back pain. I can also adjust the back based on whatever I am doing which is nice. The chair height and armrests adjust, too. Most chairs I checked out didn't adjustable armrests it was definitely well worth the money.  Its a very sturdy chair. The quality is excellent, in some chairs the padding is squishy but not this one it's firm and makes my day at the office more enjoyable. I was surprised at how easy it was to put together, it took me about 45 minutes from unpacking it to rolling it up to my desk. I have had this chair for only few days and I get so many complements from all my colleagueseverybody wants to try it and its like having a brand new car. Love my Ferrino!
