I've tried a bunch of different options with data when traveling internationally: 1. adding the expensive roaming plans from my official carrier (on both AT&T and T-Mobile): convenient but extremely expensive and limited capacity, 2. purchasing local SIM cards: cheap but extremely confusing as every local carrier has a different process of setting up, and becomes a hassle if you are country-hopping, and 3. purchasing a local mobile hotspot: similar to option 2 but you have convenience of keeping your original phone number which came in handy for me as a T-Mobile USA customer, as I was able to take advantage of T-Mobile's WiFi calling feature, which allows you to continue to use your phone as if you were still in your home country, making and receiving calls to other US numbers for free as long as you are connected to a WiFi hotspot. You can also share data among various devices and fellow travelers. The downside: your hotspot will only work for the region you purchased it for. This is only worth it if you plan on staying for a while (at least a few weeks or months long) but then you end up stuck with a model that only works for the region you bought it for, as every region of the world uses bands and frequencies specific to it.That being said, I was hoping the G2 would be an improvement over my previous international data experiences, and for the most part, it has been. It is the best option if you plan on moving around from country to country, even if you only plan on visiting as little as two. For example, on a trip to Cambodia, I ended up having an unexpected overnight layover in China and the G2 proved to be a lifesaver as there were essentially no viable options to purchase a local SIM card during that time. It connected seamlessly to a 4G LTE network in China, and when I arrived in Cambodia, switched again to a local Cambodian network. Magic!The downside is of course, the cost of data. Fortunately for me, there were package deals specific to Southeast Asia and China, but for the rest of the world, you basically pay just over $30 USD per 1 GB. It's still a good deal compared to option #1 but considerably more expensive than option #2 with the rates you would get through a local carrier's native SIM. The good thing, though, is that the G2 has 2 slots for additional SIMs. I have not used them yet, but knowing that they're there gives me peace of mind since I have the option to use a local SIM if I really want to save money and I know I'm not stuck with a device that only works in one region of the world.Other minor quibbles: 1. you have to wait what seems like a few minutes for the device to find a local network after powering it up, 2. you really have to watch your data usage  it goes by fast if you have multiple devices connected to it, 3. the user interface can be confusing to navigate. You can tell it was created by non-native English speakers.Essentially, you're paying for convenience: no need to mess with local SIMs which  trust me  can be a true pain.
