I don't post a lot of reviews but this product is worth taking the time.I went through a dozen webpages and blogs that listed all of the popular songs to listen to in order to test headphones, these guys played every note, sound, click, bass thump, and high tweet that they should have. I'm a little obsessed with headphones and I have quite a few from Bose to Skull Candy cheapos and these are by far the best sounding.The packaging is great, they really put some time and thought into how good the package looks as you open it, for me that's always a sign that a company is thinking about all the small details which means they'll make a great product.They come with 8 different sized ear buds, yes 8, which include different materials from plastic to rubber to foam. You are sure to find a perfect fit which is essential for in hear headphones.Lastly, they look very sleek and professional. The copper highlight set them apart.I'm not going to use these for excersise, not sure how they'd hold up against moisture and the weight of each eat bud is way outside the ear so I'm not sure how well they'd stay in while running. I didn't buy them to workout with so that's not a negative for me.I've already recommended them to 3 friends. These are a fantastic sounding headphone, especially in this price range.
