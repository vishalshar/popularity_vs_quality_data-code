I have always wondered how to get grilled steaks uniformly rare or medium rare with a nice crust. I have tried regular grilling and the sear & bake options to inconsistent success and a smoky kitchen in the winter - not fun. When I learned about Sous vide cooking I'll admit my geek alert went off!Trying not to sound like some kind of paid consultant (I'm not), but, I LOVE THIS THING! Once you have the unit set up, and the water at the righttemperature (it has a bluetooth link to your phone so you can keep an eye on it) it's just a matter of attaching your packaged meats that have had aromatics added to it into the water bath and cooking to the desired doneness. And - it WONT OVERCOOK! Set it for 130F degrees and it stays at 130F degrees. Even an hour or two later. No overcooking. (There is an EXCELLENT site that goes into great detail on the wherefores and the why's and the science behind sous vide cooking - I suggest you check  out sciencedirect  sous vide it offers quite a bit of helpful information on sous vide cooking. )I will be adding pictures later of my first steaks using the Anova Sous vide cooking method. I'll admit the steaks were a little thin for my first time around and had too high a fat content. Further attempts will utilize thicker less fatty cuts.
