In only 2 weeks there is a noticeable difference: my lashes ARE darker, requiring only 1 coat of mascara now. I put it on at night before bed, and have had no problem with flaking. My lashes also seem to be much fuller. I also use it on my eybrows to cover the grey. It does NOT wash off with regular use, although it may appear to at first. I beleive this product was made for women like me: older with thinning lashes & brows that have gone grey.It is NOT a mascara, and not meant to be used just before applying mascara: it says so right in the directions!
