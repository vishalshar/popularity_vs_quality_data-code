Need to improve the heart rate monitor and the app for workout. Heart rate detection is off around +- 10 bpm. Actual real time HR is critical when trying to avoid going over your max heart rate or when targeting a channel range.  You cannot turn off the voice feedback while exercising and this is annoying.  Works with other fitness apps like iCardio, Digifit.  You can swim with it and take a shower while hearing your favorite audiology! Battery needs to last longer.  The audio transparency needs some refinement to be able to hear lower pitch sounds and voice. If you are cycling and want to hear a car behind you you or talk to your buddy you can turn on the audio transparency all the way up, but still can't hear some sounds around you.  This will make me want to take them off to talk to someone.  You have to put them both in your ear to connect and the take the left out if you want to use only one.  This is just silly.  Overall its a great product and I will not return it.
