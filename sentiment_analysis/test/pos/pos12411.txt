My nine year old is loving this. It's Christmas and with all the bey blades and nerf guns and other treats he opened, he's been working on Piper for hours. So grateful to the Piper group for spending their time and energy creating such a great product and learning tool. The quality, design, instructions (a blueprint and the the "mission" were fantastic), and a way for my kid to learn STEM without it feeling like I am forcing him to do "more school." If you are wondering if it's worth the investment, I say it's worth more than we paid!
