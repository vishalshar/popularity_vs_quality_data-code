After receiving my latest utility bill I was shocked to see how much money I am spending on keeping my house cool.Browsed online for a smarter way to save on my bills (and do something green) and came across this company.Received the tado unit about a week ago; first impression was very good. A sleek box and a stylish white design, a bit like Apple.Was worried about installation but it was literally plug and play (see the pictures that another reviewer posted), plus one connection to my home wifi.The iphone app to control it is very intuitive and has cool features, such as turning off - automatically - when I leave the house and turning back on - automatically - before I get home. That is a really cool feature as I either forget to turn of the AC in the morning (meaning I am wasting money while I am away), or I get home at night and my place is an oven. Let's see how it performs over time but this is a promising start
