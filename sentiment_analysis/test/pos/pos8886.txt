I had a Fitbit flex and lost it because of the strap. Wanted something with more options and that wouldn't fall off my active wrist.  The battery life is insane!  I've had it for two weeks and have yet to charge it.  It's stylish and I barely notice it on my wrist.  It's a great tracker and you can't beat the price.
