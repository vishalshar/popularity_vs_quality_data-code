I can't speak to the 1st gen device, b/c I tend to avoid 1.0 creations by unknown entities. As regards this 2nd gen version, I purchased after combing the web for customer insights, especially in terms of Apple Watch integration, and studying Automatic's privacy policy. Short version: now that I've used it, happy customer here.The biggest hassle was getting the dongle out of its hard plastic drinking-glass container. I thought the next problem would be actually locating the OBD-2 port, on my ancient but beloved 2008 Mitsubishi Spyder Eclipse convertible. Situated inside of the car, I couldn't find it, no matter what contortions I put my body through. But once I a grabbed a flashlight, knelt down on the ground next to the driver's seat, then nosed around under the steering wheel, I had my mercifully quick Bingo! Plugged this device in without grief, moved to sitting in the driver's seat, changed the phone settings from "auto-lock 2 minutes" to "never," opened the Automatic app on my iPhone 6+, then watched the device update its firmware. Frankly, my fears of complexity proved totally unfounded.FYI: While awaiting the device's arrival, I had signed up at the Automatic site, connected the Automatic channel to my IFTTT account, and configured a handful of recipes: check-engine light occurrence to ToDoist and gCal, trip particulars to EverNote including map of from/arrived destinations, a DropBox cvs file for mileage particulars, and an iOS notification to open the Automatic app whenever the ignition switch is turned on. Once the dongle was in place, and successful setup confirmation was received, I next turned my attention to my Apple Watch. That too was a no-brainier re setup. A little more research, and I opted to purchase iOS app Find My Car Smarter Pro. Delightful  hands-off combo.Caution: it didn't take long to see a battery drain issue. Troubleshooting research strongly  suggested the culprit was the Automatic app's Crash Report feature, which is on by default. Turning that off returned both batteries -- iPhone and Watch -- to their previous joyous longevity-monster states.This self-employed woman is seriously grateful the last half of this year will see automated mileage info created/maintained, allowing me to uninstall the Mickey Mouse apps claiming automation, when the only thing each did faithfully was spontaneously reboot my iPhone. This works. As advertised. Add the IFTTT integration per that (free!) service's Automatic channel as well as other "oooo-baby!" channels, and my mind is blown by the comprehensive tech goodness. If and when the check-engine light comes on, I'll have the diagnostic scoop in hand, so I can go to the repair shop without the requisite jar of Vaseline. I know no one affiliated with any of the companies/services/apps referenced here. I'm simply a bought-it-at-Amazon customer who appreciates a genuinely stellar product. Hence, this review. (Be careful! A certain brick & mortar chain still stocks the previous gen device. You don't need/want that aggravation.)
