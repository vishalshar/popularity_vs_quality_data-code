I love this little thing. It took me a bit to figure out how to connect it to my phone; I think I was confused because it seems two of my neighbors also have these, and it "saw" all three! But, once I figured it out, I tested it around my house and was able to hear it loud and clear. I found out by accident that if I push the button, it will send a ding to my phone--so, now as long as I can find my phone, I can find my keys, and vice versa!The one improvement I would recommend is adding a keychain hook to the package. It was a little hard to get it onto my existing ones.LOVE the product, and the husband will be super pleased that he doesn't have to search for my stuff as often now.
