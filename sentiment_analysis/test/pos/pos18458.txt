I looked extensively for a light gaming laptop.  I checked NewEgg and Best Buy daily for hot deals and picked this one.I bought because...1. 4.4 lbs - Most other models with similar specs and price were coming in 5+ lbs2. 512 SSD - Others came with 128 GB SSD and Large HDD.  I am not too techy, so I didn't want to deal with dual hard drives3. Gaming capabilities while looking professional - I like the fact I could bring this laptop to a business meeting if I needed to.'4. Price - I paid $800 which was on the low end for the specs5. Ability to easily upgrade RAM and SSD - I saw some models which required removing the keyboard and looked very difficult to upgrade.What do I think?- I love the SSD - Yeah it is that fast- Runs the games I play - CIV 5 and other turn based games- I wish it was a 14", but 15" is not terrible- I like the keyboard, I have larger hands and see the advantage to a proper spaced out board- The charger block is WAY big-Trackpad is fine, I see why people gripe about it, but i think the more you use the better I will getIf you are considering something in this range I recommend this one.
