The look is classy- I bought a metal mesh band to replace the white that was perfect for summer. The step tracking is right on and I like seeing where I am on my 10,000 with just a glance.  The waterproof aspect is perfect for tracking swim laps. Love that I don't have to charge the thing! Only negative is the band really needs to come in a smaller size.
