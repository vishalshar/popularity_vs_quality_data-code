Got this bike for my daughter for her birthday. It came with no teaming wheels. I called and they were awsome about getting what I needed. They sent me a whole new bike and I took out what I needed and returned it. My one complaint is this bike is extremely heavy!  My daughter is 5 and very small for her age. But even I have a hard time lugging this thing.
