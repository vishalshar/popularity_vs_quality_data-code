I really enjoy Bare Coconut Chips, I find they make a great snack.  This was my first time ordering the honey flavor and I was not let down.  Just like other flavors of Bare Coconut Chips the added flavor was not overpowering and the coconut flavor still shines through.  If you like coconut chips in general and are interesting in the honey flavor this should be a great buy.
