I bought this several months ago, use it on my bike rides at least once a week, often all day (50-60 miles) to take pictures every few seconds.  I'm very happy with it.  Everything about this product screams good design, precision engineering, and quality materials.  It is easy to use.The iPhone case provided is a perfect fit.  It snaps out of the holder easily - but only when you unlatch; zero problems after hundreds of miles.  The safety line is useful and easily clips and unclips.  It is comfortable - almost unnoticeable.  The straps are very good quality and naturally lay flat.All my feedback is "pro" - no "con".  If you want to carry your phone in a very handy place and want to take pictures, this is the only product I would recommend.  Kudos to Miveu team on a job well done... and THANKS!
