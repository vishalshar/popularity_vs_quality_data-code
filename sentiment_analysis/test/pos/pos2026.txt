Definitely worth the money spent over the competition.  Install was easy, and I am using the system over my home wifi with no issues.  At first, the system would not connect to the Blossom servers and I had initial issues scanning the 4 zones in my front and side yard.  However, after a reboot of my wireless router, all worked well.The app could use some improvements to keep up with Skydrop and Rachio.  I would like to see my local weather shown on the app and the system using the weather history to determine if watering is needed or not. We have had a lot of rain where I live, and Blossom is set to water on Thursday and Sunday evenings.  Today was the first day watering was scheduled. I could see in the smart watering feature of the app, the amount of time would reduce over the day, due to rain we had in the day. However, an hour before watering was scheduled, we had a big rain storm and the system was still scheduled to water. I was able to find in the calendar where I could turn off watering to avoid this issue.  I also turned off watering for the upcoming Sunday considering more rain is in the forecast and the amount of rainfall the past week and a half.  Would like the app to display a message indicating watering has been cancelled due to rain much more in advance and to take into account the weather history and amount of rainfall to determine if watering is necessary or not.  Additionally, if the smart watering feature needs to increase or decrease amount of time to water, an explanation as to why would be great.The description of the sprinklers are confusing when choosing the type for each zone.  Some are easy to determine, but some, such as "rotors" or "sprinklers" could be more defined to better help the system understand the sprinkler type.  I think my zones are set correctly based on some internet research.As mentioned in reviews on here, a history of watering in detail would be great as wellBesides what I mentioned above, this is a great tool to have and even better that I can control from the iPhone or iPad.  Looking forward to improvements to the app and smarter watering.
