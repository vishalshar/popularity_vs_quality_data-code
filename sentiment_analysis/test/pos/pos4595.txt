So firstly, this showed up literally next morning when I ordered it even though it's so close to Christmas (not sure if that was Amazon or Robolink, but nice work there!).  The drone itself is already in one piece when you open up the packaging. It sits on top of an insert with the URL that takes you to the tutorial on their website--because under the drone is like a bunch of cool fiddly wires and screws and chips and stuff (which it turns out is the parts to make the remote control that you program and connect to, to fly the drone). You don't actually need to know what it all is to get started, the videos (conveniently under the Getting Started heading) will tell you what it all is. They have an instructor lead you through building the remote, explain installing the software on your computer, and once it's set up the basic code to get it flying takes only a few minutes max to get working.  There's more you can do with the drone by uploading more complex codes to it, which I haven't looked through all of the tutorials for yet, but it's all available on their website.The drone itself is pretty small and light, but durable enough to endure some bumps while you're learning how to handle it (don't fly it outside in windy situations though... OR OUTSIDE AT ALL MAYBE? It does say right on the insert that it's not for outdoors, lol).  If you're more of a hands on learner and don't think you'd do well at figuring out code just looking at lines on a screen, programming a toy that flies is great because you can see how it responds.  I'd bet if I were a parent (since I'm a learn-by-teaching sort), it'd be cool to work on this with my kid.  It's definitely a nice way to learn about the Arduino environment, which is actually a programming thing that's applicable to other stuff besides this toy (like seriously fancy robotics stuff).Anyway, poking around on their other public media stuff, it looks like they had a Kickstarter earlier this year and they've got updates happening regularly, so I'm excited to go through the rest of the tutorials and see what new stuff goes up after I get through those! GONNA LEARN SOME LIFE SKILLS AND HAVE FUN DOING IT.
