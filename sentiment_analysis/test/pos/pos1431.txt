So for a year I have debating blowing the $1500 on a Fleer device for LDL Paranormal and haven't mustered hutzpah to spend the bucks. When I found this the $250 was worth rolling the dice. Here's though what you need to do: Buy yourself a Cell Phone Adapter Holder with the 1/4 screw to attach to a camcorder, buy a L Bracket Extender for a camcorder and then a suction Cup Camera Mount. All three will cost you $30  together. Now mount a regular small palm camcorder to one end of the L bracket and the Cell Phone at the other on the adapter and the suction cup under the Camcorder itself but make the suction cup 1/4 go through the l bracket and into the camcorder. This will let you shoot the picture of the cell phone while the Seek Thermal displays and it does three things: It gives you audio on your thermal video, because the seek app does not record audio, it gives you unlimited record time because of the camcorder, and it extends the amount of time you can have the thermal cam on..Lasts longer if its just displaying as opposed to displaying and recording..check out LDL paranormal for a demo of me using this and how to quickly build and assemble it..for the $30 in parts you now have a device as good as or better than even the Mid Level Fleer at $800. And yes this thermal works great for Paranormal Investigations. Has a clean range, res isnt too bad at 180 x 112 and it has 15 settings for color..very good deal if you do what I did with it..
