This work perfectly in terms of size in our lunch boxes (PotteryBarn Kids). I like the Bento compartments and only having to wash a single container each night. I haven't used the Thermos compartment yet, but definitely will be as the kids get older. I don't like that they aren't microwave safe. It would be nice to be able to send in food that needs to be heated up and to heat it directly in this lunchbox. It's also quite expensive, but seems incredibly durable. It also seems to be the only container that combines hot and cold compartments.
