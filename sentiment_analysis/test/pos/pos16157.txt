To say I love tea is an understatement. I don't drink coffee. I don't drink soda. But tea. Tea is my vice.I first came across Rosali Tea from their Kickstarter campaign and have been hooked every since. This delightful box of nine premium loose leaf teas is a perfect sampling of different teas without a huge commitment. Why choose when you can have them all? There's also something very satisfying just by opening the beautiful box each time. Remember when you were a kid and you read every inch of the cereal box in the morning? That's how I felt with their packaging. Each tea includes interesting stories and information like the health benefits and origin, so you start to feel like a bit of a tea connoisseur once you start pouring. I can't wait to get another one as a gift for someone!
