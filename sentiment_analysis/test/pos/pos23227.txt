What can I say, this feeder is an absolute dream. My cat has several health conditions (and a ravenous appetite) that require frequent feedings. I was working long hours and would constantly worry about my cat with the cheaper feeders. I would come home to find that he was starving because he had either managed to quickly open them or flip them over and go unfed. Not only does this feeder stay closed and locked, but my clever cat has not found a way to break into it. I love that I am able to view him throughout the day on camera, as well as set it online if I forget to beforehand. I was hesitant to spend this much on a feeder that may or may not work (when 4 others had proven to be an utter waste of money), but can honestly say that it has been worth every penny. My cat and I thank you feed and go!
