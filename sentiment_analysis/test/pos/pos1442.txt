These are some of the best apple chips I've ever had.  I originally ordered these because they do not add sugar like most other dried apples sold in the store.  I didn't expect much out of the flavor but was very surprised to find them plenty sweet!  The sweet cinnamon and apple flavor is the perfect afternoon snack to satisfy my sweet tooth.
