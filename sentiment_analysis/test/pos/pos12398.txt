Very nice product which is great in limited circumstances. Does this replace my readers? Can but probably in the end won't. They are fantastic to have on the back of my phone. It takes a bit to get used to handling them, putting them on, keeping them on, keeping them clean.  But you do learn. 3 days in I was a pro at pulling them out of the case without looking and placing them on my nose without getting finger prints on them. My experience says they work best placed rather aggressively on the bony part of your nose, not soft flesh. Then you sneeze and they are under your airplane seat. Laugh too hard or itch your nose and they are dislodged. But for the "where are my glasses moment" when you just need to see a menu or look at something handed to you, they are great.  Good conversation starters.  Very clever and useful product. After using them a week I plan to have them on the back of my phone for a long time to come. And for reading for a couple of hours, I'm pretty sure I'll stay with my reading glasses.
