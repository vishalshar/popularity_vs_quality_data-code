This is a smooth creamy butter product.  I'd never tried ghee butter before but am a butter fanatic.  We eat at least one stick of salted butter per week in my house and use it for toast, frying eggs, grilled cheese sandwiches and for sautéing certain white fish and shrimp.This butter is not salted to the strength of salted butter you buy in sticks, but it is also not completely sweet and devoid of salt; it's like a lightly lightly salted butter.This Ghee Butter is for use in the same way you would use oil-- sautéing in particular.  I do not use it to cook eggs because I cook eggs with butter mostly for nonstick purposes and this does not coat the pan the way a stick of butter will (butter sticks smear onto the entire surface of the pan, ghee butter melts and moves around the pan like oil does once melted, so the egg sticks to parts without the melted butter-oil on them.  (See picture which has stick butter on the left and ghee butter on the right.)If you want the effect of oil but don't want the heavy, greasy, oil-flavored side effects of oil, GET THIS. I love that it works like oil but is so much lighter and fresher tasting, smooth and without the thick greasy feel of oil.
