Although I'm a newbie I've had the opportunity in the last month to work with three different companies. I've purchased a Yuneec Q500 4K which has been sent back to the manufacturer for repair, a DJI Phantom 4, which I returned because the battery that came with it would not keep a charge and finally the Autel Robotics X-Star Premium Drone with 4K.If you're looking for drone under $1k with the most value then I highly recommend this one! Besides being an incredible machine that you can put up in the air and feel confident you're not going to screw up, the customer support is UNMATCHED if compared to the other two companies.It's really simple. Download App on your tablet or phone, attach propellers, which is a snap, power up RC, power up drone, start app, wait about 1 minute and you're ready to go.The instructional videos on their website are easy to follow, a pleasure to watch and chock full of pertinent information. The user interface on the app is intuitive and simple but also highly customizable.The video is very stable. At four hundred feet it looks like the camera is sitting on a very tall tripod. The amount of technology in this drone, Orbit, Follow Me, Watch Me, Way Points, Home, Auto Launch work like a charm.DJI does have the buzz, but this company has an equivalent, if not better product with a more user friendly interface. Updating the firmware couldn't be easier. And they even give you a 64GB SD card!
