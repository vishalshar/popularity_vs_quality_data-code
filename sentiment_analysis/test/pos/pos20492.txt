I considered buying one of these a while back but felt it was expensive and limited not to mention I assumed sound quality would not be great.  I eventually cave and purchased one because I wanted basic drum functionality to have while playing as opposed to always playing to a metronome.  This thing exceeded my expectations sound quality was better than I thought and firmware updates have added extensive midi control functionality that has made this an valuable tool when writing as well.
