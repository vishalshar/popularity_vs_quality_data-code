My kids love these things (and so do I)!  This bulb comes extremely well packaged and is easy to set up.  It seems to be built like a tank.  I use the smartphone app on Android to control it and find it quite easy to use.  These display any color you could ask for as well as various color changing "themes". We keep them at a standard white for day-to-day living, but often change the color/mood of the room for movies/games.  You don't think it makes a difference, but it does.  Very fun to have around.
