EDITED 8/5/2016First of all, the plan prices have gone up since we signed up. But they grandfathered us in on the old prices. We have used this on many occasions when my husband has fallen or gotten stuck in a location and we needed assistance. What I like best is being able to update his information including doctors and medications. It has been more than 2 years, and our device is failing, because of the battery connections in the charger, so we have ordered a new device. To carry the "replacement plan" is $3 a month - which would have cost us more than simply buying a new device every year here on Amazon.I feel the customer service has deteriorated since I originally signed up (when very few people had the plan, it was easier to be more personal) but they still are helpful and courteous. IMHO, still one of the best deals out there.After seeing several ads on television, we decided to go with this alert device instead of a much more expensive contract that works over our land line.Set up was easy online (you save $10 on set up fees, making it only $25), but if you are less technical, you can call them and they will walk you through it.When the test call didn't come, we called support who had us push it to test it. We had a bad connection and it cut off. Our support person tried to let them know we were OK, but before he got through, they had called us back on the button to see if we were safe.Later, while I was installing a lanyard, I accidentally pushed the button again.Both times they responded immediately, and they were professional, making sure we were safe before disconnecting. I never felt that they were in a hurry, they were there as long as we needed them.Because this has a GPS chip and runs on cellular service, you can use it when you are out and about, in fact, you can even use it as a personal safety device.There are currently two plans, $14.95 a month for the basic response, with extra fees for extra services. They will call for help, call a loved one, or whatever you need.It costs $19.95 a month for the premium plan allowing loved ones to locate your position and allowing access to health professionals to discuss issues. With this one, you are put in contact with a nurse and a doctor will call you back within 30 minutes. It also will send a notification to your loved one any time you push the button.Since plans change over time, check on the GreatCall Web site for current plans and options.For us this made good sense because my husband is no longer able to use a cell phone, but needs to be able to get help. When we are out and about, especially in rural areas, it helps us to be able to be easily located.I have completed all of the medical information and feel very comfortable having this handy and available.
