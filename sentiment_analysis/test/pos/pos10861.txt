Functionality-wise these bulbs get five stars all day long. I love not having a hub and still getting all of the best features of a multi-color light setup. Grouping, scenes, and schedules all make this an instant smart home solution. We've even been able to double using these as plant lights on rainy days or when it's too cold outside. Coupled with an Amazon Echo you get voice controlled lights - and combined with cloud services this IFTTT you can pretty much automate the lighting on your house based on ANYTHING (location, time, social media activity).The biggest disadvantage I will give these lights is that in my current set (3 total), one light will randomly drop off line at least once every other day, and the only way to clear the issue is to turn the light off/on again. It's not a specific bulb, it seems to happen to them all at some point. Not as reliable as I would have hoped. Sometimes the Eco integration is also ignored..  but it's impossible to tell where the fault lies when that happens.Edit: firmware updates have solved connectivity issues - thank you LIFX/Tim for taking time to respond!
