I love this sensor. It does a pretty good job of reporting my speed and spin as well as distinguishing between forehand and backhand shots. I am not sure how accurate it is but it is quite consistent on how it reports my strokes. on occasion it will report a high forehand as a serve so not always the best but I am sure that can be worked out in future updates.
