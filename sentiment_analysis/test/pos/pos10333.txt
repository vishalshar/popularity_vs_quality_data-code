I thought about getting a YoCam when it was initially on Indiegogo but I held off, however once I saw it was on Amazon I jumped at the opportunity! So far the camera has been great, I've brought it on a couple of hikes with my family and I and have been able to grab some great shots! However, mostly I've just been using the YoCam as a baby monitor for my newborn, as it's far cheaper than most video baby monitors I've seen online.
