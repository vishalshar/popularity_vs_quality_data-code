***UPDATE*** After a few months of using this as my day to day case, as well as my mount, I have one major issue with it.  Through standard use, debris and particles (dust, sand, etc.) have accumulated between the back of my iphone 5, and the inside of the case.  As you would expect, while the case is on the phone, it is difficult to tell that anything is building up inside.  The particles (especially some sand) that ended up in the case caused significant scratching to the aluminum body of my iPhone.  While I can see this being a potential issue with any phone case of this style, it is very disappointing to have a protective case actually cause damage to the phone.  If you buy this case, probably a good idea to inspect the inside of the case on a regular basis.I am very happy with this mount, it was extremely easy to install on my daily commute bike.  The rubber bands hold the mount securely to the stem of my handlebars.  The mount is low profile and unobtrusive when not in use. Most of my riding is on paved roads, so aside from a few potholes and curbs, I haven't really been able to rattle the case to see how well it will stay attached, but based on my basic riding needs it seems very stable.The Quadlock case that is required for mounting the iPhone 5 isn't the prettiest case out there, but it isn't terrible.  Well constructed, easy to access all of the function buttons on the iphone.  Slightly bulkier than I'd like, but comfortable in the hand.Mounting the iphone on the stem is extremely easy and convenient.  I like the flexibility of just being able to hop off my bike and remove my phone without any hassle.  This is probably the best feature of the mount.My only major issue with this mount is that it is absolutely not water proof.  The plastic cover can be thought of as a splash guard at best, protecting your phone from sweat, mist, maybe dust and dirt.  This may be obvious due to all of the exposed openings in the under body of the case, but this will definitely not protect your iPhone from any serious amount of rain or water.  Keep this in mind if you're looking for an all weather solution.Overall I am happy with this, and would recommend to anyone looking for a solid mount for casual/commute riding.  Like many iPhone accessories, I would say that this unit is overpriced for what it is.  $50 seems like a more reasonable price for this, but that being said, I couldn't find a mounting system/case that looked like a better option based on my requirements.
