The robot is so much fun.  My 9 year old daughter started playing with it first thing Christmas morning.  She loved the ease of use with the cell phone controls.  The cheap batteries lasted about 2 hours.  But the better name brand has lasted 2 hours a day for the past 4 days.  The robot is do much fun even the 3 year old learned the phone and hand motion controls.  The kid liked this better than the BB8 because this was easier to control.
