I'm a crazy audiophile on a grad student budget, so when my beloved AudioTechnica noise cancelling buds died a few days ago, I had to find some that I could hope were off at least comparable quality and were also a bit stylish. I loved the look of these and CNet had a pretty great review of them, so I sucked it up and got them (frankly, I wasn't planning to spend over $50, but I couldn't find any of the quality I wanted around that price point). They just arrived today and after testing them for the past hour with a wide variety of music and out on busy NYC streets, I'm seriously impressed. The noise isolation is stellar and so is the fit. The buds look gorgeous and the packaging is so beautiful I don't even want to throw it away. But aside from all this, the sound is incredibly balanced and rich, with a solid but not overpowering bass. I can't wait to hear how these will sound once they burn I'm a little, but for now, I'm amazed. If Chinese startups are producing audio products like this, I'm pretty eager to see what other tech they'll come out with in the coming years.
