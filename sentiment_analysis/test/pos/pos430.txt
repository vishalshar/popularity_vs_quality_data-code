What a wonderful product . The apps are keeping my children aged 5 and 9 engaged for hours. I love the fact that both children can increase their spelling and vocabulary in a fun way. My 5 year old loves matching the shapes and both children like that they can learn to draw better. An overall very good purchased to which I am very pleased and extremely impressed. I am glad I purchased two of these so my children can both play with the different apps at the same time. I would definitely recommend these to my family and friends.
