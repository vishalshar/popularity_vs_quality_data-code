My husband gave me this as a gift. Fortunately I've only needed it for "check in" alerts - no emergencies, thank god - mostly to tell him I'm on the way home since I have a long commute (I always seem to be driving by the time I think to tell him, and I don't want to text and drive!) I love the GPS, too, so even if something as simple as a flat tire happens, I can just press a button to tell the hubby exactly where I am so he can bail me out.Now I'm "paying it forward" and getting one for my mom since she lives alone. I'm relieved to know she'll be able to reach out if anything - dangerous or not - comes up.OH and I almost forgot to mention - MAKE SURE you buy this from Amazon directly. Amazon takes returns, but not all the sellers do.
