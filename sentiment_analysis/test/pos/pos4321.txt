Love the phone. It gets a ton of attention because of it's looks. It has great hardware, plus the cool cloud storage. I accidentally got it a little moist when I left it on the counter in my bathroom while I showered, and Nextbit got me a new one, even if it took a couple of weeks. Great phone, great company, but buy a case because it gets scratched easily and is a tiny bit flimsy... Nextbits next case should be lifeproof.
