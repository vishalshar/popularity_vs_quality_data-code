Customer service was outstanding with this company.  The first one I received had a couple of issues.  The point at where the mount attaches to the ball on the mount became VERY loose to the point that whenever the phone was on the mount it would just tilt all the way down.  Customer service said they were aware of the issue and were in the process of re-engineering the mount.  When it was complete, they sent me a new mount.  The mount no longer got loose and tilted down.The second complaint I have is that the metal plates that mount to your phone were functional, but the adhesive failed after a couple of months.  The metal plate would just then come right off the phone.  I contacted customer service and they said to use another method to attach the metal plate.  I found this unacceptable and that they should come up with a better adhesive to mount the plates to the device.  I simply used double-sided tape that worked for a little while until that failed too.I then realized the mounts have small magnets under the rubber point where the phone attaches to the base.  There are 8 (I think) places for little magnets and only 4 were included.  I took four magnets from the replacement mount and inserted them in the other mount and there were enough magnets to place the metal plate inside my phone case and it would stay on the mount 75% of the time.It is a good setup, but they need to figure out how to make the base magnets stronger and provide better adhesion for the metal plates.
