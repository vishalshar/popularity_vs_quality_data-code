Boy what a tasty mix is this. As good on wild boar as it is on a domestic potato. There is a little heat in the mix, and a little fragrance and a balanced completeness. A light dusting as your meats rest in the refrigerator, and a sprinkle at the table means max flavor without over-salting. By far, most of our salt comes from outside our own kitchens, where we can have control.I have salt pigs and such on the wall next to my stove, or on the table, but I keep this one in the bag. It needs to be shaken immediately before use (why oh why to they always say "shake well before using") to keep the blend evenly distributed.Thanks Michael, no dilemma for this omnivore anymore.
