I have many mini & micro quadcopter/hexicopter, along with a few racing quads. This was my first GPS enabled quad. I couldnt be any happier with this purchase. The XSP is just awesome! The flight modes are very impressive, and I really like the travel case. I have my XSP set with limits for altitude (400ft) and distance (1500ft), which work great. I have flown to these limits and I have had no issues with control or video link. I know the XSP is capable of much further distances but for now I am comfortable with the current limits I have set. My friends were amazed with how stable the video is. It is like you have a tripod mounted in the air. I just cant say enough good things about this quad. I think you need to take a serious look at this quad before purchasing a P3, P4, or typhoon H.
