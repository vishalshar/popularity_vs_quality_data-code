This is very accurate in tuning. It promises +/- 2 cents, but it seems closer than that. I have used it to tune two of my guitars now: A Taylor 414, and a Taylor GA3-12. Did an excellent job on both, extremely high precision.If you're tuning an acoustic guitar, it depends on the microphone on your iPhone, iPad, or Android device, so you have to get the device close to the guitar being tuned. That can be a bit of a challenge--the phone sitting on your knee is not terribly stable.I hope they'll come out with some adapters for the tuning head, so it will work with smaller machine heads like ukulele and mandolin--it was too big for my ukulele.But it's more accurate than I thought it would be, and that's really a pleasant surprise. A very good automatic tuner.
