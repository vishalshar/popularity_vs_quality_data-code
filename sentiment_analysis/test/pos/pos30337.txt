I ordered a certified refurbished version of this product, and the sleep pill it came with was already associated with another account, which made it so that I was unable to use it. I emailed Hello support, and they were very quick and helpful. They fixed my issue within hours of sending the first email, and I didn't even have to do anything. They also followed up to make sure everything was working, which is appreciated.As far as the actual device, the smart alarm is the best feature. All of the other information it provides is interesting, but more or less unhelpful. It keeps a log of when there were noise or light disturbances during the night, but doesn't tell you what they were. This would admittedly be very difficult to do from a technical standpoint, but it leaves you with no information so that you can potentially correct the issue. Was I snoring? Was a dog barking? No way to know, and thus no way to fix the issue, or even tell if it's something you can control.The only thing I'm pretty unhappy with is that they make you use the USB cord and wall adapter they provide (the device won't turn on otherwise). If they do that, what's the point of using micro USB? They might as well just use a proprietary plug interface. Another annoyance is there is no way to tell what your device's MAC address is. From their support page:"Knowing your Sense's MAC address should not be required for normal setup and usage of Sense, and there is not currently a way to access this information from within the Sense app." well, no reason unless you have MAC filtering set up on your network. The only way to figure this out (and still use MAC filtering) is to turn filtering off, connect the sense, look at connected clients in your router, write down the MAC address, and then turn filtering back on. That's a lot of inconvenience for something that would be very simple to include in an advanced settings menu.
