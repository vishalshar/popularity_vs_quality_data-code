this is the best company i ever bought something from. i have the ultra light pro series iphone 6 plus on my bike and my wife's too. I also have the the windshield mount too that works really good for google maps gps. i had one problem with the plastic star piece on the bike mount but it was my fault were i broke one of the fingers off so i contacted the company and ask if i can buy a new one and they said "what is my address we will send you a new one" when the pieces came there were 2 extra one in the bag...well worth my money.
