This treat camera is awesome.  It helps relieve both the dog's anxiety when we are away from the house, but also our anxiety of what the dogs might be up to while we are away.  We have also checked into the house when our alarm system has gone off.  The ability to shoot a treat is the best feature.  My dogs still run to the camera even when we are home, I'll still log in and shoot them some treats just to keep them liking it.  I have also had several people who saw the app go ahead and purchase their own Petzi.  Everyone who sees me use the product loves it.
