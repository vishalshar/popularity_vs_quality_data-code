Excellent!  My cat, Taz, has been having issues for about a year now with over grooming himself and having thinning coat and bald belly as a result.  I've only been using this for a few weeks now and notice that his fur is growing back and he is not obsessively grooming himself.  My vet said that he did this because he felt itchy all over and gave him a steroid shot which lasted a couple of weeks but did not fully address the issues.  This is much better because instead of purchasing a vet diet cat food for all six of my cats I can target only Taz's wet food in the morning and evening.  Thank you for this wonderful supplement!
