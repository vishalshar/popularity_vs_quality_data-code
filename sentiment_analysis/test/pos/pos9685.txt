I had been searching and searching for a plastic cover for my mason jars, that allowed you to put a straw or drink through it and then I finally came across the recap.  I really like the cap, the only downsides is it takes me a couple extra seconds to get the cover to screw on just right, it's weird almost like it has to be perfectly level to screw on.  And then it does leak a tiny bit, but I'm usually holding my drink, not putting it in a cooler or anything so it's not a problem for me.  And lastly, if I have this cover on my mason jar, and I put it in the fridge, its seems harder to unscrew it.Seems like a lot of negatives but overall I do like it, just think maybe it needs to be revised a bit.  I'll keep using and I will probably get some more just because it seems to be the only option I've come across.
