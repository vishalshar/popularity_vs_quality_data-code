We really like our OmieBox lunch box. Our favorite features are:Great portion sizes (not to small, not too big)Seals tight but it's still easy for little hands to open and close.Good insulation, so food is truly still warm at lunch timeWell made, feels durableWe have other reusable containers but we've been using this one every day!
