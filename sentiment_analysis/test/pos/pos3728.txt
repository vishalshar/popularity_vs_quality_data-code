These things are great, I use them with my phone and work phone to adhere to the desk and wall for easy access and mountability.  I'll be honest, sometimes I even use it to adhere to the tile in my bathroom right outside the shower so I can listen to music and also have access to my phone if necessary without the phone being exposed to the water and steam.  It's perfect to keep within reach but out of harms way.  I use them on an iPhone 6s, and I also put them on the phone with a cell phone case over them.  They fit with no issues and don't get in the way of being able to use a case.  Obviously you can also use them on your case if you have one with a flat back (mine has designs so the back isn't totally flat).  Overall I'm very pleased and definitely think the price is appropriate.
