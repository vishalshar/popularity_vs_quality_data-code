Very good product.  I use them with my EarPods and my daughter uses the smaller pair for hers.  We are now able to use the Apple EarPods that before the Earhoox where basically unusable.  Before the Earhoox I could not get the EarPods to stay in my ear.  I recommend using this product.  I will most likely need another set since we recently purchased two new iPods.  For many years Apple has been producing EarPods that do not stay in the ear, Apple continues to fail in this area.  I just asked my daughter what she thinks of this product.  She said I like them, it makes it way better for the ear buds to stay in my ear.  I have purchased in used both the Earhoox for EarPods and the Earhoox for the older round style ear buds.  They both work well.
