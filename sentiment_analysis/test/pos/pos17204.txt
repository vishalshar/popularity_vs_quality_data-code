I usually buy the Lil Critter vitamin gummies for my kids because I want to make sure that they taste good so they actually take their vitamins. My 2 yr old won't eat the Lil Critters but my 5 & 9 yr old do. So I bought these and I have to fight with my 2 year old that they aren't candy. I always taste everything I give my kids and these are the best tasting gummy vitamins out there! They aren't as chewy as typical gummies, they are a little soft making it perfect for my 2 year old. She is 24 months exactly and started buying them for her at 20 months old. If this review was helpful to you, please take a second to press the Â“Helpful" button below. Thank you.
