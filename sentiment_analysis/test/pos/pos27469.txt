The bag and cage are well made and appear to be super durable.  The bag material is nice and tough and the zipper seems strong.  The cage is lightweight but does not seem flimsy in any way.When I first got the bag I had some issues getting it packed with my supplies.  I suggest that you visit the companies website and take note of the types of things that they are suggesting to use.  My particular multi-tool was on the larger side and I had a rather beefy spare tube.I contacted the company and Allen was nice enough to call and help me the next day, even though it was a Saturday.  He gave me lots of great advice so that I could use the bag with my stuff.  One great suggestion was to use a 26 inch tube even though I'm using 29 inch wheels.  The smaller tube will still fit my bike in a pinch but takes up a lot less space in the bag.In the end I am so happy to have this on my bike instead of that old seat bag.  It looks much better and I don't even notice it when I ride and it's not in the way when I try to mount my bike to a workstand.  And even though it took a little work to fit my stuff in the bag the customer service experience was superior and I like knowing that I'm using a product from such a great company who makes their products in the US.
