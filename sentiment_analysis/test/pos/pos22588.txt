So I ordered this speaker because I was going to Dragon Con (think Comic-Con, but less comics and more sci-fi/fantasy stuff). I needed a speaker where me and my friends could listen to music in the hotel room, in line for a panel, hallyways, etc. So it needed to be a little louder than most. I also wanted something durable and resistant to drunk people spilling drinks or knocking it over. And the less I could worry about the battery the better. Well this is a great package for all of those qualitites.Loudness:Is it as loud as a UE Boom with max volume. No. In loud mode is it still pretty darn loud. Oh yeah. It covered pretty much everything I need. When I go camping in the spring, I will not hesitate twice to bring it with me. In a hotel room, it's probably even too loud in loud mode. At home I mostly use it at half volume, in normal mode.Durability:The sport is a rock and I can't wait till I get the aluminium frame for it. I've dropped it a few times and it just bounced off the ground. I also suspect the case will break before the speaker, which is great because I'd much rather replace a $30 case, than a $200 speaker. I have seen how it holds up in water (hopefully I never will), but I believe the claims.Battery Life:It gets 40+ hours of battery life. I rarely charge it, and when I go places I never worry that on a 2-3 day trip, that I'll need to charge it.Sound Quality:It's pretty good, but it could be better. The bass is a bit thin and sometimes the highs overpower the produced sound, but generally it's favorable. If I had to scale it on 1-10, it'd be an 8.Overall:This is a great speaker. If you want super high quality sound or an extremely loud speaker, this isn't for you. If you're looking for the best all around package, well then look no further.
