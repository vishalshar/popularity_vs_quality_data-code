My husband uses this and loves it.  It's not cheap - it's about $5 in the stores - but he thinks tubs worth every time.  We have three small kids and a restless dog and the slightest thing wakes my husband and he finds it hard to get back to sleep.  With this sleep water he gets a great nights rest.
