I'm very happy with this, works fine, I've been able to record several albums from both records and tapes and not a problem doing it, although it does take a little getting used to.  The buttons are stiffer than expected, but then with so many electronics being light touch or swipe touch, it's just a matter of more pressure.  The sound is clear and bright from both records and recordings.  I can willingly recommend this player/recorder.
