We are winos in my house. This gadget let's us enjoy the "good stuff" without having to crack open the whole bottle to finish before it changes or turns. So far so good! You can use it multiple times on the same bottle  (provided it has a cork)  allowing for vertical tastings without waste. Love, love, love.
