So far I am very satisfied with these. I am very impressed by the quality and safety and purify of the ingredients. Its the first supplement that offers nearly every supplement I want my daughter to have. Previously I was giving her a multi, an omega and a Vitamin D. This is a one stop supplement. And my daughter loves the taste and has not yet tired of them. I am halfway through the bottle.
