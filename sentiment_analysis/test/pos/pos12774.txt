This product is exactly what it says...Thin Charge.  Compare to your typical "rugged" case, it's about the same size as it relates to thickness while the phone is attached or inside the case.  Of course, it is significantly heavier, so don't expect to be a delight to hold if you carry your phone in your pocket.  The case feels good in the hand and the top mounted charging port is a plus if you're like me and you use your phone before bed.  The actual charge function works as I can get about 1 and a quarter charges or so from <10% battery levels.The one highlight that I'll speak of, which doesn't echo the experiences of others is the customer service.  I ran into an issue where the case broke where the top connected to the actual battery, causing the top to disconnect frequently.  This, in essence, rendered the case unusable.  I reached out to customer service on a Sunday evening at 11:22pm and received a NON AUTOMATED response in 7 minutes.  I described my issue in detail with the representative and had resolve in under 90 minutes!I've dealt with one of the more well known "charge case" companies on a similar issue and was basically told to pound sand when I ran into a similar issue.  I highly recommend this case for anyone that may be looking for a battery case that won't add to much bulk but is still functional.
