Our family uses parmesan cheese constantly.  We purchase large bags of parm cheese at Costco & put in a mason jar.  Purchased this lid for the jar, and this has been a wonderful product.  So easy to flip the cap & pour the cheese out.  Much better than our previous method.  Highly recommend.  The price could be a few dollars cheaper; however, it makes opening the jar much easier .. Plan to purchase a few more in near future.
