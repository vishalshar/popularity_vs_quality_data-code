This product was great! When I take my vitamins they make me nauseous and I don't feel good after. But Premama did not make me feel nauseous at all. I was able to drink it in my water and did not even know that I had put anything in it. I will definitely be repurchasing it while I am trying to have a baby and then purchase the others while pregnant and after pregnancy. Highly recommend!
