The cold-pressed oil comes out of the bottle green, not like other avocado oils.  This means the flavor and the vitamins and minerals have been more preserved. Yet it colors your potatoes slightly green at first, but not permanently. The flavor does not cover any of the flavor of your foods and handles higher heat than olive oil. I prefer it for frying.
