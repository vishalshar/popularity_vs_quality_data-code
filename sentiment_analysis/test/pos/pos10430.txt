While the transfer speed seems to be a bit slow (hence the four stars), it is hard to beat this much storage for the price. A great way to backup files, or transfer them from place to place.The drive itself is a little thinner and does not match the picture exactly. It is more rectangular, but has the capless USB protection end and the hole that allows you to attach it to a key ring. Overall a great product.
