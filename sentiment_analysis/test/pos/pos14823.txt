I admit I was skeptical, but they work great and are easy to take on and off. It takes a little extra time to put them on and take them off, but it is a lot easier and better then dealing with the ice on the mirrors. Would recommend them to others. I have not had mine that long and am unsure how they will hold up to continuous weather exposure but for the price if they last one winter it is worth it and I would buy again.
