This is a great solution for basically doubling your OS storage. No more pesky out of memory messages. However, it's not painless. It wreaks havoc on your battery, draining it quickly even when the lid is closed and the Air is sleeping... restarting after the battery has drained is a lot more complicated. I've also noticed that it screws up the PRAM, which I've had to reset periodically because the fan sometimes just keeps going and going even when not needed. I only noticed this happening after installing the TarDisk. So good product, but caveat emptor!
