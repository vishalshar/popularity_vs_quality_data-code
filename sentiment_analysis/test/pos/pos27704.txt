I was so happy to stumble on a bunch of grass-fed jerkies and meat snacks.  This one is close to Divine Bovine, yet grass-fed, chef-crafted, better tasting and less expensive.  What's not to like?  So far I've tried the ginger orange and just bought the sampler pack.  It's not too hot or sweet at all,just spicy and sweet-savory.  I don't have kids but have a kid pallette and I definitely think kids would like them too.  Can't wait to try the other flavors.
