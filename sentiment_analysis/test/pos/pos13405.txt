After running over my childs bike a few times I found this amazing product!  I can use it to lift my sons bike above my car so now I will never hit it again.  They have an amazing app that I use on my smart phone to raise and lower the myLIFTER making it easy to take my sons bike or anything I put on it up and down.  It was not hard to put up in my garage either, I being a female found it very easy to install and use.  It is very well built and so strong!  I would highly recommend this to anyone!  It has saved me so much time and effort and now I have a lot of extra space in my garage.  I plan to buy more in the near future!
