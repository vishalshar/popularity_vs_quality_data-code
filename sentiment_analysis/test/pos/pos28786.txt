This is the best companion I had on a long haul flight, something when I had it wrapped around my head. it even buffers out the cabin noise and I slept like a baby on the flight... yes even in economy. Material is awesome... I haven't got a chance to give this a wash yet.. kinda curious how it would hold up to wash.
