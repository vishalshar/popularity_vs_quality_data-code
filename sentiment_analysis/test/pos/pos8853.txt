As a pregnant woman, I am always at risk of feeling queasy or nauseous without warning. Its been a big help to find these bars to curb those feelings! One thing about the flavor (but take with a grain of salt as pregnant tastebuds are out of whack!) --the blueberry is not a strong flavor in the bar. I still really like the taste (like the hints of ginger!) but it's not overpowering blueberry if that's what you are expecting! The bars are filling without weighing you down---which is a big plus too when you are pregnant and have less room in your belly:) Highly recommend for anyone experiencing nausea!
