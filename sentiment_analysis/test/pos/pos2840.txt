I've been using this for about a week now. I live in a very hot & humid area so this is perfect for me. I had one of the kinds with the suction cup, and it worked really well for about a month. After one day of 100* weather, I came to my car and found the suction cup had pretty much melted.That experience prompted me to look for an alternative. This is great! It fits just inside the CD player slot, it doesn't go too far in, but far enough to keep it steady. The best part is how easily you can insert and remove the phone. I wrestled with my old one. This one has an easy button system so you can get your phone in and out with only one hand.My only advice would be to look at your car's CD/console area before you buy. I have a manual shift car, but it is not in the way at all. My stereo has a big volume knob right under the CD slot. That wasn't a problem, I mounted this to the right side of the knob with the phone facing me. Overall I'm very happy with this phone holder.
