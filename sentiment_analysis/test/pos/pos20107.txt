I have been waiting on the Nextbit Robin since its Kick Starter campaign. When I saw that Amazon was offering it at the pricethat early adopters on Kick Starter got I had to pull the plug and buy one. I love this phone. It feels great in the hand. It is very lightin weight. The screen resolution and brightness is fantastic even in bright outdoor light. I read a lot about the speakers being poorin sound quality but believe me they are not. I find that I have really turn them down more often than not and the clarity of the sound isspot on. Both the front and back cameras do a fantastic job of capturing images for both photos and movies. Robin is a pure Androiddevice in that it doesn't come with all the bloatware that comes with most other phones. It will get updates from Android at the sametime they roll out to Google's own smart phones so you don't have to wait months for an update.My only complaint with this phone (as with most phones today) is battery life which I would put at marginal. I tend to usemy phone for streaming videos and I know that is part of the reason why the battery doesn't last very long. I can stream about 31 1/2 hour movies before I have to recharge the battery. The good thing is that it comes with USB C with quick charge and I cancharge the phone back to full in a couple of hours.I HIGHLY recommend this phone to anyone looking to buy a new  phone.
