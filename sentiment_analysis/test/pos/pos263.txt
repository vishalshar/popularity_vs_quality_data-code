Bought these after buying the Samsung IconX, IconX was a awesome fit and sound, but you can only pair it with your Samsung Phone. I love samsung stuff but I dont like the limitation on this so I went for the BRAGI and I have to say I like these better except the charger is REALLY BIG and heavy. Still I sent Samsung back and keeping the Dash... easy to use and works with everything I have bluetooth which is about everything I own!
