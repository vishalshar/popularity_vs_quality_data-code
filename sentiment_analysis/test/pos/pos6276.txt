I have not had the opportunity to use it for very long, but it appears to be sturdy & well-suited for carrying laptops & accessories in various places, including doing geologic field work in various parts of the world (North America, South America, Australia, etc.), which I have done during the past.  It is large enough to carry my old 24" X 18" heavy laptop (which I still use)!
