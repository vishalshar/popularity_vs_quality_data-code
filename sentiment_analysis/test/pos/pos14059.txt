I would be lying to you if I told you that the item looks a little cheap when you first get it. But I guess that is ultimately irrelevant because, well, it is a light that goes into your toilet. As long as it does what it is supposed to do, right? Using it could not be any easier. You simply insert some AAA batteries (not included) into the device, and suction it to the side of your toilet. A little light folds over the side of your toilet into the inside rim, which you also suction on as well.As a quick aside, I have read a good number of people complain about the suction cups not working. I will tell you that simply cleaning and wiping down the areas before you apply it, as well as (this is the most important part) applying a little bit of water to all the suction cups before you apply them will all help create a perfect seal. I did this, and the device has not budged since I have put it on.Getting back to the device, once properly installed, you press the button on the side of the motion sensor, which starts the light cycling all of the colors. The colors transition nicely, and if you just want it to show one color instead of all of them, you simply push the button when it is on your color, and you are good to go. The motion sensor itself works pretty well, as the light will only turn on when it is reasonably dark in the area.Overall, the IllumiBowl works exactly how it is advertised to. In the end, that is all that really matters.
