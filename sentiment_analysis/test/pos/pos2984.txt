The Screen of this Laptop is good, i thought the same as you guys when i first played a video, U just have to Adjust the Screen setting on Intel HD Graphics Control Panel, Color Settings etc.. Also turn off or Adjust Asus Splendid Technology, Thats all.  Also u may notice itsnt charging while has 95% or more of the Battery, Itsnt a problem it just a Asus tec that helps Ur battery life keep long, then u get less than 95% it charges again normaly.
