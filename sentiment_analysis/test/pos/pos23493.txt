I've had the 512GB (effectively 480GB, which is OK with me) version of this drive for a couple of months. So far I've used it exclusively as the home for my Lightroom catalog and photos; I sometimes need to use Lightroom away from home on my MacBook. With the catalog and photos on this portable drive, that's easy and not disruptive. I haven't tried to measure transfer rates. I am very satisfied with the speed with which this drive operates. Both my computers have internal SSDs, so I've been spoiled by how nimbly SSDs work. It's nice to have an SSD external drive, and the price for this one wasn't ridiculously high.When I received this drive I formatted it for the Mac OS, and have used it with two Macs with no problems.This is such a small and lightweight drive that it's ideal for travel. I'm soon taking a vacation where every ounce of luggage is going to matter. I'll probably take this along as backup storage for my photos.
