This thing is more like a game then learning.The keys light up and wait for you to get it right before moving on. This allows you to work on the parts you know at speed and slow through the parts you are struggling on.Works with iPhone/Pad even the mini, also android. There are included Lightning and micro usb cables for connecting your devices. These are not the same cables that come with your phone/tablet. The connect to the keyboard with USB "B" plug.The games and drills are fun and you can purchase songs to expand your library.Has a foot pedal jack and a mic jack so that you can sing along through the integrated speakers. Also has a headphone jack for when you need to be quiet.I look at this and wonder how this hadn't come out till 2015.
