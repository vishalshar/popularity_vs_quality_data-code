I researched the various different iphone bike mounts including Lifeform, Rokform and Satechi.  I was looking for a mount for my iphone 5 that provides stability on a mountain bike oversized stem but is easy to install and use.  Also, I was looking for a mount that did not require a bulky iphone case.  The Quad Lock has exceeded my expectations.The pros for me are:1.  Very easy to install.  The kit includes zip ties and their rubber band type mounts meant to fit different size stems.  I used the zip ties and installed it within a minute.  It was extremely easy.2.  Very stable on the handle bars and easy to attached and detach iphone.  The case clicks in quickly and holds the iphone securely.  I have yet to take a very rough ride so I will update the review once i do.3.  Low profile iphone case that is still functional.  This was very important to me as i typically don't like using iphone cases because they are too bulky.  This case is as low profile as I would imagine you could get with a mounting case.  Very easy to slip into your pocket when the case is on which I love.  Also, easy to use the various buttons on the iphone when the case is on.Cons:1.  None that i can think of.
