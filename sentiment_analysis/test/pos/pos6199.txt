These are much larger than what they appear, but once they are on they look good.  A little difficult to put on as it's a TIGHT fit to get the bracket on that hold it on, which, makes it difficult to get off once its on.  From the feel of it, On and Off a couple times and you might decide to just leave them on. Seem to be sturdy and well made. I like them, just not "perfect" (or 5 stars).
