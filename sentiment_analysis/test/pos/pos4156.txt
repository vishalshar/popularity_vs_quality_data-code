Stay tuned for a few tips below.I've owned a few pebble, pebble steel (not the time), and for me battery life is a priority over geeked out functionality.  I bought the Rose Vector Luna on a very good sale, so the price was right. My review is based on a price that is comparable to a new Pebble Steel or other Android watch of comparable style to the Vector.PROS:First, battery life truly is amazing--my first out of box charge was rated to last about 28 days, with a lot of fiddling and tuning, testing and button pressing.  The second charge is on day 17 with 55% left, to go an estimated 37 days.  I'm a moderately low user--getting about 40-60 message alerts a day.Style is much nicer than the pebble.  The watch is larger. It is about the size and look of the Moto 360 2nd gen 46mm.  The ability to customize streams on watch faces allows me to choose simple ones with minimalist appeal, and quickly go to a face that has 6 or 7 streams to check the info I want at a glance.  The always on watch is so much better than the color LCD watches which only turn on with the right flick or button press.  The minimalist notification ring around the watch face is nice and private. The calendar bars (which can be turned off with the middle button) is a very nice feature that gives me quick review of my workday.TIP: If you roll your wrist *twice* to "glance" at the screen (like you might to auto-view a notification) the backlight will come on.  Too fast or too slow does not trigger it.  This is similar to how the pebble lets you shake the watch to activate the backlight.Hardware is firm, perhaps heavy (which I like, being a built man) and very elegant as well.  It feels very sturdy, well constructed.TIP, the Moto 360 2nd gen 46mm glass is the same size, and tempered glass protectors for that Moto fit the Vector Luna just fine.App (vers 1.6.0 currently) is nice looking, and functions well enough.  I found that at first it cut into my phone battery and was not pleased.TIP:  I turned off permissions to the app for Camera, Location, Microphone. This solved the phone battery use. It's practically nonexistent for this app and data use went down significantly.  I suspect it is the Location permission that was using data and eating battery.Support has been excellent for me.  The first day I got it, I wanted to set up a weather stream and couldn't find my city.  I contacted support and withing a few hours, they got back and told me that their cloud database (which has the cities) had been down, but they fixed it. Sure enough, I found my city and now all is well for weeks.TIP: Use the App to contact support rather than the website or direct email. They seem to respond quicker from the app.CONS:Compared with the Pebble, the Vector is missing a few features--1) the ability to reply on the watch to texts/messages with a pre-written quick text. I used that feature when I was driving or in meetings if I felt I needed to get a quick "busy now" message to a priority client or person.2) no compass. While I rarely used it on the pebble, I still miss it a little.3) Scheduling off time, or easily muting the vibrations from the watch itself.  Vector needs to fix this.  The idea that they regulate when the watch gets notifications and determine this for me through their "smart programming" is not ideal.  So far, I have only been woken once by a notification. Once is more than it should be, since sleep is a priority.4) There's no Pandora app.  The music app works well enough.Other minor issues:The bluetooth range seems less than with the Pebble, but it reconnects quickly and seamlessly.There is no option to review previous notifications that have been cleared.Email messages only display the sender and subject, and nothing from the email.The trades for battery life are well worth it.  I hope Vector can fix (1) and (3) in future software updates.  as for the compass, it's not a feature and I knew it going in.I won't go back to the Pebble now, with this kind of battery life, elegance in style and form. The Vector is a watch first.  I have a good phone, and I don't need a battery-draining phone wannabe on my wrist.
