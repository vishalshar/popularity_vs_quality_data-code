Hand down the best cell phone or tablet car mount you can buy, extremely easy to put on and take off. It goes in the CD slot and not in the vent so you dont have to worry about breaking your vent. I have the NVidia shield K1 tablet with a hard shell case and pretty heavy for an 8 tablet the mount holds it flawlessly and I have a IPhone 7 plus in a Otterbox commuter case.  You can rotate from landscape to portrait with ease and it stay in place. The gel pads really hold the devices in place and placing a device in the mount is a snap literally, you press the device on the plate and the pads snaps close holding you device in place.  Releasing the device is just as easy press the ratchet release lever with your thumb and remove your Phone or tablet with One motion.
