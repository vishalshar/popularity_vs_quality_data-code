I'd give this a 4.5 but don't have that option.  I'm very happy with my leaf.  It is very attractive (the color is lighter than I was expecting but very pretty and neutral) and it looks more like jewelry  than a fitness tracker.  The app is easy to use and has  nice graphics and motivational messages.I have a slightly larger wrist so would've loved the option to get m/l band.  I was able to barely get the s/m on and gently stretch it and it has gotten more comfortable in the past week.  The chain works nicely for a necklace and it clips anywhere as needed.On my wrist I find that it tracks more steps than my fitbit (i've been wearing  both for now).  On the necklace it tracked fewer steps than my fitbit, which I always have clipped to my bra.  The sleep tracking seems accurate as well.  I am not using the cycle tracker option.
