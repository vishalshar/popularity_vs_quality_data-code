When I initially saw the Brush Hero on Amazon, I thought that it would be something that I'd use infrequently and only when the weather was warm since I was certain that I'd get soaked from the "splatter."  Not so!  This rotating brush is really COOL!  I use it, and keep looking for things to scrub.  Works great on poopy bird-baths.  Incidentally, the speed is slower than I had originally thought.  NO SPLATTER.  Very user-friendly.Mr Clean and Happy Birds
