If you invest in good quality make-up brushes, you absolutely MUST get The Brush Guard.  The Variety Pack comes with Brush Guards for both face and eye brushes.  I would recommend ordering a few packages - or ordering a couple of packs of the Eye Brush Guards and a couple of packs of the Face Brush Guards.  I invest in professional grade make-up brushes and The Brush Guards keep all my brushes in as-new shape.  An absolute must have product - simple, elegant, easy to use - simply wonderful.  I'll never be without a Brush Guard for each and every one of my brushes!
