Love the integration with Homekit.. It makes it so much easier to operate. Geofencing is a must. Sometimes i am back home with bags with groceries and love that i dont have to shift everything in one hand to be able to use the other one for unlocking .. Also, "honey, did you lock the door" is a thing of the past. She still does ask , but i lock it from a comfort of my bed..
