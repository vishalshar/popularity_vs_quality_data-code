I ordered this for my puppy, since she's teething.  The material is the perfect firmness for the chewing associated with teething, and my older dogs seem to enjoy it as well.  It bounces great, is pretty flexible, but stands up well to the play. This toy does float very well, and it comes in several different colors.  You do, however, have to be pretty good to get it to fly like a Frisbee.  It's a great dog toy though, and the fact that it's USA made makes me feel much more secure about the safety of the toy.  The proceeds from the sales of these toys allow the designers to financially assist widows and children in Ethiopia, so you're getting a great gift for your pup and helping others as well.
