4.5 out of 5 stars. The battery uses sound to setup the wifi info. Mine correctly setup the first time. Installing in the smoke detector was easy and start to finish only took about 5 mins. I have seven wired smoke alarms. If one sounds, they all sound. I only needed to buy one battery, which is great compared to buying seven Nest Protects.I tested the alarm twice and both times the battery correctly notified me via the iOS app. There is a slight delay between alarm and notification, maybe ~10 seconds. That is not an issue since this is used for remote monitoring.What keeps this from being a 5 star, the fact that anyone that wants notifications will need to install the app and log into the account. That is an extra burden if I would like my neighbors to get notified while I'm traveling.Overall, I highly recommend this battery.
