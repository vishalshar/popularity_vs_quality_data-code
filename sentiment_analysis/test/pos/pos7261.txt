We bought this "robotic ball" and were worried we would use it for two weeks and never use it again. So far, the Sphero has not fallen prey to a shelf. Sphero is fun, can teach some basic programming skills if y work through one of Orbotix free apps and it has some sweet dance moves. Not sure it is the best money ever spent, but is a great silly (but pricey) toy for the nerd in your family or friend group.I must admit - I went back and forth about buying an Ollie or a Sphero 2.0. I am happy with my decision to purchase the Sphero instead as it has more App Store games and is waterproof. If you are more into racing, I would recommend the Ollie.
