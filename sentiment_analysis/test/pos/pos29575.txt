I needed a camera when the children grew up and began to stay at home alone. I chose Oco and I'm happy with my choice.The camera seemed so great. Setup was very easy and quick. Picture quality is good, the night mode and microphone works very well. Nice features like motion activated alerts. The remote monitoring is free, if you don't need recording.Yes, I recommend this camera and its service.
