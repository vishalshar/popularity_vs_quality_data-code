I got these to use it for my paint brushes. I wasn't sure which size is good so the variety pack was a perfect starter kit. Personally, the ex. small size is the most useful one as that fits my size 8 Windsor and Newton Watercolor brush. It slides on easily and keep the bristle in shape. Perfect for daily use and travel.For makeup brushes, ex small is probably good for any smudging brush and eye liner brush unless the handle or the base of the brush are significantly thicker than the bristle. In that case, this won't work too nicely.Overall, I'm happy that I got these. I will definitely order again.
