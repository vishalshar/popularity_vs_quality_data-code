This is a natural wonderful product..it is non irritating at all.for me anyway..no more paying yo have my eyelashes tinted...I like this natural product so so much... to be honest with you..I don't think about reapplying it!  It does the job...and does NOT irritate my eyes...I really don't like that Heavy "icky" feeling of mascara.  I'm sold on this for life!
