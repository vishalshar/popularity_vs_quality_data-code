This emergency crank radio is awesome!The reason i really wanted this was because of my daughter. She is 5 and loves music but now a days everything is handed to kids for free with no lesson involved. So now i taught my daughter that if you want something you have to work for it. Every time she uses this i time her and have her spin the back for 1 minute. It doesnt really do much at the pace she does it but at least she get the idea and understands that if she wants the radio she has to work for it. May not be alot but at least she understands the concept.Now for me i love this because its great pool side. I have not done alot of camping but i would only imagine this is perfect for camping as well. There is an alarm on this, a phone charger, and 2 different light modes which is what makes me assume this would be perfect for camping. There is also 2 battery compartments in the back. one is the rechargeable hand crank batteries. the other is for 3 AAA batteries with a switch on the back to switch to and from the AAA or rechargeable batteries.Disclosure: This product was sent to me for review.
