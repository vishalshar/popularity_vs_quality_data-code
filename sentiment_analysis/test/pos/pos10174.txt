This is my first fitness tracker, so I can't compare it to any others, but I love it. I was looking for something that would help me figure out how much I was moving, and hopefully motivate me to move more, but I really didn't want to wear something like all my friends' industrial-looking fitness trackers. The Leaf absolutely fits the bill. It's attractive and versatile. I mostly wear it as a bracelet, but when I want to be more discreet I clip it to my bra or my waist band. I don't love the way it feels as a necklace; it's a big pendant so it bangs around a bit when I move, but I do always get compliments when I wear it this way. It has absolutely motivated me to move more, which has had a positive effect on my weight, and it's also clued me in to how little sleep I was actually getting. I just feel healthier with it as a part of my life. More active, more motivated, more rested.
