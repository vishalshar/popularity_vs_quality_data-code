Good quality rain jacket. I normally wear a size 4/6 misses and the XS fits me well, though not much room for a bulky sweater underneath. The front zipper is metal and didn't run smoothly upon delivery, though it has improved with use. The only other thing I would change would be pocket size/depth. They are rather small and shallow. Keys fit fine, but my iPhone doesn't feel super secure in the pocket.
