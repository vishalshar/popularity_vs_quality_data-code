This watch is pretty accurate. Waterproof and does not need a weekly charging as most of the trackers on the market. I have it for more a month now and I am very happy with it. The sleep calculation is good because it helps me to manage my sleeping time better. The app does not have a good grade but I am sure there will be some updates in the future. Design is fantastic and very simple : the only down side is that it's a little thick. But overall a very good product
