I have two boys, ages 9 & 11 who really need to work on memorizing their math facts better, so I thought this game might help. I didn't expect it to be so strategy-based, but that's going to be a good thing. We've only played the game once, and right now my boys aren't using good strategy, and are relying heavily on addition to play the game. I can see that as they play the game with my husband and I more, they are going to see the benefits of thinking strategically and they will want to use more multiplication, division, and subtraction. The first time we played, they mostly just tried to move their pawns forward to win, but by the end they were starting to see that moving forward isn't always the best strategy. I think this game is going to be a lot of fun to play for many years to come. Because of the strategy involved, this isn't just a game to help kids learn their math facts, but a game that helps develop deeper mathematical thinking and the ability to predict several moves ahead, like in chess. My kids don't love the game yet, but I see its potential, and I think they are really going to enjoy it once they get the hang of it.On another note, I have an old board game I got when I was a kid called "X From Outer Space" made by Discovery Toys. I used to like it because of the cute little plastic pawns shaped like aliens flying spaceships and the cute space theme. (I got it around the time of the Challenger explosion, and I was very interested in outer space.) My boys have played it with me a couple of times and liked it, but all it really does is help you learn multiplication. There really isn't any strategy to it at all, so after a while it starts to get boring, and it really holds no challenge for parents, so it's a pretty short-lived family game.  While I still enjoy it for kids learning their times tables, Prime Climb is really a much more interesting game and offers more room for growth .
