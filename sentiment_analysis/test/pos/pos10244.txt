I was pleasantly surprised, as this didn't have any Amazon reviews when I purchased it.  The device is really small and easy to carry. I attached it to my key chain and use it once a day which is a huge change for me. Since I work and travel a lot I never got to monitor my health. The app is super friendly and easy to navigate. I am planning to purchase one for my father
