I have a couple Ilumi bulbs. I like that they do not require any sort of hub. The app is lame does not seem to make full use of the bulbs abilities. The Ilumi site has been promising an app update for months. I love the bulbs and effects though and plan to stick with Ilumi over other smart bulb products.
