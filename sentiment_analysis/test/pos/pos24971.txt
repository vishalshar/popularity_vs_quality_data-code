My wife adores her robin and gets compliments on it all of the time. Nextbit values the participation and feedback of their owners, and actually wants to update their phones (looking at you, Motorola!) with later versions of Android. The cloud thing is a gimmick, and the phone really could have used an SD card slot. But despite of that omission, it's an awesome phone all around that deserved far more praise and attention than it got.A good phone by a small company that actually gives a damn about their users. What more could you want?
