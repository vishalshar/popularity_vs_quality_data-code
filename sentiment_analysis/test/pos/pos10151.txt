My kids, husband and I all love these vitamins. They taste great (although I prefer the yellow and orange ones over the red), which makes them much easier to remember to take because we actually want to eat them. I buy them frequently enough that I wondered what the difference between the adult and children's version was, so I called Smarty Pants to ask and they said none--they are exactly the same! The only difference is the dosing: adults take 6 a day and kids take 4 a day. So I buy whichever one is cheaper.
