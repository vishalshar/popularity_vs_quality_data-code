These bags/wrappers are awesome.  I wasn't too sure when I first started using them, so I jumped on their website which provides great info.  As a single household, buying large blocks of aged white Cheddar from Costco is daunting, at best.  These hold up extremely well and the cheese maintains its flavor and moisture.  I'm going to use these for Christmas presents this year with a block of cheese -- that's how great they are.
