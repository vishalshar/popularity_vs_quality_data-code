I have used Spire for two whole days and so far I love it. I like that it tells me when I am tense and need a break, when I have not a taken a deep breath. In summary, I am learning a lot about how my body and mind responds to day-to-day activities such as conversations, meetings, work tasks and even a podcast about productivity made me tense... The product works very well.
