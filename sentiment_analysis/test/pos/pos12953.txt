Honestly, I purchased this pitcher for vanity reasons - because I love the look of it! But after using it for a couple months, I have to say that it's the best filtered water option I've tried to date. I have a filter in my refrigerator and I also have the Brita but I find changing the filters frustrating and time consuming. It is so easy to use and to replace Soma filters. I love that you don't have to touch the filters and that they just pop in easily. Plus, Soma offers a really easy program where they send you filters every two months so you don't forget and have to worry about when to replace filters. Highly recommend for equal opportunity functional and aesthetic purposes. It looks and works great!
