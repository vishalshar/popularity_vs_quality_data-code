I wasn't sure what to expect.  I have read every review here and accross the internet for the Fugoo, UE Boom, Creative Roar, TDK A33, Libratone Zipp, both Bose, three Klipsch, Nyne Bass, Big Jambox and G-Boom.  So many to choose from and no store nearby to hear them all.  It really came down to the Boom and the Fugoo because of reviewed sound quality, size, and splash proofedness.I really wanted to buy the Roar, but its not really a beach/camping/travel type speaker.The Nyne Bass was simply too big.  Maybe if it were just going to sit on a mantle, but I have a receiver and speakers in that case.The TDK was in the running till the end, but appeared to be a notch or two below the Fugoo and The Boom. Battery tech/life specifically.I think the Mini Bose is ugly.  The Big Bose lacked battery life and sportyness. And honestly not a fan of bose.I was so concerned about sound, I really considered the Zipp.  I really believe it has the best sound quality from my "research", but no bluetooth, 4 hour battery, and its too delicate to toss around in a bag or cooler or have kids play with it.The G-Boom seems too big also, but such a great price and such good reviews. If it was jobsite only, pretty sure this one would be a no-brainer, but I work in an office.For the Klipsch 3 its too big. Andrew Luck is a big guy and it still looks huge in his arms. D batteries . . . really?Klipsch 1 had several bad reviews here on amazon that I believed.  One compares it unfavorably to the Boom.  If its even in the same sound neighborhood and over $100 more than the Boom . . .Klipsch Gig, too many bad reviews.The Big Jambox has been out for like 3 years.  They should rev it yearly and call it the Big Jambox III or something, like Bose does, to make me at least feel like they updated the tech.  If they had, I probably wouldn't have even done the research and just bought that one right of the bat.UE Boom and Fugoo checked all the boxes.  The only complaint I heard about the Fugoo was loudness which it sounded like it was addressed in several firmware updates.  It had the best battery, most water proof, and maybe eensy bit better fidelity.  So I bought it.  The few days it took to receive,  I was concerned that I should have bought the Boom.I opened the box, paired, put on some pink floyd.  It sounded fantastic but definitely played way too quiet.  I had it turned up all the way, 3 feet from my wife and she didn't even yell at me to turn it down.  From someone who gets angry when I chew too loud, that is saying something.  I went to the website, downloaded firmware and put it on there.  Painless 5 minutes.  I could probably piss her off from the next room now.I'm very happy.  Its impressive engineering that they get the bass and sound quality from something so relatively small.  It meets all my needs.  I can't say if its better than the Boom, but I'm not really worried about it.Hope this helps.
