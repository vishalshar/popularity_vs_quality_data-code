4 stars for how much I like the game.  If we include the fact that the game is small enough to fit in any pocket or the change compartment of your car would mostly make it a 5 star.  This game really fits the 'best bang for your buck' easily.The rules are easy, the game plays fast and is very tactical for what it is.  Very good game, 4 stars is still very good.
