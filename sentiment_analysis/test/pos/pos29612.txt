These came in on time and in good condition. I purchased these because my son has food allergies and it's hard for him to eat at restaurants so I pack my own food for him but he has to eat it cold. This way all I have to do is ask for some warm water and mix so he can have a hot meal!  He loves the flavor of these and it also has some protein in it too! The packaging makes it easy for on the go!
