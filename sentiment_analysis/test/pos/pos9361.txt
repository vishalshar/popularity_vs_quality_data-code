As someone who has had psoriasis since I was 15, I am so happy to have found this product. If you had seen my skin before, you would be amazed at how my skin looks now. I had red scaly and flaky skin all over my arms and legs and I was so embarrassed to go out with short sleeves or shorts. I have tried everything from over the counter and prescriptions by my dermatologist but I was not able to get any continued relief. My dermatologist suggested that I try some natural products instead of all the toxic steroids. I tried a few out there but didn't find any that helped. I then came across Metaderm from searching on amazon and I decided to give this a try. I got the Metaderm spray first (I posted my review there) but I have since moved on to this Metaderm cream because I feel that this is somehow better for me. Anyway I put it on twice a day, but I didn't notice any change for the first 2 weeks. But after that my skin quickly began to change. All the scales and flakes started to dissappear and my skin became pinkish like it was starting to heal up. It is now the 4th week that I am applying this and now my skin is so clear that it is barely noticeable. For the first time ever in a long time, I wore shorts to the supermarket the other day and I was so happy. I have been now using it all over my spots and my skin looks so great. I am really hoping that this will continue to keep up.
