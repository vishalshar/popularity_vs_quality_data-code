This is a great product is 100% better than the lens cover that comes with the phantom 4. I will admit that I was a little worried that it wouldn't protect the gimbal during travel but in my opinion it protects it just as good as the original one does. I was not pleased at the price considering that is was a cheap piece of plastic when in reality it is a hard durable plastic which feels to be coated in some sort of scratch preventing material, which means that it will not scuff up your investment. This made the price seem extremely reasonable. One last thing, I just can't stress enough how easy it is to apply and remove this product. It is truly like night and day and if you use your phantom 4 as often as I do then you will understand once you have purchased this.BTW my buddy also has a phantom 4 and right when he saw/used mine he ordered one.
