This IS like movie popcorn. We used our Presto popcorn popper with one tablespoon of this oil on the top of the POWER CONCENTRATOR and 1/3 cup of POP SECRET Big and Fluffy popcorn. The popping started irregular popping intervals at about three minutes and I took it out of the microwave. All but a few kernels remained not popped and the popcorn was huge and had a great taste. I then sprinkled a bit MORE of this liquid over the corn and lightly salted with Kernel Season's unflavored popcorn salt. AWESOME corn! And at what price, a tenth of the price of theater corn?So when you are at home watching movies or just want a great snack, this popcorn popping oil and a bit more once popped, is just superb. Six of these bottles came with the purchase, and I thought that was a LOT, an awful lot. So I gave away two bottles. So now I am thinking that it would be horribly rude to ask for them back.... I didn't know this stuff would be THIS great!
