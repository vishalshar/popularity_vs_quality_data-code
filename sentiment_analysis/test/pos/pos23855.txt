I live in Napa Valley and work in Silicon Valley. I take it on the ferry from Vallejo to The Embarcadero in San Francisco. From there I ride my Urb-e to the CalTrain Station (just past AT&T Park). I take Cal Train to San Mateo then ride! The Urb-e makes what would be the worst part of my day into the best part. Thanks! I get stopped all the time in the city by people who want to know what I'm riding. Several people have actually taken my picture.
