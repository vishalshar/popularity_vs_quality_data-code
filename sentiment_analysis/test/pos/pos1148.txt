I have the entire Osmo set but resisted buying this one for a long time as it's the replacement for a white board or lots of papers! Seemed a waste of a lot of money...However the quality of the unit is really amazing - whiteboard is really big and matches well with the Osmo set. The attached markers are simply way better than anything we had seen. They are not smelly and the market tip is hard but smooth simultaneously. In fact, post using the markers, we also ordered quite a lot of markers from Yoobi.My daughter loves this and it's quickly become her favorite activity using Osmo.
