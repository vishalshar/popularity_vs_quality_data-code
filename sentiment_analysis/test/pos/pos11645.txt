All of us encounter those problematic little problems around the house...the end of our iPad charging cord seems loose, the new bathroom towel rack has bars which are not "attached" and fall out of the wall holders each time we reach for a towel, one of the feet of the crock pot fell off....I could go on and on.  This stuff fixes all this and MORE.  I purchased two packs and I have been fixing things like mad!  All I can say is STOP ME NOW...I am looking for things to repair now.  This product is as good as the advertisement!  Get yourself some and, as the package directs, "FIX THAT THING"!  Truly an amazing product.
