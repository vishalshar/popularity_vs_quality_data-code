The product is good.  It makes kids think.  Without more missions, I'm not sure of the lasting impact.  As a teacher, to make any impact I need several kits (I have one for my class of thirty).  At 300 each (250 each for 3) the price quickly gets out of reach.  As with nearly all STEM products, money is the barrier to getting kids developing their skills.
