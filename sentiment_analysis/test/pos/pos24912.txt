My son (and my husband) absolutely love the Anki Overdrive track.  We've had lots of family fun with the kit - my husband building elaborate tracks, my son picking out details about his car and character on the app, and me watching them spend hours playing together.  All in all, it's a fun high tech toy for everyone.
