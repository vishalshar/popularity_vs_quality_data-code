After reading all the reviews my husband and I were still on the fence about this product. There are a lot of problems with it, but there's also nothing else that is similar so we decided to give it a try. For the first 30 days we were pretty happy with it. It was easy to set up and use. The battery lasted a long time, and I even had to use it to track our dog once and it at least gave me the general direction he had gone.  Then on day 30, it stopped working.  I realized while out walking the dogs, that I hadn't gotten notification. I tried using the "locate" and it worked once, but then it didn't work. I hit the "track" button and nothing happened.  I have contacted support, and I'm waiting to hear back from them.
