This is an excellent company, and I take daily a few of their supplements. I love the fact that all of the ingredients are derived from plants and none are synthetic. For example, most supplements use ascorbic acid as vitamin C, however ascorbic acid is synthetically produced, and the body does not metabolize it the same way as it does naturally occurring vitamin C. The vitamin C included here is derived from oranges, as are other vitamins derived from other plants/seeds. Fantastic. Taste is great and I actually look forward to it. 100% organic and non-GMO.
