I love the cooler. The battery lasted all day with making about 10 rounds of frozen mix drinks and charging my phone. Got back to the room and still had half the battery left.Ice stayed frozen even in the partial sun.Wheeling the cooler in the sand was terrible but what cooler on wheels is not.Speaker is loud enough for around a pool or with friends at the beach, but not enough base.The cooler is expensive but it saves me from buying frozen drinks from the bar. About $200.00 worth.
