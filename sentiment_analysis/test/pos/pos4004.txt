I have had this chair for about a month and ......I LOVE IT! I am a gamer and I do a lot of homework on the computer, so I am on the computer a lot and my previous chair really put a strain on my back. I wanted to get a new chair and I didn't know what to get until I saw this. When i got this chair I extremely excited, but before i could use it had to put it together.....which took me about 25 minutes with the help of this video I found online ([...]). It is very adjustable and now when I get sleepy I would rather just stay on there chair and sleep on it rather than go to my bed. The cosmetics of this chair are great it really lit my whole setup. The chair comes with a head and back rest, but personally I only use the back rest.Pros-comfortable-adjustable-assembly/video-looks-adjustable arm rest-wheels work on carpet very well-very durable/long lastingCons-PriceOverall, I love everything about this chair even though it is kind of expensive I am willing to look over that because of the durability and GREAT comfort .
