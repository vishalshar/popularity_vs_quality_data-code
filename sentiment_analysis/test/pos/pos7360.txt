These socks are great - they have washed well, held up well and still fit well after a few months of wear and washing. The grip is sturdy and i've not had any problems with them slipping. They are very comfortable and well cut. I'm planning to purchase again to get a few more pairs in rotation. I bought a bamboo iteration of similar socks on amazon and they were pretty awful.
