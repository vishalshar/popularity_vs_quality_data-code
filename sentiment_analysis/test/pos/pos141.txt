I am giving this five stars because I love the shampoo. I ordered it in Citrus Vanilla and I really hate the Citrus Vanilla scent and when I order it the next time I'm going to order a different scent. But, in spite of the fact that I don't like the scent, I love this shampoo. It's like magic.I have long hair. Like long enough to donate it to locks of love. I don't love having long hair, but I do love my husband and he loves me having long hair. Long hair is a pain in the neck to take care of. One of the reasons it's a pain in the neck to take care of is that washing it and drying it is time consuming. If I don't use a blow dryer it takes most of the day for my hair to dry. Because it's such a pain I like to wash my hair as infrequently as I can get away with without looking like an unkempt greasy mess. I used to have to wash my hair every other day or every third day if I was stretching it. With this shampoo I am literally washing my hair once a week and it's not a problem.You'd think that a shampoo that lets you wash your hair once a week would completely strip your hair, but it doesn't. It's amazing. My hair is soft and smooth and doesn't get lots of wispy fly aways. Also, I used to regularly comb handfuls of hair out of my head and since I started using this shampoo I'm loosing a lot less hair. I don't have a clue why that is.The other thing I like about this shampoo is that a little goes a long way. I think that because I can use about two quarter's worth of shampoo  (lather, rinse, repeat) once a week this is an extremely economical choice. I've been using this for almost two months and I anticipate that the bottle is going to last me at least six.
