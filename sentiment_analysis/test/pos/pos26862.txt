Puchased Tone-y-Bands for my mom after she had shoulder surgery. She was always athletic and was having a hard time after her surgery because she wasn't allowed to do much. These allowed her to keep her arms toned and feel like she was still able to be active.  Also, I purchased my own pair afterwards because of how great her results were. I love them and wear them around the house to do house work. These bands are GREAT!
