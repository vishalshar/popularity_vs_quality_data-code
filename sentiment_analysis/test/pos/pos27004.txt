Works great for my new iPhone 7. It's slimmer than the Rokform case I had for my iPhone 6s. Like the clear back. I even find that, for some reason, it stays on the belt clip better than my last one. Now I actually can use the clip whereas before, I was always afraid of the phone falling off. Hopefully, it will stay this way. Love the Rokform accessoriesÂ—from the bike mount to the window mount to the tripod mount as well as the magnet mounts. I've been using them for a few years.
