I've bought Peanut Butter & Co. "Dark Chocolate Dreams" dark chocolate peanut butter spread in the full size container before, and I'm happy to see it's available in convenient, individual sized dipping cups that are easy to bring to work or keep in my purse for whenever a snack is needed. These cups are generously sized and really hit the spot when I'm hungry- especially when I have a sweet tooth too. My favorite combo is to dip pretzel sticks into this chocolate peanut butter as it balances out the sweetness, but fresh apple slices also taste yummy dipped in this chocolate peanut butter- and there are plenty of other tasty combinations. The main ingredient is peanut and, not surprisingly, peanut is the dominant taste. But the added cane sugar and cocoa give this peanut butter dip a distinctly sweet chocolatey taste. This flavor tastes rich and is perfect for when I'm in the mood for something sweet that still has some substance- one serving has 7 grams of protein. One dipping cup at a time is definitely my limit as this snack is sweet and rich in fat too.Each 1-1/2 ounce serving has 235 calories, 2 grams of fiber, 17 grams of fat and 10 grams of sugar (about 2-1/2 teaspoons). The sugar is a bit high unless this is replacing a sweet snack or dessert, but the salt content (56 mg) seems reasonable. The texture is appealing as it's evenly blended and smooth with no oil separation and doesn't require stirring like a pure peanut butter That consists of just peanuts and salt. Instead, these dipping cups do add cane sugar, palm fruit oil, cocoa butter and other ingredients that make the texture different from pure peanut butter and make it less healthy too. Although I generally prefer regular old fashioned peanut butter as it's healthier and tastes better to me, these dipping cups are an enjoyable and convenient combination snack/dessert. I'm likely to buy some to keep on hand at work as these are a tasty, satisfying and convenient snack that's a nice switch at times from regular peanut butter and hits the spot when I'm hungry and want something sweet too.
