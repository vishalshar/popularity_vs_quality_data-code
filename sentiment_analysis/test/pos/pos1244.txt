I use this alone when I am not wearing eyeliner/eye makeup and under any mascara if I am wearing eye makeup.  I can tell the difference instantly.  It darkens the ends of the lashes where they are light instantly making them look longer.  I use it as a base coat if I am using mascara and feel like it does a good job protecting my lashes from the mascara.
