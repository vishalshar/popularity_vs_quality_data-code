Switched from wearing my hair straight to wearing it curly but couldn't find a diffuser for my beloved Elchim pro because it has a smaller barrel.  this one fits perfectly.  I like that I can detach the two pieces.  It does use a sort of rubber grip to stay on the barrel of the blow dryer but it is very secure. Order fulfillment was fast.  Thank you.
