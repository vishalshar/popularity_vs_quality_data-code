My teenage daughter just got a car and we needed to clear out space in the garage to fit three cars in during the winter time, so I looked around at a hoisting system we could use for our bicycles and decided on a couple of myLifters.  I bought two and they were precisely as advertised.  The app is easy to use, the bluetooth connections are completely reliable, my not-so-tech-friendly wife likes them and they reliably hoist the product up and down every time with no problems at all.  We've had them for two months and are completely pleased.  We had one issue with one and the manufacturer was reasonably prompt in their followup and everything was great - their customer service is awesome.  My only complaint is the price - if it was a bit cheaper, I'd buy more.  But the price we paid seemed fair enough in comparison with other non-bluetooth hoists and the bluetooth functionality is so magical and easy that it makes the price a bit less cringeworthy.
