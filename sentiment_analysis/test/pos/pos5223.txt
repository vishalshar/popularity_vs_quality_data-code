Great little pocket belt, nicely made2.  Stretches to fit the iPhone 6S Plus, even in the Lifeproof FRE case which is really quite large.  This one is their "Classic" version which is actually not designed for the 6S Plus, they have a "Large" version that is meant for these larger phones and passports.  This one can be stretched to fit, as you see in my video, but if you prefer not to have to stretch it, look at the Large model.3.  Has two compartments in the main pocket and a separate little pocket on the side - great for phone, money and keys.4.  Slim buckle is nice in that it's slim, but they are not the easiest to unclip5.  Sometimes there is some bunching at the buckles6.  This is the first pocket belt I've tested with foam padding added and I'm not too sure I like that feature.  It's nice because it does hold the pocket more open and gives it more form, but it also adds to the bulk.  Sometimes I like it and sometimes I don't.  If I had to pick only one pocket belt to own, I'd go with one without the padding because it's slimmer and more versatile.  But if I could have two, I would get both because they are each suited for different situations.If there are any questions, please feel free to leave me comments below and I will do my best to answer them.  Thank you!
