This is exactly what I hoped it would be. I tried Roku ...and I hated it. I tried Chromecast ...and I hated it. The Nvidia Shield only runs Android TV ...which falls WAY short. Chromeboxes at least have a real internet browser ...but the app availability, just like the other options, is nearly worthless. I was about to just give up and build a HTPC when I came across this device ...and it is exactly what I have been looking for. FULL Android with FULL access to ALL of the Play Store - or any APK you can find - everything that I have tried has worked great. The only gripe that I have is that the wifi is a little weak - streaming 1080p from my NAS is not perfectly smooth, but plug in an Ethernet cable and it plays perfectly, no problem for my use because I intended to use it wired anyway. I am looking forward to multi-user support in a future planned update. If Jide ever makes a robust 4K version (specs like the Nvidia Shield) I will buy it in a heartbeat, but this will do the job until then. This device could easily be a full desktop replacement for me (except for Photoshop/Lightroom). This is my best purchase of the year.
