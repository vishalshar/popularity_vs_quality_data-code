Simply a wonderful product.  I travel very often for business and being able to know where my luggage is when I land is wonderful.  The unit works very well.  The unit itself is slim and lightweight.  When on the ground between connecting flights, I like to confirm that my luggage arrived with me.  When I land at my destination, when I walk off the plane, I do a track, then I can see my luggage made it with me to the destination city.  It works very well.  A few detailed points:  1) Battery - the battery really does last a long time - 15 days or more.  Excellent battery longevity.  2)  One minor point that is a bit odd - the switch needs to be in the "on" position to charge it (it won't charge if the switch is off)  3)  Accuracy:  The unit uses the GSM phone networks/tower triangulation (not GPS satellite), which keeps the power consumption low (which is great).  Thus the accuracy is perhaps 300-500 feet (which is absolutely good enough for my needs), but it does not have GPS satellite (30 feet or so) level of accuracy.  For me, that's a great tradeoff.  The price of the unit I think is reasonable, and the service price ($29/year for unlimited tracking) is very reasonable too.  Overall very satisfied.  A+.
