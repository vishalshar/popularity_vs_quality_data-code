a little clunky, but perhaps this is considered older technology at this point.  unless there are legitimate heat exchange issues that i'm not considering they i imagine someone could make this same thing in a much smaller profile.  the manual switch buttons are also very small and hard to find as they are flush to the body on the side and sit below the plane of the outlet they control.  If you're not paying attention it may also be misleading how many of the 4 outlets are controllable.  It is only the 2 outlets nearest the plug that are smart outlets which are individually controllable.  You can not control the strip as a whole via app or other service.  The 2 on the far end are just convenience outlets.  other than all that it works great and this thing can handle the load of my 120v air conditioner without a problem.  The whole strip is rated for 15 amps so it should be hard to kill this thing.  good stuff
