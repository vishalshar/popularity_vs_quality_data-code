These have been great, especially at the 20 dollar price point.  The 2 Zwave outlets can be controlled independently and named seperately as well.  The only drawback is that Alexa can find some of them to control and some of them not so much.  I don't know why exactly.  Overall though, these can't be beat for the current price.
