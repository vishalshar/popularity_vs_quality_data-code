This product is well designed and seems durable. Having struggled with pressure sores for several years almost nothing has helped. I was hospitalized for a week or so and the 15,000 mattress is the one exception. My sores were better for a month or two after that but soon came back. Desperate, I decided to give this VERY expensive product a try.It is backed by a 30 day money back gurantee, but I never had the chance to give it a try since I ended up keeping it. Some companies are not good about that kind of thing, others are.Although I am very appreciative of this product, it is very expensive for what you get. I suppose that might be for insurance purposes, literally every medical supply company is ripping off the system by keeping prices very high. I do not know if this is covered by insurance though, my insurance certainly wouldn't.Lastly, I combined this with "Bed Sore and Pressure Ulcer Protection Undershorts" by GlideWear. I tried to include the link but it kept pulling up some kids book. It is available from Amazon though, and is a kind of padded underwear that helps a lot. It is also very expensive and likely only used by the desperate like myself.I also had to cut foam out and place it above and below the pad so that my body is laying flat on the pad. This is because the pad raises your butt off of the bed but your shoulders and legs are still below. This places a lot of pressure on your back. This is a HUGE downside to this product.Make sure to use it properly, with the sides pushed up against your hips. Not tight, but near enough that there is liquid underneath you.
