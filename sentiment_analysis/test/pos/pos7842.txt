First thing my reluctant niece said was, "I'm not really that into engineering, this toy  looks like it's more for my brother." After playing with the littleBits for just 20 minutes she had a change of heart and said, "Maybe I could do engineering, it's fun."The toy is extraordinary. Although she did need some coaxing to test out the different bits, once she got the hang of it, she was inspired to experiment and test on her own. I highly recommend this toy to encourage girls into technology. We own the Snap Circuits as well, but they were less appealing to my niece for some reason (Although both are excellent products and I would consider purchasing more of both). The biggest difference I see is that Snap Circuits are attached to a board (although it does have more pieces to experiment with), and littleBits are free to be incorporated into a craft project, since they attach to each other and don't need a base to snap into. So I see Snap Circuits as more of a STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math)-based toy and littleBits are more STEAM (STE "Art" M). Perhaps that is why they appealed to my niece since she loves art.
