I find this a very useful device to charge my iPhone from my Lenovo ThinkPad, or to upload pictures from the iPhone to the computer.The length could be an inch longer for better usability, but this works ok and takes up very little room. Worthwhile if long cords make your life too complex.Robert C. RossJanuary 2016Review sample provided by Amazon seller.
