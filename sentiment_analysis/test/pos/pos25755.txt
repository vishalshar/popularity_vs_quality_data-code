I love the lock.  Works as advertised.  I have read some of the other reviews that the auto-lock feature either does not work or works intermittently but so far that has not been a problem for me.  It does work everytime when I leave and when I arrive home.  I get the notifications that the door is locking and / or unlocking.  I have it integrated with Apple's HomeKit and to my surprise it works great.  I can tell Siri to lock or unlock the door and ask if the door is locked or unlocked and it works every time.  In fact I didn't buy the August Connect device because it does work with HomeKit.  I did purchase the keypad.  Like other reviewers I consider the keypad a must have.  In particular if you use the auto-lock feature.  I step outside constantly without my phone and the keypad works great.
