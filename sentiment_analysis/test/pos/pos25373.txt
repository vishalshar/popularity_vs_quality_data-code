I work with books-- a lot of books,I often go to library and take notes on famous quotes from lot of different languages books. I always find myself having to refer to translate from the printed the text paper, and copying it online was always a real chore. Not anymore-- with beescan. I just swipe the text and transfer it right to my mobile or computer, without even connecting, with the help of bluetooth. This pen has made it so easy to transfer text from printed work-- no matter what the language-- that it's gone from being a long, irritating chore to a simple part of my regular day that doesn't bother me at all. also directly scan a table into a excel file and we can save the file as jpg, word, pdf, excel, etc.I love BeeScan- it's made my life easier!
