This is an interesting gadget.  I tried it out last week while hunting.  I heard a little rustle in thick bruch behind me and shot a thermal image.  clearly saw that the image was of a whitetail deer, who then snuck out behind me.  Had I not had the camera. I never would have likely been alert to the deers presence.  Pretty cool.  I could also see the small thermal images of squirrels frisking around in the trees over 75 yards away.  Again, fun little tool
