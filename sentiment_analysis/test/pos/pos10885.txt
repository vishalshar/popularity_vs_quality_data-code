I'm using them with the LG Tone Infinim headsetÂ LG Tone Infinim HBS-900 Wireless Stereo Headset, Silver. I won't attest to what they look like when I wear them, but the Earhoox significantly improve the sound. The headset has "traditional earplugs" with three sizes of simple round buds to fit into your ear. Perhaps I have unusually shaped ears (don't we all?) but I couldn't get any of the round buds to fit snugly and stay in place. I looped the Earhoox over the earplugs, tried different bud sizes, and finally achieved a reliable fit.I have a cheap zipper case for the headset, and I need to pull the retractable earbuds out a little to fit the case.I need to use these for a few weeks to see if the perfect fit remains or requires fiddling to maintain.
