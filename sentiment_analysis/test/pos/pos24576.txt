Fast delivery, packaged with all the handy tools which makes the installation extremely conv Setup is quite smooth as well even there is some typos in the instruction however that did not affect much. Fingerprint scan is quicker than we thought. My family is happy about this purchase. For this price I say it is a pretty decent product.
