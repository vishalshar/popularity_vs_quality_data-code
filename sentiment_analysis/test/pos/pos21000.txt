This is amazing. It only took me about two min to set up and start using. I got it to see if my landlord was going in my apartment while I was gone, and also the added security is good to have. It's a great product to accomplish this. There are two things I wish it could do however, which is why I gave 4 out of 5 starts. 1) I would like to have the door chime on while having the alarm sound off, however it appears that you can only enable the door chime if the door alarm is also enabled. Not a big deal, but it would be nice. 2) I wish it could send notifications via text in addition to the email notification. I don't check every second of the day, and if the alarm was going off I wouldn't know until I checked my email. Sending it directly to my phone would be awesome.Maybe it can do these things and I haven't figured it out yet, or maybe they will be coming in future updates, not sure. BUT overall this is amazing and does exactly what I wanted it to do.
