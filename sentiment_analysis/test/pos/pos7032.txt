Packaging: Nice well-designed box with some useful information about the product. Individual mounting parts were in plastic zip locked bags.Instructions: Came with a nice colored fold-out of useful and easy to understand installation instructions.Product: The product is well designed feels durable. The parts are easily assembled and fit perfectly together. The knobs all work with ease and all the telescoping and lever actions are smooth. There are no loose fittings or rattling or anything else that suggest this is a cheap product.Function: Works as described. Installation was easy: clean the surface of your car, stick the round mat on it, then place the mount on the round mat and pull down the suction lever. It holds my Nexus 5 with ease. Even in the most extended telescoping position, the mount does not shake when I hit a bump on the road.Final thoughts: I'd recommend this car mount over any other car mount on Amazon as of 7/23/16. It is simply the best one available right not and it comes at a good price. Nice job, iOttie!
