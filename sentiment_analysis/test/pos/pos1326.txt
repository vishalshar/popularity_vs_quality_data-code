I'm just giving it 3 stars after a couple of hours with it.  I will probably up the star count in the future. (I have just upped the rating to 5 stars for the robot itself, but not the software...see added comments at end.)  First, it is quite small, and a bit pricey.  The dimensions given appear to be the shipping box dimensions.  The robot itself is approximately 3.5 inches long, 2 1/4 inches wide and 3 inches tall.  Interaction requires that your android device be connected, and thus you are disconnected from other wifi apps.  I've only found two Cozmo apps, but there will be more coming down the pipe.  It is essentially a table top gadget.Setup is pretty simple.  Three light cubes are included that the robot plays with.  I'm not sure what their function is other than to entertain the robot and to be used with games involving the robot and operator.  The robot sits on the charger, which can be plugged into USB or a wall outlet.There is no doubt that it is clever.  I'm impressed at what it does in such a small package.  There is a speaker inside, but it is very difficult to understand anything Cozmo says.  And Cozmo doesn't have a way of voice input, only the android app.I'm looking forward to more apps, and more familiarity on my part.  Just a few more capabilities could make it awesome.****After a week of playing with it I'm upping the stars to 5.  The five stars are for the robot itself.  It has clever movements and is able to convey some feelings. The Cosmo app used to drive it is lacking and gets only 2 or 3 stars at the moment.  There are 4 games to play, with the promise of more.  The robot has a small number of stunts, such as a wheelie, stacking cubes and knocking them over.  Thus the software leads to a bit of boredom after a while.  The app also requires the control device to be dedicated to the robot, and there is a bit of wifi setup required with each session.  Hopefully software upgrades will make it awesome.
