This little guy has basically been my savior over the past couple of months. My phone's charge port became less functional recently and for my phone to charge I had to apply a certain torque to the plug while it was inserted. Through the use of my nomad key and a few different battery packs I was able to keep my phone charged. I finally have my phone fixed but I can say that a couple of months of hard use are next to nothing to this cord. I will state that after a while it has taken on a distinct curve but I couldn't care less due to its outstanding performance.
