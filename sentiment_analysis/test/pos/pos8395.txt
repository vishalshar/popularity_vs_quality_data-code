I ordered the Blue Lotus Elixir, not the red lotus one. I guess it ran out of stock. The Blue Lotus (wild berry flavor) was delicious, had a cool greyish blue colour to it, and worked quite well. I definitely felt I had more energy after drinking it but not so much like a can of Monster or Red Bull. The reason is probably the sugar content. It only has 16g of sugar compared to 30g+ in Monster/Red Bull so there isn't an instant rush of energy. The drink is useful when you want to study for like exam but don't want too much energy. It works very well and lasts quite long, much like a cup of Japanese green tea.
