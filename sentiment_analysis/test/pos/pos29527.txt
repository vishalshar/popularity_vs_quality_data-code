We have a 10yo cat and it is not a scary one - he traveled a lot by car and train (haven't taken flights though :) ) so the training was very easy. He was wearing collar and did not take attention to it from the first try. Our property is about 1/2 acre with a fence all around and the cat was climbing the fence easily.I've put the wire about 2ft above ground (and under ground under the gates) and used stapler to secure it to the fence. After the first try the cat jumped off and ran to the house. One time he was able to escape under the gate when running after another cat. The collar was on 2nd setting then so I had to put it to 4th. Now the cat gave up its tries and does not escape even when chasing our neighbors cats.As we have a fence the cat was easily trained itself, I did not have to use this leash training. I think it would be a real pain to train a cat with only these marker flags and no real fence, especially when a cat is chasing another one or a bird.
