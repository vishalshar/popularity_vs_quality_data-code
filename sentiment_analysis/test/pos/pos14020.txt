This is a great product for promoting a child's imagination. I love seeing my younger cousins use their imagination to play and this smart toy uses technology to do just that. So far, they have so much fun slapping on the band and imagining the old wrapping paper roll (from Christmas) is a sword, magic wand, fishing pole or baseball bat.The PBS Kids app integration adds to the capabilities of the Moff band and offers an interactive experience that has really motivated my cousins to move around the house instead of just sitting in front of a tablet or TV.Overall, this is a great buy and as Moff continues to grow, I can only imagine more possibilities for this band. I would definitely recommend it -- but if you have more than one child in your household, I'd recommend buying more than one!
