This coffee maker lives up to all my expectations.  It's small and light weight, very simple to operate and brews a great cup of coffee from all the pods I've tried.  It has a removable drip tray and will brew up to 12 oz. of coffee.  While you can't use tall travel mugs, because of it's petite size, it does take wide mugs up to about 6 inches tall.  Have traveled with it now for about 2 months and cannot be more pleased.
