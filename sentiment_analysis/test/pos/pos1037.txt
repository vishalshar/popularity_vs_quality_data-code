Worked well for us.  We caught several field mice that had gotten in our basement and haven't seen or seen evidence of any more since we dumped this about three times.  I like that it does not require dumping a squished rodent like standard traps.  I didn't want standard traps or glue traps or poison since we have a cat, dog and small children.  This was the best option for us.
