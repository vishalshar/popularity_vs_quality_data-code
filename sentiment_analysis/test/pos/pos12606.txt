My son has this plugged into the USB on his desktop's keyboard. We incorporated our Amazon Alexa with the IFFT app, and with a simple phrase we're able to alert my son that I need him which is nice verses yelling "dinners ready!!!!" across the entire house.  Simple to instal, relatively easy to configure to use with Alexa.
