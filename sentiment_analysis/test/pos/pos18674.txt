Great thermal camera very low price compared to any other I've found. The frame rate could be better and the auto heat focus could be much better. In the cold I need to put my hand in the camera's view to keep everything turning red and white where I can no longer see an object of heat unless brought right in front of the camera. Has great range and good image quality. I found my camera to display an objects heat at a few degrees below the actual temperature.
