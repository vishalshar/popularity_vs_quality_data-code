Our dog was bleeding internally last November and we did surgery to remove two tumors on her liver.  Luckily it was the type of cancer that they typically do no treat after because they can live a couple of more years.  I started giving her this supplement in her food once a day to try something natural to help her stay healthy.  She is doing great and the amazing thing is her eyes have been foggy and had a blueish/green tint for about a year now and I just assumed it was her age (she is 13).  I just noticed in the past week or so that her eyes are totally clear now and back to their natural rich dark color.  Pretty amazing.  I am going to start giving it to our other dog now as a preventive measure.
