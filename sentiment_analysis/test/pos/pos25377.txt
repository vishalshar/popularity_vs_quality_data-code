We have the scoopfree litter box (2 of them) and replace the trays about once every 45 days.  Our cat had a urinary infection at one point and was put on a special urinary food as well as my wife wanted to make sure it didn't go without peeing, etc (she works in veterinary).We bought an automatic flow type stainless steel watering pan as well as buying 2 of the scoopfree litter boxes (one upstairs, one down).  Our cat hasn't had an issue since then.  There is no cat urine/poo smell in the house, even if you forget the refills and go a few extra days..
