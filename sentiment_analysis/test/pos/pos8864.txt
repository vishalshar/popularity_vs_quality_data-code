This is a great pen and even though I am not much of an artist, I have made some neat things and look forward to playing with it with my grand kids when they visit me.  It's easy to hold and manipulate and the instructions are clear.  BUT,THIS PEN IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO USE, and replacement filaments are hard to obtain.  The 3Doodler can only use 3 mm filaments, not the 1.75 mm filaments readily and cheaply available on Amazon for other pens.  $20 plus $5 shipping buys you 41 feet of 3 mm filaments with a 3-6 week shipping time from Hong Kong.  Expedited shipping is very expensive and will double the $20 price.  In contrast, you can get 280 feet of 1.75 mm filament, which is what all other pens use, in 2 days with Amazon Prime for $23,99.  3Doodler need to fix this filament problem for me to want to continue using the pen.
