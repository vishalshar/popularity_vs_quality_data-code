Great countertop yogurt maker. Holds the mix at approx 104 to 108 degrees F for as long as you need it to be - I use it for making non-dairy almond milk and soy milk yogurt. You MUST start by heating the liquid to 180 F over double boiler, reduce heat to 100F, add your culture (1/4 cup greek or 1/2 cup plain yogurt) to start. For non-dairy yogurt making, a probiotic powder capsule (just the powder - not the cap itself) mixed into the yogurt starter is also helpful. After yogurt is brewed (4-7 hours for dairy, 8-10 hours for soy, 10-14 hours for almond), you use the provided strainer to "drain"/reduce your finished yogurt to get the consistency of thick greek yogurt. Check internet for non-dairy recipes - you will need to add arrowroot and/or agar agar powder to get the almond milk yogurt to thicken.
