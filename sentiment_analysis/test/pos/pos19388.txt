I would give them 10 stars for taste and they're a perfect healthy snack.  Except the shipping would get 2 stars.  I first ordered 1 box of two 14 oz bags and I was surprised when it had some packing balloons (what are they called???) in there, but when I opened them the chips were in excellent shape.Because that was such a great experience later I ordered several boxes more and they did not come with the packing balloons and the chips are in bad shape.  Several handfuls of fine crumbs in the bottom of every package.
