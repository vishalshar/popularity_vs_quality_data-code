I've bought several shipments of Sugru, including 'sample' packets for friends. I like to keep a bunch of the little packets in the fridge, you never know when you're going to find another use for it. Though my initial purchase was mixed colors (white, blue, black, orange) I find that I prefer to keep just the black and white on hand; the colors are fun, but unless you want your Sugru project to stand out, it's rare that you will need the colors.  My favorite use so far has been to hide wiring in my car.  I run the wiring along the dash where I want it, then run a thin bead of Sugru over the wire and press it into the corners and crevices. It blends in with the dashboard (you can even texture it if you wish, using a washcloth or swatch of leatherette or something).  It's strong; the wiring stays hidden and doesn't come loose. I live in the desert where the interior of my parked car in summer can get up to 130 degrees, and the stuff stays stuck. I've also used it to make protective caps on sharp shower door handles, repair cracks in my car door's upholstery. Check out their website, there's always fun new ideas for using Sugru.
