I bought this after seeing the product on Shark Tank. I occasionally suffer from SI Joint pain, but mostly my back is healthy. But I have a job where I sit all day every day, and I began noticing my poster is not what it used to be and I wanted to start correcting that now before problems develope later. I have been using this at least once a week for about 5 months now and I am pleased with the results. I find that even when I am not wearing it I have tendency to correct my posture on my own. Also I used this several times a day during a recent flair up of SI Joint Disfunction and I think it help me get my range of motion back more quickly.
