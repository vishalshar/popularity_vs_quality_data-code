Sous vide is a great way to make a decent cut of steak taste great. And this aging sauce takes it to a new level. Just put in a tablespoon or two into the bag with the steak before sealing, and the steak comes out with a depth of flavor that's a real pleasure. Not exactly the same as dry aging a steak for a month, which affects the texture, etc., but with that in mind, it's a wonderful, and very easy, addition to the kitchen.
