One word.  Wow! The hex honey comb construction creates a subtle texture inside that feels amazing.  (Might have to try turning it inside out for her benefit)  No more of that old "shower in a raincoat" feeling with this one. The extra strength claim is not exaggerated. It can almost be re-usable. Priced reasonably too. I will never buy anything else again.
