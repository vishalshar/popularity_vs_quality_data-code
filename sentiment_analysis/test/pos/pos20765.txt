*I received this product for free solely for the purpose of testing and reviewing this product. All unbiased opinions are my own.This is a nice tracking device for most items. I find it interesting how it connects to my phone via Bluetooth in order to transmit its information to my phone. In order to use this tracking device, you need to download the app called "TrackR", and create an account. After this, you can link the tracker to your account, and view the tracker's location on your phone. It is well noting that because the only method of transmission is through Bluetooth, if you go out of range, the tracker disconnects.It is truly amazing how fast this tracking device works. Almost immediately after I press the sound button on the app, the tracker starts playing a sound to help me find the item. Also, if I lose my phone, I like that pressing the tracker's button will make my phone sound. Overall, I really like the concept of this tracker and I would recommend it to you.I hope you found this extensive review helpful. Thanks for taking the time to read my reviews, and have a nice day!
