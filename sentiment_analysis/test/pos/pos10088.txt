If you're a technology or knowledge worker--like a scientist or researcher--this will wake you up and help you focus. If you're a vegan or vegetarian student looking for a natural, non-prescription-drug boost, this will wake you up and help you focus. If you're a long-haul hamburger-loving truck driver, this will wake you up and help you focus. In general, if you work long hours, have a family (or significant other), have hobbies, have a pet, attend conferences, travel by plane or car a lot, this will wake you up and help you focus.These pectin-based "gummy cubes" contain l-theanine and caffeine. Those ingredients are commonly regarded as safe, and when used together they have a known effect of providing focus without the typical drawbacks associated with having only caffeine. They contain sugar in the form of glucose syrup and sucrose (table sugar) and a range of B vitamins. When combined, these ingredients will give both mental and physical energy.I gave these to my significant other, telling him they were "coffee candy with caffeine and l-theanine," after about 4 minutes he said "what did you give me?" and I explained and showed him. These things packed a huge punch. We were having a relatively lazy weekend day, and he lacked motivation to work with me on cleaning the house. He had one cup of coffee about 20 minutes prior to me giving him two of these cubes. The coffee wasn't doing anything for him, I think because he's a regular coffee drinker with high caffeine tolerance. These provided an extra boost. This got him going.I've also been using these at work to help with focus. All in all, I think it's important to recognize that these cubes are a form of edible medication. It's more than coffee--In my experience, they'll wake you up and you'll get an intense focus, even if you've developed caffeine tolerance.
