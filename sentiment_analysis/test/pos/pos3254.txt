I am not too crazy about the way the unit is put together.  There is a screen on the bottom that is held on by a removable door that gives you access to the inner workings of the unit.  It is VERY difficult to get this screen back on and in place.  Unfortunately the screen falls off quite often.  I also am not crazy about the clip on the back that holds the unit to the water container.  The clip works fairly well, but it has two positions and it is VERY difficult to change its position.  Dispite all, I LOVE Sous Vide cooking!4-6-2016My Sansaire machine just quit on me.  Contacted Sansaire and I received a new machine within a week.  Great customer service!
