...but I have to do it for this one. I needed a camera to live stream a panel discussion that I was hosting (and much more events like that will follow). After looking at the different options, I found that Mevo could check all the boxes and it did: good quality video, the multi camera feature and the ability to track faces automatically are a big plus especially for a panel discussion. Also, it takes only few minutes to be ready to stream once the product is out of its fancy box!. I haven't tried Facebook yet but it works great on Livestream. A five-star product for sure!
