It's great for blocking out the moisture to stop the mold and letting the cheese breathe. I had a chunk of Smoke Gouda that was already molding inside it's plastic wrap, cut off the portion, and slapped it in the bag and it hasn't gotten moldy again since. It's been two weeks and I couldn't be happier about that part.Only slight con.. Not sure how big of a wedge or slice that people put in but it doesn't want to close up properly unless it's perfectly square. Even then it's not entirely perfect. It does the job regardless of it being closed or not.
