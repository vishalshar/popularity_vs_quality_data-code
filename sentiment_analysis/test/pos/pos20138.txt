So far, so good.  We watch dogs as a side business (no more than two at a time) and some of them concern us as flight risks.  We have a fully fenced in yard and we don't make it a habit to let them out without supervision, but you never know when a dog will dig or jump, so it's nice to have the insurance of the GPS tracker that is waterproof and is firmly, yet comfortably mounted on the dog's collar.  We tested it before use and were very satisfied with the tests.  It does require a monthly subscription for full tracking (I'm not sure it even works without the subscription) but it is definitely peace of mind.  When you get the tracker, you simply register it and sign up and it is activated.  I was a little depressed that all of the reviews that were written stated that there was only a $6.95/ month fee but there is really a tier structure based on bi-annual - $6.95/month, annual - $7.95/month and monthly - $9.95/month.  I was surprised to find out that it was also an activity tracker for the dog.  All-in-all, it's working out so far!
