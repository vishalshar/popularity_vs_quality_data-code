When I say I'm neurotic about researching dog foods, that would be an understatement.  Love this food..and so do my dogs.  5 star rating on Dog Food Advisors (not an easy feat), 4 protein sources, no corn, wheat, soy, etc.  Raising a litter of puppies on it right now and have had the best reaction so far of any litter I've raised previously on other foods.  Great value for the cost!
