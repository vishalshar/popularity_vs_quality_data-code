Update 11/7:As of this past weekend, the August Lock is now finally compatible with Homekit in the Apple Home App for iOS 10. A big milestone!Also, in case you are wondering, your Apple TV can be allowed to go to sleep and the Auto-unlock feature will still work. We had set our Apple TV to the "Never Sleep" mode based on the recommendation of another reviewer. I can confirm that this is not necessary with our lock, as auto-unlock works perfectly when the Apple TV is asleep.Update 10/28:We have been using the lock for a little over a month, and I am glad to report that I was able to upgrade the review from 2 stars to 4 stars. The auto-unlock feature works so well, it has been a great convenience when coming home with our hands full. I also want to say that their customer service team has been amazing at answering questions and following up to make sure things are working smoothly.Here are some improvements made recently:- app has been updated several times and it is working better. They seem to release an update every 2 weeks or so.- notifications are now working better- the Widget now works on an iphone 6- after having some difficulty connecting remotely, I added a Connect to my setup, and that has been 100% reliable (not ideal to have to buy this accessory, but it works better than my Apple TV).Areas still needing improvement :- still no compatibility in ios 10  Homekit app- Activity log is still missing some events- we use auto-unlock and it works flawlessly, but for many reasons don't want to use auto-lock. Locking the door with the phone is a bit of a pain (no better than using keys) so we will probably buy the keypad. I wish we didn't have to buy another accessory.- IFTTT functions are really limited, and so I can't do basic things that I would like to do, like trigger a door lock event at specific times.Original Review:I wanted to love this lock so much. But due to incredibly buggy software, I am not sure whether I will keep it or return it. This will depend on August's ability to fix its issues within the return period.Our family is using this lock with an iPhone 6, an iPhone 6s, and an Apple TV 4th Generation that is located less than 15 feet away from the lock. Our software is up to date on all devices (iOS 10.0.2 on the phones) and the August App was updated on 9/27/16 when the new version was released. Unfortunately all bugs have persisted in iOS 10.0.1 and 10.0.2 and with the former and current version of the August App.The lock works fairly consistently when it is within bluetooth range, although there is a lag time of up to 10 seconds. This is much longer than I expected, as the lag time with the other smart devices we own (TP-LINK plug and Ecobee3 thermostat) is barely noticeable. We were most excited about the Auto-unlock feature, and thankfully we got this to work within the first day. It did not function when we first set up the lock, but after following the instructions on August's "Auto-Unlock Troubleshooting (iOS)" page, we were able to resolve the issue.  [...] . So far, the feature has worked consistently following the initial issues.There are some big issues when we use this lock, both remotely and at home:- when out of Bluetooth range, sometimes the lock status remains grey indefinitely, making it impossible to tell if the lock is open or closed, and impossible to lock or unlock the lock. The app has to be killed completely (sometimes more than once) to fix this issue. This has happened to at least one of us daily. Oddly enough, Siri seems to be able to check if the lock is locked out unlocked even if the display is gray. I am told that August cannot determine the cause of this issue because the commands are going through the Apple servers, and Apple will have to fix it. Since the device is marketed as being fully compatible with the Apple TV 4th Generation, this is not a reassuring response to this issue. There is no scheduled fix date for this problem, which can be a big issue if you are trying to let someone in remotely who does not have the August App installed.- the iOS widget absolutely does not work. Pushing on the lock or unlock button only opens the August App, but does not perform the lock or unlock actions. Exception for iPhone 6S: if the App is killed, the widget will work to actually lock or unlock the door one time. But if you then let the app run in the background, the widget stops working. The widget is supposed to be a time-saving shortcut. But instead it wastes time because it does not perform the functions it says it performs, which is a potential security issue if you use the Widget to lock your door, and then later realize your door was never locked. There is no scheduled fix date for this bug.- Activity log is missing events. One of the advertised features of this lock is that you can track every time the door is locked and unlocked and who performed the action (except for manual lock/unlock). However, when we use Siri or the App remotely, those actions never appear in the activity log, even after we come back within Bluetooth range. If the activity log is important for you, just note that about 75% of events will be missing from the log, rendering it useless. There is no scheduled fix date for this bug.- HomeKit compatibility is not yet fully supported. This version of the lock costs a premium so that you can use it with Homekit. However, if you actually attempt to use the Home App in iOS 10, you will be prevented from doing so as the app will tell you that the device is not supported and requires a firmware update. This update has not been released yet so you are stuck until the next firmware update. The compatibility is advertised on the website, but there is no announced date for the firmware change.If you have a question for August Support, you may contact them here: "If you need immediate assistance during business hours, please give us a call at 844-284-8781. Hours of Operation: Monday - Friday 6:30AM - 8:00 PM PST Saturday - Sunday 9:00AM - 6:00PM PST"If you are able to reach their customer support team over the phone, they are very friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to take the time to troubleshoot. The issues I had could not, however, actually be fixed via phone. The quality of phone interaction is good, but August simply does not have enough people answering their phones to make the wait times acceptable.Furthermore, it is very discouraging for a customer to hear that there are no actual dates set to implement fixes for major bugs. Supposedly many of the issues reported did not appear until iOS 10 (I received my lock after the update, so I cannot confirm whether this is accurate), so they are new issues. While I understand that a software upgrade can affect the features of the lock, I would expect improvements with new versions of software (not decreased functionality), and I would have expected August to thoroughly test their product using the beta version of iOS 10. Knowing that at any moment in the future another software update could potentially result in issues preventing me from locking or unocking my front door is very concerning.While so far the lock has worked when we are within Bluetooth range, it has failed to work reliably away from home, and it has significant bugs that prevent key features (like widgets) from operating. Since this lock has many known software issues, customers should be advised it does not work as advertised on their website out-of-the-box. Known issues should be posted on their website so customers do not waste time trying to troubleshoot them.Missing features that would improve this product:- Ability to schedule an event (for instance, lock my door every night at 10pm)- Ability for widget to show you if the lock is already locked or unlocked without opening the app.The bottom line is that this lock costs too much for a product that should essentially still be in beta. I am a software implementation project manager, so I am familiar with rigorous testing procedures for user acceptance. This lock does not currently meet my expectations of a functional product due to excessive bugs.I hope that I can update this review soon with a list of bug fixes and improvements. If not, the lock will be replaced with a more mature product. August, the ball is in your court.
