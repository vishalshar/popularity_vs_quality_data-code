Both my remotes died for my old Craftsman garage door opener and I decided to give this a try despite not having very many reviews yet. The devise itself is very small. The concept is really simple, I wired it up to the positive and negative terminals on the garage door motor that connect to the existing keypad and the blue activation light came on right away. I got the iPhone app and it made the first connection almost instantly. The last step was setting up my wife's phone by scanning a QR code displayed by the first authenticated phone.The app is pretty minimalistic and no frills, but hey it's a garage door opener. The nock to open feature is like magic, and works great for when I am coming home on my bike. I usually takes a few tires for it to catch the nock however.I made one modification to the basic unit by replacing the existing wires with my own much longer set so it could get a better signal outside my stucco garage (Stucco is full of wire mesh and is really good at blocking electronic signals). This was easy to do and now I get a bluetooth signal from my entire back yard. I would also recommend considering the unit with the door position sensor which I did not buy because I did not see it for sale: http://www.amazon.com/gLink-Transform-Android-Remote-Monitor/dp/B015X2BSE6When I contacted the company about not having the sensor they offered to mail me one to try. I will update this review later once that is installed.
