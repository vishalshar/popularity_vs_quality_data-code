The product is ingenious and fantastic, 5 stars but the price is astronomical!!! Y'all need to go on Shark Tank to work with them to get your price down so that this product can become the new industry standard to save moms and dads backs from pain and injury. This product should be taking off and be in Target, Buy Buy Baby and Babies R us like yesterday but the cost is just way too high! Plus, I had to buy mattress pads still! It was all totally worth it to save my back, me being a physical therapist and seeing traditional baby sheets as the bain of my existence. I'm a huge fan of everything but the price because the price limits all the people who can benefit from this product.
