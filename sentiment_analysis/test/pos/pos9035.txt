I purchased this for the first time and have been very pleased with the product!  A very light day moisturizer, it left my skin feeling hydrated and smooth but not weighted down.  Fragrance free, paraben free, I highly recommend this moisturizer to all skin types and ages!  I am 33 and tend to be oily but this kept my t-zone under control.  My 14 year old daughter also tried this moisturizer and liked it, it did not irritate her sensitive skin and kept her face hydrated all day.  A great moisturizer!
