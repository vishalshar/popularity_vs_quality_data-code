It's about time i put that CD slot to use in my car. My nephews always wonder what it's used for, thinking it's some sort of bank for coins.This car phone holster slides in with ease. I had to use the extra clip provided to make connection tighter on my camary se. The main reason I picked this holder over other ones is due to the fact that u just push your phone right into the holder which triggers the button in the back to close the arms. With a squeeze of your thumb n forefinger u open arms back up to take phone out. The one hand operation is ideal and quick. I have had many holders from iOttie, bike and different arm holders for car. That one hand operation always brings me back. Not sure why anyone would want a two hand mounting system.Even though unit is all plastic it has been durable and served me good service for years with my iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy s7 edge.
