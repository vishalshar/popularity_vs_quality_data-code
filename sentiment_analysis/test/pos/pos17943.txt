I have had my Bellabeat Nature for over three months now and really like it.  Seeing how so many people were getting benefits from their fitness trackers, I wanted to see how I could amp up my fitness with more awareness and data given by a tracker.  Most trackers, however, look too functional for me.  Then I found Bellabeat.  I love that I can wear my Bellabeat Leaf Nature clipped on to my clothes, as a bracelet or a necklace!  And it's attractive.  It keeps track of my activities and sleep, has a monthly cycle/period calendar and includes many types of guided meditations to keep stress levels low (which can impact health, just as activity and sleep can).  The programming needs some tweaking.  It would be great to be able to add my own time meditating to the app, for instance, and I have already contacted the company, which assures me they are working on it.  Overall, I would recommend this for any woman who wants to build more awareness around her daily health.
