My cat loves it and it's good for him...I've never had a cat food that could do that before. It was either good, healthy cat food that he'd nibble, or the junk they sell in the grocery store (you know the ones that list corn as one of the first or second ingredients). We love this stuff! We love it so much, we are going to get the dog food version of this for my chi's.
