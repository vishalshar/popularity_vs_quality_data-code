I'm really enjoying this phone. It's simple. No crazy apps  that are not needed. I had to download a gallery for pictures but the most resent updates of the phone included gallery and a music app. So far I haven't had any complains after 3 months. It comes with a fast charger and a very slim screen protector. The phone has a strong slim feel to it. Love the sand stone texture on the back. When the screen is off you make a circle and the camera turns on ,double tap and screen turns on and make a v shape on the screen and the flash turns on. Very cool stuff. You have your screen shot in the power button but the new updates have it in the down volume and the power button . Overall it's a great phone and the price is a steal. One more thing it comes with to sim card slots for those people that have two phones .
