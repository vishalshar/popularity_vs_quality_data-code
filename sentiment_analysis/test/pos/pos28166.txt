Excellent product for my FJR1300.  Talk about attention to detail.  Even the packaging was impressive.  This company takes pride in its product.  Clear cut instructions for quick install.  Easy installation and user-friendly.  Accurate to within one psi.  I'm particular so I balanced my wheels by off-setting with one 0.25 ounce weight since these weigh 10 grams or 0.35 ounces.  I probably didn't have to since my bike is portly at 650 lbs.  Great early warning alarm system for when there is sudden pressure loss.  It'd be cool if the app forced my phone to stay awake like a gps app does.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.
