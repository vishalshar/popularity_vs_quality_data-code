This thing is AMAZING!! I have not been able to find anything comparable to the scoopfree anti-tracking mat. It literally banishes the little pebbles around my cat boxes. I keep one close to each cat box. After having them for 3 months - i have found that it makes a huge noticeable difference on the amount of crystals that get all over the house. Don't bother buying the cheap mats. This one is 1/2 the size and works SO MUCH BETTER!
