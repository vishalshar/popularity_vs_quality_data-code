I have been a user if LIFX bulbs for about a year, and have been very pleased with their performance, particularly with their ability to be programmed and remotely accessed, since we travel a lot. This specific bulb is my first "Colored" light and found it to be as easy to use as previous models, a little shorter in height, allowing it to fit more lamps, brighter, and cooler to the touch. It's fun also to have the ability to change the color of light within a room the match the season or mood. I would highly recommend LIFX.
