These cheeses bags live up to their reputation. I have thrown out too much cheese in the past and decided to try these bags--what a blessing! They keep the cheese fresh for weeks and no more spoilage. They are worth the price--which is very reasonable considering the cost of "wasted" cheese. Thanks for a great product!
