I bought this to replace an ageing Pronto.  It does everything the Pronto did and more.  It controls all my IR devices, (TV, DVD, etc).  It also adds WiFi remote control; I can control my Wemo Switches with it and it interfaces with my Amazon Echo for voice control.  For the things needed help in getting setup the support was fast and helpful.
