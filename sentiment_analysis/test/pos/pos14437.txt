So first of all I want to say that it's amazing how these treats compare to the Halo freeze dried chicken treats. You can pay about $9 or $10 for a 2.2 oz container of the Halo treats or you can pay a few more dollars for these Whole Life treats and get twice the amount. So naturally I chose these. While Halo seems to have marinade as an extra ingredient in their treats, these are 100% pure chicken, which is good because I don't think cats need marinade in their meat. I also like that they're made in the USA.The thing about freeze dried chicken is that it is 100% healthy because it's a 100% chicken. And the best thing is cats seem to prefer it over any and all other treats. My cat is on the small side and she's a very finicky eater and I often worry that she isn't getting enough nutrition. With these I can supplement her diet to ensure that she gets enough protein. In the bag there are a lot of large pieces as well as smaller bite-sized pieces. I crush the small ones to put over her food or feed dry and I soak the larger pieces in warm water. Since my cat won't eat wet food, giving these soaked is the perfect alternative as she seems to love them even more soft. Upon being soaked, they soften into a meaty texture right away.Overall, freeze dried chicken is the best treat you can give your cat and the size and price that these come in is perfect. I hope Amazon never stops selling these.
