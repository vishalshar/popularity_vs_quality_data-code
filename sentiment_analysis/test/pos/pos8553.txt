Our dog has loved these---she's pretty small (10 pounds) so we break off small pieces for her but she goes nuts for them.  She loves the taste of them and they seem to be healthy for her.  The packaging itself is nice (good zip lock) so they've last on our counter for a long time.  Just holding the bag up in the air at this point she comes running.
