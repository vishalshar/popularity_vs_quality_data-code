Amazing pencil it works just like it says and the materials that the pencil is made of feels premium I have the walnut one and it is beautiful. The only negative thing I have to say is that the Palm rejection works but sometimes you switch apps with you hand resting on it. The eraser sometimes smudges also but that's all I can complain about I love it best drawing I have ever done on an iPad!!!! Must get if you love to draw nomatter what skill level.
