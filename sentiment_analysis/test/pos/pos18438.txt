Overall this is a great way to keep keys in a pocket.  Initial assembly is somewhat difficult and frustrating, and is the reason for docking one star.  When used for more than three or four keys, the two mating ends are quite difficult to screw together.  However, once assembled, the screw does not loosen with regular use, keeping keys firmly in place with no 'jingling.'  When needed, I found each key very accessible and easy to manipulate.
