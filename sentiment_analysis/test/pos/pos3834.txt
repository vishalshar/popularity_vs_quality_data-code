I was skeptical. But to be honest, with the sheer amount of international travel I do, it's pretty awesome. It's worked for me here in the UK, it's worked for me in Toronto/Montreal and Quebec. The only challenge I've had is that it feels like the data consumption is much more than it should be, however, I'm not sure I didn't turn off the background tasks as it should be. It's probably my fault. It's neat that it looks just like my iPhone, even though it runs the Android OS, but even the "swipe to unlock" feature, looks like IOS. The menus can be a little confusing at first, but you get used to it. Overall I'm happy.
