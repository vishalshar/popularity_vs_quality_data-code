Incredible! I've been making pizza with a pizza stone in a conventional oven 20+ years . I thought it was decent until I tried this. It delivers restaurant-quality pizza in under 4 minutes. Get's over 900 degrees on a Weber three-burner grill.No need to do anything fancy. Just assemble your pizza, throw it in, and rotate every 30 seconds or so. In a couple of minutes you have a perfectly cooked pizza. Again, restaurant-quality.It far exceeded my expectations.
