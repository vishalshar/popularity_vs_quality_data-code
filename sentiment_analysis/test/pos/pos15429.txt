I used this product to girder my Sennheiser headphone cable where the cable connects through the headphone cup, and at the jack, where stresses are likely to lead to damage. If you've been through as many headphones as I, then Sugru will extend the life of your cans. This stuff is simply brilliant. It works exactly as described, and has so many great uses.
