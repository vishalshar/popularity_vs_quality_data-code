I found this product on Amazon Launchpad, and decided to try it as a small pick me up. I really like that the product is made in the USA with natural agreements, seaweed from Maine, and vegan and cruelty-free.  I use it mostly on my hands, and have found the Seaweed Bath Cream to be moisturizing but not sticky or greasy. The creamy texture makes it easy to control the amount you use, and to apply the cream where you want it. The scent is light and pleasant, and you can easily discern the citrus and vanilla notes.I really like the Seaweed Bath Co. body cream -- it does everything I want in a moisturizer, with none of the downsides.  I plan to try some of the other products from this company as well.
