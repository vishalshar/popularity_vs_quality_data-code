I purchased this for my sons 7th birthday and he loves it.  It flies really well as long as you make sure your paper is in good condition. When our paper is bent or worn the plane will crash right after launch. So if you're starting out, I would recommend bringing a couple bodies with you when you fly.  Also we really like this template[...] it's really stable.  I'm going to be purchasing a second PowerUp so that I can fly with him.  It's a great little toy.
