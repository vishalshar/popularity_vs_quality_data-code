Love this phone, love everything about it but have only had it working for a couple of days now. The set up process was a bit tedious but the guy at the AT&T store was very patient and helped me through the whole process. Finally got all my contacts moved over today by going through my gmail account and was very happy because I thought I lost over 3/4 of my important phone numbers.So far, the only con is the battery and how quickly it's going down to 0%. But I was told that the battery has to learn from my inputs which is what I will do over the next few days. Got the Midnight color and love it/ Also got the black case from Amazon.com and it fits perfectly! Very very happy customer here and am sure I will be able to get the battery situation fixed soon.Edit: Had to send the phone back because it got stuck in a voice mode and couldn't get back to the main page. Not sure what happened but after 4 days of use, it flaked out on me. Also the battery life is dismal to say the least! With minimal use, it went from 100% down to 20% within a few hours and got very hot while not in use. Some of the apps must be working in the background. This phone is just not ready for the consumer. Was very excited about it at first but after four days, it was unusable. Folks, I would avoid this phone until they can fix these issues. I sent mine back on day five and am waiting for my refund! Think I will go and get a cheap go phone after all this nonsense using the Nextbit Robin!
