I purchased one of these to check and track my cooking and beer brewing temperatures.After opening the packing, I ran a test and found that this unit will report changes quickly and accurately.The setup is fairly easy (fortunate since minimal instructions provided) but figuring out how to operate it takes a bit longer. Recommend going to their website to read how to set alerts etc.With regards to controls and settings, I hope that with future software releases that Supermechanical will make improvements to these since they are very rudimentary at best and limited.Overall the construction of the unit appears to be excellent, the metal props appears to be fairly sturdy stainless steel (could use a pointed tip rather than rounded), the silicone parts are soft and easy to hold and appears to come with a generous amount of cabling so that your iPhone/iPad does not have to be too close to the source of your measurements.I love the packaging, white styrofoam (could have used paper based instead) meat tray wrapped in plastic, just like a piece of meat you might find at the grocery store.Overall, I love the simplicity of this device (just wish it had more controls in the software) and that it will function perfectly for my needs.Oh, and in case I forgot to mention, it can record your temperatures in case you need them for future reference.
