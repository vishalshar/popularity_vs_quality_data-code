Bought the Blumoo a few days ago and set it all up last night in about 3 hours.  I have a Marantz AV receiver, Oppo DVD/Bluray player, Samsung LCD TV, Verizon cable box. Epson HD LCD projector, Apple TV, and DaLite screen with a motorized drive.  I set up 8 macros to operate these devices if in appropriate combinations with a single push of a button on my iPad, for example "Watch TV", "Project TV", "Project Apple TV", etc.Set up was a breeze with easy and intutiive steps so you can check functionality as you work.  Once the macros were set up everything worked as it should every time.  I stashed away all of the remotes last night and hopefully will never need them again.  My iPad (and iPhone) are now my universal remote controls.  As I also have Echo Dot I'll be setting up the Alexa skill over the weekend.I only have two reservations: 1) The screen designs are very rudimentary and could be much more attractive.  A good graphic designer can fix this so I assume this will be coming with future upgrades. 2) Two crucial functions for the Marantz receiver that toggle its two HDMI outputs were not available.  I've emailed blumoo support about that and expect a solution presently.If you're frustrated by the number of remotes you have and want a reliable, low cost, easy-to-set up solution, blumoo is it.  It's a great value and I highly recommend it.
