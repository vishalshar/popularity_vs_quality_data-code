With a little cutting and welding I was able to adapt the included brackets to fit my 2015 Chevy 2500HD. Works really well and puts my surface pro 3 right where I need it to work on the road. Am going to buy the optional support arm as the whole set up constantly moves when traveling. Overall great.Only things I would change are as follows:Better instructions for manipulating the joints.More bracket options to configure for odd vehicles.Ability to rotate the knuckle directly under the platform. It only goes forward/backward not left to right.
