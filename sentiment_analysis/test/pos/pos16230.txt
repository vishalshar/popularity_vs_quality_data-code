We are heading into our third year of primary school and always struggled with the hot/cold lunch split and this lunchbox gives us a real option for either, in one box!!! We've tried a number of boxes over the years and found one we really liked, but it doesn't even come close to the omiebox. My daughter loves the colors (she ordered the pink berry) and I love the sturdiness of the box - she ran home everyday to check the mail and was so happy when it arrived. I love that you can order extra components too.
