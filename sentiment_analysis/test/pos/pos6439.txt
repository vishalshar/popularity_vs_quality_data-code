I upgraded from the basic version of this harness in Ocean Blue.  I have a BC that gets a bit headstrong.  I love the added padding of this harness, it actually helps it stay in place better once you've adjusted the straps.  The color is vibrant and looks great against his black and white fur.I also bought one in Steel Gray for my Blue pibble pup (because there's no purple!  ::sad face::)...I definitely got the wrong size, because she was able to escape it.  I will have to get the M/L size for her, because she's maxed out on the Medium I have on her right now.
