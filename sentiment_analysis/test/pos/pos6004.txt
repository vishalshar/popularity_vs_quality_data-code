If you are having a problem with adjusting this case you need to get rid of your apple watch because you obviously can't read instructions.  After you follow the SIMPLE instructions and get your apple watch in the case, put it on your wrist.  Try the digital crown and tighten the screws SLOWLY.  You may find that pressing the sides of the case in and using the STRAIGHT allen wrench (provided) will tighten the case without over tightening.  If you use the angled allen wrench it is very easy to over tighten the screws and that will cause problems.  Just look at the pictures and follow the directions.The case adds enough "bulk" to the watch to make it look more masculine.  I usually wear a Suunto watch, so I am used to big watches.  This case does add some size to the watch, but it provides protection to the touch screen and has a better "feel".All functions work normally and this is just a very nice case.Update:  After wearing this for a couple of weeks I can say that this is a fully functional case/band for your Apple Watch.  Some have said that the digital crown gets activated (along with Siri), but if you go to the watch app on your iPhone you can control the watch orientation.  For example I wear the watch on my left wrist and adjusted the settings so that the digital crown is to the left (away from my wrist bone).  No problems with Siri activating at all.Follow the simple directions and do not over tighten the allen screws (you are not putting lug nuts on your car) and you will have zero problems.
