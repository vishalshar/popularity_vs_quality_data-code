This is an awesome idea for kids, the only complaint is that the price is too high. If they made this just a little bit more expensive than Legos, you would have every kid with these. I cannot imagine that most of the parts are very expensive. They could probably drop the price in half, and still make lots of money. Excellent idea. I hope it catches on.
