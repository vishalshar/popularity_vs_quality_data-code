The grip is ok. It feels strong and tight. Hand-grip could be little bit smaller then this because it s a little hard to handle it when you try to press the button on remote. Rubber finish of grip is very nice. Weight of it is also fine. I did not test it in the water yet but I am sure it will not sink. The Thumbscrew has just broken at the first time I fix it. No problem, I have lots. Actualy it s not good screw as gopro's. Package was also strange. I mean it was open before. As you know, Amazon has an additional package of the actual product. But the product package is opened before. No problem. I am happy. Because you can not find anything like this. Best part of it is you can remove the remote holder unit with the cam and use it like that in your palm. Brillant!
