I really enjoy using this cup.  It starts out with coffee in the morning and by evening I'm using it to drink ice water.  I've completely dropped use of other coffee mugs completely.  Even if I'm sitting around the house I'm using this mug.  The no tip feature, while not flawless, is pretty handy.  I've avoided a couple of spills because of it.
