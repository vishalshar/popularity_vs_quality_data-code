This thing is awesome.  I know what your thinking; it's just a coffee mug.  But this one is different.  It "locks" to a smooth flat surface, so that a sideways force, such as your hand or arm, cannot accidentally knock it over!  It doesn't sound that great to read this, but I just received it today, and tried it out, and WOW!  It does exactly what I just described.  We are talking about a level surface, such as a table top.  If you're like me, you  probably have your favorite beverage alongside your trusty keyboard; an accident waiting to happen.  I've had to replace 2 keyboards thanks to dousing them down with heavily sweetened coffee.  So this thing is just what I needed.  I do not intend to "try" knocking it over, but judging just from the force needed to try pushing it over, it would take quite a wallop to break it free.  But, get this; if you just lift the mug straight up, it comes up effortlessly.  It's like magic.  So clever!  It came very well packaged with instructions, a 20% off coupon, and a welcome to the club letter.  Thank you, Jayme Smaldone (Founder of Mighty Mug) for bringing this into existence.
