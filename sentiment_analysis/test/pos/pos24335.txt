I bought two -- one for me and one for my girlfriend. We travel a lot and there is little choice in personal protection devices abroad and in transit, so this looked like a good option. As expected, it is lightweight and loud--sounds like a car alarm from the early 90s. God those were annoying, but they do attract attention. The fact the battery isn't replaceable doesn't worry me too much. I'll test it occasionally. The pin itself is snug but not too difficult to pull. Feels like a nice balance between too many false alarms and too difficult to pull in an emergency. I also like that the entire device has a rubberized coating. Much better looking than plain hard plastic and less slippery. The loop on the pin side is sized fine, but the loop on the body is thick, so only large key rings fit which limits your options. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.
