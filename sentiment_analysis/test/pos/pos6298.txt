I haven't used this check cord a whole lot yet but it seems to be a solid product.  It's good, thick material that doesn't tangle or snag very easily.  The only reason my review isn't a 5-star is because the clip seems a little light for this type of cord.  I haven't had any problems with it yet but it's something I'll keep an eye on.
