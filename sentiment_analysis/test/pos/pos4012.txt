I ordered this set for my toddler. I searched and searched for toddler utensils and just couldn't find anything that was safe for his teeth they scraped but a fork sharp enough to "stab" food so he wouldn't get frustrated. THIS IS IT! I just love this set and I sure do show it off when I can.  I just have one set right now but have a baby who will soon need his own set as well, so we will be ordering again.  I also plan to order a spare for each child in the diaper bag because even though traveling with his "everyday" GoBites, Momma sometimes (ALWAYS) forgets to pack it!
