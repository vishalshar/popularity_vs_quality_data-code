I bought one of these for my two dogs, and I liked it well enough to buy another.I walk anywhere from four to six dogs at a time, and this makes walking multiple dogs MUCH easier....no tangled leashes, no losing a dog without realizing it.I connect the two I have with a leash, so the four dogs I have now are all connected.
