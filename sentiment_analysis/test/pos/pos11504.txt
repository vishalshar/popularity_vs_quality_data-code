ok.... first I would like to say I was VERY skeptical about buying this mattress. I have never slept on this kind and was worried that I wouldnt like it. But I bought it and I LOVE IT!  Me and my husband are sleeping better than we ever have. I am no longer waking up with sore shoulders and arms that have fallen asleep and my husband is no longer waking me up every few hours from his snoring! I would recommend this mattress to anyone and have told my parents, brothers, friends....everyone I know... about LULL!
