It works as it should. It sometimes slips out of place or the suctions come unstuck and its gross to readjust it (even tho it's clean just...toilet stuff in general) but the colors are so pretty and the illumination works to keep the bf in line, if you know what I mean.Works at lights-out and during the day it stays off.Definitely would recommend it, even if you don't have a guy in the house since the colors are so pretty.
