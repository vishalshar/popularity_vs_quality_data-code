This is the best travel jacket! I was able to put my entire purse contents into this jacket. It is somewhat heavy but not uncomfortably so.  It is made very well with quality materials. SO convenient to go through security!  I am looking forward to wearing this jacket when walking the dogs, too!  Pockets for everything. Just amazing. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it is overpriced. $149 is a lot for a sweatshirt jacket no matter how many pockets...
