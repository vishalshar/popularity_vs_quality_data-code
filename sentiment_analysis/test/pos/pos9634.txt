I've only had the chance to take this suitcase on a few trips so far, but so far I love it! With some high-tech, new concept products like this one I would be worried about them getting the basics right; but from my experience the case is very well built and doesn't sacrifice anything in terms of luggage construction quality. I like all the different compartments and the rotating wheels are convenient. As for the "smart" features of the product, I particularly like the built-in scale feature and the ability to charge my phone through the USB port. There were times in the past when my phone battery died unexpectedly while traveling and this can be a huge headache. I haven't used this suitcase as a checked bag yet, but anyone who travels a lot has experienced the incompetence of some airlines at locating lost luggage. The location tracking feature seems like it would really come in handy in that case. I haven't utilized the locking feature but for some people that might be an added bonus.I used my previous small suitcase for many years, so this product still has a long way to go to prove its durability. But so far I am very happy with it and think it would make an excellent gift for anyone who takes lots of short business trips and likes having the latest high-tech gadgets.
