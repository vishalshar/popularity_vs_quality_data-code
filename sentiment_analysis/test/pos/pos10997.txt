Makes feeling clean after a long day of hiking and climbing easy.  I love the product because it didn't leave a film/residue on my skin after use and I use two per self washing. I was the only one in our group that didn't smell.  I would definitely buy again.  Not only for camping/backing where showers are not available. But will use after races that I run.
