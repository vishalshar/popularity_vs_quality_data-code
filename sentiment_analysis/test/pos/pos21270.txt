Great look and functions as advertised with no issues. I have only had it a short time but so far it works flawlessly in all aspects. The app has had some issues. However, that is for infrequent use so no harm there. Great look and as others have said my wife is good with it being in the room which is great. A bit pricey but a solid investment.
