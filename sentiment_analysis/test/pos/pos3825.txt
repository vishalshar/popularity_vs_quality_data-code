This is the first time I have tried this method, and I was surprised that it works pretty well and stings, but doesn't really hurt. However, knowing how to do the process, I subsequently made my own sugaring mixture the second time, following precisely the directions on YouTube, and it came out pretty well, too.  A lot of stirring, a messy job, a sticky pot to soak and wash, but a good product.
