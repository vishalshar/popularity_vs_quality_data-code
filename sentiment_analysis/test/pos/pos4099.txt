I've Been using avocado oil as my moisturizer for my face and body for 2 years now but this is the first time having an oil of this greatness.Before I had a unrefined/refined  oil mix that I thought was pretty good but not like this! This oil taste,smells and looks like it came straight from an avocado like an hour ago. It's a beautiful green but doesn't turn my skin green.It sinks into my skin quickly without leaving it oily.This oil was the best price I found for extra virgin unrefined avocado oil and after I finish up this bottle in several months I'll get another ,though that may be awhile since I'm only using it for my face and tips of my hair cause I can't afford to put it all over my body. I'll just use my naturally refined avocado oil for that. Extra virgin unrefined avocado oil has all the nutrients left unlike others so it's the best for skin like the face that shows aging. Overall I recommend this oil for beauty and I expect for food it'd be great as well.
