We just had our first baby and I am so worried about everything about her surroundings. I was going to buy a simple baby monitor just to make sure I hear if my baby cries. Then I saw this audio monitor and I fell in love with it. Hubby bought it the next day and we got it today. It was very easy to set up. I love the fading light colors on the device. The white glossy look of it is also very modern and goes with our furniture. The air numbers have changed a few times since we installed it and it is cool to know what happens around my baby. I also get an alert if there is a change in air. For now, we only use it as a baby monitor but it sure has lots of features.
