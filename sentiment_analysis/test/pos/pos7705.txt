I'm writing this using the actual tablet.. it is good for the money.. if you are use to using something faster you will see a difference.. but for hat I paid it works great.. watching YouTube and Netflix .. it works just fine.. great size.. I was expecting it to look like a 7 inch tablet.. the screen is the same size as a tablet.. but the body of it is a little slimmer giving it the appearance of a huge phone.. I have it on T-Mobile service.. connected with no problem.. but in my area TMobile signal is crap.. will switch to a carrier that's stronger in my area and add to this review.. I would recommend this phablet.. it is good for what i paid..Browsing can be a bit slow but streaming movies and videos are great..
