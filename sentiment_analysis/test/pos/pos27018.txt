LucidSound's LS30 Wireless Universal Gaming Headset is outstanding whether you're a gamer or just very particular about your headphones delivering beautiful sound. I used these before my gaming son tried them, and they flipped me out. I simply listened to my favorite music (I work to music) and the combination of music and comfort made me understand why this headset by LucidSound is so worth the money, It is great that it is universal, as well--my son will love that! I posted some photos of the box it arrives in-- and where the cables are stored when not in use (3rd photo from the left). They are pictured as well in the photo which is 4th from left.This headset is a simple setup with a great return. You are going to LOVE it if you get it for yourself. If there are other members in your family who are deeply involved in gaming--be prepared to share (like that is going to happen with a gamer) or get another one!  Amazing headset by a great company which is committed to the best in audio and acoustics. Wow product!
