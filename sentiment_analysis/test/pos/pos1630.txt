These are quirky for sure.  The programming is almost outdated but it works. You hold your phone over it and it pulses your screen. None the less you get two programmable outlets, individually controllled and two all time outlets. If you bought two separate smart outlets you would pay 4 times as much. This was a good deal I bought 3.
