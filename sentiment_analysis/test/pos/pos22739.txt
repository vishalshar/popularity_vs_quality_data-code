For the sale price of $60 this is a really great battery case. Actually its thin enough where I don't mind throwing this on even if I think I *might* need a little boost in power during the day. My other battery pack isn't much larger, but its large enough to where I never use it. I use this case often. It doesn't charge fast, but I don't think its supposed to. Basically if you're down to 60% just turn it on and keep using the phone. Eventually it will hit 100% again and the battery will automatically turn back off so you can keep using the internal battery until the next time you want to turn it on again. It isn't meant for quick charging then taking back out of the case, its meant for using all day and for that it works well! They also did a nice thing that I've fought with other chargers in the past, and that is during charging. When you plug it in, does it charge the battery? or the phone? which first? what this case does is it charges both but makes sure your phone is a priority to get charged. Nicely done!Nice job on the mechanical design, excellent minimalist design as far as lights and buttons etc. I am super impressed.
