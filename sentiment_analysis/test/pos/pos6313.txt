one of the most convenient innovative products at a relatively low price - I despise dog eared cards, I cant seem to manage to keep the original card box in tact.. this product is perfect, the cards are stored in a sturdy protective case. The case doubles as a card holder with discard. This case fits my wide playing cards...  I LOVE IT,  my only wish is that it was easier to open, it probably will get easier with time and practice. Hey, manufacturer please feel free to send me some to share with other family and friends... I bought 3 of these for my house hold... These would be perfect marketed to the "RV" community.Keeping the camper organized is the key to comfort. I would love to see these on the shelf at camping world.  Your college kids would love these because they are always playing cards in the cafeteria. I picked up one for my high schooler to keep in his back pack. The local comic/collectible cards store should keep these in stock. So many marketing possibilities.
