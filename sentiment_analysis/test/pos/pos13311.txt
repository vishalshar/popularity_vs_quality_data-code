I was impressed with the all black sports edition and was using it round the clock. But it had an unofficial or cheap look which is now solved by this steel version. Major advantage for me is the battery and the simple watch function. No need of charging means this stays in my hand forever !!! Then due to the dial design, it registered in my daily life as a normal watch, so I don't forget it at all. I mainly use this for tracking sleep and it having a battery that don't require a daily charge helps me - even if I doze off or go for power nap it registers. Battery replacement in 6 months is not a show stopper and it's quite easy.
