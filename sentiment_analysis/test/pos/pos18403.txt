I do woodworking for a hobby, and I use may measuring devices, but the one that is used the most it the short length tape measure.  I bought one of these to try out, and I liked it enough to buy a second one.  The LCD display is large, sharp and easy to read. The memories are great for storing measurements, and Measurement unit conversion is handy. I also like the center dimension feature too. As to accuracy, the manufacturer states it's accurate to +/- 1/16 of an inch, in my use so far both tapes seem to meet this tollerance. I would like to see it accurate to half this tolerance, but, for it's intended use, it is accurate enough.  As to battery life, I haven't had the two tapes long enough to find out. The CR2032 coin cells are used by other measurement instruments, so they are common, easy to obtain, and relatively cheap.  As to other features, it would be nice to have a lighted display, so that when working in dark areas the displayed readings would be readable. As to durability, time will tell. To this point, I would recommend this tape measure to anyone that makes use of short length tapes... It's a innovative product, well thought out, and easy to use.
