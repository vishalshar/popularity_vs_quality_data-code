I am so glad to have found a natural solution to motion sickness.  I recently took a harbor sunset cruise, and while I normally feel queasy on a boat, had my Anchor bar with me and ate some - and subsequently had no problems at all, so was able to fully enjoy the trip!  Any anti-nausea medications that you can buy in the drug store usually have unpleasant side effects, such as drowsiness.  You also cannot mix them with alcohol, and as this was a sunset cruise, we wanted to enjoy a glass of wine as well.  I am delighted to have found Anchor Nutrition bars, and will make sure to carry one in my purse!  They are tasty and mild enough to enjoy even with a touchy stomach, and I felt good knowing that it was a healthy snack as well.  So thankful!
