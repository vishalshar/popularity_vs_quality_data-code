This camera is exactly what I was looking for.  It was easy to setup and worked right out of the box.  The build quality is excellent -- it is mostly made of metal, and is very durable.  The power cord that came with it is very long and therefore had no issues about deciding where I could place it.The video quality of the camera is great, and I really like the night time mode.  I've had night vision mode on cameras before and it was always a joke, but with this one I can clearly see in the dark.I really like how it works with the phone and I can connect to it at any time and see what is going on, and even talk out of the camera!  The camera has lots of options, so you can configure it to record on sound, motion, both, or whatever combination you want.  The cloud saving feature is really nice and simple to set up as well.Overall great camera, I can't think of anything I would improve.
