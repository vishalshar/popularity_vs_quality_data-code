This stereo system is surprisingly good for what it cost.  The display backlighting is bright and the size of it is nice and large.  Audio is crisp and clear, better than I expected for a cheap stereo.  Everything works very well, even the antenna picks up stations my old stereo couldn't.  My only complaint is with the bluetooth capabilities.  Unless my phone is basically touching the stereo it won't stay synced, and I own other bluetooth devices so I know it's not the phone's shortfall.  Otherwise this is a great stereo and I still feel it is deserving of 5 stars.
