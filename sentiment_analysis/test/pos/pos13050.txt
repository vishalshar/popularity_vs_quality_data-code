I gave this phone five stars because I couldn't give it 4 1/2. The reason for a four and one half rating is that the phone does recognize wifi areas available but does not have the capability to connect automatically to ones you use on a regular basis. Other than that it's a good phone. Was easy to set up. I just took my AT&T sim out of my broken phone and installed it in this one. Just had to let the phone program to the AT&T network on its own. It comes with the google play store and all its apps. It also comes with a screen protector and gel case to protect it so you don't have to buy one which is nice. The battery life ( if your not running apps all the time ) averages about a day and a half. The phone works like a phone should and its a lot less expensive than some of the outrageously priced name brand ones. I have no issue recommending this phone thus far. If something changes I'll let you know here. I hope this review helps you out.
