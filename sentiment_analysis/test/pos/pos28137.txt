I have sleep "issues" and try to stay away from prescription stuff. This is one of the best I have found.  It helps me drop off to sleep quickly.  I still wake up around3 or 4 but finally get back to sleep a little.  I also use the sublingal melatonin I get at the health food store and that is good also.  You put it under the tongue and it disolves and gets into your system without going through the stomach etc so you get more of it faster.  This stuff is a lot more expensive and I ws told to look for it at Walmart and Target and I will because I can't keep paying the "pricey price" but it does work well and is worth it when one MUST get to sleep.  I use it only in emergencies because it is so costly. I would happily buy from these people again though., It came promptly and was well wrapped.  They are good sellers.  It is just too expensive for me on a regular basis.
