I love this mix and plan to make a batch with nuts. The consistency of the cookie is completely unlike traditional cookies. This is a paleo cookie and, quite frankly, tastes light-years better than the traditional ones, homemade or store bought, I grew up with. Refrigerate unless you plan to eat them up immediately.
