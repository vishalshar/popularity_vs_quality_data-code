I removed a mattress protector from my bed years ago as it made the bed hotter and it made a crinkle noise. Amazon often sends notices of products that coincide with products we purchased in the past and products of exceptional value. Recently they sent information on "Plush Deluxe Mattress Protector" while announcing a sale price.  I knew I needed a mattress protector but probably would not have acted on it had I not received the Amazon notice. I put it on the mattress as soon as it was received and was ecstatic (if you can be ecstatic about a mattress cover) that night when the bed was not hotter and the protector did not make a crinkly noise.  In fact, and much to my surprise, it made the bed more comfortable.  I have no idea why; it just did.  For anyone who needs a mattress protector, I highly recommend the Plush Deluxe.
