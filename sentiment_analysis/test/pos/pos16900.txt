I love my Leaf; I find it to be quite accurate when actually walking distances; I work out a lot and in my zumba dance class its hard to measure steps but it seems fairly close compared to hard the work out is.  It doesn't calculate anything based on different forms of exercise though- like yoga or weight lifting- mainly dancing, walking or running.It does motivate me to hit the magical 10,000 step point each day; even though I work out 5-6 days a week anyway, I have been surprised that it psychologically gets me moving more.The sleeping part seems to work pretty good on mine- but kind of funny because usually you know if you've had a good night sleep or not!  But I still like looking at it and seeing what it says!Have not tried the de-stress breathing app yet-It is NOT compatible yet with android devices- the app appears only for i-phones or pads.  I have both and its only available on my iphone.  I wish they specified that in the details.I wear it clipped on my sock when walking or running; clipped inside on my bra when I don't want it to show. The necklace and bracelet are fine but I seem to like it more as a clip-on.  At night I clip in on a tank top to sleep--I did buy 3 of these- two for friends and they like them as well--
