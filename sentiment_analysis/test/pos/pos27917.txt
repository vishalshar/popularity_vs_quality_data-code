This was my first appliance purchase without seeing the product firsthand, but I was impressed with the reviews and ordered. I am very happy with this microwave. It fit perfectly in the space on my counter top without taking up too much room. It's very quiet and easy to clean and looks great in my kitchen. Great price too !If you need a reasonably priced microwave that doesn't take up the majority of your counter top space, this a great one to have !
