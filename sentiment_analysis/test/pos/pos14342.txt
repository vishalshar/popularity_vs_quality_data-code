This thing is a lot more versatile than I thought!  It is adjustable so you can wear it at your hips, waist, below your chest(or above it I guess but haven't tried that).  Also I find myself wearing it with the clip in front and phone (iPhone 6 plus) with cards in the back as it seems so be more comfy that way.  I am a size 8 and I would say if you are larger than a 10/12 this won't work for you.  I mostly use it when I don't have pockets and don't want to carry a purse.
