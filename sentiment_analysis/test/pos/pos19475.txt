Going to the doctors office produces a tremendous amount of anxiety for me.  I usually down a Pepto chewable or two before walking in the door, my hands feel clammy, my stomach is upset; I am miserable and scared.Sitting there for over an hour, waiting to be x-rayed, I was starting to freak out.The Spire stone was buzzing, telling me I was in a tense streak (2 minutes or more).I had no headphones; I couldnt Boost (Spire has audio sessions that guide you through getting from tense to calm) without looking like a complete idiot.So, I decided just to sit there, look at the breath wave and try to achieve a calm streak. (See the pic)Couldnt hurt, right?Up and Down, Up and Down.2 minutes in I hit the streak.  Once I hit the streak I just focused on continuing it.It became more of a game.At 30 minutes, I realized I wasnt freaked out at all any more.  I wasCalm.I logged an additional 39 minutes after the x-ray, sitting in the examination room waiting for my results.Hello!After the x-ray while WAITING for the bad news I logged 39 MORE minutes of Calm.I bought my Spire as an anti-jerk device in meetings (youre tense buzz buzz); instead it helped me regain control when at my most fearful.Im not suddenly less afraid of going to the doctor, but for the first time I feel much better equipped.Transformed is a better word.Thank you for making Spire.
