I've been using this for about 3 weeks or so and so far I love it. I use on my face, as a nightly cleanser. My skin has been very clear, soft and my pores appear smaller since using. It's even keeping my skin clear since using loads of sunscreen and being out in the heat sweating during the day these past couple weeks. I will admit, I have pretty good/balanced skin anyways, but I do have my breakouts here and there and it seems to be keeping even those small little breakouts away. As long as it keeps performing this well for me, I will definitely purchase again and I would definitely recommend to others.
