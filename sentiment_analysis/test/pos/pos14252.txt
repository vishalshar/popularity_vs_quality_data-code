Pros:Locally stored scheduling. Not dependent on constant cloud access.hard for pet to break into or tip oververy easy to program schedule and also set a one time feed or feed on demandhigh build qualitynotifications that your pet has been fed so you know it workedeasy set upConswebcam is low res and not angled to allow a view of the food in the bowldoesnt integrate with any other home automation protocols or IFTTTexpensive. however no truly comparable product exists so I guess they have a right to charge moreI have an irregular schedule so I wanted something that could do something that could easily be programmed to do a one time feed ahead of time. plus my cat gets fed twice a day for weight control and when I am home I will just put out the food myself. so I didnt want to mess with a complicated electronic timer everytime I plan to go out and need a automatic feed. one of the main complaints I found on other auto-feeders was that they are a pain to program. the feed-and-go is super simple to program and change the schedule in seconds.
