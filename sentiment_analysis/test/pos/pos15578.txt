I bought this speaker for it's rugged design, water resistance, sound quality and light carry weight for backpacking.  This speaker has exceeded ALL expectations.  The sound is frickin LOUD, fills a room as well as projects in all directions outside.  The sound is incredibly rich for the size, and doesn't crack or pop when turned all the way up.  The rubber feet keep it secure on smooth surfaces, and the shape is great for fitting in a pack that is already cramped for space.  No reason to leave this behind!  I want to buy more for my family and friends!
