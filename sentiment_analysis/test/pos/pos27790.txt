We purchased this robot, the white one and the Miposaur for our boys for Christmas. The robots are really cute and can battle each other in "lazer tag" (but that wasn't as much fun as we thought it would be). You can download an app to interact with the MiP via your tablet or phone, but they preferred steering him around, delivering treats to our cat on the balancing tray and watching him spin around and dance. It was very entertaining for a few days but they don't play with them much anymore.
