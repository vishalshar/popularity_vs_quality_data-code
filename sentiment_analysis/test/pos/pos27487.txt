I bought this digital measuring tape for my husband for Christmas. It was a little confusing at first trying to figure out the actual measurement. There is a button on the side that toggles between inches and foot and inches.  The display is clear and easy to see. Its outer shell is plastic so I am not sure how long it will hold up to prolonged use.  I checked out the type of battery it uses so I could buy more. Would hate to be in the middle of a project and the battery go dead.
