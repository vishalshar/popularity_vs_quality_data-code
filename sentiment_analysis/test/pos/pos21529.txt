Yes. In fact, that is a banana in my pocket. My Speakeasy Briefs pocket. (Apparently, Amazon thinks that a photo of a phallic fruit stashed in the pocket of my underwear is too inappropriate. But my hand down the pocket grabbing my junk isn't)For being somewhat of a novelty, these boxer briefs are actually very comfortable. Comfortable enough to wear every day.The pocket is big and spans the whole area of the front. You can hide a lot of junk in there for safe keeping next to your other junk. Great for festivals, concerts, games, or traveling. I just hope that the metal zipper doesn't set off metal detectors which it shouldn't. If you're going to be shoving a flask in there and going somewhere with metal detectors, you might want to get a non metallic flask. Or else you're going to have to explain why there's a hunk of metal in your crotch. I don't think anyone will believe you have robotic genitals.I'm very happy with my Speakeasy Briefs and I believe I'll be back for more.I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
