I love it!  I've been using it so far just on craft beers and it works as advertised.  It's easy to set up and to clean.  It does take some trial and error attempts to refine the pouring process but we're talking beer so just have fun drinking the "it's not quite there" miscues.  The only negative is the tap handle on mine doesn't quite screw in properly and the sometimes pops off.  Small price to pay for at home draft beer.
