Awesome product! When I made the transition to natural deodorant, I was extremely skeptical. However, Primal Pit Paste converted me. I was sick of chemical floral scents and sick of harsh concoctions mucking up my underarms, and this product was the answer. I am an active person and walk about 4 to 5 miles a day in all weather, so I needed something that actually helped prevent smell a bit, and Primal Pit Paste did the trick. I only had to re-apply on the most hot and steamy of Boston days.
