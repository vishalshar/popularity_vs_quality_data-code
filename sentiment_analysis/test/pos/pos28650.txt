I bought this device quite some time ago, and used it only briefly, so I need to get back on a regular routine to give it a fair chance/review.  I've paid for light therapy in salons for a much higher price.  When I purchased this item it was a very reasonably priced.The thing is, this type of therapy must be used regularly to see results, so in that respect I haven't used it regularly enough to give it a proper review.It takes personal time to lay down with the light positioned just so over your face.  The unit functions very well, strong orange and infrared lights (non visible light).  A more flexible, or longer arm might make the positioning of the unit over your face easier, I think that would be the most significant complaint at this time.  The purchase price now is much higher then when I purchased it from Amazon.All in all, the unit functions as it is supposed to, and I believe LED light therapy to beneficial, but it must be used frequently to see improvements.
