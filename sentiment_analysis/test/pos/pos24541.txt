This thing is wonderful.  I was going back and forth between Foobot and Awair for about a week before I decided to go with Awair.  The deciding factor for me was the Co2 reading.  Foobot does not actually have a Co2 reader but puts it together by an algorithm of other measurements.  While Foobot has more perks in the sense of historical data, IFTTT compatibility and the ability to work with more than one unit, I decided those were software app enhancements and will eventually come.  I was pleased to find that historical data has been expanded to one week and that it can work with multiple units already.  Clearly an update occurred after many previous reviews.  IFTTT compatibility is currently in the works so I'll be able to integrate the findings of my Awiar to trigger actions such as run my house fan for 15 minutes, or raise or drop the temp of the house, etc...I'm very pleased with the findings of my Awair unit and have already taken action to help prevent poor air quality from every day house activity.
