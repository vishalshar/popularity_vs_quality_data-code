I love this activity tracker. I've had mine for 17 months.  I've really beaten mine up, I've worn it every day 24 hours a day (even while sleeping) because I like the data tracking etc.  However, please DO follow instructions for gentle cleaning.  After 17 months, probably because I've used alcohol (to spray and disinfect), the protective coating is now peeling off; and I have to replace it.  Despite that problem (which I believe is my error), I'm still recommend purchasing this tracker.  It's been a constant companion, every day reminding me to breathe deeply, and encouraging me to get more active.Note, when traveling, before going thru security, don't forget to remove it (unless you enjoy getting patted down); it sets off the scanners and perplexes the security people.Hope this helps.
