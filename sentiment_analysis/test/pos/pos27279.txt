Firstly such a great company with amazing customer support, empathy and excellenceSecondly the PodTracker is amazing. I use it everyday to see what Scampi my cat is up to while I'm at workIt works perfectly right out of the box and is easy to recharge and interchange the batteriesPlease don't let the size put you off. It's not that big in real life and it's smooth, tough, reliable and Scampi doesn't even notice he has it on or tries to get it off.I personally guarantee you will love your purchase.Before buying it I did a lot of research already having a basic gps tracker but it wasn't in realtime and you had to keep taking it off and downloading the data. Too much effort in the end. But with my PodTracker I use it everyday. So make the jump and click "add to cart" you'll have so much fun!!!!
