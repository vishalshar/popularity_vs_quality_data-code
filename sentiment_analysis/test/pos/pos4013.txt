Bought these to take on canoe trips, to reduce waste. It's a great set & I love the little case that keeps everything clean & tidy. The knife cuts through meat. The fork is very strong and has no problem piercing a piece of raw carrot. The fork edge has a slight cutting edge also. The spoon...works like a spoon is supposed to work! Plus you've got a nice little toothpick stashed in there too. I've started to carry my set with me in my purse. I eat a lot of lunches at my desk, so this set is the perfect answer. No more stabbing holes through my lunch box trying to transport a steak knife to work!!
