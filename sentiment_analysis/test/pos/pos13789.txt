Most useful device for prolonging the quality of a bottle of wine if you only want to drink one glass!  The second iteration pours faster than the first but is still rather slow.  The enclosed sleeve should protect you from an exploding bottle, but I have had no problems.  Main complaint is still the expense, but the device works well as advertised.
