So I don't own a coffee maker because I'm not a regular, every day coffee drinker. I only drink it when I *need* the caffeine boost. But when I drink coffee I'm partial to smooth, not bitter tasting coffee. Didn't know what to expect from Bizzy. I literally just tried it for the first time (used water as the mixer because I don't have any almond milk right now) and it's fantastic. Smooth, not bitter at all, and actually flavorful. I just added a little sugar to sweeten and nothing else. I will definitely buy more next time around!
