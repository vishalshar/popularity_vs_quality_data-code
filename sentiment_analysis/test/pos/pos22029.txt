I bought this for my husband, but I ended up really liking it! I like watching the concerts - its like Im there!  Its comfortable on my face and the picture is really clear. I have an iPhone 6S Plus and the fit is really tight, but it works just fine. I think Im going to ask for one for myself for Valentines Day!
