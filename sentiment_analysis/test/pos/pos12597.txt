Its a wonderful product and meets my wxpectations. Only problem i found was one of my tag was not registered even crow flight distance was less than 20 fts because of alot of hurdles. My alarm device is in upper portion and tags are in lower portion of the house.Extender is must device to buy along.Still its cheap but meets expectations.Application is written in some different technology so little bit slow but works fine. Zone option for armin and disarming is my favourite.I will recommend this to everybody but with extender device.Bravo..
