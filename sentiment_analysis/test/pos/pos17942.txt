I love my Bellabeat Leaf Nature! I wear it every single day, which is big for me as I'm not a jewelry person and I often forget to put things on.The Leaf is beautiful and simple and it's very versatile. If I want it on as a necklace, boom, it's a necklace, if I want it as a bracelet, done; or if I'm at the gym I can clip this baby to my bra and it stays put for the whole workout. I primarily wear it as a necklace, and I've gotten numerous compliments on how pretty it is. One of my friends bought one after seeing mine because she loved how it looked and I couldn't say enough good things about it.It's not an average fitness tracker, as it includes meditation for wellness as well as period tracking and stress monitoring. Again, it's versatility has been a huge focal point for me personally, but it's effective in measuring activity and I have reminders set for when I haven't moved for a period of time. Working in an office, this has been incredibly helpful, as I sit at a computer for long periods of time each day. Also, I take full advantage of not having to sync it for days at a clip. In the beginning, I'd sync it every chance I got because it was exciting to see my activity through the day, but as I get busier I forget to sync it, and I love that it holds onto my info for a while. My only issue (it's not even an issue) is that it's not fully waterproof. Outside of that, I love it so much!
