I had previously purchased a 20 Amp, four USB outlet device from The HERRINGTON Catalog.  However, when I saw the Charge Tech, 27 Amp device WITH a 115 VAC outlet as well, I had to have it.  I returned the 20 Amp device, unopened as soon as it arrived.  (I didn't even bother to open it!). Anyway, the Charge Tech is perfect and was the same $150.00.  When I go to the VAMC (for the three day stay, which is required each time I visit), for treatment, I stay in an eight man berthing compartment.  Trust comes at a high price these days, so when I go to sleep, I lock my iPhone 6+, my Apple Watch and my BOSE Bluetooth earpiece in the supplied locker.  By the end of each day, the phone and the earpiece are exhausted of power.  The watch about half-way.  The best thing about the Charge Tech device is that I can plug the Apple units directly into it, and as the Bose unit requires the use it's OWN charging device, the AC outlet on the Charge Tech sure comes-in handy!  I lock everything in the VA supplied locker, and by 0800, everything is fully charged and ready for another day of use between, (and sometimes during) appointments.  It lasts the two nights of use and still has enough power left to use it at home for the rest of the week.  I try to drain everything with rechargeable batteries, to a minimum of 20%.  I was an Electronics Technician and a GPS Repair Instructor in the USN for almost 14 years.  My career was ended by a traumatic brain injury...but I still know of what I speak.  When I recommend the Charge Tech device, it is from an informed opinion.  You can take my word, or leave it.  If you elect the latter...it's your loss!  H E ?
