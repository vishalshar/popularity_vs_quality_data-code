I like the flavor of popcorn - always have. For years and years, I never even considered adding any seasoning beyond butter and salt. However, someone gave me a shaker of cheese flavored seasoning, and I never looked back. None of the stores I frequent every carry more than two or three of the flavors, so when I saw this sampler pack, I ordered it.I dry pop the popcorn in a microwave, hit it with a butter-flavored spray (Can't Believe It's Not Butter is very good), then either sprinkle on some salt-substitute or some or one of these flavorings. This way, you get a huge portion of the stuff for around 200 calories!This means that for me, the butter flavored topping is a bit redundant - your mileage may vary. The white cheddar is very nice - great cheesy flavor without overpowering the popcorn itself. Same with the nacho cheese. The ranch isn't what I expected - more of an onion-y overtone, but pretty good. The caramel could be a lot stronger. The bacon cheddar is right up your alley if you like either flavor - you get quite a taste of each in every bite. Be careful of the cheesy jalapeno - it's pretty spicy, so a little goes a long way. Also, I managed to inhale a tiny bit as I was shaking it on, and I was coughing for five minutes. My far and away favorite is the kettle corn - sweet and salty at the same time, it takes my right to the county fair when I use it!You can of course use these on foods besides popcorn - such as baked potatoes, pasta, or salads. I haven't used them in those ways, so I can't say how they'll work for you. But if you're a popcorn lover - I highly recommend trying this variety pack!
