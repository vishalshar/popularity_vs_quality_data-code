I have been shopping for sometime for a good affordable and yet easy to use pull focus that would work with the 50mm f1/8 prime lens, it's hard and most of them are over hundreds of dollars and requires a rail system and such.Then I first found DSLR Solutions' focus system, it was ok, the problem was that the velcro system is hard to tighten it out with the prime lens. During a film shoot, I got so mad at it that I took it off my camera and gave it to my grip (as a gift) lolThen I started shopping again for an affordable one, and ran across that Kickstarter page, I was skeptical, especially not knowing if it works for the prime lens. I emailed them and got a prompt respond.I ordered! It came fairly quickly from Adorama, and very simple! For the prime lens, just put the extra rubber to it and then attach the shifter, and that's it! it works and it doesn't get lose and it was very smooth (comparing to the $$$ follow focus system we also have at the studio).I definitely recommend you to try it out, do some google or just go to their website, plenty of videos to show you how to attach it.
