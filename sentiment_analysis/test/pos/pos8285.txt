Love my withings watch. I used to have a Polar A300 but it was so big, bulky, and ugly looking. I also got a 18mm Magnetic Milanese Loop Stainless Steel Magnet Closure Lock Watch Band For Withings Activité, Activité Pop or Activité Steel (YESOO Retail Packaging - 180 Days Warranty) (Black) metal strap with magnet closure for it to dress it up a bit more. The included strap is a very soft and comfortable silicone, but I wear this watch with suits at work, so wanted something a bit dressier. The app is very functional and easy to use, and the watch is basically your standard analog looking watch; the exact reason I bought it. If you're looking for something with fancy features and all the bells & whistles, look elsewhere; Garmin or Polar have what you want. If you want something that looks like a watch, not an activity tracker, then this is the watch for you.
