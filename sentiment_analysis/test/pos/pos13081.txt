Thin and light case, protective, holds my iPhone 7 Plus very securely to my Quad Lock Out Front mount, even when the ride is bumpy.The design of the mount system makes it easy and quick to mount or unmount your encased phone on the bike mount, good for those Kodak moments that happen on your ride.The case fits on the phone very securely. Some people like this case enough to use it daily, even when not biking.  You certainly could - it's thin, easily pocketable, and the part on the back that attaches to the bike mount protrudes very slightly--less than you'd expect from the pictures.I have 2 other cases I prefer to use when I'm not biking.  It's really not hard to put the Quad Lock case on or take it off when you're done with your ride, so that's great if you need to swap cases frequently like me.I like that the case is sold separately from the different mounts Quad Lock makes.  A year ago, I invested in Quad Lock mounts for my two bikes plus a Quad Lock case for my iPhone 6 Plus.  When I upgraded to the 7 Plus last fall, I didn't have to upgrade the mounts, just the case.There's a clear cover available for the case which isn't included with it.  The price for the case alone is reasonable, but the case + cover costs more than I want to spend.  But I can survive without the clear screen cover - the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are more water-resistant than previous iPhones, and if I get stuck in a downpour, I don't mind putting my phone in a pocket.The Quad Lock case plus mount isn't cheap.  But it's well made, very secure and protective, and I expect will last a long time.One tip for people who haven't used a handlebar mount for their smartphone: leaving the map app open and the phone's GPS on will drain the battery quickly.  I'm getting better battery life with my 7 Plus than I've had with any previous iPhone.  But still, make sure you're fully charged before a long ride.
