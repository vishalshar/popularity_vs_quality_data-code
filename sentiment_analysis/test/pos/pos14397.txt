I thought this was going to be a disappointment. But, it turns out to be one of the best purchases I've made. It has everything I need to travel fast and through the TSA process. The battery charger was huge for me, since a lot of times the outlets at airports are hogged up, and I like sitting light on the plane, so I really don't enjoy having to pull out my charger and plug it into the outlet on the plane either. The charger is perfect for layovers, and I don't have to sit near an outlet for hours and hours. The location tracker, I haven't had the need to use it yet, but it's nice to know that if my luggage ever gets lost - I can track it real time! I actually tested this out by leaving it a friend's house and it was pretty damn accurate as to where my luggage was located.The digital scale is super helpful, I don't have to remove items or add items and then weigh it to check for accuracy. I can literally monitor the weight and pack as I go, without ever worrying if I've placed too much items in my luggage. I also love the electronics compartment on the outside, I used to HATE having to dig through my bag for my iPad and then having to somehow fit it back into my luggage. Now, I can just pull it out from the compartment and slip it back in once through TSA. The digital lock is pretty cool too, I don't have to worry about small keys or combination locks, as I used to with my old way of using luggage.The design is great, it's sleek and probably one of the better looking luggage cases out there. I haven't run into any issues with this item so far. Will revisit and add more if anything changes regarding my great experience with this item so far.
