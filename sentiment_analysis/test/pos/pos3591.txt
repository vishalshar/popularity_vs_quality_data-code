Forgot how much I love having fish as pets...gave it up because I dislike having to clean the tank and stress the fish in the process.  This hydroponic tank is fantastic!!  I have had it for over a month and the water is still crystal clear because the plant cleans the fish waste.  Only thing I would offer is that it is better to start with a mint plant or live basil if you can get it (the seedlings were a challenge at best).  Also - if you do not heat your house to over 70 degrees, the website has an excellent heater to add to the tank.  I have 4 of these now - they are amazing!!  One is mounted on a "floating" wall shelf and the centerpiece of my kitchen.I even installed one in my husband's office.  No way I would have done this without the hydroponic component as he does not have time to clean the tank.  The reduction in his blood pressure is worth the cost of having a happy fish in a tank to look at during the stressful work day!!
