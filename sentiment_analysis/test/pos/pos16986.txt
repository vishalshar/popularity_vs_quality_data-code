I liked this mascara because I don't like a heavy look, it stays on all day and removes easily with my normal facial cleanser.  If you like long lashes, this product won't make you happy (reason for 4 stars). It gives me a little color on the upper and bottom lashes. If I want to reapply and refresh during the day, the lashes will not clump. I prefer a natural look which this mascara gives me, without clumping and easy application.
