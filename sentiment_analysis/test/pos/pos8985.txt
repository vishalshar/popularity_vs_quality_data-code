My Daughter said she wanted a robot for Christmas... I got her this learning tool instead. I like how the child has many different modes of play with this toy on top of learning code to be able to program the bot to do things. A skill I am certain She will need later in life and with this toy hopefully coding may become "fun." .... We will see...
