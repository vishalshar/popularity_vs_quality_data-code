This thing is awesome.  I have had mine for 3 weeks and we have had 5 outdoor movie nights so far. You can't CHARGE and play simultaneously, BUT, you can have it plugged in to run indefinitely, ( I'm using the wall charger and cable from my old HTC one too power it.  Last night we watched the whole movie Planes which I had ripped on to a large sd card and streamed from my phone, then after the kids were in bed, I rented American Sniper from the Play store and streamed that from my phone.  Tonight, we rented Paddington from the Play store and streamed it, then I Netflixed Top Gun....you can't charge it while your watching, but you don't have too. I think most of these people that have an issue with this don't understand how to operate it. It comes with an Android 5pin cable, which is the standard android connection you use to charge your phone, and it comes with an 11 pin android cable which I need for my galaxy s5.The remote is only necessary when using an SD card mounted directly into the machine, otherwise, you connect your tablet (I used it with an Acer A500), your phone, (I used a Motorola blur (I think that's the name) an HTC One and A Samsung GS5), or a laptop. I even used it with my Chromecast.The ONLY issue I have, is the volume from the internal speaker. If you hook an external speaker up to the cube with 3.5mm cable, you will be disappointed. But the machine simply can't push a lot of volume. INSTEAD, I turn bluetooth "On" on my phone and use a chargeable bluetooth speaker...plenty of sound. This nuance means that in order for you to have any significant sound, you will need your phone/tablet/computer to do the heavy lifting. I have a 64gig SD card, which I have ripped most of my favorite movies to. I ripped the movies in mp4 so my phone can read them, turn bluetooth on the hook up the projector. ..no issues. The picture quality is great,  plenty bright enough for a moderately dark room. Tonight the moon was nearly full and I'm projecting onto a 92 inch screen without an issue. If you purchase this I world recommend a quality bluetooth speaker and a large sd card for your tablet/phone  (not the cube), unless you will be on WiFi while you're streaming.--Update--Going on 3 or 4 months now. Still works great. I've used it for backyard movie night (probably 10 times now),  I've used it for work to show training videos in many different office settings (just find a clear wall or white board; now a tax write off), I've used it while camping in an rv (shown on a portable screen) and last weekend I made a case from a 3 inch mailing tube and a piece of memory foam and hiked way back into the Sierra mountains in CA. I downloaded a few movies to a micro sd card in my phone,hooked my phone to the cube and watched 2 movies broadcast onto a nearby huge granite rock. This thing is amazing and so far I couldn't be more impressed.
