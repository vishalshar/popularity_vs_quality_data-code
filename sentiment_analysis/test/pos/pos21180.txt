I purchased this phone in gold. Haven't been able to use it fully since one the sim cards need to be cut down. I can remember reading that a screen protector is included in the package but i didn't get one i got a clear case instead which wasn't supposed to be included in the package. Just saying I would have preferred the screen protector instead of the case. From the little i did with the phone its great so far.
