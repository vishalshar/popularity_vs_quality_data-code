I had perfect vision for almost 49 years. Now I'm coping with glasses. I've bought around 10-15 pair in the last year or so.  I've lost a few pairs. The biggest problem is I often don't have them when I need them. When I saw these I thought they would be great backups to the regular pair I try to keep up with.  I've only been using Thinopitics for 2 days and they are already my primary pair.  I keep thinking I should get another pair, but I don't need another pair. I almost always have my phone handy and therefore my readers are always handy. It's so convenient to put them away in the case attached to the phone I can't see loosing them. They have a lifetime warranty too.I'm a very happy customer!
