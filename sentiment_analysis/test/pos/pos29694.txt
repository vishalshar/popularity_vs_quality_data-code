This scooter is on the pricey side but worth every penny. I use it to commute to work when I'm running late or when my arthritis makes it painful to walk and impossible to walk fast. What I really love about it is how fun it is - when the joints are aching the uplifting ride keeps me in a good mood, and that's important. It is very well engineered and I get a kick out of folding it up when I arrive at work and dragging it behind me. I get lots of questions and compliments. I've seen people ride this on the street, but I stick to sidewalks and go very slow when there are lots of people. It goes at a pretty brisk pace, but not enough to be scary (rated at top speed 15 mph). I greatly appreciate the light for evening. It was very easy to get to know how it works, brakes work very well. About a month in and still very pleased with the purchase.
