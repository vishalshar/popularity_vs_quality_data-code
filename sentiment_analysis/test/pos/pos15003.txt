Great product. Works well I use with facial brush and it really does a good job at exfoliating .It's not harsh like some previous brands I have used.  I'm sure anyone especially those with sensitive skin can use with no issues but everyone has different skin .Definitely leaves my face feeling so clean and has a brightening effect as well.The tube was sealed and is a decent size.With this product I definitely got my money's worth.You really only need a little each washing .I found a little really goes along way .Will reorder when needed.
