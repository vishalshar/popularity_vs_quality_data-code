I received this as a sample for review. It works great, taste is subtle and it's a very healthy choice! I absolutely love cooking with this product! This bottle is large 500 ml and only a little is needed at the time, so it last awhile! It's great, has a high heat point, and it's much healthier than other oils. I prefer this to olive oil, because it cooks better and more evenly, and with a 485 smoke point I don't have to worry about toxins getting into my foods! This is a very versitle oil, it's been great for saut√©ing, dressings and even using in place of vegatable oil for baking! This has to been one of my favorite cooking oils to date, it's healthy and taste great! Definitely make the switch if you're trying to eat better and healthier! I've been using it for tons of meals for weeks and I still have over 3/4 of the bottle left!
