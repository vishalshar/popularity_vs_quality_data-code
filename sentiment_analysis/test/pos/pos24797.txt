I gave this item as a gift to my husband, who is an extremely technologically saavy android phone user.  The result:  He loves the product and has recommended it to others.  We tested it outside at night (I stood outside while he scanned the yard and took photos), and were amazed at how clear and accurate the heat-seeking images were (my silhouette lit up like an orange Christmas tree).  He also tested the camera in rooms where we tend to have drafts, and was able to quickly locate the areas around doors and windows that require insulation-related repairs.  I recently recommended Seek Thermal to our plumber. He suspects that this product could prove highly useful to him professionally.
