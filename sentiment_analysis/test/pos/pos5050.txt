Im reviewing StormSurge here but I bought all 6, 2 for my boys, and 4 more for gifts because Ive never seen anything like these. Its like a doll and action figure combined. The torso is plush but, unlike a lot of 18-inch dolls of girls, the limbs (which are plastic) bend and the shoulder, elbows, hips and knees.  The hair is a hard plastic, I thought it might be a little sharp on some of the dolls but my 6 year old now sleeps with his every night and so far no problems. My boys have thrown theirs around and they are pretty rugged. The stand included in the packaging is great; my 8 year old keeps his on the bed stand beside him. Love the idea of the comic book too; its nice to have superheroes for younger kids that arent all PG-13 movies. Too bad they dont have more accessories or change costumes.
