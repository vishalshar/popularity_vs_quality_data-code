This drink is a very good quality drink. It has a calming effect even with the caffein.I had to stop the use of this drink because it became quite addicting. I don't like touse any product that is addicting. It was easy to stop, with no side affects.Howeverthe Flower extracts are very powerful even in small doses and make no mistakethey are medicinal ( short term use only). The people who designed and craftedthis Elixer know what they are doing.
