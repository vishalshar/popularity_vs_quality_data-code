This is an excellent product. My Maltese has some dietary sensitivities and this is one of the only salmon jerky treats that is made only with salmon. All others have strange ingredients and fillers that may cause problems for her. She loves this and the salmon is recommended as non-allergenic by our veterinarian. My only reason for four stars instead of five is because of the price. Fortunately my 7lb dog only gets itty bitty pieces as treats, so this bag last us a long time. Better yet, it is made in the USA! Many treats are made in China, so be sure to read labels!
