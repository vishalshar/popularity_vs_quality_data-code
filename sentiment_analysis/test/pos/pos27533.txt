Read The Specs First.  This is an awesome product.  It provides IR imagery for very low cost.  The XR Extended Range version has a fixed zoom lens with manual focus.  I found the zoom too tight for the work I do so I am swapping it for the standard version.  I suspect that the XR version will be better for those who want to track game or 2 legged critters in the dark but it is too much zoom for construction details.
