For years, my primary care physician has asked me to take my blood pressure at multiple times during the day so he can review more info than is available from my infrequent visits to the office.  Yes, I have an Omron 10 at home, but the process of pulling it out a multitude of times, finding the same piece of paper that I've written on before and writing on it again (and again, and again) is enough to make me ...er.... forget to do it.I almost bought an Omron 10+ so I could keep records via USB on my laptop.  I thought that was the state of the art.  It's not.I did a little more research and found that I didn't need to connect via USB.  First I took a look at some Bluetooth enabled blood pressure monitors, but then I found the Blipcare WiFi BP Monitor.  I hesitated because of the price, but then took the plunge (I ordered the WiFi scale at the same time).It's all it's cracked up to be.One of the things I've learned in my several decades of temporary occupancy on this earth is that there's a greater likelihood of things getting done if it's easy to do them, if there are few hurdles in the way, and if you create a do-able routine that takes no thought.  This was not possible for me before for consistently taking blood pressure readings.  Now, it is indeed possible.Setup is simpler than you might think.  The unit has its own embedded wireless access point.  Turn on your laptop.  Insert batteries into the Blip monitor and the acronym "AP" (think: "Access Point") appears on its screen.  On your laptop search for the "Blip" access point and connect to it (no password needed).  You are now in communication with the Blip Monitor.  Open your browser and go to a specific IP address (mentioned in the included startup card).  You are now on a simple configuration page.  You scan for your local WiFi's name and choose that as one of your three possible WiFi connections (Why 3?  The unit is light enough to carry between home and work, and maybe you want to take it along with you when you go on vacation).Register on the Blipcare.com website, and sooner than you can say "systolic" you'll be transparently uploading data from your Blip BP Monitor and creating pretty graphs.As I mentioned above, I also purchased Blip's scale at the same time.  I've been creating pretty graphs with that as well.  Taking multiple BP readings per day is more important than taking multiple weight readings, but I've been doing the scale thing, too.One thing that I've observed about the Blip readings as compared to the readings I get from my Omron BP monitor and Omron scale is that the Blip readings are "tighter" when measurements are taken close in time.  Let me explain.  With the Omron machines, if I were to try to repeat a measurement shortly after one was previously taken, the systolic/diastolic readings can vary by 5 to 10 units in any direction, and the weight from a scale measurement can vary a couple of pounds.  This behavior would make me not particularly trust a single reading from the Omron equipment.  So, you can't take one reading.  And you can't just take two, because you wouldn't know which one to trust if they differed by more than an insignificant amount.  So I'd wind up taking 3 or 4 blood pressure readings in a row or stepping on the scale 3 to 4 successive times.  Then came the mental math to compute an average reading.In contrast to the behavior of the Omron equipment, both the Blip BP Monitor and the Blip scale provide repeat measurements that, in my experience so far, are very much closer to the first reading.  The variation in the BP readings will be at most 2 or 3 units.  The variation in the weight readings will be at most a fraction of a pound.The result of this improved behavior in the Blip units is that I have much more confidence in the readings.  I take one reading and go off to do more important things than wasting time on trying to figure an average result from a number of repetitions.The one thing that I think the company needs to improve on is the website user interface.  There's little in the way of instructions, which means you have to hope that everything is intuitively obvious, and that happens not to be the case for all the features.Is the aforementioned website difficulty enough to detract from a 5-star ranking?  Not in the least.  The sheer design brilliance that leads to the simplicity that makes it so easy to monitor blood pressure regularly gives such an upward pressure to the number of stars that I can't imagine anything pulling down the number of stars I'm willing to give.While I'm using the Blip BP Monitor solely for my own purposes, it's easy to see how a concerned adult with an aged parent might want to purchase a unit for mom/dad to use.  The readings get posted automatically, and the adult child (or other concerned person, such as a doctor) can have access to the online data to see what's going on from a remote location.  The website even gives you an opportunity to set things up to automatically send out a notification email if certain events happen (e.g., systolic is above 150 for 4 consecutive readings).I'm telling you, I can't wait to see my primary care physician's face when he sees the data and charts I'm going to be bringing to him on my next visit.
