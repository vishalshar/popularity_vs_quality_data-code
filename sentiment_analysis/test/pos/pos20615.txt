Handy little gizmo. I bought this for my mother who is always losing her keys and phone. I know that embarrass' her too. So I picked this up as a birthday gift. She's used it a few times. Works just as advertised. I do wish the device was a little louder. At times it can be hard to hear. I really like this over the TILE because you  can replace the battery and not not have to replace the device.
