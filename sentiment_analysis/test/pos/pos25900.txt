Great way to jam with different tones without having a mess of pedals and other equipment. Awesome Bluetooth speaker will def get the cops called. I had to upgrade to a 7" tablet because if you are using your phone it gets interrupted too much, so I just leave the tablet with the amp. Great for just practicing and or jamming with friends it is loud enough to play with a big drum set for jamming.
