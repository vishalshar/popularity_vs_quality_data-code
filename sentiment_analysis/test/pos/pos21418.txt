I'm hard to impress, and this product is impressive.  Very bright, very simple to use, very decent battery life.  4 stars because you HAVE to use the remote control to select source.  It is a tiny remote and you will lose it at some point almost certainly.  If the projector would auto-sense the source or even just remember the last source you used that would be wonderful.  But no, you have to use the remote every time.  Even a button on the projector itself to select source would have been fine.  Forced use of remote control sucks.Update:After a month of usage I changed this review to two stars.  The battery will no longer charge adequately, the remote just continues to get more frustrating, the sound makes it virtually unusable with video, there is no support site for the product, the menu should default to MHL which is what everyone will use.  This product could be SO GOOD if they made a few corrections.Update 2:  Unit no longer stays turned on more than 1 min.  Have owned it 6 weeks.  Amazon will not take a return and the website has no support or warranty info.  I would buy another product.Update 3:  Back to 5 stars again!  Rif sent me a new cube and it seems to solve all of the issues I mentioned above.  Remote is now bigger, device defaults to MHL input so you usually don't need the remote anyway, battery is better, etc.  I'll nitpick a bit since Rif is actually responding to reviews (which is great) - the included cords could be a lot longer.  If you are stretching to a DVD player or a laptop they are pretty short.  Speaker is still too quiet but it doesn't seem like there is real estate for a bigger one.  Love the product - kids watch movies on the ceiling a couple times a week, I carry it in my backpack for work, wife uses it for stenciling fonts onto a chalkboard in the kids room (pic attached).
