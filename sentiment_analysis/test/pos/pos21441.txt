I was looking for a quality case that included some good functionality for a reasonable cost.  While the Otterbox will protect your phone more than you can ever imagine, it also doubles the size of the phone.  Rokform is cool, functional, and protects the phone.  It's an awesome product.  I had it with my iPhone 4s and just upgraded to the 5s.  Thankfully the add ons worked with both phones.
