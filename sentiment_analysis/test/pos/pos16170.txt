I've been using Dream Water for about a year on occasions when I've had trouble falling asleep.  I don't know whether the effect is real, or a placebo effect, but I can say that on almost every occasion I did get tired and fall asleep shortly after taking it.  Either way I've been satisfied with the results.  Yes, it's expensive, but I'm kind of glad because it keeps me from taking it too often and getting hooked on it.  It seems to be a useful product.
