This was a welcome departure from all the cheap crappy cell phone holders I've had in my cars over the years. This guy is really well made and solid. It barely holds my Samsung Galaxy Mega 5.8, but my phone isn't going anywhere from my bike. It is nice and snug. I've jumped off curbs and gone over potholes and it stays put. I'm so stoked to finally have my phone on my bike for listening to music and tracking my rides.
