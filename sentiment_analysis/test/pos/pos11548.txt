Bought this after having a couple of cheap drones fly away.  That's no longer an issue.  The GPS always brings it back.  Camera quality seems good and the picture is stable.  There is no feedback from the motors into the video like cheaper models.  Tons of camera settings.I have only had a few minor issues.  One was getting video to play back onto my TV or computer.  Changing the default video from .mov (default) to .mp4 seems to solve the issues.  The automatic landing works great in GPS mode.  With manual landing it seems to tip over easily.  Perhaps turning off GPS mode would work better.  I have noticed that the propellers are tough.  I'm still using the original props, even though I have tipped it over three times.  The switch for GPS mode is right next to the camera up/down wheel.  It's easy to accidentally hit the wrong one.  I tried using an Android LG device that was available.  The FPV video was great from the Star App, but most user settings did not work.  I didn't check to see if the device was on the Autel approved list.  I now use my iPhone 5S without any issues other than the small screen size.The suitcase is great.  The App works well once you get the right device.  (You'll need a lightning USB cable for Apple devices).
