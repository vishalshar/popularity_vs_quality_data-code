All I can is sick......I'm a huge Philips Hue Fan, but since they don't offer an outdoor bulb this is most definitely the way to go. I only own one since I only have one outdoor light that I have to take care of. I think this product might though have an issue if you had several, well not an issue but pretty annoying. Overall build quality is on par if not better than Philips. I wish these guys made more bulbs. I am a huge fan of the color green and this has the greenest of hues unlike Philips Hue where for some reason don't understand that people like green.
