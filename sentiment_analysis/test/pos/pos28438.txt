It was an eye opening experience. I've been on the quest for a perfect steak for a long time. I've found it. I received the cooker yesterday. We cooked 5 NY Strips last night. They were a little over 1" thick. My butcher seasoned them up before he vacuum packed them for me. The cooker was super easy to use. I used the iPhone app and connected to the cooker with my phone. This is totally unnecessary, but totally cool!! LOL.  The recipe in the app was spot on. The cooker sent me a message when the cooking was finished....not that I needed it...I was hovering over the pot watching it cook for the whole hour. LOL. The steaks were cooked Med-Rare ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!! Edge to edge perfection. I measured the internal temp at 135deg. I threw them on the searing burner for about 2 min total and served em hot. Ohhhhhh my goodness.....they were so delicious. I was skeptical at first. Not anymore. Is it just an expensive water heating doohicky??....Yes. Is it totally awesome and cool water heating doohicky??...Yes!! :-) Get ya one!
