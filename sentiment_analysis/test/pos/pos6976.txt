PROS- Awesome picture quality. The technology is super impressive.- Sound quality is also great; they work really well in headphone-only mode- The ability to see above/below helps for spatial awareness  its not as consuming as VR headsets. Truly, its just like having a big-screen TV in front of your face with the ability to see/feel your surroundings. I can watch a show while folding laundry or keeping an eye on my kids.CONS- The lens adjustments needed to get a clear picture can be difficult and time-consuming- It can get heavy after a while; I need to lean my head back on something after a half-hour or soYou also look kinda silly while wearing it, but that is a given considering the category. Overall its a really cool device that I imagine will only get lighter in weight and easier to adjust in future iterations. Fun product, great start.
