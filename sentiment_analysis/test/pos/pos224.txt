Fantastic product.  To be fair, I'm not an overly smelly armpit person. That said, I love Primal Pit Paste AND Schmidts AND Piper Wai.  They all work wonderfully for me.  Yes, I did get an initial bad reaction when I first tried all natural deodorant, but then discovered that most everyone has to "detox" from their old mainstream deodorant first.  I used some Sulfur soap for about a week to help clear up the bumps/rash in my pits and tried again.  Worked like a charm and no more rash after my next applications.  I ordered all three kinds of natural deodorants (Primal Pit Paste, Schmidt's, and Piper Wai) to check them all out and see which one I liked best.  Scent-wise, I really like the Schmidts and Piper Wai, BUT I have only tried the Lavender scent from Primal, so maybe I'll like some of the other scents better. Texture-wise, Primal is my favorite. It's soft, so you don't need a paddle (even though it does come with one, I use my fingers) and it goes on smooth.  The Schmidt's and Piper Wai are a littler harder and you have to hold it up to your armpit for a few seconds to warm it up before you try and smooth it on. All three work on me great, though, and I would rate them all 5-stars.
