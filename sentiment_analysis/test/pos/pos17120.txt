I'm soo glad that i bought this item! I wash my brushes once a week and the fact that i can use the brush guards to keep the shape and allow it to air dry is amazing! I've washed my brushes before and tried to figure out a way of drying them without having the water run into the bottom of the brush and ruining the glue that keeps it together but they'd either be ruined completely or the brush would be, for a lack of a better word: deformed.I take care of my make up brushes a lot and when I trvel I like knowing that when i go to use one their not messed up at all.The Brush Guard Variety Pack has definitely saved my brushes from being thrown away and me from having to buy new ones every couple of months :D
