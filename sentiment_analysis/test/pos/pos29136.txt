The iFetch was purchased for my granddog, Otis, a Labradoodle, also known as a designer mutt. As a well-heeled and discerning consumer, he loves his iFetch. Being smarter than dogs that put the ball in and then have to chase it, he prefers for Mom put the ball in so that he can stand close in front of the machine and catch the balls as they are fired out. His reflexes are amazing! Otis is excited when it is time to play with the "robot," his word, and will do it until the human is worm out. I do not know if he will ever stoop to loading the ball himself.
