Avid biker here.  I have a lot of bottles.  Out of the dozen I own six are Clean Bottle brand.  These by far are the best.  They ARE THE EASIEST to clean.  You can put smoothies in them.  If you get some bottle wash brushes you will have no problem cleaning them even if they are left in your car with smoothie residue for a month.They do NOT leak.  I see some people complaining they do.  They do NOT.  There is a seam between the bottle and caps that may hold water so when you fill them and tip them it seems like there is a leak.  It is just the water caught in the seam.  Very durable.  Only negative is they don't carry as much as a regular bike bottle.  I usually carry one regular and one clean bottle with me on my rides.
