Overview: These filters work to make the colors pop out more in my videos and photo's.Design: The filters just screw onto the lens after the original one on the Phantom 4 is removed.  They act as sunglasses for my drone.Quality: The filters are made of high quality parts and materials.Function: The Neutral Density (ND) 4 is good for cloudy days.  The ND 8 is good for sunny days.  The ND 16 is good for very bright conditions and even when flying over water.Pros: Before using these filters, I would have a glare on my videos because of the bright sun.  These filters make it better for getting the brightness on the video's perfect.  I did a photo comparison to show how the picture looks before and after putting the ND 4 filter on.  The first picture outside is without any filter on.  The second and third outside pictures are with the ND4 filter on.  When I shot it, the conditions were partly cloudy.Cons: After creating the video, I noticed that it was grainy.  I did however record it in 1080p so maybe raising the definition of the video quality would help more.  The grainy look was gone after I did some post production edit by raising the sharpness.Overall: I would recommend these filters as one of the most important accessories to get when purchasing a drone.  I am surprised that the manufacturer doesn't already include it with the purchase of the drone.  The filters really took my videography to the next level.
