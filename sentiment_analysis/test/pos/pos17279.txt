I accidentally requested a refund after mistaking the product to be flawed but after trying a few things out, it worked perfectly!The device would not connect to the app after following instructions, so I figured to some how reset it if I could by taking out the battery, which is located behind the logo. You have to take off the cover (side with logo) then take out the battery and re insert. A red light will blink. Put the battery back in as instructions are shown located on the lower left of the backside. Re insert the cover and follow the instructions.Everything has been working perfectly. I would highly recommend.
