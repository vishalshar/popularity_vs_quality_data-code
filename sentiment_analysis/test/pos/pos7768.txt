I know testing should be a regular process, and appropriately so for crucial reasons. But I have to admit that I have never tested before. Maybe it was the inconvenience of setting up a consultation or feeling like I've been safe in practice. The myLAB Box on Amazon was recommended by a friend and was absolutely worth testing (no pun intended). It was a good experience and in my opinion far better than going through the hassle of going to a doctor or finding a clinic with lab hours that I can actually make.1) When I opened the HIV kit box I found an easy step by step guide with the accompanying tools (lacet, test paper, mailing materials, etc.). To be frank I've never done a self pinch blood test before so the only friction I had was muscling up to do it myself (vs. a nurse typically doing it), but it was pretty simple and painless as it was just a small drop of blood instead of a whole vial that a lab would typically take. After that was done, I placed my blood on the designated paper, let it air dry for 30 minutes as suggested, sealed it and it was good to go. The best part was that myLAB really takes care of the busy work of putting together the mailing envelope, address, and postage. I literally just had to pack it and bring it to USPS. No extra steps involved, no extra money. In short, they really remove anything you don't need to do yourself. Definitely allowed me to finally take a test like this without having to go through the trouble of setting up an appointment, etc.2) I also received a chlamydia/gonorrhea test with my purchase that took no more than 5 minutes with the specific instructions attached. It came with a cup, and an easy to use method to dispel the urine in a test tube. Packed it away with all the prepared postage material and it was good to go! Couldn't have been easier. Collecting the urine sample was just like going to the bathroom at a doctor's office.
