The august lock has been a great addition to my studio.  The ease and convenience of unlocking the door without keys and being able to let others in from a distance is great.  The lock is well built and aesthetically pleasing.  Both installation and set-up were incredibly easy.  Your door MUST close all the way with ease and your deadbolt MUST be aligned properly for it to work right.The Auto-Unlock has been a big disappointment for me.  I am using this lock on a studio that is only 30 or 40 feet away from my backdoor.  The close proximity of my studio renders the auto-unlock function (as it is currently implemented) useless.  Upon setting up auto-unlock I found out that you must move at lease 100 meters (I believe by default it is 200 meters) away from the lock in order for it to auto-unlock when you return.  So, for me that means it basically never works unless I run an errand in the middle of the day and go directly back to the studio.  Even worse (and why I ultimately disabled auto-unlock) is that when I left my house and came home the august would connect and my studio door would unlock even if I stayed in my house.  This was a disappointment.  I assumed the lock would be able to tell when you were approaching the door (say 5 to 10 feet away) and unlock the door for you.  Apparently the technology is not there yet for that kind of implementation.  So if auto-unlock is a big feature that you're interested in, make sure it will work in your situation before buying.Otherwise it is a solid product.
