I feel good about giving these vitamins to my three year old. He likes the taste and I feel like they are helping to keep him healthy. I was looking for an effective children's vitamins with no extra sugars and these gummies do not disappoint. I have mixed feelings about the fact that you need to give 4 gummies per day (mom's have a lot to remember on a daily basis), but we do half in the morning and half at night. My pharmacist is a good friend of mine and let me know our bodies obsorb vitamins better taken throughout the day, so with that being said, it makes sense. We will continue using these as they reach my high expectations.
