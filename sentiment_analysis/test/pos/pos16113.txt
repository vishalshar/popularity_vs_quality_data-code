It's an awesome game that my 8yr old and I both love. It's a strategy game pretending to be a math game that teaches math facts as a side effect! It isn't time based, so there's no pressure to do calculations fast, but being able to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division well allows you to run through your strategies in your head more easily. Anyone that can count to 100 can actually play but the game gets more fun the more you get comfortable with basic arithmetic. Even if you don't yet know how to multiply or divide it has an ingenious color coded scheme that helps you figure out the answers.
