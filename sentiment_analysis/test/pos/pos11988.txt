This really works.  The tracker reminds me to get up and walk. It also lets me know when I'm stressed, or calm.The tracker comes with some breathing exercises.  I've only tried one, but it was really good.I can integrate my calendar and location with the tracking report.  If a meeting is stressing me out, I can see it plainly at the end of the day.
