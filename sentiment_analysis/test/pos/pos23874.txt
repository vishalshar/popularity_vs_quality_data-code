Several months ago I was served wine at a friend's house and she used a similar aerator.  I decided to purchase one.  I found this one from AFL Products.  When it arrived I used it right away on a bottle of wine I had on hand.  It was a wine I had purchased before, but didn't care for--until I tasted it aerated!  I was shocked at how much of a difference aerating makes.This is a very well made aerator.  It has good weight and is attractively displayed in a stand.I am very happy with my purchase I paid a lot less than my friend did on hers and this aerator is as good or better.
