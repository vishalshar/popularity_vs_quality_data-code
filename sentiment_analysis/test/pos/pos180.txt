I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by this tool.  I usually take a Mountain House pouched meal with me when hiking and had other sporks, but they were a little short when reaching the bottom of the pouch.  I didn't want to carry one of the larger spoons so this was perfect.  You can use the utensils individually or lock one to the other for a longer reach.  Perfect and definitely worth carrying with you.  It's also strong and lightweight.
