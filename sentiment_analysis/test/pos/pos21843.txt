I guess I'm getting lazy, but the first thing I do when I buy shoes is get rid of the laces. I don't like them, but I can't always find slip-ons, especially for running shoes. These are a great compromise, I only used two per shoe, still have a great fit and can slide them on and kick them off easily. Until Nike makes some Free Rn loafers, I'll keep buying these.
