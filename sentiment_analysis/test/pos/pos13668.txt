Comparison:-I have tried a bunch of sleep trackers, but they are not geared towards sustained us. The Eight is so much easier than other sleep trackers I have tried over the years - phone gets knocked off the bed, wristbands run out of juice, then I have huge gaps in data which make it impossible to optimize sleep.Heating:-I didn't know what to expect with the heating feature, but I was pleasantly surprised. I appreciate that, through the app, you can easily automate when it turns on an off and it can be different for each side of the bed.Tracking:-It correctly tracked my go to bed and wake up times and had standard light and deep sleep metrics.-I am really interested to further explore the breathes per minutes, toss & turn, and temperature metrics to try to optimize my sleep.Unboxing & Set Up:-I appreciated the that packaging was beautiful and well organized. The paper instructions and app instructions were clear and simple for quick set up.Needs Improvement:-Documentation insert says it must be unplugged everyday, I wonder if that is necessary.-The white noise feature in the app could be improved... I tried jungle sounds at 1am and it came on full blast, which was a bit jarring-The app is fairly comprehensive, but it's unclear that the star icon gets me to the warming, alarm, etc. features.
