This company has superb customer service.  I received my Hang-O-Matic and I thought the bubble split in 2 so I called the company and they shipped me a new one right away. It worked great. I hung a curtain rod, 2 floating shelves and some pictures.  It was so easy to use.  I just ordered a few more as gifts.
