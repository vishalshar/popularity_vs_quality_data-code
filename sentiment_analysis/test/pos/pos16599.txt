The only reason why I picked 4 stars - because I didn't really like the color.  I really liked the dyed patterned blue but wished it has in pink.  Other than color, this is FANTASTIC!  Much better than what my son has (Tech 21 Mesh).  I am thinking about purchasing the dyed blue for my son but it may be too babyish for him because he's 10.  My daughter is 5 and this is perfect for her and she loved it and easy to carry when we are going out for errands.  Just perfect!
