The taste on this sauce is awesome, sweet with a slight kick, I absolutely love it. I've gone through about 3 bottles already, what finally got me to leave a review though was the customer service. I received a bottle that got broken during shipping, I put in my complaint on a Saturday night saying the bottle got broken. Sunday morning Lawrence just asked for some photo's to verify and had a new bottle shipped out on Monday. I appreciate the service.
