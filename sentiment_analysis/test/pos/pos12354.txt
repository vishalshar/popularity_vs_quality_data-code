Reading the prior reviews and sad stories about lost devices I decided a fresh approach was in order. I used thin double sided tape on the back spine and around the rim of the device (all places where the band touches the medallion) and I am going on 9 days now and no loss or exit of the device. It can really never leave the band now since its taped in, but I won't lose it!
