First impressions. Quick prime eligible delivery. The packaging is great. The box is labeled with the color for easy organization if you store a lot of filament. Inside the box was a resealable vaccum sealed bag of very good quality!Zero issues with my prints. I can quickly tell this is high quality stuff! The price is excellent for the quality of the product. Last but not least the 500g spools are great. I was a little bit apprehensive and wasn't sure I would like it as much as the 1kg spools but it makes it better to not have the same spool exposed to humidity for too long. Also gives you a chance to try some colors you may not want to print with alot without having to commit to a 1kg spool.Overall 5 out of 5 stars. My new go to filament!
