Our 5 1/2 year old son loves both of the YOXO kits he has!  He has recently been into all things Star Wars and legos, so he immediately started building the spaceship included in this kit.  He then began adding on his own "shooters" and "boosters" to the spaceship and has been flying it around the house pretending it was in battle.  Our 2 1/2 year old daughter has also enjoyed putting together pieces and building random things.
