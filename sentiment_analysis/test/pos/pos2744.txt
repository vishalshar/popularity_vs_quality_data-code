Best kitchen "gadget" ever.  Creates perfectly cooked steaks, I just sear them on my panini press, or grill.  My favorite might be the moist chicken though.  I flatten chicken breasts and put ham and cheese in the middle.  The sealing process makes for a very nicely held together cordon bleu.  Served with a nice mushroom cream sauce...love it.
