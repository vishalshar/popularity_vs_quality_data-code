The headphones are amazing, gorgeous elegance with amazing sound. The sound is crisp, clear and makes video games come to life.  If you are video gaming make sure that you use them on wireless/active mode instead of connected to your controller (passive mode).  The difference between modes is like night and day.  If you have a big head like I do, these headphones are superbly comfortable even after a few hours of gaming.  I am very happy with the purchase especially since I got them on Prime Day at a discount.The only "con" about the headphones is the packaging, I couldn't find the wires so I tore the box apart trying to find them.  Imagine my surprise when I looked at the center of the box and realized all the wires were located right under a pizza slice looking logo lid.  I am still :-( that I ripped the box trying to find the wires.  I am providing pics that show the location of the wires.
