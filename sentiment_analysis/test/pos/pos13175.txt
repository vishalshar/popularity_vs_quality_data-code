I purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas, but they have to remove their I-Pad protection in order to use it.  Since Mom and Dad have had to replace broken I-Pads before that did not have any protection, they chose to say they could not remove the protection for them to use this product at home.  So, if you have that same concern, this product is not for you.  I brought the Osmo Gaming system home with me, so they could play with it at my house.  I don't have protection on my I-Pad.  They enjoy it very much here and play it everytime they come.  My grandchildren spend a great deal of time at my house, so it is used frequently.  If you are not concerned with using your I-Pad without any protection, this is a super gaming for you or your children.  My grandchildren are 9, 12, and 13.  They all play as you can set up accounts for everyone that wants to play.  It can be played alone or in groups.  However, if played in groups, only the one signed in on his/her account gets the credit for solving the task.  I have an account too!  I have not played any of the games on my account, but about a week ago, I learned that I could download Masterpiece (free)  for  Osmo and use it to trace pictures.  I am involved in Bible Journaling and some of the imspirational pictures on Pinterest are above my skill level.  I can take a screen picture of my Pinterest inspiration and trace the part I need using Masterpiece and the Osmo.  It is GREAT!  Can I just say, I love it!  There is also another download available that is free.  At this time, Amazon has this product on sale!  If you are interested now is the time to get it.  I highly recommend this product for all ages above 8 years of age.
