Kuna lights are easy to install as a replacement for existing outdoor lighting fixtures, and we were in desperate need of an upgrade anyway. The smartphone interface is excellent and very easy to use. We started with one, and now have four!Easy to install on Wi-Fi. We have one installed more than 50 feet away, and three of them the Wi-Fi have to go through multiple walls. The only thing we did a little differently was to wire them up to an old extension cord in the same room as the Wi-Fi access point to logon the first time and set the password.  Don't know if we needed to do that, but we found in the past sometimes the first time a device mates with the Wi-Fi access point it does it better if it's close at hand.They work well with CFL bulbs. The smartphone interface has lots of features--audio alert on your phone, talk with someone at the door, turn the light on/off, play pre-set message, sound an alarm, go back and view video clips from the motion-activated sensor, and more!Limitations: No night vision mode. So at night you only see as far as there is light from the lamp, unless you live someplace with lots of outdoor lighting. It only saves clips activated by the motion sensor, not continuous video. So for example, one mounted on the front of the house or garage will not capture 24 hours of activity on the street in front of your house, but will just save people walking up within range.
