Great phone mount! Stable, easy to adjust, lost of adjustment options, and the larger button for the arms is a big improvement. It also seems that it will stay stuck to my Prius dashboard but we'll see how it holds up once it starts to get hotter in a few months.I hope they solved the spring breaking issue with this version...we'll see...=)EDIT:Updated 03/06/16I have take two stars off because the little legs on the bottom will not say at the height where I set them. It seems the screw is too long to keep the legs secure and I had to add a washer to fix the issue.EDIT: 03/13/16I contacted iOttie about the leg issue and they sent me a replacement. This one had the correct size screw and so I've bumped them back up to 5 stars.
