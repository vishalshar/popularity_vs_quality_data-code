Since I've bought these 2 months ago, I've almost always had them with me because they're so handy. Sometimes I'll leave my regular readers at home and just bring these. I use them every night to read in bed, because they're so light on my face that I don't notice them like regular glasses. They go on very easily, even one-handed. They stay on pretty well, unless you sneeze or blow your nose. I find them very, very comfortable, even for extended periods.I did NOT attach the case to my cell phone case, because it's thick enough already, so I can't say how well that works.I've gotten some amused comments from colleagues at work, one said I looked like Morpheus from The Matrix and another said that next I'd be wearing a monocle! But others have said they look good. My wife tolerates them, though she thinks they look odd. But I suspect that's exactly how she feels about me! (tolerates but thinks I look odd).  (Just kidding, honey!!!)On the negative side: I've tried to keep these always either on my face or in the case. I think I've only dropped them twice, yet they have a few small scratches. I only notice them when they're off my face, so they haven't affected my vision yet. They offer a guarantee, but I haven't looked into taking them up on that. If I have to order these again, I'll order directly through the company, since I can get 2 pair for only $6 more than Amazon charges for 1 pair.I got them with a clear frame and 1.5 power. I really need 1.25, especially for reading computer screens, but the company (repeatedly) says that the 1.5 will do the job. I'd like to see that customer service rep buy new shoes and get them 1 size too small or too large, and tell her "those should work for you!"  :-)
