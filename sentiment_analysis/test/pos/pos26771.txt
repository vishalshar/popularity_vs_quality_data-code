Installation Problem #1:First position I installed it in (right on the bottom of the opener per the Garadget recommendations) had too much light interference because of the lamp on the opener (the Garadget couldn't "see" the laser reflecting off the door and so always thought the door was open). I fixed that by mounting a little block of wood in front of the Garadget (on the bottom of the opener) with double-sided tape. The block cast a shadow onto the Garadget and made the detector work fine. Problem #1 solved.Installation Problem #2:The day after I installed the Garadget, I noticed that the regular garage door remote had its range dramatically decreased. Before, I could open the door from a block down the street, now I had to be in the driveway and feet from the door. Confirmed it was the Garadget, because when I unplugged the Garadget from power, the normal remote worked as before. I'm assuming the WiFi must have been causing some sort of radio interference than messed with the normal opener. Ultimately, the fix was to buy a bit of bell wire and a longer micro USB cable and install the Garadget on the ceiling of the garage a few feet away from the opener (see photo - I mounted the Garadget to a "blank" wallplate that I screwed onto the ceiling and ran the wires through the attic for aesthetics). Problem #2 solved.Now that I've got the installation/positioning kinks worked out, the product is very convenient to use. I never worry "did I remember to close the garage door?" anymore. If I want to go on a run or a bike ride, I don't need to bring keys... just my phone (which I'd have anyway for tracking my workout). Great idea and a simple design.
