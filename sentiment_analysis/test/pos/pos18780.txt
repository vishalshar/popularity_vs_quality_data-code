I purchased this for my kids ipad mini. I was looking for something that would protect the device from tosses, drops, and just plain kid negligence! Well, the search is over! Not only does the case look good with the colors and the functional handle, it is thick and actually causes the device to bounce when it's dropped. You can clearly tell that it absorbs all the shock. I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun and effective ipad mini case.
