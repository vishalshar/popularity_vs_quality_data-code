Great yet simple smart watch. With our cell phones that can do everything, who needs a wrist watch anymore. I've discovered that I do prefer my wrist watch for a quick check of the time, or the date. That's it. And I found a watch face that does that well and adds a few extras. The heart rate monitor is a cool bonus and it does that quite well. I get 7-10 days on a charge.
