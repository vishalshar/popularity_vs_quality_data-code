I have two of these used primarily as PT IP security cameras in my house, mounted on the ceiling. The quality of the image is great, although you need good wi-fi bandwidth. The pan angle is really impressive, almost a full circle. The sound is two way, and includes a loud siren, still and video clip capture ability. The customer service is really top - notch, being a small startup with responsive and helpful, quick support.The drawbacks include (addressing the 1-start rating): the QR setup code process is very, very tricky, but the newer versions of the camera firmware and handheld app. make this easier. The sound can be somewhat unreliable when first establishing an audio stream, but once you start talking or listening, it seems to catch up. The motion detection push notifications can be overwhelming, but this seems to have been changed in more recent versions of the software too. Finally, the video and images recorded on the microSD in each camera, if you wish to this to record instead of the cloud, can currently not be viewed except by removing the card from the camera and using a reader attached to a computer. Also, it would be great to have the ability to stream to the cloud and the microSD simultaneously.The team responds to feature requests and feedback quite nicely, so I assume these final features will be released soon in a future version.I personally do not need the IR remote control ability at this time, but it seems like a great idea.Since this is a new and rapidly improving product, I see no reason why it should not be given a 5-star rating during the next few software upgrades.
