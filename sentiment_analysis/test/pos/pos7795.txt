I am so, so happy to find a filter system that drains into a glass container.  Although I'm not totally plastic-free in the kitchen, I try to use as little as possible.  I like to have filtered room temperature water sitting out, ready to use.  In the past, I haven't been in love with the idea that my drinking water has been sitting in a plastic pitcher all day.  It's wonderful to have an option out there that's glass (and I can live with the water traveling through the plastic filter to fill the pitcher).  The whole thing has worked well for me.  It's easy to fill and pour.  I know that there are some questions as to what the filter actually filters out, but for me I just wanted something that would get rid of the chlorine-y odor and taste & anything else that it happens to filter out would be a bonus.
