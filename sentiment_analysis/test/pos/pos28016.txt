I just set up the system today.  The setup was very easy, but you need to know that this kit does not have everything you need for a healthy Betta.  You'll need to purchase a heater, and additional gravel would give the aquarium a healthier substrate.  Also, the aesthetic elements are additional purchases you will probably want to make.  What I wish was included was an aquarium light so the fish is shown off to his best potential.  LED lights that suction to the base of the grow tray can be purchased here on amazon for about $15.  Speaking of lights, I also purchased a grow light for the slotted plants because I want to grow cooking herbs like mint, basil, oregano, etc.  As I said, today was the setup, I'll update the review as I see how it works for both the fish and the herbs.Two months in and the herbs are growing well and the fish is healthy.  The only problem I face is in tank algae...probably brought about by the light I added to the system.  The snail I have in the tank can't keep up there is so much algae.  I'm going to have to do a water change to clean out the algae.  But, the grow light is great for the leafy herbs, if you were wondering.
