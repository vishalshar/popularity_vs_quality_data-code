They got a 4 star because it took for ever to get these darn things.... Had them shipped to my work address where I receive all my packages ... First off they gave mii an estimated delivery time ..... It never got here ... Contacted them they said they sent another one ..... Still didn't get to mii .... I contacted them again and I have to say their customer reps were very helpful and reassuring thanks (Vivian & Patrice)  I don't know what was going wrong btwn them shipping it and the post office getting it to mii...but it never got to mii and the worst part is there was no way to track this packages which sucked major ...... So we tried one more time and this time had it mailed to my house and it got there finally !!!!! And I loooooooove then hassle free drying of my make up brushes and they don't loose their shapes ..... Thank you brush guard
