The set up was relatively easy with a nice integrated app. I have a lot of d-link stuff and have found it very reliable. The one trick I found was that it is easiest to temporarily enable WPS on my normally non-SSID broadcasting wifi router. With that, the set-up was incredibly easy.I like that the App allows you to name the device and select an appropriate icon to represent it.
