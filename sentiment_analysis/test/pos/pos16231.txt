Overall a good product. The thermos does not keep food hot for as long as I would like, but it is better than no insulation at all. I was able to keep yogurt in one compartment and crackers in another without them getting soggy, or any leakage at all. When you remove the thermos compartment in order to pack a sand witch, you'll have to cut it in half then stack each half a bit in order to make the standard bread size fit. The compartment divider works very well, doesn't slide around.
