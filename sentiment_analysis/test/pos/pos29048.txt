The case feels very solid and I'm not concerned about the safety of the phone.Doesn't appear to be any flash bounce back that I've encountered yet.Doesn't add much bulk to the phone, nice and sleek.Only problem I've had so far is that the side buttons are incredibly hard to push, but that's due to the thickness of the rubber protecting the shock from a drop.  The may wear in a bit, but its worth the protection.
