I bought this to use on my iPhone 5S for HD Video recording. We cruise a lot and I'm tired of viewing videos with that awful wind racket the built-in mics make while out at sea. The only post-processing that works with that racket is to mute the sound and maybe do a voice-over for the affected tracks.The Ampridge MightyMic for iOS with its wind sock has eliminated the awful noise! I couldn't be happier! And, with the directional shotgun pointing at the subject being videoed, any background noise is realy subdued. This was a very good purchase for me.
