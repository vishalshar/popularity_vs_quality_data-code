I finally found him a Frisbee.  It seems safe for him to chew on since it is soft.  It does not fly like a professional Frisbee, but it supposedly works on water also.  My dog is an adult Chow mix, and he is not much of a chewer, except when it comes to Frisbees.  He likes to play with this and carry it around.
