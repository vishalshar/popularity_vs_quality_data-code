This is one of the few pet food companies that DOES NOT participate in animal testing, as in the cruel laboratory kind. (This has been verified by PETA.) Also, it has an accurate suggested feeding chart on the bag (verified by my vet)--this is rarely the case fir other dig foods. The ingredients are well-chosen and combined. And my dog (and her digestive system & skin) likes it, too! :)
