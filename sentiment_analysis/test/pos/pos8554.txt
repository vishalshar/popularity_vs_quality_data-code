Our dog loves this.  I fill different toys with various treats for lunch every day.  He will sniff in the box to find the toy that has this jerky in it.  I have just ordered salmon hip and joint and salmon skin and coat to try those.  Would like more pork options as I believe my dog is allergic to chicken.  I really like that it is sourced/made in the USA.  I will not give our dog anything made in another country.  It is easy to break off into pieces so it can fit his toys and also so I don't have to give the whole thing to him in one go as he's not supposed to have so much to eat.
