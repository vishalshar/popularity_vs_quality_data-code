My husband has written a screen play and is planning on using his phone to shoot the movie. His only problem was the ambient noise from the mic on the phone. We found this and he is OVER THE MOON ecstatic. This condenser mic works exactly how he wants it, bringing the dialog out and reducing the white noise.
