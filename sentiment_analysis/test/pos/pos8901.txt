Lock works great. My client loves it. Siri likes it too. Of course, it was installed yesterday. LEt's check back in 6 months.Decent Build quality. Lacking in installation detail, and no OBVIOUS "settings" icon on APP ( it is the little decorative circle that opens settings.... foolish )Requires a GOOD quality lock, and modifications to lock for optimal fit, something I specialize in. So it was no trouble for me.In this case, it was the ONLY product on market in a keyless lock of ANY sort that would fit the door itself, due to custom design of door.Communicating with the company is nonexistant. Phone only for installation help. We applied as a reseller months ago, no replies.I would prefer this be wholesaled in traditional form. It was a royal PITA to get all three components, deal with sales tax resale issue and not pay freight.
