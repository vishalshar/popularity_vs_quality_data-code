I have been wanting to buy these for awhile now and I finally pulled the trigger.  The instructions were done pretty well but I found an installation video on YouTube that was extremely helpful during my setup. It took me a bit longer then I expected but I was very meticulous during the installation.  The work and function great on my mountain bike and the amount of people who have stopped me to ask about the lights has been unbelievable. They definitely add a high level of safety and visibility as I am riding! Well done Revolights!!
