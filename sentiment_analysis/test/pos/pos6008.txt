This is a fun brush set to use. It leaves my hair very full looking, much more than I want. I've wrapped just my roots, which is tricky to do and not leave a line, but the outcome is much more desired in my case.Being able to leave the rollers in and start a new section is convenient and much quicker than traditional rollers. The brush can be used as a regular round brush, so I've done that wo leaving any rollers in.Quality wise, these look like they'll last a while.
