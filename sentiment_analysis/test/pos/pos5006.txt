I love the convenience and ease of setup for this feeder. The camera gives me a bird's eye view of him in a feeding frenzy. I have found no issues with the online interface, and it is on time with scheduled feedings. This is great if you like your animal to feed at specific times, but can't be there. The only problem I have found is the 'call your dog' aspect doesn't work so well with my unit. It is a garbled, low noise. I've tried recording my message 3 different times, and I have a loud voice, so the issue is with the machine not me (thus the reason for 4/5 stars). The machine is quite large, so I recommend measuring the area you plan to use. Because I also use the Drinkwell Multi-Tier Pet Fountain, my 5lb. Chihuahua has a feeding space that measures 20"D x 33"W! But I love both of these products, and recommend them to all pet lovers.
