As a passionate fitness instructor Im always looking for new trends and gadgets to enhance my class programming for me and my students. When  I was introduced to Tone-y-bands I love the way it looked and feel - pretty fashionable and comfortable. Then when I used them in all my classes UAUUU!!!  Pilates / Dance /Running /Aqua/ Cardio conditioning truly added that extra punch it says you will feel.  I burn at least 15% more calories in each class. Its heavy enough to add resistance (which is adjustable) to maximize intensity but light enough to wear without injury throughout the entire workout. I truly recommended, all my students love them.
