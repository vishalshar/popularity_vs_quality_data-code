I ordered this delicious energy for myself and my fellow firefighters. We are all prior military vets turned contractors out here at Afghanitan. Lotus was a hit with everyone out here!The taste is phenomenal and its all natural! I've noticed it doesn't leave you with a "crash" hours later and some of the guys have even mentioned it subsides therir appetite, which is a plus if you are trying to lose weight/exercise.I am not a coffee drinker so Lotus is my morning coffee for the day to keep me up and 'em the entire day!  I am going to substitute my pre workout energy powder for Lotus next time I workout. See if Lotus can give me that extra push in the gym... I'll review the results once I do. I would definitely recommend this product! I even have some of my family members buying this product after I ordered some for them. Thumbs up Lotus!!
