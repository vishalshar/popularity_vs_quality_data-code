I have been using this keychain for the last year, and I absolutely love it. It keeps my keys organized and they don't rattle in my pocket. I added a USB drive a true utility mini tool. The small hook you see in the pic came with the try utility tool and I find it is very convenient to snap my keys to my car key fob. As you can see the leather is holding up really well and the stitching has not come undone. Definitely would purchase again.
