The installation was a breeze, and after really quick setup it started working.After some really quick bug fixes by the software team the doorbell is coming on into its own now.Kudos to the tech support team as well, as they were very helpful and prompt that built my confidence in the august brand.Pros:- Great camera picture quality with true colors.  Skybell and ring don't hold a candle to this one in terms of video quality.- The audio quality from the speaker is loud and clear enough and works very well.- Oh and did I mention it's pretty trendy looking - functional and elegant.Cons:-  Just wished it had a LED light when its dark outside to help the camera capture better images by illuminating the faces .  Although I could put a motion sensor led light near the door to get the same results so not a deal breaker by any means.Haven't been so excited about a doorbell this much.  The other advantage is that it will act as the communication bridge if you already have or plan to get the August smart lock saving you $80 for the August connect device right there. So it's a win-win if you also plan to update to a smart lock and there is none better than August's as per all tech reviewers.  I intend to purchase one myself and use it along with this, and will update my review in a few months , possibly giving it 5 stars if all goes well.I truly believe this is the best doorbell cam with a pro-active software team ,that makes incremental changes quite often like  Tesla does and sends it over the air.
