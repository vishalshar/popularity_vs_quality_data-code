The Premama Digestive Aid chews arrived in a re-sealable bag inside of a small box. Each chew is individually wrapped, much like a caramel candy. I am using these primarily as a digestive aid (and not a prenatal supplement) since my baby is almost 9 months old. They have a tasty, caramel flavor and are soft  not overly sticky to chew.Ive taken Align probiotics off and on for almost 10 years to combat digestive issues, and have been using these Premama chews for 3 days. Im a fan of the Premama supplements so far. Its great that each serving (1 chew) contains 2 grams of dietary fiber  which my Align pills do not. I eat one with my morning coffee  which is actually a lovely combination  and one in the afternoon when I need a sweet pick-me-up. I do like that these are handy to keep in a purse or diaper bag for portability. During the summer we are on our boat or camper quite a bit so packing these is easier than a baggie full of probiotic pills.Now for the cons: This is just a personal observation, but I would not have enjoyed these chews during either of my pregnancies since I lost my sweet tooth during most of that time period. If you have to avoid dairy, wheat or soy for any reason (which I did for at least 6 months postpartum), this is not a product for you. And I have noticed a light coating on the roof of my mouth after eating these, which does go away after a short while.Overall I would highly recommend this product. I received these chews as a gift from the weeSpring Parent Panel in exchange for my honest opinion.
