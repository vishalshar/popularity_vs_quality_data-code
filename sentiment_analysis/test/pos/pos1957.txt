5-star so far. My old moka pot has become too raggedy so I thought I'd try something new as a replacement. I purchased the ground bean version as I purchase from a local roaster. I didn't expect much from it... A hand operated espresso machine?  Phsaw... Yeah right!I pulled my first shot today (sans the burr grinder that hasn't arrived yet so the grounds could use some improvement and will undoubtably improve the end product when the correct and even fineness). It delivers a deceptively espresso-like product. It lacks the darker hue and viscosity of a proper Italian espresso but it did produce a lovely light crema, rich flavor, and zero bitterness. It's summer in Washington, D.C. so I opted for iced with a splash of milk (hot beverages might just cause heat stroke this week). We'll see how it holds up over time and through the season till its time for hot. I noticed that the espresso did not retain its temperature for long but I paused before pouring the boiled water into the chamber so it could have and probably should have been hotter from the get go.Great all-around first impression!!
