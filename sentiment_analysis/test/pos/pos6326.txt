I refuse to even think about the amount of money I've wasted on Parmigiano-Reggiano that either molded or turned into a block of cement in my refrigerator despite all my attempts to keep this beloved cheese protected.  No more!  I've been using these bags for about five months now, and I've not lost a bit of cheese to spoilage.  My Parmigiano-Reggiano remains in excellent condition until the last crumb has been used up.I no longer waffle about purchasing a newly found expensive cheese for fear it will come to an untimely end in my refrigerator before I can use it up, I know it will keep in these bags.
