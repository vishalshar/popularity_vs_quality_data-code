Great little alarm system.  The app is good, a little slow at switching between tabs, but still good.  It tells you the last 24 hours worth of activity on the doors, whether it was opened or just shaken.  You can set schedules for it to arm/disarm at specific times on specific days, or arm/disarm it manually every time you leave the house.  It is definitely loud.  We've forgotten to disarm it a couple of times in our apartment, and the neighbors definitely hear it.  The set up was easy, it's never once crashed, and it just works!  Yes, if you open the door real slow you may be able to not have it go off, but I don't think this is deal breaking.  We have this paired with a $80 video camera we also bought that detects motion, so if either go off we can check our phones and see live video of the door.  The korner pieces stick well to the doors, the part that sticks into the router is a little oddly shaped, but it does it's job well (I mean, they fit some type of networking card, and a loud speaker into a tiny little thing!). The router piece also rotates (between the white and grey section on the picture), so you can always make sure the speaker is facing up.
