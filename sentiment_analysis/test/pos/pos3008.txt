I discovered Dream Water sleep aid at store in JFK NY airport.  I found it helpful to get a good night's sleep after more than a day of travel, followed by a full day of activity on vacation.  I was physically tired but so excited about trip, that I was having trouble sleeping and getting used to the time change.It is somewhat pricey when buying individual bottles.  Buying by the case of 12 helps to make the product affordable for occasional use.  The ingredients are available as supplements for those who want a less expensive sleep aid for regular use.I like the taste of Snoozeberry, not too sweet.  I sometimes get tired of swallowing pills (medicines or vitamins and mineral supplements), so having a 'shot' of beverage to consume is convenient.  I especially will use when I have to rise early but am not feeling sleepy early enough to get 6-8 hours of sleep.  I do wake refreshed after drinking the sleep aid and don't feel that it knocks me out, just helps me sleep.
