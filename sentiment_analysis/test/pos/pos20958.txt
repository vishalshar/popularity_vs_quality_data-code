I have used this about 20 times now (Mostly for stakes) It is awesome. I buy stake in bulk when it's on sale, Vacuum seal individually, (I found it better  to season with Thyme and/or parsley but salt and pepper untill later because it can slightly dry the stake.) Then freeze them. They keep for a long time frozen and vacuum sealed without freezer burn. When its stake night just take out as many as you want, Place them in a vat of water (I use a large lobster pot) set the Temp for 126F (med rare) and walk away. You can leave them cooking all day if you need to. They won't get over 126F so they won't over cook but you need at least 2 or 3 hours depending on how thick your stake is (less if they are not frozen.) When you'er ready to serve just remove from the bag salt and pepper to taste, put them in a very hot frying pan or grill just enough to sear the outside of the stake and enjoy. Perfect every time. I have done a prime rib like this and it was amazing.
