I recently purchased a MergeVR headset and have been very impressed.  I did quite a bit of upfront research and it is as advertised.  Visual quality, comfort, and usability are all 5/5.  If you are unsure of which VR headset to buy I would highly recommend Merge.  It's been a hit with my family and friends!
