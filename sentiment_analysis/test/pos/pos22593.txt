We have a terrible chipmunk problem. They eat through siding, electrical wiring, burrow under and wreck concrete, etc. We have used various means over the last 25 years, the most effective to date being the "bucket of death" (look it up). HOWEVER... The Raticator S-Plus is a rodent ridding machine!!! The advantages are numerous: very little prep or mess, easy disposal, visible "catch" indicator, easy maintenance, and the fact that IT CAN be dis-assembled for cleaning. I think others had mentioned it can't, but there are 4 philips screws holding the bottom plastic floor on. Just be smart about it, ok? I had condensation cause it to false trigger and short (you'll hear a faint "zzzzit...zzzit...zzzit" sound when you flip its switch on) and was able to open it, separate the parts/plates and dry it out (and left it to air dry as well). Works great. Other advantage is that I'm now catching moles and voles (and one mouse in my garage) which I've never been easily able to do. One trick I'm using is crushing sunflowers seeds in a mortar and pestle into a dust and sprinkling that around the front, a bit inside, and leading to, the Raticator. I've noted that they have a new model that uses infra-red detection, which may alleviate some false trigger or failures, and I might just get one of those, too!Update June 30th: My brother-in-law asked me to order 1 after he tried mine. I notice several recent 1 Star reviews and wish I could help since I have one (paid full pop - not a freebie or promo) and it's working very well. I do take the time to pulverize sunflower seed into dust for a "trail" for the chipimunks to follow and I do "camouflage" it with leafy tree and bush branches. Rats and even chippies are pretty smart and skittish and you have to sort of know the habits of the ones in your immediate are. Surprisingly, I'm getting voles which were eating the bait out of my previous small live traps without setting them off. The Raticator got them. With chippies, you might exhaust one nest or burrow and have to move the Raticator to a fresh location in order to keep a "clear perimeter" around your home. Which is all I'm trying to do. No rat problem here, but I'm putting a heckuva dent in the chipmunk and vole population around my house.
