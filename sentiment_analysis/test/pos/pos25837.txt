I've been very happy with this lunch box. I know that some claim for it to be a bit small, but keep in mind that you can stack items and the clamshell design will accommodate them. As many others do, I utilize just about every size of your standard tupperware and have not had any size that this cannot accommodate. With the biggest sizes, upon zipping the shape of the lunchbox may change some to accommodate but overall it is a nice product. I do like that the zipper appears to be made well and does not hang up or have any issue.
