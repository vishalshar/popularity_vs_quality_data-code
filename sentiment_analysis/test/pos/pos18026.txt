The convenience of these sheets far outweighs any negatives. No more struggling with the mattress in middle of the night if you have a sick kid or a constant wetter. The edges near the zipper lie more flat if you take them out of the dryer after only a few minutes, smooth them out and hang them over a door to dry. I've had mine for a year now and they hold up decently well. I have three and rotate through.
