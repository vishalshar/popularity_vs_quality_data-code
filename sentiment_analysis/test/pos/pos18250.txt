I read all of the glowing reviews about this mouse on the net about how it is the most magical, comfortable mouse ever so I had to give it shot, especially when it was listed as a Prime Day lightning deal.This mouse is covered with the soft touch rubber that I love, which makes it smooth and somewhat grippy at the same time.  The texturing on the sides is a great touch and not too aggressive, which makes it easy to lift off.  There are slight finger grooves on the right of the mouse for your ring and pinky fingers that are great if your hand size fits.  The buttons are tactile and responsive, no complaints there.  The sensor is spot on and I did not detect any acceleration or jittering when using the mouse.Ergonomically, the mouse is fantastic for people with mediumish hands.  I wear a medium sized glove but I can see this mouse fitting people with small to large hands fairly well.  Those of you with monster mitts, this mouse may be too small for you unless you claw grip.  I use a hybrid claw grip and this mouse is perfect for it.  It has a pretty versatile shape so you could easily use a palm grip as will if you have medium to small hands.My only complaint really is with the software, which I feel is a bit unpolished and cluttered, making it not intuitive to use.  Also. the scroll wheel is average at best, the tactile response is kind of mushy but that isn't really important to me.Overall, I was highly impressed with this mouse and recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable, do-it-all mouse.
