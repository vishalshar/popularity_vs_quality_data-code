Besides the Pixel this is the only other Android device that appeals to me because: It never lags, the skin is subtle and by installing a launcher you can get a very similar experience to a Nexus device.  The camera, display and performance far exceeds the Nexus 5x.  Closed Beta for Nougat (android 7) is already out so in a short while the it will have the latest AndroidOS. Additionally, the bootloader is unlockable and you won't void your warranty flashing ROMs on it as the Nextbit team supports hacking.  My battery life has been good usually getting all day life with moderate use. This is a great and surprisingly powerful android device that competes with many flagship models and blows away anything else in the mid-grade and budget tiers. Everything just works and works well. Actually it caused me to migrate from my iPhone
