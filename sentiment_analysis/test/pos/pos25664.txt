My husband is a firefighter and works 24 hour shifts at a time. Using the canary devices has definitely set his mind at ease that we're safe in the house when he's gone. The canary gives me peace of mind being home alone that no one has entered the house thanks to the text alerts. It's also been a huge help for us keeping an eye on our dog while we are away from the house.After purchasing the indoor canary for the front of our house, we decided to also purchase the Canary Flex for outdoor / the back of our house.The setup of the Flex was super simple, take it out of box and you're ready to go within 20 minutes ... even for the non technical user. The Flex is a sleek design and virtually undetectable. The mount is great and easy to use as well - you can really put it anywhere, cordlessly and easily. The video and audio on both canary devices is incredibly clear. For the flex, the night vision mode outdoors works wonders. We've been using it to check and see if there is any wildlife in the back yard before letting the dog outside at night. It's been a great tool keeping both the house and the pup safe.Overall, it's nice to have this added protection and peace of mind to keep an eye on the back of the house when we are home or away. I know my husband also feels better that he can still keep an eye on things when he's working a 24 and provide protection when/if there was an alert out of the ordinary.
