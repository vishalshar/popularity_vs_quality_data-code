This is my first 3D printer, if you done any amount of research on them I'm sure you have found like I have that it has one of the largest print area sizes for the price range. My first print was done on medium with the standard settings that come with MatterControl.  I was amazed at how well it printed.  It is still going strong right next to me at this moment.  There is always something you would like to print or try out.  I believe and have read elsewhere it's features are comparable to some units costing quite a bit more.  Look at the resolution it is capable of, size of the available area and see what you can find. Not only that, you are not limited to buying "cartridges" from a specific manufacturer which to me was the biggest selling point.  You can use any filament, just read up on what is involved and needed to do in order to do so. There are wood filaments, sleel like filaments, flexible filaments, glow-in -the-dark filaments and on and on ...  I would buy it again if I needed to.  I think you will probably love it as much as I do.  Doesn't look bad either .
