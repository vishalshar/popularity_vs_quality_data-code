Update: I contacted LittleBits Support and got a reply from them that same weekend. They immediately sent me two replacement boards which worked very well.  They also informed me that they will refresh their kits to include the new boards in a couple weeks. Since we got the new board, my kids have been playing with it almost daily. They really love this kit. They already asked me to get them more so they have more flexibility to create their own inventions. If you are having issues with your hoard, contact them to get the redesign board and you'd be much happier.My son kept asking me for Littlebits as he got to play with it a couple times at school. He was very excited when we received the Gizmos & Gadgets kit this evening. The product has great potential. However, the board that you mount the little pieces on was poorly designed. It took me a good 10 min to put the pieces on one board. I was not even able to get it mounted on the other board at all. It was very frustrating. I will contact Littlebits to request for a replacement item. I have read about this issue before but had thought they would have fixed it by now. My recommendation is that people should not buy ANY Littlebits kits until they fix the issue. Also, if you play with Legos you'd notice that the fit are full circles. With Littlebits, the feet are only half circles. This cause instability when mounting to the board.
