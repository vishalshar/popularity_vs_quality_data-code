I LOVE  this stuff !...I've always had baby-fine hair, but now that I'm a "woman of a certain age", it's thinning, too - and even w/ hair 'thickeners' / 'volumizers', my pink scalp was all too visible after blow-drying & styling - UGH ! ! !  Then my stylist recommended your professional version of Infinity Hair Fibers, sold under the "Eclipse" label, and I was sooooo pleasantly surprised at how wonderfully the product (in conjunction with the hair fibers locking spray-) matched my hair and camouflaged my scalp...my hair looks much thicker , and my pink scalp isn't even visible w/ your super product - THANK  YOU  ! ! !
