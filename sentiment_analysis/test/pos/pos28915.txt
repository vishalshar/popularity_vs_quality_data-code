I originally bought this phone for a backup because of the huge screen but quickly fell in love with it now it is my everyday phone here is the pros and consProsThe most amazing battery life I have seen on any phone you could use it 2 days straight the entire day and still have battery lifeThe screen size is huge not much more than a regular tablet so watching movies is greatFast processor, a lot of memory, and an average cameraConsThe phone is heavy and there is no real good case that they made for this phone only the generic one.If you are looking for a phone with a big screen, a lot of internal memory where you never have to worry about using an SD card or the phone jamming, and a battery that is probably the best one on the market. I use my phone probably 2 times more than the average user finding a phone with a battery like this is amazing and a word to the wise the phone takes an extremely long time to charge because of how big the battery is make sure you get the fastest charger available they make a 3.5 amp charger they sell on Amazon if not it will take you anywhere from 6 to 16 hours to charge the phone depending on what you're using here is a link to a charger I bought on Amazon that works amazing to go with the phone I would not use the average charger https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00JJ7AN70/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1
