This is my first bicycle in 15 years and I am so pleased I went with the Public. I wanted a bike that would get me outside riding and would take me from my house to the football stadium for all the games. The gears shift smoothly and the seat is comfortable for my average 30 minute rides around my neighborhood and to the stadium. At about 29 lbs, the bike is heavy enough that I feel stable while riding but not so heavy that I can't take it up the four steps at my front porch easily.On another note, the yellow is wonderful. I get compliments on it everytime I ride and the color gets a lot of love. Definitely recommend this bike!
