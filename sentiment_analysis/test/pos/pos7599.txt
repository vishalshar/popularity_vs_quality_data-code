We bought these for our two-year-old who is potty training. She still lets the bed at night occasionally but it is such a pain to completely strip her bed down. These are great we just layer waterproof pads with the sheet on top of it. The zipper is a plastic zipper that is well hidden underneath the flap, so no worries about your child lying on it are playing with the zipper. We got the light gray colorwhich is a nice neutral color and works well for our daughter and our son. The material is nice and soft and very durable. I have watch this many many times and so far it is holding up well. I have ordered two more of these to have back ups.
