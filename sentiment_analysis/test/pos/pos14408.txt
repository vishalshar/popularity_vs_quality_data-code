So handy and convenient.  I've bought so many of these... For me, friends, family, etc.I had to buy me another one because mine cracked.. I'm not reckless with it, so IDK what happened.  The new one seems okay.. although I do see a small crack in it by the USB end.I like that it now comes with a key ring.  I like to hang it with my keys, so that I always have this with me.Makes a great gift, but I definitely recommend getting one for yourself.
