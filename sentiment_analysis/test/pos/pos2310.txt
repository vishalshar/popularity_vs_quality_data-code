This product is excellent for lower back pain therapy, for what it has done for my spinal stenosis is remarkable!  The down side is the self contained carrying zipper failed after only five uses.  Please know that the failed zipper has no effect on the performance of the Better Back; only the inconvenience of carrying and storing the product.
