I bought one of these after we had work done at our home and I wanted to check for high VOC and dust levels.  It definitely works as designed and I haven't had any issues after a month with it.  I use it with IFTTT and our thermostat and an air purifier.  It works great.  Once the levels get high it kicks on the fans for a few minutes and the levels drop.  It's fun to see what impacts the various sensors over the course of a day or week.  It's very sensitive and you can even tell when people enter and exit a room just by the dust or co2 levels.  I think it's great so far.  It did give me some connection issues when I first set it up and then tried to move it to a new network but after that it hasn't been a problem.  It just works and I've noticed my allergies have descreased as I've taken steps to lower the dust levels.
