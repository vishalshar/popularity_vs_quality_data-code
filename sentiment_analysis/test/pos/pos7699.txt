We've been using this since kiddo number one was born.  Still our one and only crib sheet for our second two.  easy to make up the matress ( like a fitted sheet, but in the bottom and ZIP! on goes the top sheet.  The real beauty is when you can whip (zip) off a wet sheet and zip on a dry one at 3:00, even one-handed sometimes!We have a few bottom sheets that came with sets and a few more too sheets for quick changes. Always have one when we need it! Oh and the zippers have NEVER malfunctioned on us.  It's a great baby shower gift.  I recommend it to pretty much everyone who is in the market for "incoming-baby" stuff or creating a registry.****Oh and I don't know how some of the people who review things on Amazon get stuff for free or discounted for their  "unbiased reviews" but I've never been offered free stuff. (Am I jealous? A little.  ?) But seriously, nobody influenced this review... except maybe my 3am-sleep deprived-previous self...
