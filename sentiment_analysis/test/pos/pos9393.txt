First time user just got it today cant believe what I have been missing out on. The only downside is the price is high but is worth it due to shipping fees and the work that went into putting this together its a whole different level of experience. have it in a low intensity volume and my teeth shake to the bass on how intense it is. Have not tried gaming yet but I bet you its crazier than music all around I give it 5/5
