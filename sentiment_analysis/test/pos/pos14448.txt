Ok. The lid fits, color is red, the flip top closes & yes, one can drink with no leaks. Here's my problem. The flip top flips off. I do not possess super human strength, or even work out. I am a fairly sedentary grandmother who simply wanted a convenient travel lid for cold beverages in my canning jar. If I'm not paying attention & flip it up with even normal pressure the stopper flies off & I have to go hunt the flipper. Not helpful when driving & potentially disastrous when shaking. I much prefer the sipper lid with straw. If I need to shake something, I'll shake with the original canning lid & then use the sipper lid. I just couldn't give it 5 stars. Probably should have given it 3. I mean the flipper lid is a major function of the product but so is the overall seal of the entire lid. Hence, I opted to go with 4.
