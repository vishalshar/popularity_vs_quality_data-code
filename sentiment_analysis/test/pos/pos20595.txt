The first one I received had a door that didn't have a tight seal, could see inside oven from hinge when closed and didn't want radiation leakage so exchanged for a new one. I like this better than the smaller GE one I had - I don't think that one lasted 1-1/2 years, that was my second oven. I like all the features, the size of it the Bella. It looks nice as well. Hope it lasts a long time. My first microwave oven lasted 20 years (GE).
