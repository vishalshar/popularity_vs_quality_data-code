This is truly a French designed product - high quality, cozy, just lovely. We shop fairly exclusively with Le Petit Bateau and Jacadi. We have sleep sacks from both brands (purchased in Europe), and could not find anything like it in the US. Our 9 month old had outgrown both, and I stumbled across this on Amazon looking for a replacement. It arrived and I was in love. Our baby adores it also.The 9-24 month size is a little big for the 9month old (she is 18lbs), so we also ordered the smaller size for her.So far, it has help up well through washing and the quality seems fantastic. Bravo and thanks for bringing a bit of European coziness to US babies!
