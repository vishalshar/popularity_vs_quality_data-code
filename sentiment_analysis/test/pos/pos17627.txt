Other reviewers have mentioned the same problem. They look like well made filters and they fit my Phantom 4 nicely. The problem was that one of the filters in the set has fungus, or manufacturing mess, all over it and is unusable. I have contacted the company to request a replacement and hopefully they will respond soon as I needed them for a shoot this weekend and now will not have the full set to use. The polarization effect does not seem to be extremely strong, but only slightly noticeable. It should definitely help the image quality, however, and I like have the 3 levels of ND available. These screw on, replacing the factory UV filter. I also have the press-on ND filters from Polar Pro that are universal for the P3 & P4, but I do not like how tight they are when pressed on. It takes a lot of force to remove them and I'm concerned about damaging the gimbal in the process. These screw-on filters should be much better, if they replace the defective unit.update 11/9/2016I emailed Polar Pro about the defective filter and they were prompt to reply and send a replacement. So, although initial quality control may be hit or miss, they do stand by the product and now I have a complete set of nice filters. So, I've updated my review to 4 stars.
