This is one of the best designed items I have seen in a long time.  I am using it with a iPhone 5 with a case.  It is well thought out and easy to use.  It was very easy to install without the need for tools.  It is easily adjustable to fit many bikes and viewing angles.  Even with the case on I could put in a larger phone.  All areas where the holder contacts the phone are padded with rubber to both prevent slippage or damage to the case.  The phone can be both installed and removed from the holder in seconds.
