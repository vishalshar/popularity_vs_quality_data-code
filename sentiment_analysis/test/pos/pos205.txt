This is the best bluetooth speakers I've owned. I would dare to say it is louder than the bose, and the same quality output. No kidding!Take it to the beach, scratch it on the rocks, when you get annoyed of the abuse you gave it, order  new jacket and it's good as new!Try it.  Take it to target and compare it to the Bose. There is an software update that will increase the volume, and doesn't affect the quality of the music. Amazon will take it back if you're unhappy. I don't think you'll be returning it.BTW You can buy the cheaper Fugoo speaker. The inside is the same. The outside jackets are interchangeable.
