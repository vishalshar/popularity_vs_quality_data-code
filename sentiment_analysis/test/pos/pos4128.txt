Bought it Thursday night, received it Saturday, put it in my heater closet where the nasty critters have found their way into my house, and got up this morning to find my first dispatched rat.  The battery cover is very easy to remove.I live on a green belt and get coyotes, fox, raccoons, wild turkeys, all manner of burrowing pests, and birds of prey.  I have several small dogs that keep most of the vermin out of my yard, and I don't use poison.  I have had several rat zappers that don't last very long, and I had a lot of blinking lights without a kill, and the battery cover on the Rat Zapper is nearly impossible to remove without a screw driver.  The size of the Raticator is nice and streamlined, but big enough for large rats to enter.  I hope the Raticator holds up.
