I have been complimented on my beautiful watch dozens of times!! I purchased the white Steel version. People are SHOCKED when I tell them it's a fitness tracker.But that was my main concern. I find fitness trackers a little obnoxious... And incredibly ugly and obvious. I wanted a beautiful design that I could put on and leave on, which I do! Since wearing my tracker I hit 10,000 steps 6 days a week.I would recommend this watch to everyone except maybe the extreme marathoner/health nut.I do wish the Withings App was all encompassing, like the Fitbit or Jawbone. Withings sincs up to Health Mate and other food trackers, but isn't easy/intuitive enough for me to care to use it. I can't be bothered to sign into three different apps to log my life.If that's important, do some testing first. I forwent the better apps (Fitbit, Jawbone) for a product I was willing to wear 100% of the time.Also a trick for other treadmill-ers, relevant for all trackers, I put my watch on my ankle to accurately track my treadmill sessions. If I don't, the trackers do not track well because my wrists are usually stationary (holding onto the treadmill).
