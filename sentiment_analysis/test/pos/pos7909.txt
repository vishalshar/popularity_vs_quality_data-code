Awesome scale. Reliable and accurate. I trust the weight tracking and pulse wave velocity. The body composition as everyone knows is for giggles as the only way to accurately measure that is with DEXA. The PWV is the main reason I purchased this. Its crazy what they have achieved. Normally the equipment that does this costs around 10K and takes 20min to get a value. If you are scientific in the way you track your body then this is a great tool
