I love this bag!  With the built in battery and ports for charging, the software that allows for auto lock when walking away or being separated, the GPS and the built in scale...this bag rocks.I travel 75% and i have been able to pack a weeks worth of clothing and gear in this very strong bag.  The wheels and the adjustable handle height make it ease for a carry on! and it fits the overhead every time.....and when the airlines says no more room., please check your bag...it is secure and safe.Great product and now have many of my guys at the office looking at this as a clothing/computer bag (has built in laptop compartment) as the bomb!  Love this bag!
