From the moment you unzip the Royole X's plush carry case, it's clear that this thing is designed around delivering a premium user experience. Expect the process of dialing in the fit and connectivity to your local network or device (in my case, an iPhone) to take a few minutes, as navigating the various menus through a click-wheel interface on the right earcup is a little clumsy, a'la iPod from 2009. Once you're set up and you've made it through the super cheesy pre-loaded videos, the actual viewing and listening experience is very cool. The audio quality is excellent, the earcups are plush, and the display is ridiculously crisp  just make sure to adjust each eye's focus on the underside of the unit, otherwise if you have a slight stigmatism like me, you'll start things off with a headache.Pretty stoked to take this on a long flight, as the overall comfort of the head unit (despite its surprisingly heavy weight) and the noise-canceling capabilities are perfect for carving out that coveted private theater space for a Star Wars marathon, while the rest of the plane is stuck watching Seinfeld reruns.+ Truly premium experience+ Impressive build quality+ Great audio quality+ Very crisp visual display+ Familiar click-wheel navigation Heavy head unit Confusing to set up/calibrate
