I got this for my wife and I because we didn't want to shovel out a lot of money for the FitBit. The box it came in as a display was very good looking, and from the moment I opened it up I knew that we got a quality product. The watch syncs up with my phone, and was very simple to do. At first I struggled getting the heart rate monitor to pick up my HR, but after a few tries it seemed to work well and haven't had an issue since. The alarm works and over all I would recommend this to anyone as a good alternative to the expensive competition. It is really slick too and not bulky. I definitely feel like this will genuinely help me with my fitness goals.
