Just "knowing" I'm wearing it makes me more aware of my breath which in turn makes me more relaxed. I just received three days ago and my average breaths per minute has already gone down from 17.9 to 14.7. I emailed their customer service "Neema" who I think she said was one of the developers, and she responded to me right away on a Sunday. I've adjusted all of my notifications so if I go longer than 4 minutes of tense breathing, it's going to alert me. I love this thing and kudos to whomever developed it. No glitches whatsoever.
