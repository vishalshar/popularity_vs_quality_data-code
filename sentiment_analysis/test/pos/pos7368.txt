I was curious about this product and decided to buy one to review for the website I write for MyMac. To be honest as an Machead I really wasn't expecting too much and was pleasantly surprised by how well this little inexpensive PC works. There are things that I hope will get better. The File Manager is a single window at a time PITA, but considering iOS has nothing even remotely like it, I'll give it a pass. You can also use (at an extra cost) actual working versions of MS Office or to keep costs down download one of the many mobile versions of an office suite. Multi-tasking works well as does multiple windows open at the same time. Configuration can be a little tricky since you have both Google's settings and the Remix settings to deal with, but once you've done it, you shouldn't have to bother with them again.Remember that you'll need a monitor with an HDMI input (not real expensive to find these days), and either a bluetooth or USB keyboard and moused. You could probably get all three for under $100. Also not a bad idea to pick up a 32-64GB mini SD card since this only has 126GB of storage though you can also use standard USB2 connected drives too.
