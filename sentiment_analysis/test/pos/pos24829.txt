He's 11 years old now, and three years ago lost the use of his two left legs.  $6,000 later they still didn't know what was the cause other than "maybe" his immune system was attacking itself.  They've had him on a steroid now (taken every other day), and I really worry about how that can damage his organs.  So far he seems to be doing really well according to yearly blood tests, and I credit this supplement (along with "immune" by the same brand) and some really healthy food (Wysong) as giving him a second chance and helping him to have a healthy life.  He's a great dog, and I plan on keeping him as healthy as I can.  Even though this is expensive it seems to last a long time--maybe two months, and it's worth it to me.
