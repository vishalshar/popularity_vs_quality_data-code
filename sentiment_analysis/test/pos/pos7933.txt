I love my Bellabeat!! It is gorgeous, and I have received multiple compliments on it as a piece of jewelry, however there are a few tweaks I would make in how it works.  For example it does not accurately register steps taken, I can run around my house for 3 hours cleaning and only register 38 steps!! However if I go for a walk or wear it during work (busy dental practice) it works beautifully. Also, I'd like to see the design slimmed down a bit, it has a fairly high profile to wear as a bracelet. The worst aspect is leather bracelet has worn very fast and is almost broken.Over all it's a purchase I'm happy with, but looking forward future improvements.
