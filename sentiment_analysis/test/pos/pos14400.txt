I never even thought about innovating on a suitcase but this is a really cool product!  It's definitely the best looking and well designed suitcase I've even owned.  I feel like a total boss at the airport!  I know that some people say it's a little small, but I've not found that to be an issue and I've had smaller suitcases in the past.  It's a great business suitcase that is small enough so you don't have to check it in.My favorite feature is the battery charger!  I've had airport delays where I've needed to charge my phone and I often used to forget my phone charger when traveling so now I just leave a wire charger in the suitcase so I know I've always got juice for my phone!  The battery is super-charged too - I think the website claims it can hold 6x phone charges or something crazy like that.  I haven't needed to do it 6 times in a row, but that's pretty neat.The digital scales and the auto lock feature from the phone are pretty nice features.  It's unlikely I'll lose this beauty so I haven't needed the location tracker, but it's a great feature in case somebody "permanently borrows" it!  The analytics are interesting, and I guess they can easily update and add to this as it's being driven by the app on your phone.Overall, I'd recommend this product.  It's stylish, the features are handy and I love that they're innovating on a suitcase!  Seriously, a suitcase!!  Who would have thought!?  This is the future!
