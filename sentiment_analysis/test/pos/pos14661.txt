A couple friends recommended these to me and I would have to agree these are a must-have! The zip off sheet makes changing a breeze after an accident, a leak or spit up! Would definitely recommend these to any new parent if they are looking for worthwhile crib bedding! Also, would make a great baby shower gift! The pack of three is nice, so that you have spare sheets to zip on when one gets soiled.
