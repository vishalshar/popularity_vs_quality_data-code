This  phone holder is the perfect solution in my Mini Cooper! It sits just right in the CD slot between the heat/AC buttons and the stereo. Nothing is obstructed  and the iPod cord the Mini dealer provides you with is exactly the right length to use your iPhone/iPod vertically with a little bit of leeway so you can tilt the phone to your liking. Unfortunately, if you like use the gps app or whatever in landscape mode then the cord is too short. I might check the dealership to see if they make a longer one.  I've had this mount for a few weeks now and have NO complaints so far. No rattling noises or shaking at all. If things change after long term use then I will update but so far I am very pleased with my purchase
