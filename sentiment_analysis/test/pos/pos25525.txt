The first order I made did nothing, absolutely nothing so I gave them a 1 star review.  The company sent me a replacement which did work (see their response below).  After they did that and after the mushrooms started, I changed my review to 4 stars.  Had the initial batch worked, they would have got 5 stars.  I will be harvesting my mushrooms tomorrow.
