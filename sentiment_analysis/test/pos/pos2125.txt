Eyes aren't as good as they once were.  Counting off ticks on a tape measure is a pain.  Recounting for accurate measure made for frustration! Enter this neat little gadget.  Frustration free for the simple do it yourselfer or a honey-do list (the life or death task of hanging that curtain rod just right).Pros:For my wood shop projects it has been a joy.  Good accuracy, fast, and consistent.  No more turning that musical jewelry box into a singing ashtray for mom on Mother's Day.  Large enough display to read easy - will display total inches, feet and inches, or metric. Auto-adjust button for front or back (tape case) measurement.Cons:Just the typical "it ain't exactly the way I want it".  Display on the side would've been nice. Kind of a pain lining things up on the side and have to lean over the top to read. No tears, there.  Wouldn't mind a better tape "stop and hold" button in the tape.  Little buttons on top vs. big fingers - not a show stopper.In the hands of a trained craftsman this would be excellent!  Bought a second one for the wife. She just hands it to me on Saturdays and puts me and it too work.  That one won't leave the house.  My plan backfired.
