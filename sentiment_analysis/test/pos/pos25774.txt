The Dash is a great set of headphones, but you have to understand how they work to truly appreciate them.  What I like about the Dash is that they sit fully inside the ear.  They don't protrude out.  This makes them very sleek looking and inconspicuous to others.However, many people complain about the bad connection with them.  Because they do not stick out of the ears, the signal doesn't work "as well" as with other bluetooth headsets.  To be able to carry your phone or device anywhere on your body, the Dash would have to have the bluetooth radio chip stick way out of your ear to provide the best connection.When I run with them, I use an armband, as I always have, and wear it with my phone.  I don't have any issues with connections that way.  If I use them at home (on a treadmill or simply sitting and watching movies or listening to music) I have no issues at all either.  If I get too far away from the phone, they can begin to cut out, just like any other bluetooth headset.I love them for the size, as they are perfect to throw in my pocket when I want to go somewhere.  I usually keep the earbuds on me, and throw the charging case in my bag.  The earbuds go into a power saving mode after a few minutes of not being in your ears.  This way I don't have the large charging case shoved in my pocket.The sound quality is quite good IMO for bluetooth, and the latest software update really helped with the volume.  I also like the transparency mode.  When I am outside, I can turn transparency on to be able to hear things around me, especially when running outside.  Inside (on a treadmill) I turn transparency off so I don't have to hear the treadmill operating.Long story short - the Bragi Dash is a great set of wireless earbuds,  There is a trade-off of the style vs substance in regards to the connection aspect, but if you understand that, and can adjust, they are definitely worth it.
