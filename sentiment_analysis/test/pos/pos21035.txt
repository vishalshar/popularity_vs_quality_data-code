This has been the best purchase I have made since I found the Kingston-microSDHC-Memory-Reader-FCR-MRG2.  I am giving this a Five star only because I was able to work around it's few flaws and because I simply love it.  There is none like this out there.  compared to the competition which come with 32, 64, 128mb internally, with this puppy I can swap out with all my microSD cards I already use.  I simply love the backup feature on this thing, especially because it verifys that the data is already there and it doesn't create multiple copies.  So you don't end up with duplicate photos, Love it!  When I first received it I plugged it in and away it went.  right away it took me to the apps I needed to download.  Downloaded them all which were (3) three.  just to see what each one did.  After installing the apps I opened the first one and it ran smooth, copied a few photos and then removed the micro sd card to view them on the computer.  Sweet!  all there.  It was fast and easy.  Once I found the Backup Sync feature it made this item Golden!  I am recommending this item to all my friends.Another cool feature is that it can play your videos straight from the card.  I put a movie on one of my microSD cards and watched it with no lag.  I was even able to stream it to my tv from my phone and it was just awesome.I later swapped it with a microSD card that has my music and was playing songs from it.  just love how easy and smooth it plays my media.Now for the cons.Cons:  The day after I received the item I tried plugging in the device and I kept getting a "Device Not Connected"  I unplugged / replugged and it just woudln't connect.  After a few attempts it finally read the device.  Not sure what's up with that.  Will update later if it continues to be a problem.-When viewing photos in smart view it crashes the app.  just completely kicked me out.  I tried deleting the photos where I thought were the problem but didn't seem to do anything.  Not sure what the issue is with that. so i cannot view the picture pasts a certain point. but it only happens in Smart view.-When trying to copy a few videos, the app would just freeze.  I went throught the photo's selected a folder in my Camara roll then selected a few pictures and videos.  The process starts and at a point it just freezes.  It completely freezes the app and you just have to kill the app and restart.  I notice this more on Videos.  I eventually did one by one just to see which video was having issues.  but just not very convenient and not sure why it would get stuck on the a single particular video.  They were all recorded the same so it didn't make sense.-the small prong that connects to the phone seems a little flimsy.  It wiggles a bit more than I would like it and feel that if I am not careful it might break.  I thinking if this is why I get the "device not connected" error message. but we will see.-the main thing that I don't like about this is that when it copies the photo over it sets the modified date to today and not the original created date.  If the vendor could change that it would make me very happy. (;So aside from those glitches.  I've been able to work with it and now I have seperate microSD cards for my family.  they each have their own and they backup their photos with ease.Love this product, and cannot rave about it enough.
