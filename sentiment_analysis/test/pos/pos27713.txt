I have been a Rokform fan for some time now and have used these mounts regularly on both my mountain bicycle and motorcycle.  When I upgraded my iPhone to the 6S, I bought the clear version of this case (which has one less part and seemed more sturdy overall) and simply love it even compared to the previous Rokform cases I've owed (which were much bulkier).  If you are looking for a case that can handle both offroad biking and motorcycling with ease, this is the case for you (combined with the appropriate mounts that are sold separately, of course).
