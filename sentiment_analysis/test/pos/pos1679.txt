I just recently learned about xylitol and like it because it has a low glycemic index as well as fewer calories than sugar. I am on a low-calorie diet and am trying to eat as healthy as possible, so this product works well for me. I use it in my coffee and have not noticed any weird aftertaste that other low-calorie sweeteners have.
