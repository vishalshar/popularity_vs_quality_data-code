I've been using these almost every day for lunch. Now, maybe I'm just a young spry 25 year old, but they are not as difficult to open as some make them out to be. Not as easy as a bag of chips, and I don't doubt that someone under the age of seven would have some issue, but I think that's more about technique than strength.They are not clear, but opaque, which doesn't matter to me but might to some. However, they are leakproof (moreso than my lock-and-locks), which is exactly what I wanted.As other reviewers have stated, they do not dry easily. I tend to wash a bunch of dishes at once, so my solution was to put them overtop of a cooking spoon so that they are forced to remain open. They dry perfectly fine for me that way (I do not have a dish washer, so no comments on that).Overall, I would buy again. I've had them for a bit now and I don't think they'll wear out, but I'll update if I see any glaring flaws.
