These are very nice socks. I honestly think the material is better than the gold toe socks that I purchased at the same time. Given that $20 for 3 pairs of them, I would rate 5 stars. Here's a little suggestion, buy size large if your shoe size is larger than 9. As I wear size 9 shoes, I found that size large fits me very well. If I bought size medium maybe I need to stretch them a bit more, hence the feeling isn't as good as wearing size large.
