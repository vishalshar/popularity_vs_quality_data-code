I use this mostly with Reason, and while the default Reason preset is okay, I'm digging in with making my own along with a custom Remote template. Responding to X/Y on the pads, you can use them like virtual knobs if you want, changing parameter values on synths, etc. I'm so sorry I waited so long to finally buy this. As a musician with limited space and that likes to be mobile, this is an excellent solution.The cable it ships with is garbage, if I barely bump it from beneath the Quneo resets. Thankfully I have many micro USB cables around. I did kinda like the KMI-branded cable. Oh well.
