Case is pretty rugged. Easy to get use to taking case on and off to mount different back plates. I use it on my daily commuting bike and when I am at my desk at work, I switch the back plate out so there isn't any back opening and everything is smooth and flush. Buttons are very hard to press and is not tactile. Volume up button is tricky. If you don't press the very top edge of the volume button it will decrease the volume. Seems like the up down volume button is not centered correctly. Overall case is a must for those who want to mount the phone to their bike securely. I have had other gen iPhones and I have used the bike mount since the iPhone 4 and it still works flawlessly. With this iPhone 6 plus case.
