bought these for my 3 kids but I end up eating them as well.  One of my little ones will only eat apples with the skin peeled - which is a pain for me - so these are a quick and easy alternative.  Plus its great when apples aren't in season (and I only buy organic).  great to have on hand, pack in lunches, take with for car snacks, etc.  highly recommend!
