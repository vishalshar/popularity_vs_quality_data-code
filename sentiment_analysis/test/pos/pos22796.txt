This just arrived yesterday. It smells off putting to humans and very strong. Not that cat food should smell as appetizing as waffles or something, but this was one of the worst dry cat foods I have smelled. HOWEVER, it is about what the cat thinks. I threw this in his food storage box and instantly he was over there like white on rice even though I had already put down his wet food dinner. He smelled the inside of the box and started yelling at me. I said "OK, you can try some." I threw a few kibbles down on his plate and he vacuumed them down and started screaming for more. I told him to forget it because he is on a diet (He is 16lbs and the vet said he should be 14.5 or so - he is a big boy in general), but tomorrow he could have more. So this morning I gave him both his wet food and the Solid Gold mixed with a little bit of his old food and he sucked it down again without complaint. He apparently likes this much better than the Premium Edge. Time will tell if this food helps to slim him down. I'll update in a few months.*Update* - One month later, our cat is losing weight with the help of this food and portion control. Yay!
