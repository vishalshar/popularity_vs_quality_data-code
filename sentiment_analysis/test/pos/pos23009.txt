It does really fit onto and release well from my presta valve stems so far.  Not sure that it is easily a one hand job but maybe with more practice or breaking in!?  Changes easily as described between presta and schrader, though I have not needed to actually inflate schrader tubes.  The pull ring often won't drop down on its own, but  the head still seems to hold tight while inflating.  It was easy to change out from my current pump head and didn't even require cutting the tube
