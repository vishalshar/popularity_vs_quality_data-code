Unique!  Gives info as advertised, a little quirky to get started and find some info.  I have not figured out how to print results.  Would be nice if it doubled as a distance-to-green device, I understand that they might add this to future models.  Does record scores, ave scores, Driving distance, fairways hit, % left or right ,long drive.  Gives ave distance of all clubs, and accuracy on approach shots - percent within 15 yards of center of green, percent long, short, left or rt.  Gives % GIRs and scramble up and downs.  Only putting info is ave putts/green both for individual rounds and overall ave.  Some room for improvement, suspect future models will be better, but I could not resist, I am not disappointed !
