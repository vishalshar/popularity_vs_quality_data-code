Works perfectly! You just have to remember to tag your shots which isn't as easy to remember as I thought it would be. Its fine as long as you upload one round at a time as you can add an adjust your shots at that time (before you forget) including the placements of the pins. I am hoping they enhance the analytics on the website so I can get more stats than currently available....like shots gained and lost.
