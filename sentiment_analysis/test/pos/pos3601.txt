I bought this game after seeing Joe Santagato's videos of him playing it with his siblings.  It's a riot!  I pre-ordered it and paid $19.99. I have friends that would like to purchase the game for themselves but the price has jumped to a ridiculous $98!  What gives???  You can buy just the mouth pieces and make up your own silly phrases for MUCH cheaper than that!  It's a fun game, but not $98 fun!
