I bought a few different brands of socks along with these, and I have to say that these are by far the most comfortable of the socks that I purchased! I actively notice on several occasions throughout the day how soft they feel, and haven't had any quality issues. I will say that the thick box they come in is a bit excessive/wasteful, particularly for only 3 pairs of socks.
