I have been suffering from a sway-back posture for many years. I invested a lot of research in finding the proper exercises to improve my posture, spent a lot of money on all kinds of therapies (Pilates, physical therapy, dance classes and many more), with very little improvement. After using the Upright device for as little as 3 days, I saw a significant improvement, which was also noticeable by others. I have been using the device for over two months now, and I continue getting stronger and straighter. Although the training is performed in a sitting position, the results are seen in both sitting and standing.This is truly magical!
