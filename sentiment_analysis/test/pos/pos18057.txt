When I ordered this drinking horn as a complete and udder impulse buy, I was skeptic about what I was getting myself into. Two days later, I received it and placed it where all could see, however I did not have an event to use this fine drinking vessel. As a college student who is 21 (don't drink under the age of 21, kids), I took it to a college party and finally drank from the horn for the first time. That was when disaster struck.I wound up going full viking as I filled my horn with beer; my beard grew in full in 1.2 seconds and I went from a 5' 6'' scrawny man to a 7 foot bear man. I manly yelled at the top of my lungs and took the closest person to me in a headlock and beat the other party guests senseless with that poor person. As I realized what I had done, I took the liberty of pulling the house off the foundation and threw it onto the beach where I performed a viking funeral for all of the people I once called friends. I have no friends now. I am a lone viking.It was a good Saturday night.
