I've been using this smart lock for one week now. And the auto-unlock feature works great. Every day I come home with my hands taking my bike and packages, and sometimes letters in my mouth. It's super hard for me to put everything on the ground, get the keys from the backpack, open the door, pick everything up, and get in. The auto-unlock kicks in at the perfect timing (when I just arrive in front the door) so far. And it works stably. The set up process is also very intuitive. I love this product.
