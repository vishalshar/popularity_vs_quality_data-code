I love the stylus and how it works with my iPad and the Application Paper53, however, and this is what bothers me a bit but I still love the stylus don't get me wrong: "The Tips", oh man, they should be more wear resistant (any improvement here would be very welcome), - this is why I'm giving it four stars (actually it's more like 4.5).I have a screen protector on my iPad and when the stylus was new the rubber tip was great but then after just two weeks it started sagging and jumping lines, I ordered replacement tips because I figured they would come in handy and boy o boy, they not only are handy but since I am a heavy user it turns out the first replacement lasted only about 9 days before it started sagging like the one the stylus came with, which if you can manage it's not a deal breaker but I would love it if they lasted longer. I know that in a consumer economy buying replacement parts are necessary (like ink and batteries, etc,) but again, I would love some heavy duty tips, I would buy those even if they were more expensive than the 8 bucks you pay for the replacement pair of tips Paper sells for this stylus that it indeed magical, exciting to use and awesome but it would be "super awesome" if the tips withstood my style of sketching.
