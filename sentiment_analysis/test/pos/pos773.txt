Like a number of purchasers, I ordered this and found that there were shipping delays in getting it.  Once it arrived, however, I've been extremely happy with the uKeg 64.  It's a very nice-looking growler.  The brass and steel give it a very high-end look.I often use it to try out a batch of home brew before the bottled version is ready.  This means filling the uKeg from the fermenter or bottling bucket, inserting a CO2 (seltzer style) cartridge into the well underneath the cap on top, screwing the cap onto the uKeg, and turning the dial up to 15 psi.For a totally flat beer, like a fresh home brew, you may need to expend an entire cartridge just to force carbonate the beer.  When the cartridge gives out, turn the dial on the lid to zero, remove the lid, remove the spent cartridge, pop in a fresh one, screw the lid back in, and dial the CO2 pressure back to the level you want.  Now you can dispense the keg of carbonated beer easily.  Supposedly, the manufacturers will offer an option to add a larger CO2 cartridge in the future for force carbonation in the uKeg, but they've not specified a release date for that yet.The double-wall construction also means that the uKeg will keep the beer cold for quite a while, especially if the growler goes into your fridge for a few hours with the beer in it.All things considered, I'm very happy with the uKeg.  It seems like a great product and has served me well so far, rescuing a batch of homebrew that I couldn't seem to carbonate naturally.Update September 12, 2016:. I had an issue with the growler where the goose neck part holding the tap came off. I contacted the manufacturer and they shipped a replacement part and tools. I had it a couple of days later and replaced the broken part fairly easily. The repair part was free, and the vendor's support response was great.
