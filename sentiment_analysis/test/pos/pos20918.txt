Not sure what the negative reviewers were expecting, but this thing is awesome. I'm just learning and realizing how hard playing guitar really is! This makes it easy to practice. The apps are simple and the instruction on Jam Tutor is nifty. My kids are starting to learn also but the neck is a bit too wide for their hands. Highly recommend for newbies like myself. I know plenty of guitarists but I haven't showed it off yet so I'm not sure what their thoughts are.
