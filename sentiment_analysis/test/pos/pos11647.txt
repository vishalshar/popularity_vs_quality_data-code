This stuff is amazing. It's silicone little pads of joy that you mold onto ANYTHING to make whatever you're using better. To wit; I used it to mend a broken plastic laundry basket handle. I used it to strengthen and repair the worn-through insulation sheath at the plug end of an iPod charger cable. I put wads of it on sharp edges of things I don't want to bang into. I stick two items together with it, using it like glue. I love that it comes in tiny packets of just the right amount of the stuff - about the size of a wad of bubble gum. This amount will get you farther than you think! It's sturdy once cured. Once you start to use it and familiarize yourself with it's functional properties, a million more uses will pop into your head. Really great product!
