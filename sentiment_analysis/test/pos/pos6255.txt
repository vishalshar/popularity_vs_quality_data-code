My honest opinion: immense potential, futuristic idea, but not ready for production just yet.The good:- The hardware that is required for controlling is already there. Software updates are coming in and the device upgrades itself constantly. The further down the line from this review (October 2015) you buy this, the better the software will be.- Setup is easy, just plug in.- Adding devices is easy, add devices using the smart phone app.- "Activities" are awesome. You define an activity by adding whatever devices you need to turn on with a single click. For example watch Netflix - you add TV and Roku to an activity.- My 5.5 year old learned quickly how to use it and could put on her favorite movies by herself.The bad:- Too sensitive to finger movement. I wish there was a sensitivity control in the app.- Sometimes would misread a movement as a repeat press of the same button, and the menu would jump all the way up, or the volume would go all the way down (thankfully it didn't happen with volume up). It isn't physically possible for a person to make the the pinch gesture 10-15 times in two seconds.- If you enjoy having your food while watching TV, or let your kids have meals in front of it, it will keep muting, thinking you are attempting to do the Shhh gesture.- Young children. My kids are 4 and 5.5, and they move a lot. It drives the Singlecue crazy, and them too because their movement triggers actions that either stop their movies or mute the tv.- I found the menus on the device (not the app) a little repetitive and confusing.- For some reason it has some trouble "waking" Roku up (we have Roku 2 XS). Once it is awake, the controlling of it is ok.Features I'd love to see in the future:- Sensitivity control in the app.- Setup process for minimal height for controlling the Singlecue (you could try to figure it out by yourself by trial and error, but it could be helpful to have a setup process to make it fast and easy). This way you could potentially eliminate wrongful reaction to kids movements, or for people who would rather control it by standing up or rising their hand higher up.- A simple on/off feature without unplugging. If for example you have guests over and you don't want the Singlecue over reacting to all the people around it.Bottom line, I expect great things from this lovely appliance.
