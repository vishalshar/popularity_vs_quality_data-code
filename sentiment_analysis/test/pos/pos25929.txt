I love these things. I now have them for 2 ipads and my iPhone and they work perfect in the car and around the house. Everyone that sees the setup in the car wants them. I know the point is to be small and light but I still get nervous having the entire back of the ipad exposed but I found I can use the apple case over these if needed for protection although the magnets done work.
