Installation is pretty straightforward, though I would recommend that if you are going to hook this up to Alexa (to control the lights by voice command), you should complete the sync to Alexa online as opposed to the Alexa app [app was super cludgy!].The fact that these lights will change hues is very nifty, and I like that it will auto shut off based upon movement detection. That being said, this particular package of lights are best used if they're not placed in a lamp / covered in a shade - I noticed the sensors need to have a 'clear path' to be able to detect you.
