Rokform cases are the BEST! My last Rokform case was a random purchase in the Target clearance section and it turned out to be an awesome purchase. I love the the sticky magnet that I put on my car's dash. It makes hands free driving so much easier, without having to use a big bulky phone holder. I love the Crystal Series case even more than the previous Rokform case I had. It's very sleek, clean and more importantly it's sturdy and protects my phone.
