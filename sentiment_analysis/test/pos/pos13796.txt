This was a huge hit with my niece as a Christmas present. It's extremely easy to use, runs fairly long on a single charge and comes with a descent number of sticks to start with. Also, the instructions have great tips and templates to help you learn how to build complex things with the pen. If there is any downside, it's just that you can quickly go through sticks when filling panels of shapes to make them solid.
