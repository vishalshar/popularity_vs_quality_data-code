This is a quality product from a company with superior customer support. For the price you cannot beat the build and materials of this mount. I was very impressed with it's quality compared to the one my girlfriend has from Verizon (we are never buying the Verizon one again, its useless).You notice I mentioned superior customer support. Right out of the box I did have an issue. My 08 VW Rabbit has a very very thin CD slot. The blades would not fit into my deck. I emailed Mountek and got a reponse from a person in <5min. 4 emails and 20 minutes later they had agreed to send me thinner replacement blades to swap out. It is now 4 days later and the new blades have arrived and the mount works perfectly. This is why they got 5 stars even with the compatibility issue.Why should you buy this mount instead of the standard windshield mount?1. You can reach the phone. Windshield mounts require you to scooch up in your seat or remove phone to reach.2. It doesnt obstruct your view through windshield3. Who uses their CD players anymore anyways. Chances are if you have a smartphone to put in this mount, then you no longer need your CD player. Might as well fill the slot in your dash with something usefull.4. Good quality. Its made of durable, flexible, heavy plasic. Not that cheap brittle shiny stuff.5. Amazing customer service... I could keep going
