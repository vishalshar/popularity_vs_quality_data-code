Bought two.  One arrived with a gasket, one did not.  After reading reviews, discovered too much hassle to ask for replacement.  Bought gaskets at hardware store and now have gaskets for jar pour cap and white plastic lids.  Really love these, but gave only four stars because the packaging allows for gaskets to slide out and then not arrive at destination.
