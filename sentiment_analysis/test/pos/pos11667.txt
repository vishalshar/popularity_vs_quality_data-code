I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! I'm planning on getting myself one soon.I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and told them I was looking for, basically, an adult sippy cup. Something that kept stuff hot for a long time without actually getting g hot itself, and that wouldn't spill or leak as he fidgets a lot and tend to knock stuff over. The associate showed me the video for this and I couldn't believe something so perfect existed haha. He informed me they no longer carried it and I went on Amazon immediately.He's been using it 5 days a week for a month now and it still won't tip over or leak, and it keeps his coffee hot for hours. We really dig it, and it's one of the coolest practical things I've ever seen.
