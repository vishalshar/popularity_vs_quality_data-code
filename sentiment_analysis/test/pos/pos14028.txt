I've been using the Narrative Clip for a few days now and I love it. I did a lot of research and looked at a lot of sample photos before buying and I'm very happy with this product. I feel a lot of the reviews are harsh. People need to remember that this is the first version of this product and it will only get better with time. I feel it's pointless to have the Clip on all the time while at work or when doing mundane tasks, instead I clip it on when I go out and about. I've gotten some great shots while bike riding or just walking around a mall. It's true that indoor photos are grainy, however I typically turn them to b&w with instagram and increase the sharpness and it gives the photos a very nostalgic look. Being an avid photographer, people would often get irradiated with me always pulling out my iPhone to snap shots or lugging around an SLR so this has corrected the issue.I find that clipping the Narrative to my sleeve is actually better then in the middle of a shirt/jacked like recommended and I get more straight on images. I decided to go the rout of not using the software and uploading to the servers, instead I just dump the images to a temp folder on my desktop and weed out the ones with potential. I'll then sync to my iPhone where I can add filters and upload to instagram. This might be tedious for some, but I can take a few minutes and post/tag a batch to upload when I have time. I've even clipped this to my dogs collar and have gotten some very cool shots. I welcome the odd distorted images that some times occur when a lot of movement is happening. My biggest worry was actually people asking me what the device is. When it's on my sleeve, people don't even notice it and if/when asked I just say it's a pedometer so I don't have to answer a bunch questions or get weird looks.Some things I would like to see is the ability to adjust how often the images are taken. Would be nice for 5, 10 or 20 sec intervals that can be set with the software. The double tap feature for taking forced photos is very finicky and rarely works for me, but then again, that's not what this was designed for. Check out my instagram for samples: IdeaAttic
