I've been reading a lot of bad reviews of the LEAF on multiple sites and I don't know why. I got mine about a week ago and so far have no complaints. I love that it tracks my sleep and the breathing exercises are amazing. I have pretty bad anxiety and it has really helped me to just focus on my breathing a couple times a day. There are pros and cons to it but in my opinion the pros far outweigh the cons when it comes to the LEAF.
