These are awesome.  I have fine, shoulder length thick hair.  I was recommended these by my hairdresser.  So easy to use,and what I love is you don't have to put them in perfectly.I use this on a regular basis.  When they arrived one of the brushes tops (where you connected the handle to)was broken.  I can push it on and use it in my hair, but it will full of again.  The other five brushes came inperfect condition and have have not had any issues with them.Overall, they work so well in my hair.  I am really happy with them!!!
