We ordered this grill light after seeing it at a friend's house. We live in the northeast and grill year round. It gets dark early in the winter. We knew it was what we needed for our grill, as our outdoor light does a poor job of illuminating our grill area. It arrived quickly. Great quality and super bright! I recommend!!
