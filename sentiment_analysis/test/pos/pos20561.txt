Its clear that this escape tool was very well thought out and designed. Like most other reviewers I havent (and hopefully wont) had an opportunity to use it, but it seems made of quality materials and Im convinced it would perform as intended. What absolutely sells me on the SuperVizor above all the competing items is its visor holster -- this keeps it right where you need it, should you ever. I know the odds are I will never need it, but its nice to know its there!
