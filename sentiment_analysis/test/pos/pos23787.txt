This is not what I expected. Reading some of the older reviews here, I expected a dumb remote that will be just a nice gimmick to impress my friends. I guess that with the latest updates, they turned this 180 degrees.What I got was the closest thing I can get to home automation powered by my phone. It's true, the AnyMote Home itself (the hardware) is pretty dumb, and I'm going to rate it 5 stars because it works perfectly. However, this review is also for their software, also 5-star worth, which contains the true power of this product. To give you an idea of what it can do, here's the whole setup I've done for myself over a Sunday on my Android. Keep in mind that the amount of customizations you can do in this app is absolutely ridiculous.- I've created macros (they should have named them "activities") that turn on my TV, xbox and speakers- I've created macros that switch to specific channels AND turn off / on components as needed- I've put all those macros on a notification, which disappears when I leave home (disconnect from wifi) and is available on my lockscreen- I've combined my hue lights with my tv, xbox & speakers remote- I've configured finger gestures so that I can use all this without looking at the phone, just like with plastic remotes- initially I've even configured it to execute IFTTT tasks, but that's no longer needed since my plugs (wemo) are now integrated in AnyMote- I've created tasks to turn on my lights at sunset (ok, I'm cheating - the app created these for me).. and moreThis is highly specific to my own devices, so I understand why I had to configure most of it myself, and that's fine. Like someone said in another review, I don't understand how this is not more popular.
