I always feel guilty when I have to be gone and have to leave my 3 bichons at home alone.  They have treat balls to play with , but  Petzi has been a wonderful addition to our home.  I can not only watch and talk with my 3, but treat them.  I have to put the camera on the counter as one of my bichons is extremly smart and loves treat puzzles, so he thinks that this is one big puzzle.  I am still trying to figure a safe way to mount it closer to their level so I can see more of them.  Could not be happier with the product.  I have probably sold 8-10 to my friends who have pets.  Showed it to my vet today and he was amazed at the technology.  Thank you for making this great product so I do not have to feel as guilty about leaving my dogs.
