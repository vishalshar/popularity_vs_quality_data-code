The you tube video about Osmo Coding needs to be more concise and let's get rid of the kids.  Almost everyone buying this is an adult who is purchasing it for a child or grandchild.  Get a grey hair up there on the video explaining to other adults here is how you use it with your child.  My initial reaction during the tutorial is to press the screen.  I did not realize I had to use the button in the kit from the get go.  This is a very basic concept that someone my age (65) needs help with.  When 8 y/o's have there own credit cards, then the you tube video with kids explaining it to other kids will be relevant.  Until then, make a video with an old timer who explains the initial steps from unpacking to game play.  Now that I finally have it figured out I used it in preparation for a visit from my grandchildren and it did go smoothly.  One tip I can give is that the code executes from the top down.  That is not intuitive because I assumed it would execute from the tile immediately adjacent to to execute button sitting on my desk.  That is the bottom tile.  I think that explains one of the negative reviews I saw on Amazon.  Also when making a video skip the face shots.  Show the iPad in the holder with the tiles and the user's hands.  No one wants to look at an old guy anyways.
