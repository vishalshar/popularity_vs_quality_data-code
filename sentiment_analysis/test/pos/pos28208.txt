I absolutely recommend this laptop if you need on-the-go gaming. It runs anything from minecraft to GTA5 (on medium settings) quite easily. It's a very sleek, good looking laptop. The lighted keyboard is great, There are no compatibility issues as far as I've seen. Battery life is excellent when you're using it for surfing the web and low usage tasks. Obviously playing games is going to use quite a bit more battery so you'll need to plug up. Cooling is great although it does get quite warm and I'd highly suggest getting a lap desk for it unless you like sweaty inner thighs. I personally don't, BUT if you just spread your legs a bit it's not too bad. It's actually quite nice if you're feeling a bit cold. Other than that I've not got any complaints so far. Maybe that the charging cable is alittle too short, but that's not a big deal.
