Why so few reviews? It's probably because people hate to "close", as I do. First the good news. This is the most versatile and original set of pads you can imagine, it's not locked in to one DAW or setup. Now the bad news: same thing. It's not locked in, so you have to map it. There are some good presets for a handful of programs, like two for Live, and for Tractor and for Logic, and Reason, and drum pad mode, and you fill in the details.It can output one or 4 note-ons with velocity (one per corner) for each of 16 pads, and map pressure to a selectable MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) in each corner (grid mode), or (in Drum Mode) map two CCs in x-y mode across the pad, and a single CC for pressure. Each pad can be either in Grid or Drum Mode. They light up automatically in colors, or you can send MIDI messages to directly control the lights. The various sliders and rotaries add a lot of possible CC messages you can choose(with the included editor), and some of the surfaces can be assigned multiple banks. That all together is a preset. There are 16 preset memories, and the editor can save/load them to disk.There are options like "return CC value to zero" or "stay where released" for each sensor, and thresholds, sensitivity, ceilings, all the good stuff. It's really something, a something you have to integrate with your setup, and the bad news is that it takes creative planning and then using their minimalistic and confusing editor to set it all up. Some people complain that there aren't enough ready-to-go configs. Others complain that the company has not released enough of the interface specs so they could control the Quneo from their own programs and scripts. For the Quneo to be easy to integrate would require that the company put as much brainpower into the editor as they put into the hardware. And that hasn't happened.But here's the bottom line. You can spend close to a hundred bucks for just a lightweight toy pad-thing with velocity sensing. ALL pads react to "touch" that way. But the Quneo also reacts to pressure, in so many clever ways. I use it mostly for percussive sounds in drum mode, 16 pads in a bank, with note+velocity on the hit, then pressure ("aftertouch") emits MIDI CC 11 (Expression), and the X-Y raises mod wheel values when I roll my finger up, and  "foot controller" (MIDI CC 4) when I roll my finger to the right, and drop them both to 0 when I release. I use the sliders to control volume on 4 MIDI channels, and the big horizontal slider to control Pan. One of the round pads I use as a sustain (CC 64) "pedal". This is a very simple setup, copy-pasted from pad to pad, but it's very useful.The point is this: you can make the Quneo do a LOT more than that (they are also coming out with new firmware soon). But given that it costs only a hundred bucks more than a toy pad-thing, and is cheaper than a serious set of pads, I think that even if you do nothing more than the above with it, and even if the company isn't exactly on the front line of customer service, and even though the little micro-USB jack is ridiculous, you'll have a good thing. The pads' response is very programmable, they really feel great, the Quneo itself is very sturdy (see Beer and 2 story drop test on YouTube). You'll find all sorts of uses for it.One thing I don't believe is practical is to expect the Quneo to replace a Mackie Control type fader array. If you already have faders, continue to use them, the Quneo is for different purposes, like clip launching, being a tactile modeling clay type interface for a softsynth, controlling just a few specialized mixer parameters, etc.As to the micro-USB jack, get a couple of better cables, and, preferably before one breaks off, attach a small plate, say 1" by 1/2", to the bottom of the Quneo sticking out under the plug so it can't be wiggled or snapped off when you put it down on an uneven surface. Then it's fine.It's a great little unit that opens up a lot of possibilities. It's like our brains, they say, even at 1/100th of potential are OK. It doesn't have to be plug-and-play for EVERYTHING immediately.
