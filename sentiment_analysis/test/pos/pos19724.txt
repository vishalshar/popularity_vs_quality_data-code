I love love love this device. My favorite thing about it is that I don't have to remove my Nexus 6 from it's flipcover case. I can flip the cover open all the way to the back, then put the entire thing - phone and case - into the holder. I don't know that it would work as well with the phone vertical, but I use it horizontally, and that works just fine.
