The Seek UW-AAA for Android is very useful.  It runs fine on my Galaxy S5 even though my USB port has a waterproof cover.  I am using it to find poorly insulated areas of my home and for this purpose it is worth the money, assuming I can sell it afterwards.  It has a delay every time the shutter actuates to calibrate the thermal camera making the image somewhat difficult to use when walking.  It was fun to play with for a few hours.  I was slightly disappointed with the image quality but it is still amazing to get even this resolution for this price.  I am giving it 4 stars because it is quite fragile when connected to any phone.  If too much force is applied while connected it will either break the USB connector on your phone or the thermal camera or maybe both.  I hope that in the near future, smartphones will incorporate this tech into their flagship devices as standard hardware.  This would be much more useful than a heart beat sensor.
