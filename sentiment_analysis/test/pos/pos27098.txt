The bags are easier to use than the paper wrap although I love the wrap also.  So often I have bits and pieces, or I open the packages often, so the bags are better for some cheeses.  Really am happy to find both products, and the bags are especially practical for my husband who won't take the time to properly wrap cheese in the paper sheets.
