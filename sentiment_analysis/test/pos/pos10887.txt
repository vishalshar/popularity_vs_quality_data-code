These are amazing little products that I so desperately needed. My ear buds never stay in my ear even while wrapping the cord around my ears! So I found these. There small rubber and fit over a variety of earbuds. There's actually stylish too and you won't even know they don't go together with white ear buds. Most importantly- they keep my ear buds in! Not like "superglued" where I can do summersaults and cartwheels but they don't jingle out while jogging which is all I need!Cons: these won't fit Apple EarPods you need to get EarPods specific types (which I also bought) that work well and are just as cheap.
