Absolutely love the Petcube!  It's simple to set up.  I was able to get it online as well as connected to three iphones in the span of 10 minutes tops. The steps were simple and it went without a hitch.  The picture quality is very good and I love the fact I can speak over the microphone.  I've been able to give my dog the impression I am always watching.  She happened to be sniffing under the Christmas tree looking to see which gifts were her's (and quite possibly considering opening one or two).  I thoroughly enjoyed the look on her face when she heard me reprimand her and I was nowhere in sight.  Incidentally, I was able to catch my wife and son in this same act. We received it just days before we were to go away on a short trip. We returned late at night, but the dog sitter returned our dog home in the early evening.  It was nice to be able to check in on her and let her know we were near by.  She had never really spent a night alone, so it was nice to be able to speak to her and reassure her.  I'm pretty sure it put my wife a little more at ease too.Overall the Petcube has functioned easily and flawlessly.  As I said, the picture quality is very good, the two way microphone works wonderfully and is one of my favorite features. We have it in a big room, so it took some moving around a little to find the perfect spot. I might add at this point, the Petcube looks sleek. It can go just about anywhere and look like it belongs.  My son has fun with the laser pointer, but my dog is merely inconvenienced by it.  I could see its potential with cats and puppies.  I'm not sure how feasible it would be, but I would love to see a future model with zoom capabilities. I also appreciate the fact the Petcube can be set to alert you when someone accesses the camera to look in.
