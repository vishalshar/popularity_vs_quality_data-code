Hostage Negotiator from Van Ryder Games, is in sense a deck building game. This game comes with 3 abductors to play through, 7 major demand cards which adds a lot of replay ability during a game you randomly choose one which are character specific, 4 escape demands which one is randomly chosen, 21 red terror cards you only use 10 during a game, 6 pivotal event cards again only 1 is randomly used,  22 conversion cards which you as the negotiator will purchase and use to calm the abductor down, or help save hostages, you purchase these cards using conversion points that you earn during the different phases, 5 custom dice you use these dice to determine the outcome of conversion cards, the number of dice you roll is determined by the "mood" of the abductor certain conversion cards allow you to reroll dice and manipulate the dice, 15 hostage meeples, 1 abductor meeple, and 1 conversion marker. Hostage Negotiator is a single player game which is the first thing that attracted me to this game, then I watched a playthrough on youtube by Rahdo, thats when I knew I had to have this game. And boy was I happy, a normal game starts by choosing an abductor, then randomly choosing a major demand card, then randomly choosing an escape demand, then setting up the terror deck which acts like a timer. You randomly choose 10 from the 21 that come with the game, the finally randomly choosing 1 random pivotal terror card that goes on the bottom of the terror deck, if you can't meet 1 of the 3 requirements to win by the time the pivotal event gets revealed you lose. Also if more then half of the hostages die you lose, every abductor is completely different from the next, I won't go into detail about the abductors I dont want to spoil anything. Next you lay out the conversation  cards you will purchase later on, finally all the zero cost cards go into your hand, then your ready to start. The game takes place over 3 phases. First Conversion phase, this is where you play cards from your hand and roll dice to determine outcome, next is spend phase, you spend conversion points to buy new cards to be played next round. Finally Terror Phase, draw and resolve outcome of terror card. The game sounds easy, it's not, there are very tense moments, you need to figure out what the abductor wants, there is alot of strategy involved, and each abductor plays different and you need to play different strategy for each abductor. Now there is a lot of luck with the dice roll, but there are ways to manipulate the die outcome. But I absolutely love this game, it's great when I can't get my game group together due to work and kid's. I highly recommend this game to anybody from a new casual gamer to a gamer who plays more serious games, this is for everyone. I give this a 9.5-10 replay ability is great with the random card set up, it's very easy to learn the rule book is great, but it's deep enough that you have to think ahead and figure your moves out. Still not sure? Watch sine reviews or playthroughs.
