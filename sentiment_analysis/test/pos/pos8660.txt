Great game! My son has ADHD and I searched the web for activities we could do together. I was specifically looking for an activity that would help hone his focus and critical thinking. He tends to get frustrated with games if they are too long or too complicated. He also hates losing. This game is like chess but quicker. It's easy to learn but still challenging so it's perfect for both adults and children. It helps teach my son to look at the whole picture and plan ahead. So much so that when he does lose, he knows it's coming and we can discuss what he could have done differently.
