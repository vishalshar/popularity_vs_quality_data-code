Quad Lock is a company that came up with the most fantastic idea. One mounting system across all your platforms. It's just incredible.I use this bike mount on a Raleigh Revenio 2.0, and it fits the crossbar perfectly. I use a Quadlock universal adapter on my Lifeproof case, and it's perfect. I never worry about my phone flying off.This is seriously easy to use and I own three different QL mounts at this point (bike mount, armband, and car mount).If you haven't looked into this company yet, you're doing yourself a disservice.
