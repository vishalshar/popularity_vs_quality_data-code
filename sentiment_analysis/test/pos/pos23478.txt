WHAT I WANTEDI was recently in the market for a suitcase when my last one broke and fell apart on me mid-travel.  With an important four day trip to the Bahamas coming up I was specifically looking for a bag I could roll, that was durable and one I could check in on any airline. Also, I had a terrible experience of not being able to charge my phone while I was in an airport a few months ago.  All the charging stations were full, no wall outlets, no restaurants would help me and my phone died before getting on the plane.  So I had to charge my phone when I landed, making my ride wait for 20 minutes.  No bueno.  When I saw Bluesmart I was surprised all the features it had and thought that it might just be too good to be true.  But I bought it anyway to give it a try.WHAT I GOTI received my BlueSmart in exactly two days wrapped in a nice big tote bag. I am not very electronically advanced so I was nervous that I would not succeed in charging the bag, or manage to lock it or mess something up.  But included was a charging chord and a book with beautifully laid out instructions even a first grader could understand.  I felt like a superstar charging my bag.  I managed to lock the bag as well and had fun watching my bag move when my friend was wheeling it around when I was 10 miles away.  The phone charger not only works but it charges fast!  My iphone was fully charged in less time that it takes with a wall outlet.  Yippee!!!  Check out the photos of my bluesmart uncharged and charged.  like the starwars-esque blue light beam to let me know it is chargingI also like the material of the suitcase.  It feels light but I tried it in the rain and my clothes didnÂ’t get wet or any of the functions go down.  As a Midwest girl who is used to traveling in wind, rain and snow, this is hugely important to have a bag that can withstand the weather.AREAS OF IMPROVEMENTBag is on the small side so it really should be used for shorter travel, which is what they state clearly so no blame on them.  As a woman traveler who wants a few different clothes and shoe options, even on a short trip, I think Bluesmart could have the bag be a few inches deeper and it would help.This is a luxurious request, but it would be lovely to have a place to slip in a contact card just in case the bag is lost and the locator goes down.  Not mandatory but a nice back up plan.FINAL DECISIONI am overall really happy that I bought Bluesmart and would recommend it to anyone who travels for short periods and likes to know where their things are, charge their phone anyway and lock up their bag to avoid swiping those presents you bought for your family.  I can now breath easier knowing I have a bag that makes me feel safe and cared for while I travel.
