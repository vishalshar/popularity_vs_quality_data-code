Don't buy the $15 one sold here on Amazon.  It's a piece of junk.  This product is awesome.  Looks great, stays put thanks to it's micro suction cups on the bottom and always charges with zero issues.  I bought one of those $15 dollar docks here on Amazon, the one that has 3 different brand names but all look identical.  It would lose connection almost every time I used it.  The TimeDock works perfectly.  Well worth the price if your looking for a nice place to keep your Time.
