After few days trying this product, I think I just found it really works. I heard about this stuff from a podcast, and seems like that module working on the host immediately. So the first day it arrived I tried it before going bed, honestly I didn't have much feeling at first, not the feeling after taking Melatonin, feeling sleepy or whatever. I just feel as calm as usual. Then I felt sleep about 20 mins later. Oh, maybe it's because I was tired at that time and this module is nothing but a psychological hint, I think to myself. And during the weekend, I tried the energy vibe. Same as the calm vibe, I didn't feel much at all! I thought it could be more stimulating, like drinking coffee, but it doesn't. I have slightly rings in the ears and mild stinging to my skin, gone right after I finish the vibe. Then I think "it is nothing but a placebo module and I am going to return this next Monday. " I took it off and start my day. In the Sunday afternoon, I just realize, I have done many things I refused to do. Cleaning the kitchen, cleaning the bedroom ,bathroom and iron all my shirts. Those are things I don't want to think about, things that "I will do it when I have time today", but I seldom did. Wow. I really finish them without much struggling. It is not those things that make you high, as I thought it could be. But it make me feel less difficult to finish my TODO list. Everything happens so naturally. It's amazing when I realize it.  And I seldom write comment on products I brought but now I am doing so. Still I cannot tell it is real science or more like a hint, but for me, even if it is a hint, it's a GOOD hint.
