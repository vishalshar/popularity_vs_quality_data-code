My dog was experience some frequent and horribly smelling gas all of the time and we bought this to add to both her meals. Did as instructed, doubled up for the first two weeks then regular dosage following. REALLY helped cut down the amount and smells by 90%. The downside is that when we stopped using it the gas returned somewhat. Otherwise it would have been a 5-Star rating.
