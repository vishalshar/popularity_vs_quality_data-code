Thank heavens for this wedge!  I had been suffering with excruciating nighttime back pain for months.  I noticed that if I fell asleep on the sofa, slightly elevated, I had far less pain than I did when lying in my bed.  I have a wonderful natural latex mattress so I knew that wasn't my problem.  My problem was simply lying flat.  I found this wedge and it is PERFECT.  I'm elevated enough to completely eliminate the horrible pain I was having.  I do put a pillow under my knees to keep me from sliding down since it is 12" high.  It is firm enough to hold its shape, yet soft enough to be very comfortable to sleep on. I can't say enough. It has honestly changed the quality of my sleep...and my life.. since my pain is GONE.  AND, I paid full price, and did not get it exchange for my review. This review is 1000% legit.
