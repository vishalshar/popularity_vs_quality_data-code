The only reason I bought this was because of the working analog VU meters. It reminds me of the vintage stereos of the 1970s.  These VU meters don't work like the ones on classic tape decks.  They move when the power is turned up.  So for the most part, they hardly move since I play at low volumes.  Mine didn't have RCA inputs in the back.  The manufacture date on the box showed Jan. 2015.  On the Innovative Technology website, they had versions that include a separate record player.  I wonder if it connects to rear RCA inputs.The front aux input level is low.  I had to crank up the volume on my MP3 player.At first the Bluetooth wouldn't work even though it connected to my Samsung Galaxy phone.  After giving up, I tried one more time a few hours later and it worked and has been ever since.  The CD tray will open only if CD is selected on the function button.The sound quality isn't that good but I think if I ever switch out the speakers, the sound would be improved.  But for around $100 I wouldn't expect high quality speakers.  If it had a lighted analog tuner it would be even better because I like retro stereos.The brushed "metal" faceplate looks like plastic with metal looking paint so I'll have to be careful not to scratch it.  The over all casing is metal.It's too bad I can't change out the FM antenna.  It is just a thin wire.  The FM (no AM available) signal doesn't come in strong.I tried homemade CDs and it wouldn't play CD-R or CD-RW.  Don't try to stack full length cassette decks or turntables on top because the size of the unit is smaller.The VU meters are not as pretty as the vintage 1970's type and when off the meters have a white background unlike the vintage stereo's metal background.  They light up blue when turned on. I wish the lights were green or soft white like the old stereos.  The red needles look cheap and the over all meters look cheap too. The ONLY reason I bought this is because of the VU meters.  I couldn't find modern stereos except the very expensive McIntosh brand that has analog VU meters and they glow blue too.Update:  I successfully connected my line level output record player (turntable) to the front AUX connection.  I used a 3.5 jack to RCA jack adapter.  The volume level was good unlike my MP3 player.  The sound was rich and pleasant.  If you use a record player, you need to use one that outputs line level and not phono level.  Otherwise, you will need a line level phono pre-amp.  I wish the stereo I bought had rear RCA jacks as others said theirs had.
