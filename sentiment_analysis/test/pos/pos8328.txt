I was not sure whether to get this battery case because of the very mixed reviews.  Now that I've had it for a few weeks, here's the summary: it all depends.  First, the biggest issue - the top falling off the case.  This was a huge issue with my case, however, once I called the company, they said they were aware of this issue and have replacement tops that don't fall off, and sent me one for free with no problems.  This one works great, making this a perfect battery case for me.Now for the other concerns reviewers raised.  First, the headphones - I use headphones all the time for audiobooks, and both Apple headphones and "fake" headphones similar to apple design work fine.  I've also used a couple other types with no problems, so that's not been an issue for me.  Second, the top charging port.  I do understand what the reviewers mean - it's a little odd to have it on top, and yes, you have to have a longer cable to charge it if you are using it as a GPS in the car - but it's not been more than a minor "hmm, odd" thought for me.  The little cover you have to lift was indeed a bit challenging to open the first couple times, but now that I have a hang of it, it's not an issue (though it may be an issue for you if you like to cut your fingernails super close to the skin - mine are by no means long, but I do have nails).So all in call, I do really like the case.  It doesn't look like a battery case, it's not that heavey, and yet it can charge my phone back to full after it goes to 15-20% - I haven't needed any other power source even with my heavy cell phone use (with bluetooth since I have an apple watch) and long commutes.  It's not perfect - the top fit is still a little odd, but the new top seems to hold well, so I really do like it and glad I got it.
