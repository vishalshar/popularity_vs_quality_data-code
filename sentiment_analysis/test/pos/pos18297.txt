I had a competitor for a year- The Kwik Set Kevo has a serious design flaw when it comes to power consumption.  Even after having the Kevo manufacturer send me a replacement lock- I would run through AA batteries literally almost weekly. Purchase Augusts additional hub if you desire to communicate with your door lock via the internet and not only on Bluetooth.  This lock we have had for about 2 months and I could not be happier!  I am able to communicate with the lock via Bluetooth, wireless internet and our Amazon Echo!  The batteries have not had to be replaced since we purchased and installed the lock, which has been about 2 months so far.  If you desire to add people to your home for access, either temporary as a guest or as a admin, it will not cost you an additional cost. Kevo charged you as if you were purchasing another key to be made.  I should have purchased this lock when I first decided on getting a smart lock- instead I wasted my money on a Kevo.  Do not make the same mistake that I made and get this lock- it will not let you down.
