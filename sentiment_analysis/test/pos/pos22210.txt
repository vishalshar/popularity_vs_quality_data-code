My BMW now automatically tells Garageio to open my garage door when my car enters a close geo-fence around my house!  (BMW iDrive IFTTT Widget to IFTTT online to Garageio).  Install and Setup was simple.  Compatibility list not that accurate.  My garage door LiftMaster controller board is used in four different LiftMaster model numbers, and Garageio compatibility list didn't list two of them, listed one of them as incompatible, and listed the fourth model number my lift controller board is used in as compatible.  IFTTT now also triggers Garageio to close my garage door at night, if I forget to.  No SmartThings support but IFTTT and Alexa support so far be sufficient so far, but I suspect that will not remain true and lack of SmartThings support will become an issue at some point.
