I am a crazy first time mom and use this thermometer almost daily (every time he feels warm or has diarrhea or a slightly red hang nail). The thermometer is easy to set up, easy and quick to use and I love that I can create profiles for all family members and store temps and symptoms in my phone (ideal for answering dr questions while sleep deprived). The kinsa support is also helpful- I emailed with a question in regards to if I need to add a degree for auxiliary temps (under arm) or if it is calibrated to do so already (because you can choose to take oral, underarm, or rectal temp). They responded back in under 24 hours saying I do not need to add a degree for underarm temps, the app does not add a degree for auxiliary temps but is set up to recognize a temp of 99.4 as a fever (in infants under three months) whereas the rectal temp is set up to recognize a fever at 100.4.I love the kinsa thermometer so much I also bought it for a friend who is also a first time mom and I have also bought the ear thermometer for when my little one is over 6 months and for my husband and I to use (ear thermometer reads much quicker than the stick).All in all, this is an amazing product. I will probably purchase this item for every expecting friend.
