Pricey, but much better than the "gauze" version that they provide to you with the medical supplies.  Holds up well to washing.  Husband has used this for several weeks and still looks ad functions as good as it did day 1.  Snug enough to protect his pic-line as he tosses and turns during the night, but not uncomfortable at all.  He wears it all the time to prevent snagging the end of the pic-line during day to day activities.
