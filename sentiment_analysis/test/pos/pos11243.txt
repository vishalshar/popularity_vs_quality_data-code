I've bought 3 and Whistle has replaced another free of charge.  I feel well qualified to comment at length.I don't think the map address function works well, as it misidentifies my rural 911 address by exactly one mile.  Also, the software may have some consistency issues.  Battery life is not as good as advertised. Overall, however, I LOVE my Whistle trackers.  And customer service has been great on each of several occasions I have contacted them.The GPS satellite image is astoundingly accurate, with physical feature of the landscape clearly evident.  This morning I discovered my Beagle Nellie's tracker had detached from her collar.  (This has happened before but seldom.  I attribute it to operator error.)  My Whistle app showed the tracker as being in a cornfield about a half mile away.  I drove over there.The GPS map shows the location of my phone in relation to the tracker.  When I got pretty close on the road next to the cornfield, I walked back and forth east and west until my phone showed the lost tracker as being about 50 yards due north of my phone.  Then I walked into the field and followed the corn rows north.  When I got closer, I moved over 1 row to the east, then another row to the east.  I headed north again, and when my phone showed me as just about sitting on the tracker, I spotted it lying there on the ground about 2 feet to my right.Note that I found the tracker in a featureless cornfield surrounded by 9-foot corn plants in every direction, with only very limited visibility, and more than 50 yards from the closest edge of the field.  It was like a jungle out there.BTW, this is the SECOND time in the last year that I have found a lost tracker in the middle of a cornfield.  Today's cornfield story is not a fluke.It's usually a snap to find the trackers when they are on the collars of my wandering Beagles, as they are chasing rabbits, usually barking and not lying flat on the ground.  I've done it dozens of times, most notably last January when I discovered the little rascals had followed Hickory Grove Creek 10 miles from home!  With the sun going down in snow-covered coyote country, I drove my truck from my office in town, past my home 10 miles into the country, for another 9 miles to a woods I had never before entered in my life, walked into the gloom, and found both dogs in 5 minutes.Another time, I sent my sister to retrieve the dogs.  I told her to look down by the creek near the bridge.  She phoned back and said she couldn't see them.  Sitting in my office, 10 miles away, I looked at the GPS and told her to look in the tall weeds about 10 yards east of the creek.  Quoth Sis: "Oh, yeah!  There they are."I've tracked them at home from 2 states away, too.  So, there's less need to pen them up while on vacation.  There's no reason I couldn't do the same from clear across the continent.So, if you have a roaming dog out in the wide open countryside, Whistle can't be beat.
