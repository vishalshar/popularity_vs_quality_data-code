I ordered this watch for my girlfriend, she loves it. She's downloaded a bunch of very cute and useful watchfaces. She loves the pedometer and HR monitor. Is this watch super fancy? No, but it can do many things like controlling music from Spotify, send text-to-speech messages, monitor sleeping patterns. With winter on the way, it's nice to have weather right on your wrist. My girlfriend has tiny wrists and she was able to get a good fit. There are 12 holes for adjustment on the band, she has hers fit on the 2nd near the top so it should fit most wrist sizes. Glad I got this watch, m'lady is pleased (:
