Great product! Works very well so I am pleased as this is saving me from buying new batting gloves! Keeps your grip so you don't have to hold such a strong grip on the bat when swinging. You can focus more on a power swing. The carabiner is also nice so you can just clip it right to your bag and not worry about trying to find it at the bottom of your bag.
