Purchased Grip Boost out of curiosity, really. And was extremely surprised by the feel and increased grip. Grip Boost provides the right amount of stick. Easy to remove hands without feeling stuck to the handle. Grip Boost stays tacky on the batting gloves but does not transfer onto the handle of the bat or to hands. No sticky mess to deal with, like pine tar or other adhesives. The feel of the bat is dramatically increased. Highly recommend Grip Boost over anything else.
