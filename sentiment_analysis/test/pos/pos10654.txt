My son loves it.Chirpie is great fun. But not exactly as expected. My 5 year old really loves playing egg toss but not catching. he just drops him farther and farther. Startup Chirpie, talk to him a bit, then out the window!Chirpie seems to take this like a champ. The dog brings him back in and they start the process over again. Is this normal?
