Love this!  I just wish my dogs weren't terrified of it...lol.  Great idea and I am sure they will get used to it.  I can keep an eye on them and tell them "NO!"  when they are on the couch and I am at work.  I just wish the app would stay on until you cut it off and not "time out".  It's really cool that you can give them treats when you are gone and talk to them, but it kinda freaks them out.  I have put cat treats in it for now...my fat kitty is the only one that will come near it for now.  The "treat giver" mechanism is a bit noisy, so I think it startles them.  Would do double work as a nanny cam.
