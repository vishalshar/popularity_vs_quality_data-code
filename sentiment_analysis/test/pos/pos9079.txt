Typing this on my phone which currently has a quad-lock case on it. I love this system.I originally went with the Proper magnet system, which had cases and mounts just like quad lock, however they used super strong rare earth blah blah magnets. Which at first they were nice, and worked, however my mine reason for getting these systems is road biking. The roads are my house are rough, and i have several railroad crossings, and with the magnet system, my phone was constantly getting thrown from the bike crossing a train track or hitting a really rough patch on the road.With this system I never worry about the phone falling off the mount like I did with the Proper magnet system. Locks tightly into place, yet easy enough to remove.Comes with plenty of mounting options.If your serious about bike riding and have done your research, you realize this and Proper are very popular. However, if you bike over any rough terrain or roads or track crossings, I would definitely recommend the quad lock system.
