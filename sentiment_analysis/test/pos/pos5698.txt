After over a month of having it I realized how nice this case is. I would give it a 5 star but the design isn't the coolest ?. It has much more extra battery than other battery cases. I've dropped my phone a million times from like 3 feet and it hasn't broke. But if I dropped it higher I'm sure it would break. Though it is very slippery so I wish it were to be more grippy. It is great how the charger is on the top of the phone so then the charger doesn't get in the way of your hands when it's charging. Overall great slim battery case if you want a smaller battery case that packs a punch.
