I love my Canary Flex!  It was incredibly easy to setup and I love the flexibility of the magnetic base!  I use this Canary outside, to keep an eye on the entrance of my apartment.  It works great in rain and even snow!  The wide-angled HD view is very crisp, and the night vision is amazing.I purchased the original Canary over a year ago and have continuously loved everything about it.  The setup process was also seamless and the app is very user friendly.  I really like that you can review past video and even save bookmarks for future use.I have pets at home and purchased the Canary so that I could have a watchful eye on them while I'm at work.  I purchased the Canary Flex to keep my home secure while I'm away.  Both have been part of a great system that is really advanced and easy to maintain.  I highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in keeping a close eye on what they hold near and dear.
