I am not sure what this tastes like but one thing I know it must taste fantastic because my dog loves it. I was on a website called Dog Food Advisor and this food gets 5 out of 5 stars on their website. My Donna dog is a picky eater but not anymore. She runs when she hears me pouring this into her bowl. No more coaxing her to eat------she dives right in. I was amazed at all the healthy ingredients in this food. Lots of veggies and fruits so extra vitamins they may not normally get in regular dog food. Donna wanted me to tell you thank you for making her a happy healthy dog.
