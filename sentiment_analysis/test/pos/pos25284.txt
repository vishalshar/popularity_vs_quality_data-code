I checked out a lot of competing models and decided to go with the Skybell HD. Pleased with the choice overall. Installation was ridiculously easy. All of the necessary parts were provided, and the device is pretty sturdy on the wall.A couple of quibbles:- the silly "SKYBELL" logo on the push button almost made me not buy this product.  Why, oh why would you put marketing on a decorative consumer product like that?!- Motion detection is a bit wonky. I've tried all three sensitivity settings (high, med, low) and all I ever see recorded is the mailman walking away from the door. I'm hopeful a future software upgrade will improve that so it can better trigger on motion as someone approaches.Good things:- My router uses both the 2.4 and 5 Ghz bands, running with the same SSID. I blatantly ignored the documentation stating that you must set your 2.4 band to a separate SSID to make this work. The Skybell HD had no problems with this and works like a charm.- I was worried that it would look a little silly outside my door, but it really looks good. And nobody has any problem figuring out where the doorbell button is.All in all, a solid product so far.
