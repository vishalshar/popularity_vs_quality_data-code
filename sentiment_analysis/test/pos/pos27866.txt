This is an ingenious toy. It is not fragile, but rather well made.  It uses an IPad to operate and control (Android technology can be used as well.) Although I am a bit of a troglodyte to this technology, my 12 yr old had as much fun playing with this as he did trying to instruct me on how to operate it. It is really simple, and YouTube has several "instructional" videos showing its various capabilities.The only drawback; the dogs are not too fond of it ...LOL!!
