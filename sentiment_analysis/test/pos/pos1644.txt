What I like about this security device, is that it has a different approach to detect possible intrusions on my network.  I view it as a second lock on my internet.  I was also impressed how quickly I was able to get assistance with Cujo staff via video call.  Can't get that type of quick service these days with most large companies.  Cujo looks cute, but I don't think it's meant to be a friendly St. Bernard dog against intruders.
