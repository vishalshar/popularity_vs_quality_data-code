I was looking for a nice gift for my mom to replace the typical flowers/food.  We're both big fans of tea, and this is the first time I've seen loose leaf come in a stylish package set for gifting.  The tins ensured the tea was fresh (there's definitely a 'wow' moment when you pop them open and get a whiff of the herbs for the first time) and she loved the little spoon that comes with the set.  It was a great family experience to sample all the teas together - and this set was herbal - so it made for the perfect after dinner treat for the whole family!
