Great phone for the money, bought it as deal of the day for $200. Didn't come with a charge plug, but the charge cable has worked very well. Lightweight and free of bloatware, but missing some of the functions found in high end phones like Wi-Fi calling etc. that I would have liked to have in a phone this cutting edge. Looking forward to the next iteration, most definitely worth the money.
