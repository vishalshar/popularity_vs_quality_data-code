Munk Pack is perfect for:-a quick breakfast when you can't actually sit down and have a decent morning meal.-keeping handy in your purse because there WILL be a time when you're unprepared and a tin of Altoids is your next best option.-sustenance while hiking or climbing outdoors and don't want to feel weighed DOWN while going UP.-those who love overnight oats but forgot to make them last night.I love the handy convenient baby-food-in-cool-packaging type pouch. My only regret is that I eat them too fast! Blueberry Acai is my favorite flavor. I have tried the Raspberry Coconut one but I always go back to Bluberry Acai. I always try to have these in my pantry.
