A few months ago I purchased two 11' long kayaks and I have struggled to find a good way to store them, until now!  I purchased two mylifter units, two strap kits and two hooks and now I can lift my kayaks up and out of my way when I am not using them.The app was easy to use and the installation took about an hour to do two units. Most of the time was spent measuring and marking my ceiling, I had a very tight space I needed to fit the kayaks.I love "smart lift" and "smart lower" feature in the app, I set a high spot (the ceiling) and a low spot (the floor) and now I can get my kayaks up and down with a single push of a button.I also really like that the app tells you how much weight you are lifting.  Once I had the kayaks lifting I found I was only using a little over half of the lifting capacity.  I ended up filling each kayak with my gear to bring the weight up to the limit.I will be buying more of these in the near future!
