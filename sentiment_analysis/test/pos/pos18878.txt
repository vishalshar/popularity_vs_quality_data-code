I'll admit -- I was skeptical. But these bags really work. I bought a big chunk of expensive parmesan reggiano for a dinner party and only used about 1/4 of it.  I remembered the bags, popped the cheese in one and put it in the cheese drawer in the fridge. That was well over a month ago, and today I took it out...and it was perfect. Not a spot or speck of mold. It makes me want to go buy cheese just so I can leave it in the fridge for a really long time! (Not really, just kidding!) Seriously, these bags are amazing.
