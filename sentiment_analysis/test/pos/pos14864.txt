These are so good and healthy! Crispy apple chips for kids and adults. I take a baggie with me to work nearly every day! I've ordered them several times, and really like the cinnamon ones too. You can't beat this price compared to the cost of the little bags of apple chips you can find in the stores. Highly recommended!
