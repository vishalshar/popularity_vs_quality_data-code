I've recently discovered Health Warrior Chia Bars.  My first purchase was the chocolate peanut butter flavor.  Since I was new to these bars, I didn't have much grounds of comparison.  My overall thoughts on those were just OK.  I would eat the bars mainly because it was a healthy snack, not because I actually enjoyed it.  So when I ran out, I tried to by another box and found that they were sold out of the chocolate peanut butter flavor. Turns out it was a blessing!  I found these coconut flavors instead. Although, I was a bit hesitant at first to purchase these, after reading another review about how great it tastes, I took a chance.  Boy am I glad I did!  These are DELICIOUS!!  I will NEVER go back to the peanut butter again.  I highly recommend these to those who like the taste of coconut because it tastes very coconutty. So, if you're not a big fan of coconut to start with, these are probably not for you.
