This is an uber or an airbnb of pet feeders. Fully connected to wifi, you can record sounds or your own voice that invites your pet to a meal, and then watch through a webcam him eating which can be viewed on your computer or mobile device. I usually program the feeder to a specific time, but you can force activate it for an additional dose. Also, feeder sends me text notifications when the pet is fed which is comforting. You have 5 meals with the feeder, so for me it is enough to travel over the weekend. Also, my cat eats only wet food, and it stays ok for about 48 hours. Saves me about $100 per weekend on cat seaters. The seller's responsiveness is amazing. I had questions about cold packs to keep food fresher (you need to buy separately), sent an email, and he responded within an hour over the weekend, and was very helpful and accommodating.
