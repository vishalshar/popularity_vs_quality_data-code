This plastic prints surprisingly well..  I had no issues with it in my Ultimaker 2.  Standard .4 nozzle.  It is very abrasive and will wear out your nozzle and your isolator so get some spares.  I polished the finished parts to a high gloss.  After polishing the parts could pass as real metal.  If you are expecting a bright chrome like finish you will be disappointed.  The parts are still grey looking after polishing.  This plastic is a bit pricey costing about four times as much as regular PLA.  If you have a need for a faux metal look and don't need it to look like chrome and don't mind a LOT of polishing, then this plastic is for you...
