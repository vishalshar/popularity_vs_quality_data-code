After looking over all the other major controllers, and seeing the good reviews for Rachio, I decided to go with Rachio.  I've had it for 4 days now and it has been a great experience.  It is the "iphone" of controllers.  Anybody could connect it and get up and running.  The app is so easy to use and set up and it is easily programmable as well.  Customer service is great too.  I had to call with a question about interfacing it with my electrical system and they spent an hour talking me through it.  Get the Rachio, you won't be dissappointed.
