This the best investment for my iPhone 6 plus I have made.  Even tho the quad lock system is one of the most expensive mounting systems for phones, its probably the best.  Especially if you have a big device like an iPhone plus or large galaxy.  The bigger the device, the less stable the mount and most mounts just don't work for the large phones, but this mount always holds solid, and when it clicks into place, its very sturdy and stable.  I have a mount on my bike, my car, and i have a magnetic mount i can use for any metal surface.I do not use the waterproof cover because its sort of a pain to take on and off.  However, I tasted it out and it works great, and you can still use your touchscreen easily, but all the charging and headphone holes are filled.
