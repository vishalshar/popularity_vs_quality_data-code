I got this using Alexa on Prime day. I would buy again at full price. What a deal. I have already gotten my money back. I have a 2003 Chevy S10 truck. It seems like it is always in the shop. Recently, I spent $600 doing badly needed maintenance. I drove it for a week and I'll be Ded the Service Engine Soon light came on. I didnt want to take it back to the mechanic as I am sure I would be charged for the diagnostic evaluation. So, when I found this I bought it. I finally got around to opening it and installing it. It was all very easy. Down load the app, install it in your vehicle, then follow the instructions. I did watch a video just to be sure I was doing everything correctly. Anyway, once both the app and the Automatic were installed I turned on my engine and saw a little red engine on the top of the screen, I clicked on it and followed the instructions. It told me there were no problems with my engine and asked if I wanted to clear it. So, I cleared and the light went out. So happy with this thing and I havent even driven my truck yet. I am thinking about buying another one for my 2013 Subaru it is still under warranty, but I once forgot to put the gas cap on and that caused a check engine light to come on so I had to drive to the dealership to get it turned off. What a pain.PROS  CONSVery easy to install  NoneReceived an email from right after I installed the appApp loaded quicklyApp and Automatic synced is less than 2 minutesImmediately identified my year, make and model of vehicleApp allows you do set up an emergency call if in an accidentApp allows you do have 3 emergency contacts notified if you have an accidentCleared my engine lightPlays sound for Highway Driving Over 70MPHPlays sound for Hard AccelerationPlays sound Hard BrakingGives you a Driving ScoreComes inside a travel cup that you can really use
