UPDATED REVIEW:I've changed my original 2-star review to a 4-star review, because the company has provided new, re-designed mounting boards that address most of the issues people have been having.  The new boards we were sent are black and have holes completely through them.  The bits no longer pop off the boards now, which is a huge improvement!It still takes quite a bit of pressure to place the bits onto the board, and it can be finicky getting two bits held together by a weak magnet to not disconnect while pressing them into the boards.  This can result in a frustrating time for smaller children who may not have the patience or accuracy to line up everything 100% before pressing down.  I don't know what the company could do to address this, as it's a fundamental part of their product design.Honestly, I wish they had just gone with a LEGO-compatible peg design with their pieces and boards from the start, rather than trying to flip that particular design upside-down and put their "unique twist" on it.  There's a reason there's about a billion block toys that say "compatible with LEGO" -- the design works.  And you can't say they didn't think about it or it's not important, because the set comes with pieces that allow you to connect LEGOs to your bits! Anyway... it is what it is.In regards to customer service, the company has been very good. Although our initial contact with customer service tried to deflect the issue, once enough customers had voiced their frustration with the mounting boards, littleBits was very communicative and proactive in addressing the problem.  It would have been ideal if this sort of thing had been sorted out before their product was put on the market, but they were nice enough to send replacement boards at no cost to us, and the kids are happy to finally be able to build a project with the set that was opened on Christmas morning.ORIGINAL REVIEW:TL;DR: The bits don't fit very well onto the mounting boards, making every project an exercise in frustration.PROS: Great concept. The design of the parts is quite clever, preventing you from accidentally connecting them to each other the wrong way.  The idea behind the bits is great, and one I'd love to support. However...CONS: If you've ever experienced the problem of LEGOs being stuck together so well that you need a special tool to remove them, you don't have to worry about that here!  A product like this will live or die by how well-made it is, and the mounting boards -- which are ESSENTIAL TO YOUR PROJECTS -- are the worst part of this kit.The mounting boards have one job, and they are awful at it: THEY DON'T HOLD THE BITS.The bits fit together to form pegs on their underside that are supposed to fit into holes on the mounting boards.  This design makes it so that the individual bits are locked together by the mounting board and won't fly apart when the project moves.  However, it takes a lot (I mean, A LOT -- like, "I'm worried we're going to break the bits") of force to push bits onto the board, and they are constantly popping off the boards on their own.Because you have to press the entire assembly onto the mounting boards at roughly the same time, bits will pop apart as one section is pushed back off the mounting board while another mounts correctly.  Then, as you correct the "broken" bits and push them onto the board, another section will pop off the board.  It is extremely frustrating!It's especially annoying to watch your project (in our case, the spinning light) self-destruct the first time you turn it on because the motor popped off the mounting board while you were working on another part.  After thirty minutes of struggling with this problem, the frustration overwhelmed the allure of this kit & my kids went to play with their LEGOs.  Well done, Little Bits!
