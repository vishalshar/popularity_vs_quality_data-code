These are outstanding for the price. I have trouble keeping earbuds to stay in my ear, and these mouldings fix that problem excellently.Doing the moulding is very easy. You just drop them in hot water to make them soft, mush them into your ear, and then let them cool down. They get solid again when they are cool.Other reviews say you should keep the moulds and throw away the included earbuds. I may experiment with that in the future. For my use, though, the quality of the included earbuds is adequate.
