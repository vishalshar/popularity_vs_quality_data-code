I bought the Remix as a black friday deal in order to use it as an xfinity cable box replacement.  So far so good.  It booted right up, and I was able to install the xfinity tv app from the Google play store.  Now I'm able to watch live TV and X1 recorded shows, with smooth playback in full HD on my "dumb" TV, and I can drop a rental box and save at least $10/month.  The setup will pay for itself in a few months, and I'll avoid the January rate hike.  Would this be a good PC replacement?  Probably not, but that's not why I bought it.  For web surfing, gmail, and media playback, it seems to work just fine.  This is more of a roku or chromecast competitor, but much more flexible and customizable.
