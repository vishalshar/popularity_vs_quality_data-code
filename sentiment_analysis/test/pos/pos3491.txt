I am an engineer and bought this for my child to inspire her to learn about programming. My 8-yr old loves it. You can drive it or create programs to control it. It also comes with pre-written programs. It is pretty simple. I recommend you take a few minutes to familiarize with the software first before you let a younger child play with it, so they don't get frustrated. Run some of the pre-written programs so you know what each command means, and also learn to drive it with the simple control.I showed my 8-yr old how to drive it, and she drove it better than I do. Then showed her some of the videos on what other kids do with it,which inspired her to build obstacle courses with books and drove the Sphero through the 'maze'. She hasn't learned to use the programming mode by herself yet. But we created one together to tell the Sphero to 1) change to blue, 2) go crazy, 3) change to red. And then I hid behind the door with the iPad to run the program while she was in the room "telling" Sphero to change to the exact things we just programmed as if she was a wizard. It'd make great party tricks. She named hers "Turbo" and treats it like a pet.I can see it as a great gift for kids to teens. I am going to get one for my nephew who is 12 and is learning to program. You can do simple commands, but it also provides an interface for you to go right into the actual programming language.We also downloaded some of games that work with the Sphero, but I don't think they are too interesting.Wish list: I would like to see a "controller" software that allows you to control the Sphero by dragging it on the screen. Haven't seen something like that yet. Also would like to see the simple command software provide a little more instructions as to what some of the numbers mean.Overall, it's a great educational toy.
