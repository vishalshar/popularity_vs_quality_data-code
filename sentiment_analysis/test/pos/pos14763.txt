Love this , IUseIt in New York City and I ride back and forth from the ferry . I believe it's about 27lb but wish it was aBit lighter . Still feels heavy . I added a bell and a flashlight to the handle which I needed. It rides hard because the tires rNotInflatable so u can't get a flat . I bought it in January andI am waiting for the warm weather to really start enjoying it .
