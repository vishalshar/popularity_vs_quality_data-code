I had the feed and go for a while, but I took my time in setting it up because I was actually afraid of the set up process. I am a tenant in an apartment like complex, and I could not set it up using the WPS button. Instead, I set up the feed and go using the wireless setup. Shockingly it was super freaking easy! It was extraordinarily easy and I'm not much of a hardware person. I set it up through my iPad, which was super freaking easy! I'm still like in awe. It only took me two minutes to set up the device, and get the web cam working.I did however, have difficulty setting up the voice message, which is funny because that's the easiest part if you don't live in a decrepit home like I do. I sent a message to the company through their feedandgo website, not expecting them to answer back until like hours later. To my surprised, within like ten minutes, Alex (the owner!) called me on my cell phone. He started off the conversation with jokes which really put me in a better mood. I was pretty upset and he walked me through each step and troubleshooted with me. Come to find out, the outlet I was using was an old outlet, and thus was having difficulty! I would have never found that out on my own, but Alex called out the problem within minutes. He told me to unplug the device and try an outlet in another room to record the message. It ended up working perfectly! I was like shocked! I'm still shocked at how the customer service is for this device.He also did more than help me with the problem. He asked if I still had the foam piece under the tray in. And I did, because you know, I'm obviously not good at technology. He told me to remove the foam piece because it could damage the trays and ultimate cause the machine to stop working. He stayed on the phone with me after the problem was fixed and gave me insight on how to prevent further problems. He went that extra step to make sure that the product last for me for a long time.In regards to my pet, Peter. He loves it. He gets fussy, super fussy, but I believe this will calm him down. The one thing he looses it over is not having food in his bowl. My little prince will finally be able to calm down and give me peace.In conclusion, the price compared to the long lasting customer service and your pets overall well being; totally worth it. In fact, you're getting more than what you're paying for. I paid 250, so the fact that it's 200 now is awesome! Totally worth it both ways! Buy it!
