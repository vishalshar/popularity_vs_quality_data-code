GREAT product! It's so good, it makes you wonder why these big undershirt manufacturers never ever thought about fixing the negative aspects of the standard old undershirt. When you first receive the undershirt, put it on but don't look at yourself in the mirror and judge the product. It's really different from what we're all used to seeing when it comes to an undershirt. Instead, put it on, put on your favorite polo shirt, and then look in the mirror. The Invisible Undershirt is awesome. And it's not just how much better it looks and will make your polo shirt look - it's really comfortable. Buy one and you'll be convinced too.
