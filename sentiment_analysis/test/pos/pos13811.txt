Be careful with this product. You are bringing a food source for contaminants into your home, so this product should not be purchased without a lotta research done beforehand on myco indicators and pathogens.I noticed many yellow blotches forming on the lower end of my block, what I believe to be Aspergillus flavus, a deadly mold if inhaled in large quantities. I went ahead and tossed it out due to these blotches taking over the bottom of the block. I know what mycelium piss looks like, and, those were not.I followed the instructions and read the advice on their website... Yet nature still beat nature in my case. Be careful "undoing food" with this grow kit because it may end up undoing you if you are not careful.I wish it had worked. A wonderful kit that needs a little bit of refinement, and warnings.
