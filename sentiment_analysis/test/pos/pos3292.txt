I have a 512GB flash drive in my MacBook Pro and have hovered between 425GB and FULL for over a year.  I bought this 128GB expansion card and love it.  It took just a minute to setup and then my hard drive icon turned gold, which is pleasing to the eyes, of course.  I'm now able to get more work done because I can store more GoPro video files on my laptop.
