It's working as advertised. Little bit bulky but nicely built.On my first power-up it downloaded software update. After that it wasgoing back & forth when trying to register & top-up.Topping-up should be faster & straight forward.I will recommend it to my travelling friends.Additional notes:After using this unit for few weeks now I can say that it works very nicely wherever you might go.It is super fast without glitches. Had no problems with connections.Battery lasts forever.I just love it!
