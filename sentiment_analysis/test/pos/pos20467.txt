I just love this case. I've had it for 6 months and it has not worn one bit. It protects my phone and I can take 3 cards easy w/ me in the back but super accessible. Other wallet cases I've tried make it challenging to slide something to get the cards... This is just simple and steady. I also love the back fabric feel... It actually feels nice in your hand and gives a nice amount of support to not slip. Only case I carry now.
