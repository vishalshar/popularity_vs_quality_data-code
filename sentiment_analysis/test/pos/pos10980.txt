The only way to get a urine sample from a cat who is an absolute sweetheart until examined by a vet when she turns into a HELL KITTEN and attempts to destroy anyone within her reach, including her owner, thus preventing the "sterile sample" method (ie. a syringe/needle extraction directly from the bladder).It works great and even comes with a plastic "pipette" and a plastic capped vial. These allow you to quickly and easily obtain a urine sample and deposit it into a sealed container which prevents further contamination that leads to false positives on the subsequent urinalysis.And one of the best features is that if skillfully used, you won't get ANY cat pee on you/r hands! And we all know how nasty cat pee is, right? ;-)
