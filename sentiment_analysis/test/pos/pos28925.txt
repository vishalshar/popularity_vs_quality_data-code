I've owned the case for well over a month with no big problems in performance and protection. But, after only a couple weeks, the elastic covering over the magnet did bubble up on both pieces (see photos). However, this hasn't hindered the performance of the magnet or the protection in any way, just made it a little tougher to handle. I wish this wouldn't have occurred, but the case has still protected my phone and the magnet works, so I am still very happy with the case.
