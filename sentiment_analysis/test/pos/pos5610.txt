Easy to install with great customer support. Have a 31 year old Raynor model garage door system. First attempt failed. E-mailed and got a response within 15 minutes.  Multiple technical support personnel researched my model and gave several iterations of wiring hook-ups and troubleshooting. Many thanks to their patience and excellent support.  Photo included for my future ref/installation of second unit.
