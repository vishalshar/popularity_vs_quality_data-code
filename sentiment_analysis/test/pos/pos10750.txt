I would have given this 5 stars if it had come with speaker wires longer than about 12 inches each. Do they think I want to place the speakers immediately to the left and right of the main unit? And by "immediately" I mean touching the unit because that's how far I can put them (just like in the photo). I had to go out and find a roll of speaker wire to buy (not easy to do these days) in order to move the speakers far enough apart to get an actual stereo effect.
