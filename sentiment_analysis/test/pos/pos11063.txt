Love this. Very easy to put together and operate. I've been using this with my iPhone 6s+, and now my iPhone 7. Lens quality is superb... and the rig (which isn't too heavy) helps to stabilize the camera, resulting in a much more professional, cinematic feel. Feels great in hands, and very easy to transport.Hint: although video quality and stability is superb, you must use an external microphone (be sure to find a TRRS compatible mic system -- i.e. those with a 3 stripe 3.5mm plug). Relying on the built-in iPhone microphone is a bad idea because the rig not only represents acoustic obstacles, but also picks up nearly all contact sounds. The pics I uploaded show the unit mounted with a mini shotgun mic I bought here on Amazon.
