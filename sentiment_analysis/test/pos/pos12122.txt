I ordered the waterproof mattress protector because of a loved one with Alzheimer's.  I was expecting something serviceable and was pleasantly surprised to receive a lovely mattress pad that not only did what I needed but was well made and very comfortable.  We have California King bed.  When I ordered I may have missed an option for California King pad, so when I saw the options listed on the package, I was afraid the pad would not fit our bed--but it did!  That was a happy bit of good luck--or good design on the manufacturer's part.  Thanks much for the good product--just what we needed!
