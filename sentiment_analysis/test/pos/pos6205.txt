Originally bought a bag when they were selling them at Costco. Price was $8 a bag. I loved them and went back to buy 1/2 dozen more, but they had been discontinued.  Found them at Amazon with this 2 for 1 deal. Incredible.They are absolutely delicious. Keeping a bag in the car allows me to avoid buying junk food when hungry between meals on the road. Great broken up in hot or cold cereal; added to  a trail mix. Every one I've offered some to loves them.  They taste better than candy. Very sweet. Nothing that tastes this good should be so healthy.Let's examine the price.  Assuming that one ounce of dried apples equals 7 ounces of raw apples, which I believe is a conservative estimate, you are getting the equivalent of 12.5 lbs of organic apples for $10, or $0.80 per lb. Unless you have a source of free apples, a lot of free time to process and inexpensive heat source, you can't beat this deal.
