* Pretty easy to set up. You will need to install the pebble app on your mobile as well as any other companion app need for each application.* Has lots of watch faces but a lot of them cost money... some have phishing pages so be careful.* Can go a week without recharge.* Very easy to read display.* Bought this watch as a replacement for a chest strap heart rate monitor for Endomondo. Sadly the pebble watch dosen't share HRM stats with the endomondo app. You will still have to wear a chest or arm strap for the fitness app. The pebble watch will display the heart rate from the separate hrm.* I wish you could add more vibration 'tunes'.* Uses a proprietary usb charger. Still nice magnetic clasp charger though.* Health graphs aren't as detailed as I like them to be but they will do.
