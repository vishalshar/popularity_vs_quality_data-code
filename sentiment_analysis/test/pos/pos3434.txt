I adopted my cat Smokey, 12 years ago as a Rescue Cat.  He had an incurable viral eye infection that never bothers him.  However the drainage from his eye goes into his sinuses making him vulnerable to Upper Respiratory Infections (URI's)He gets these URI's ALL THE TIME.  And when I take him to the vet, the vet puts him on antibiotics.  But they only work a week and his URI comes right back.  So the vet puts him on a stronger antibiotic that makes Smokey lose weight, and the URI comes right back one week later!!!!Rather than taking Smokey to the vet,I have managed his chronic URI's with humidifiers.  They have helped him a lot.  But my cat still sneezes BIG green buggers from his nose, and coughs.  The poor little guy has a day or so of severe congestion.  I then get him surrounded by a bunch of humidifiers.  But it is a daunting fight that has lasted for 12 years!!!!!  ugh!I just started smokey on these daily vitamins Pet Naturals Daily Best for Cats (45 count), by giving him 1/day.  The RDA is 2/day. But with ONLY 1/day, the IMPROVEMENT IS INCREDIBLE. He sneezes and coughs A LOT LESS!!!!!  And on the RARE occasion he does sneeze, rather than sneezing BIG green (green is a sign of bacterial infection) buggers, he sneezed very small little white (white meaning the infection is less) ones.And he has so much more energy.  He runs around like a maniac on these daily vitamins..Then after about 2 weeks on these, I added to his regimen "Organic Pet Superfood IMMUNITY Premium Supplement for Dogs and Cats".  It mixes easily in Smokey's wet food.  I have only given this IMMUNITY POWDER TO SMOKEY ONLY 3 TIMES, BUT NOW SMOKEY DOES NOT SNEEZE OR COUGH AT ALL!!!  HE IS COMPLETELY CURED!!!!  HE IS SO MUCH BETTER!  IT'S INCREDIBLE... AND HIS ENERGY LEVEL IS CRAZY ON THIS IMMUNITY POWDER.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE1) Pet Naturals Daily Best for Cats (45 count)2)  Organic Pet Superfood IMMUNITY Premium Supplement For Dogs and Cats I also give a daily vitamin to my other cat as it's just good for her.  She has no infections or problems.  But she won't eat wet food.  Only her dry food.  So I mix the IMMUNITY POWDER in 1/8 of a tspn of Organic Strawberry Preserves and make a thin paste.  Then I put it on her paw and she licks it off in order to clean herself.  But she ingests this IMMUNITY POWDER.  It's too funny!
