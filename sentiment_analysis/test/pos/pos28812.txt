I purchased this as a gift for my wife for Christmas, we followed the instructions EXACTLY and after 10 days, we just got a lot of white mold - no mushrooms.We contacted customer service (twice) since they state on the site that they guarantee their product.  After 2 days, no response.UPDATE:  1/15/12Last Tuesday January 11, the company finally contacted me and said they were committed to customer service, would replace it if it was dead and could I please send pictures.  So I sent pictures, and they told me it was still viable but just a "late bloomer" and to send pictures again on Tuesday, 1/17.  If the kit still didn't show any mushrooms, then they'd send me a new kit.Wouldn't you know it, yesterday morning the kit started showing significant signs of mushrooms after about 14 days, and today they're much bigger (and more of them).So, at this point, I would say it's a ok kit, but I just think they need to revise their marketing materials and change the "mushrooms in as little as 10 days" part.  I was VERY close to throwing it away - twice.Bottom line, be patient.  If you get this kit and you don't have any luck, email the company with pictures of your kit(feedback@backtotheroots.com). They probably won't get back to you the next day, but hopefully they will within a few days.
