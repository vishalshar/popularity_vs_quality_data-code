I bought my first one on indiegogo cause I liked the idea.  I bought the next one here on Amazon because I REALLY like it.  I'm of a certain age where I have a bit hanging over my belt, and with this belt there is no pinching.  Super easy to use, looks good, it's a real change to an item that's been basically unchanged for centuries.
