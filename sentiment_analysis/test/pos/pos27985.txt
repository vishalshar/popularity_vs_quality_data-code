I'm just starting to get involved with homekit automation and it anything but friendly. I have to load a different app for every brand of homekit device I have, none of the different brands talk to each other. The ihome Smart monitor works well and controls the ihome Smart plugs using the ihome app. I even set rules to turn on a light by motion detection and an electric heater using temperature using the ihome app. Unfortunately you can't set rules with Apple Home, all it will do is manually turn things on and off, but it will talk to other brands of equipment once you get them set up by using their native application.
