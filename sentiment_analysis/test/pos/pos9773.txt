The Mionix Mouse Glidex was my replacement option for my 2 year old Naos 5000. The shipping was fast, and the installation of the product took under 10 minutes. Just peel back the old feet like a sticker and stick the new ones where they were. Very smooth on surface, however the edges of the new feet are very sharp and have an abrasive tactile and audio feedback that is annoying at first. They new feet must be broken in over time I'm guessing, since they are exactly the same as the pre-installed ones.Great product, get it if your mouse is having unnecessary feedback from normal aging. Remember to break the feet in for a while before they'll perform as normal.
