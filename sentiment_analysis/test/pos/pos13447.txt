I love Skeeter snacks!  So excited that they're now on Amazon-- and love these Chocolate Chip minis. The only problem is it's REALLY hard to stop eating them.  Tasty and soft-baked kind of texture! They did get a bit crumbly at the bottom (probably due to shipping), but the crumbles were large enough to be enjoyed :)
