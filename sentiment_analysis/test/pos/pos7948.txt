This is my second time purchasing the Pink Lotus. Although last time the price was perfect 19.95 (just a few weeks ago), now it is $26.95, which still is not bad,however, that is why it's a 4 star.I don't like when a great value is pushed upon and the seller believes it to be reasonable.In any case: If you like tea, herbally type things with honey or sweet flavors to them, than this is definitely for you.It has a "Crisp & clean calm taste". Carbonation is perfect. I drank too many too fast last time and ran outI was going to buy 3 cases, but the price went up a bit much and decided to just buy the 1 case.
