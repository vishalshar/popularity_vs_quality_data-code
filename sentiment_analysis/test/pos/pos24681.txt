I have tried all sorts of other squirt on popcorn toppings and this is the best I have found.  Not overly greasy and some real butter flavor without any overtones of off flavors.  More expensive than most, particularly those that come in larger containers, but I ultimately ended up throwing those away - not much savings there.
