I was given this product as a Christmas present (after showing hubby the video and saying "I really want this please" lol). It was sent quickly and in good condition from Amazon.  The interior box is very sturdy and does a great job of protecting the contents.  I had a pretty good idea I was getting it for Christmas so I went ahead and downloaded the app.  The app is free and very easy to install/setup.  After ripping off the wrapping I opened the box to take a look at my new toy.  Everything is secured very well so that nothing can come loose and get thrown around the box. You get 2 cars with cases, a charger that will charge 3 cars, a track, a sticky strip for cleaning the wheels and instructions. The cars are stored in a clear topped plastic case which is also where they are placed when charging (plug goes into the back of the case). I plugged the cars in and let them charge, about 10 minutes or so. Enough time to create my user profile on my phone, vacuum the carpet (we have a dog so hair needed to be at a minimum) and roll out the track. It's pretty long so make sure you have enough space. The track also comes with a thick sheet of paper on top so when you roll the track up it doesn't stick to itself.  Keep that roll of paper off the floor when you're racing if possible so as not to get fuzzies on it.  With the track set up we moved onto the tutorial.  Only one racer at a time can go through the tutorial so you'll need to take turns going through it.  The tutorial will first run the cars on the track to show you what they can do. Then it will hand the controls over to you and walk you through speed control, lane shifting, shooting (yes! you finally get those guns on your car you've always wanted) and using the tractor beam (VERY useful to pull the lead car closer for shooting or to pull him back so you can pass him on the final lap). Having both set up profiles and gone through the tutorial, we decided to practice together. My daughter picked her car, I picked mine and we started racing. You don't have to worry about driving off the track because the cars will not leave the track unless hit very hard and that's only happened 1 or 2 times. Steering is just a matter of tilting your device to right or left. To accelerate you use your left thumb to push the slider on the device all the way to the top.  I like to keep my thumb on the speed slider then as the other car gets closer, slow down, let them pass and shoot them from behind. Then slam on the gas and take off again lol.  If you're wondering if this is as fun as a single player I definitely think it is. I spent the day racing against the AI (the AI can control any cars you're not playing with) and fine tuning my skills. I selected an AI slightly more advanced than me for a good challenge and it kicked my butt several times. But I also learned some tricks from the AI.  With wins or losses you earn points to use in the "garage" to upgrade your car i.e. faster, better shields, shooting farther. I've been trading out cars as well to make sure both cars are getting those upgrades.  My 9 y.o. played with me and did much better than I thought she would starting out. I was trying to tell her how to not make such sudden changes in steering when I realized that she had shot and disabled my car :/  No more help for her.  I've always loved race cars and tracks so this was a no-brainer gift for me and I love it.  I took off a star on the review because you can only race for about 20-30 minutes before they need to be charged again. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you decide to get this game. Just make sure you check the devices list so you know yours will work.  Can't wait to get another car so that sweet hubby who listens so well can race too lol
