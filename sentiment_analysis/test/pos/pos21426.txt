Excellent game. I am playing it with my 11, 10, 8 and 6 year old kids. Easy to pick up - give the instructions a couple of reads first and start off with the basic level one game. There is an acre of game play once you start adding the additional rules above the basic level. The game cards are well made - like a good quality deck of ordinary cards. Phew!! I bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas and it could have been a disaster.
