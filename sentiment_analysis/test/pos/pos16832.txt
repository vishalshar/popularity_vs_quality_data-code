Voke is a great product.  Getting a boost is hard if you want to get something quick and avoid horrible energy drinks.  The tins are small and easy to throw in your work bag or whatever.  The taste is a little weird the first time but now I like it.  It gives you a nice even keeled boost of energy-no jitters.  I use it on a regular basis so it is also great in terms of cost.  One dollar per tab which is bad compared to many other products.  Great when I don't have time to make any tea.
