These cars and the whole anki over drive set up is an ingenious way of having family fun and engaging with one other. The track piece can be expanded to unlimited vision of creativity. Im 38 year old male and now I feel like I'm a kid again racing the new technology toys we have today. Also the lanch kit is awesome if if is set up correctly I have no complaints except for add more cars and can't wait for the 180Â° track piece.
