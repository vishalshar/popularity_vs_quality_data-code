This seems to work amazingly well and is quite durable.  We use in an unorthodox manner:  In a camper.  For a year, we have gone bumping down the road and, to our surprise, it continues to work perfectly.  Saves us an inordinate amount of effort determining when to change the tank.  Hint:  Since it is outside in the wind blast of highway travel, the meter is enclosed in a plastic bag and the connection point of the meter to the base is sealed with non-hardening caulking putty.
