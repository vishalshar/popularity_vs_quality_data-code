I've had eRazors, 2nd gen "hoverboards" (with batteries that didn't explode), and converted my old Trek 900 into an e-Bike.  Kept looking at making a Brompton e-bike (nycewheels kit) because commuting works with a full-size bike when you have a college campus around, and don't get on or off multiple buses, trains, etc.  But it still took precious minutes to fold, unfold, re-do all the quick release parts.  Saw this on a side bard ad on our local transportation site (metro.net) and figured why not click through (for once... I hate doing that to ads.)  Site looked interesting, and I signed up for the newsletter.  Got an e-mail from Alejandro the next day asking if I had any questions to give him a call.I'm only a few miles away by light rail to the place, so I asked if I could see one in-person.  He said, "Sure! If you're interested, I can show you the factory and stuff, too while you're here."  He provided not only the tour of the offices and factory, but he also arranged a 30 minute demo ride around Pasadena with 3 different models, to give me an idea of what they're about.  Sold.  But since I got to look all around the factory and such, instead of just getting one of the pre-built standard models, I asked if I could sort of piece together the features I wanted (because I really don't use cup-holders or smartphone mounts) and he produced his iPad and started working up a custom-build all for the same price, including a cool color that hadn't made it to the website yet.  Decided I did want the newer sport-tuned controller, because I'm at 200# (if you're lighter, you won't notice the difference, but with me, I could tell between the 2 especially on the hill-cliimb part of the demo ride (not recommended past about a 5% grade - little wheels make for compactness, but also less friction to put a bunch of torque on the pavement.) I ride this in LA - home of the most ridiculously pot-holed streets in the country.  Thus, I switched out the standard seat for one with more springs to absorb the bounces better Sunlite Cloud-9 Bicycle Suspension Cruiser Saddle, Cruiser Gel, Tri-color Black.  Pros - super-fast to fold, a pleasure to ride (though, as cautioned, putting your feet on the front pegs only works when riding straight - your feet don't pivot like a wheel, and it would be like trying to rest your feet on the front wheel axel of any bike - not for the faint-hearted unless you're planning to do somersault tricks). Battery capacity is pretty good (I'll only get about 10 miles per charge if I'm always running up and down the 5% grade underpass, which as with most things, chews up the most power.)  On flats, it easily goes the 15-20 miles depending on how much full-throttle you peg on the journey. Much better design than a rear-drive motor (which gets squirrelly really fast on small wheels.) Super-durable construction, and very modular design - the company is extremely millennial: CNC machining, 3D printing custom parts, they constantly buy the competition and figure out what's good and bad about them and incorporate the changes, good vision for industrial and business use. Charges back up in 4 hours max. from completely (almost) dead - do not 100% drain any Li-Po battery - this one has circuits to prevent that, but doing that repeatedly will kill ability to recharge it in the future.  It's also pretty weather-resistant - as long as you don't dump it in a lake, or try cruising on the sand at the seashore, rain will bother you (and your nerves about slipping) more than the Urb-E.  But the disc brake works wet or dry better than any other (just like a mountain bike brake.)  The handlebar is adjustable for reach by about 3-inches depending on the pivot hole you choose (straight up/down is discouraged because it makes ti feel really wobbly - but it stores flat that way.) And, there's that USB charger port (like having a ridiculously large surplus battery for your phone or whatever.) I plugged my headlight into it Super Bright USB Rechargeable Bike Light - Blitzu Gator 320 POWERFUL Bicycle Headlight - TAIL LIGHT INCLUDED. 320 Lumens LED Front Light. Waterproof, Easy Installation for Cycling Safety Flashlight  Cons - at 35 lbs. my mom wouldn't have been hauling this up stairs (elevators are no big deal, you fold it and stand atop the thing - takes zero footprint compared to yourself.) Note that 80% of this weight is the battery - so if technology gets better, this will get lighter fast. I agree the basket needs work - works as a shopping basket while you're rolling this thing around your store - though the seat eats up some of the capacity, but for the ride home, only your heels will be on the back pegs, so you feel a little insecure compared to without the basket and just backpacking the load.  Front handlebar baskets aren't recommended due to the lightness of the front steering.  I'm thinking a low-mounted toolbag might work.  Battery's too big to use on TSA flights - have to ship it separately for airline travel (360W) Gets me back home when taking the car in for service. Gets me to/from the bus and train stations and around downtown with something easier to carry than a full-bike. Get the front-stand accessory to make it stand upright without having to hold it (the side stand leans into a triangle like a bike.) You just recognize really good engineering when you feel it, and this one is minimalist and over-designed for ruggedness all at once.
