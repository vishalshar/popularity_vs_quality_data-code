I have been playing with this camera just for a few days , but really like it so far. Was using it to watch my kids inside the rooms and in a hallway.Some pros:- nice design and easy to mount- night/day vision- wide viewing angle and motion detection- supports apple and android apps- decent wi-fi connectionIf you're looking for a high quality, plug and play security solution this could be the one.
