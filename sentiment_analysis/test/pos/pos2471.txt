Well, what can you say about a game that makes everyone, from the youngest to the oldest, pretty much look ridiculous? You can say it's FUN, that's what.  Played this with our whole family (ages 5 to 65) over Christmas and, like most other reviewers, laughed until we cried.  Be prepared for a bit of mouth soreness (if you leave it in too long) and I'd suggest having tissues on hand for those who get REALLY tough phrases but bravely forge ahead with their hilarious attempts to be understood, causing more than a bit of drooling.  Also, make sure those teeth are scrubbed and shiny clean because everyone is going to see EVERYTHING! :)But seriously...wait, that's not actually much of an appropriate word for this game!  Point is, it's fun.  Play it with people you love - or at least like a lot, and you'll have a great time.  Guaranteed.
