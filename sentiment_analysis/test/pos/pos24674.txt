I was so disappointed that this wonderful tasting, natural oil was not available for awhile.  I have used it for a long time and it is a great substitute for butter.  Now, it is back in a bigger bottle and Amazon has the most reasonable price.  I'm a bit of a popcorn "nut" and this makes it even better.  It has a rich, buttery taste.
