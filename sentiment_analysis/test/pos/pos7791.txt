I love SOMA carafes. My one before was plastic though, yucky. This one is smaller but looks way nicer( can use at table without the lid for aesthetic appeal lol. I use mine lidless for laziness as the company I do have don't care. ) and no bpa or other chemicals. This is one I'd the best "table filters" you can get. If you don't use it constantly for cooling and baking with, the filter will last a good time too.
