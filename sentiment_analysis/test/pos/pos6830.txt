After using the watch for a month I am convinced that most people leaving negative reviews had no idea what they were buying. For the features and price point this watch offers it is a great alternative to other smart watches on the market that offer useless apps with battery lasting maybe a couple of days. The watch works great and (after recent app updates) works as advertised.
