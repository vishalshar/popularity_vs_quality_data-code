It charges very well and I've charged my IPhone 6S about 4 times fully before having to recharge the battery pack and it's easy to throw into my backpack when traveling. I love the bright green color - if it's exposed to bright light or sunlight it does glow in the dark which is helpful as the day goes one and you need to locate it in a dark bag.  I only give it 4 stars though because the top flap that makes it water resistant doesn't always stay closed. Due to that the plug in ports are exposed so don't have it near your water bottle!
