The BEST part, this is a product our cat actually enjoys and looks forward to playing with us in our absence. He wants to play laser games more than we have time (since we are at work), so he sits and stares and HOPES one of us will sign on.It's great to have a way to interact with him during the day and on trips.  Plus it allows us to look inside our house and gives us the privacy that we may pick and choose who may play with him and look in the house.Easy and fast to install.  I did it myself.  IF you experience any difficulty in installing (more than 5 mins) CALL THEM.  The support staff has been excellent with my questions and all help they can give.
