This item is great. I solely purchased MYNT due to having a Bluetooth camera clicker. Everything else was a plus one. I love how you are able to configure the settings on a app to your liking. I usually forget my phone and the smart tracker emits a small ring to alert you, that you have gone a distance forgetting it. I purchased 2 for keys car keys. My main one and my spare. The look to it is very modern and simple which is why it caught my eye the most. The packaging comes with all the instructions you need as far as set up. Once in the app you can actually customize photo icons for each MYNT added. At the home page, when you click on the center icon (Your phone) and gray ring flows outward and starts to locate your closet trackers. This has became a great addition to my lifestyle considering I'm a pretty forgetful person.Disclaimer: I was offered a water proof sleeve for my honest review. But certainly does not impact my opinion on this product at all.
