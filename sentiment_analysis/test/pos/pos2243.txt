I'd like to take a moment to share my experience with this treasure, that is my leaf. After spending years caring for everyone else, not taking care of myself and feeling rather wretched that I had allowed myself to tip the scales at an alarming 296 lbs, I stumbled upon an add for the leaf on Facebook. "Make yourself a priority" is what stuck in my brain. Mother of two young children, recently widowed, and have a small farm...I forgot to take care of ME. The message and the natural beauty and the simple benefits this little treasure has provided to MY DAILY LIVING has been of immense value to me. Today I'm at 247 lbs...I've done the work bUT this leaf has held me to a positive accountability that I've never had the pleasure of experiencing before. My next goal is 235 lbs. With the my desire to see the bars climb every day, to try the myriad of ways it offers to burn calories, I'm certain I'll be there very soon and then strive for the next goals to follow. If your thinking about this leaf, I hope you consider the possibilities within yourself by using its guidance to make yourself a priority every single day. Many blessings to each of you!
