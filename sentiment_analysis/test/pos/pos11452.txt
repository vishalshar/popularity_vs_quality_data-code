Found this system very easy to use and the data  collected is presented in helpful ways. I have had very few problems with incorrectly recorded shots - the system has missed a couple of shots I took with very awkward lies that caused me to use a shortened swing, but otherwise has been pretty much flawless. Some other folks have complained about the size of the sensors - I found they made no difference at all in actual use. The only reason that I didn't rate 5 stars is that the web dashboard still needs some work - there are some functions that can only be performed on the phone app at present.
