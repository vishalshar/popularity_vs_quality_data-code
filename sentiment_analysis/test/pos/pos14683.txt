I would like my microwave to last 10 years.  Since I just bought this one, I can't make any comments on its longevity.  It seems to work just fine and the size is good for someone who just wants to reheat a meal on a dinner plate.  The design is simple and attractive.  However I was surprised that the sides are black metal and not stainless steel.
