The phone is great. Great performance, and feels very well built. I was afraid the sync to Nextbit own cloud storage could cause issues, or sluggishness, but not at all. The default setting for the Nextbit cloud backup is to sync only on wifi. The idea of the 100GB of free cloud storage is great, but it does only support storing pictures and apps, which are both already backed up/synced by my google account. One advantage compared to unlimited photo storage in google photos is that the Nextbit sync backs up the photos in the original resolution, but it would be much more useful if the 100GB could be used to sync or store any file format (dropbox or google drive like), or at least video files. Until that happens I wish the Robin supported the MicroSD card I had in my old phone. Camera is good, Stereo speakers very good. The main reason I bought it was that it seems to support evey possible band and frequency in the world. Sofar I have activated it on metropcs, and used it with a freedompop global data only SIM card (really a ThreeUK SIM), in both cases it gets a great and steady signal either LTE or H. Much better than the previous phones (Nexus 4 and LG G2). Battery life: good sofar, no problem lasting through the day. During the initial setup it updated to Android 6.0.1
