Works perfectly!  Bought a second one as the first was awesome!  Easy set up for anyone with a little tech knowledge.  Connects to wifi easily and stays connected.  Updated firmware easily and provides online usage instructions.  I love the ability to schedule my outdoor lighting and the ability to turn front lights on from afar via my iPhone 6.  I would definitely buy again at even 2 x the price!  I have used for 8 months before writing this review.
