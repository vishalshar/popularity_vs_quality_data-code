We have 3 of these lights. The idea of them is awesome and overall it does work for us. We really wish there was a way to adjust how far out the cameras could detect motion. During the summer, the lights are a challenge, because you attract so many bugs and they set off the camera almost every night. That being said, they look great, install easy and offer so much piece of mind for us. Talking with people can be hard, since they can hear me, but I can't hear them (unless I have a headset connected). Hopefully they will continue to update the firmware and offer a little more flexibility in the set up since not every entrance has the same angles to work with.With kids and pets that can set off the alarm, we didn't want to go with a traditional security set up. Also, we didn't want to pay high monthly bills being offered by surveillance companies.
