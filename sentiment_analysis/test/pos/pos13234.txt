I bought this clock to replace an iHome app connected clock because the iHome app only worked when the phone was plugged into the charging port, which made it awkward to use. The Beddi app works over Bluetooth so it's much easier to use. It also has cool ambient light feature and and a white light that will come on to simulate sunrise. I also like its dashboard feature that show weather and traffic. There is also a slot where your phone can sit. All in all it's a good product.
