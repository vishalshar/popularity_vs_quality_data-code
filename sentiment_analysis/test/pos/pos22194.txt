Im going to hold off on giving it the fifth star for now to see if this passes the test of time.  What I can say is that this is far and away the best keyring USB keychain cable I have had, and Ive had a lot.  It is flexible but sturdy, the fact that the USB plug is at an angle is clever and underrated, and it has worked with several devices fine.  Plus its light and its there when you need it.  It is pricey, but as someone wiser than I once said, buy the best and youll not be disappointed.Good to see Nomad took the suggestions and complaints on its first generation of product to heart and incorporated that into this round of products.  I get the impression theyll stand behind what they sell as well.
