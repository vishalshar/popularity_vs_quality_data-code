I've had this for several weeks and like it a lot despite a couple quirks.There's a really intuitive user interface on both the hardware and software, easy to upload and print most any 3D printing file. Unboxing experience is great and the crossbar style makes it kind of fun to watch the print bed move around (if a bit loud without the cover on).As is obvious from the price tag, this isn't a high end printer and is better suited for hobbyists or classrooms than for someone who really needs precision and complexity. You should be prepared for not every print to work and to have to give some things a couple tries, that's the fun in experimenting. There are certainly printers that have higher quality prints and lower fail rates, but they're also 4x the cost. I found the things I printed to be pretty high quality, and there's a way to adjust the quality of the print if you're willing to wait a bit longer for it to come out.There's a good online FAQ and series of video tutorials to sort out most questions, and they make their tech support a selling point. I did run into a minor issues (turned out I just needed to update the firmware) where I needed some help from support staff, but I found them to be helpful and responsive.All in all, it's a nice little machine and a neat entry into 3D printing. Most of my family members and friends have now received a necklace, vase, or something similar. I made a cool topographic map of the US for myself. Attaching a photo of a bobblehead dog that I made, the body is mostly hollow and the head and tail connection extend into the body so they both bobble.
