I spent a long time comparing various Bluetooth portable speakers and after reading multiple product reviews by electronics experts and customer reviews on Amazon, it came down to this speaker and the Ultimate Ears from Logitech, which are both in the same premium price range. This was a Christmas gift for my freshman daughter in college and I had several criteria the speaker had to meet. It had to be rugged and water-resistant, to allow it to be taken into the shower, to prevent it from dying if a drink was accidentally spilled on it, and to allow her to throw it into her backpack to take to a friend's room. It had to have great sound with good bass (no portable speaker will give great bass). And I wanted a speaker that is multi-directional so that it could be placed on a table in the middle of room and heard equally by all. The reviews I read gave a slight edge to Fugoo over UE for sound quality. My daughter had originally thought about the similarly sized Jambox, because one of her friends owns one. This speaker is more expensive than the Jambox, which by the way is not water-resistant. After opening her Christmas gift and eagerly hooking it up to her music player, she was thrilled with the speaker. She loves the teal accent and the look of the speaker. And best of all, she feels the sound quality is fantastic and better than the Jambox's. And not only is this speaker water-resistant, it's water-proof to 3 feet for 30 minutes. How can it get any better?
