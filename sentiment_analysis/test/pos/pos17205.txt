My three year old has had chronic constipation problems due to too much dairy. We tried everything and finally, I decided to try getting her on a regular fiber inclusive vitamin. After two weeks and no dietary changes, my daughter now poops daily and has absolutely no problem with holding it in or having it be tough. I know, TMI... but as a worried Mom- I was willing to try everything, and this was the only solution that actually worked.I can't recommend these vitamins highly enough... they are wonderful and my kid loves them too, so I guess it's a win win!
