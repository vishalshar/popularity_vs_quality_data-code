My 8-year old says: It's amazing because it can go anywhere except in water and puddles and it does amazing tricks. It can even do reverse drive, 360 degree spins, and jump off ramps! It's also meant for skate parks.Mom says: you can also download an app called Tickle and have kids actually write code to make the Ollie go, which adds a touch more challenge to the whole experience. ;)
