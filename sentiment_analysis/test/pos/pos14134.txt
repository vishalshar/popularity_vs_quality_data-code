The bottle is a nice size. The drinking nozzle leaks while taking a drink so I remove the top cap/lid to take a drink. With the top cap/lid removed and taking a drink, I noticed a sharp edge around the inside of the rim that should be rounded or removed during production.  Removing both lids makes it easy to clean.
