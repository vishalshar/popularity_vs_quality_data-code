Love it! I have worn it numerous times when I run, and have worn it out a time or two and gotten lots of compliments!! Slips a little on the hair from time to time (I have thick hair), but easily fixed! I am going to purchase more in the future. I want them in every color!! Shipped fast and delivered well before the expected date!!
