This phone gets 5 stars for value. When I ordered it in the end of 2016, it had 2014 flagship specs and only cost $170. So why didn't I didn't just get a 2014 flagship then? The answer is updates. Phones that are 2 years old generally don't any more updates which I would lose both security updates and new features from android.Pros:-Value (specs vs price)-Fingerprint scanner works well.-Screen is very nice and clear.-Software updates. The beta version Nougat is already available and a final version should be released soon.-Openness. The company encourages unlocking the bootloader and installing custom ROMs. They even have a section on their website forum devoted to this. Furthermore, this will NOT AFFECT THE WARRANTY. Feel free to play all you want.-The company. The company has been very engaged with it's customers. Very refreshing to see for a phone company.Cons-The camera is sub-par. While the color and white balance are OK, and the pics are fine for social media, when you zoom in they look pixelated and over processed. On the plus side, it does support Camera2 API so you can download other camera apps with advanced features.-No USB OTG. This means that you can't use USB peripherals such as thumb drives.-Limited bluetooth protocols. Things connected over bluetooth like car stereos have no access to your text messaging.Meh (matter of personal taste):-The stock launcher. It doesn't have an app drawer and widgets aren't able to be placed on the wallpaper. You need to pinch the screen to access widgets. This is not a big deal as there are many 3rd party launchers out there.-Cloud storage. Personally I don't use this feature as I like to retain control of as much of my data as possible (yes I know Google and others already own me...). I would have preferred and SD card slot.Bottom line:If you don't need a great camera but want a solid phone for an affordable price this is for you.
