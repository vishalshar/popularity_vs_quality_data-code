All my friends want one of these now that they've seen how mine works. Great little device. Let's you program different vibrations for calls, texts and alarms. Connects easily, is easy to hide under clothing. I never have to turn the ringer on my phone on anymore, so I never have to be concerned about disturbing anyone. It runs on a long lasting battery, which is easy and cheap to replace every few months. Very durable, tough little device that has withstood several drops onto hard floors without a scratch.
