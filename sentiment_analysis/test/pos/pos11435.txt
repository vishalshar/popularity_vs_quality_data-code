I have been using a Yuneec for over a year. I decided to switch to the Autel at the advice of a professional drone pilot.  It is an outstanding drone. The battery system is much more reliable than the Yuneec. It has safety mechanisms built in. For those of you who are unfamiliar with drones and buy the Autel, I recommend that you go slow and possibly get some mentoring from someone who has flown drones.
