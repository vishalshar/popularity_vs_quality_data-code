A lot of fun! Once you get the hang of steering, it is quite agile, and fast! It has a good range. (40 yds Max). The different tires come in handy.Ollie does stop everyone who sees it, and their eyes open in childlike wonder. Ollie has a remarkably fun personality for a robot. Much more fun than BB-8. Truly the most fun I've ever had with a remote control toy.
