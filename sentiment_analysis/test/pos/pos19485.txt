Really great case!  Not too heavy, not too bulky, and great styling.  I think it will protect the phone just fine.  The case is also fairly light, and the wrap-around grip feature really keeps the phone from slipping out of your hand, also makes it easier to hold and operate the phone with the same hand (one-handed).  The case cost more than I would typically pay for a phone case, but I think this product is worth the money.  Haven't used the fabric band yet for credit cards, but I'm sure I will.  I tried it and it holds cards securely.  One small flaw is that the opening for the earphone jack is cut a little too small, so the earphones don't go in all the way without using a bit of force.  But I think over time this problem will go away with repeated plugging in of the earphones.  I would recommend this case to anyone who wants something unique but fairly sturdy and functional.
