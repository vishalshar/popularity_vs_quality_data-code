Love these bags! It really does keep cheese fresher much longer than they would with the original plastic wrap they come in and, since I buy aged, unpasteurized cheese ($$$), it's worth it. They hold their shape and condition after being taken in and out of the fridge. I sent some to my son, the chef, but his kids go through cheese like chain saws, so may have been a wasted effort.
