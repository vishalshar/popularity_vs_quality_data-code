These are awesome. Turned my tennis shoes into " pull ons". I can't say slip ons because I have put these up to the top lace opening. I have to pull them on. They stay tight just as if they were tied. You cannot tell the difference. I will try taking the top one out and see if they slip on easier. I will report back after wearing them awhile.
