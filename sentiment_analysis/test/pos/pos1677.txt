I've been on low carb diets of and on for many years.  One of the hardest things for me to adjust to was not being able to replicate my morning ice coffees as all the traditional sugar substitutes left me with that chemical X aftertaste.  I continued to try different alternatives like stevia and monk fruit but still I couldn't get the sweetness without a funny taste.  This stuff hits the nail on the head as not only does it have the right sugar taste without any funky aftertaste, but it has the texture of real sugar so it replicates my ice coffee experience perfectly.
