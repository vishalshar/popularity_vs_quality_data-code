I've used this on only one item -- to repair a small leak in a hard-shell kayak. It worked for me, also worked for a kayak-owning friend who used it for the same purpose. Used the directions to roll this out like modeling clay, and then applied it on both the inside and outside of the boat where the leak occurred. Last time I checked, the Sugru Web site didn't include kayak repair in the intended uses, but it works there, too. Seems like a small amount of product for the money, but it's tough to argue with such positive results.
