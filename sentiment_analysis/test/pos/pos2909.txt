My 8-year old was able to assemble this kit with minimal assistance - she had the components put together and working before the box was built.  This kit has been a big hit and a wonderful learning resource in our house (8 and 6 year old girls) for the last few weeks.  The only negative aspect was that there is no USB to AC adaptor included to recharge the unit (not a huge problem, as we have a place to plug it in).  Access to extra missions online is a plus, as well.  We have already sung the praises of this computer kit to our friends.
