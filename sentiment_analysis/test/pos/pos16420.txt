Nothing can beat this easy to use, portable projector.  I was very excited when I found out about the RIF6, that I had to buy it the very same day.  When I received the package I had to test it right away and have not stopped using it since.  This product has so much offer.  It comes with everything you need, including a large assortment of cables for many different devices, a double usb wall adapter for charging, and even a tripod.  I personally am using this product to connect to my laptop computer, which has a convenient hdmi port.  The RIF6 came with the adapter I needed to connect my laptop directly to the RIF6, so I do not need multiple converters and extra cables when on the go.It's great for anything including movies, presentations, and even just browsing the internet.  I can not believe how clear the picture is and how easy it is to use.  Even adjusting the focus of the lens is so simple compared to other projectors I've used.  It takes seconds to adjust the focus with a rotating switch and the picture is crystal clear.  In the RIF6, there IS A SPEAKER.  It was shocking to me that all these great features fit in such a small cube.The RIF6 came with an awesome tripod, that took a few seconds to put together.  It is flexible and can be set up at any angle you would need in any setting.  I personally been using it in a home theater, where I use to have a mounted stationary JVC projector, and the Cube is way better.  It boots up in less than half the time of my old JVC and the picture is amazing in the dark setting.  I've also used the Cube in the light, where it is not as good as being in complete darkness but it holds up just like any other projector.Overall, the RIF6 Cube is one of the best projectors out on the market.  It has so many amazing features and the fact that it is portable and has an internal battery is just perfect.  I could not ask for anything more from this product and at this price, hands down the best deal ever.  Thanks to the RIF6 team for making such an incredible product!
