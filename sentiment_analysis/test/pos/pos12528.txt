The Turtle Shell 2.0 sounds great. Has strong base and clear treble.Also, the company has good customer support. I had trouble pairing with the device via bluetooth, so I emailed them, and they gave me the phone number of a technician who talked me through how to do it. Turned out the problem was on my end, the device was working fine.
