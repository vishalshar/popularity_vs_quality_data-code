This a great healthy snack that actually tastes great as well. They are essentially dried organic apples with a touch of cinnamon. My kids love them.  I like the smaller bags, as the bigger bags can result in the apples getting soft  if you leave them open for a while. Great way to sneak some fruit into the family's diet.
