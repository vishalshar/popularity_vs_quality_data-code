There are many case choices out there but I knew my 3 year old would benefit from the handle on this case. The case fit perfect and easily as expected. It seems to be pretty durable but we have not yet tested it's protection properties against dropping it, thankfully. We have yet to find any cons and my 5 year old now wants one instead of his otter box case because of the cool handle.I would recommend this case to any parent!
