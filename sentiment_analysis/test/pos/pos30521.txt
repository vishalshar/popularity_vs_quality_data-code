UPDATE:  We have had the Roost for 7 months now.  We have only had one brief time it became unconnected and that turned out to be our issue with too many items connected to our wifi.  We moved things around and the Roost went back to working properly.  I think the cost is very reasonable for piece of mind.For the gadget you hope you never have to find out if it works or not... I can tell you that it does.  Within just a few weeks of installing this my phone went off at work and told me that my smoke detectors were going off at home.  Where I knew my 17 year old daughter was home alone.  My first reaction was panic... I called her and she told me that she was fine she had just burned some bread.  I knew then that this simple purchase had the potential to save a life.  Where we live we do not have fire hydrants and we rely on volunteer fire fighters.  Every second counts!  Had my daughter been unconscious for some reason I would have been able to get rescue and fire to her.  I can see where this may also be very helpful to someone that has rental property.  I would want to know if the alarms are set off.  We have not had any false alarms.  This was easy to set up and install.
