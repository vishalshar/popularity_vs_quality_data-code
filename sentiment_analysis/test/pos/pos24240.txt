I got these for my son's hockey practice and for spin class and cycling. The nozzle is excellent. It delivers a high-volume stream of liquid in short bursts with every squeeze, even through a hockey facemask. When we mix Gatorade in it, I like being able to take the whole bottle apart and run it through the dishwasher rather than trying to scrub out the bottom of the bottle with a brush. It's large enough (22 oz), but not so large that it's difficult to hold in one hand on a bike.The only complaint I have is that the seal in the bottom isn't perfect. It leaks a bit when you squeeze it, although outside on a bike or inside on the ice it's not that big of a deal, really.
