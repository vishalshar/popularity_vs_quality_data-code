Very bright green. It almost glows in the daylight. I like using this filament so far. Prints are clean and strong.  I purchased 3 other colors from AIO to try as well. I do not like the spool very much as the indent on it does not allow it to fit properly on my Prusa MK2 spool holder. I had to print up an extra tube extension for my spool holder for it to work properly.
