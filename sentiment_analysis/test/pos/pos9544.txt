The Mionix Castor gaming mouse: Mionix have really focused in on their build quality as I believe their main goal is "craftsmanship" which they have most definitely succeeded with this due to build quality, plastics/rubbers used along with a multi- dipped rubber soft touch along the mouse itself. while Mionix have boasted award winning right handed ergonomics, I personally think that the right side "ergonomic" part of this mouse is on the more, unsafe side of shaping, the ring and pinky finger groves along with a wide top-right leading edge of this mouse can make it uncomfortable or awkward to hold (this being said this is to my hand preferences), this could easily be fixed by making a more smooth right side and shaving off the leading edge. The Mionix castor honestly uses a flawless sensor with decent buttons, with the Pixart 3310 and Omeron f7n/ttc red swtiches this mouse is truly a work of art. The left and right mouse buttons feel nice crisp to press, the middle mouse button is medium strength to press, and the wheel height is on the low side of placement while the scrolling is like a smooth/soft subtle bump which I personally prefer a bit more tactile feedback similar to the Logoitech G502. all around this mouse is a very well rounded mouse, probably the best build quality I have ever had in any mice that I have tested with a great sensor, I would easily recommend this mouse. good job Mionix!
