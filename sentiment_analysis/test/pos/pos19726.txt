Having a 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse the conventional suction cup and sticky adhesive phone mounts weren't a possibility. The dash in my car isn't a material that works with either of those, and the windshield(being a small coupe and all) was much too far away to use. Then i found this, and since my six disk changer is broken this is a perfect match for me. I have an iphone 6 plus and the mount is able to support this giant heavy phone very well. It's a little bit shaky at times on bad roads mostly but it seems to be strong enough that it will not fall out of the cd slot; and that only seems to happen when i turn the phone sideways. If you want a phone mount and need something a little different than the typical ones that are out there, this is your product. On a side note this also includes extra pads in case you have a smaller phone, so all phones big and small will work with this mount.
