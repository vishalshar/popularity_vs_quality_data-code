I bought these to make cold packs to mitigate pain from migraines. I was using regular gel packs but this works much better. They are colder and stay cold much longer. It is just salt water. Takes a little experimenting to find the ratio of salt to water that will not freeze solid when you put it in the freezer and to get the right amount of solution that the bag is comfortable to lie on. I tried using regular Ziploc bags, but even doubled they leaked badly. I was looking for a bag that is sturdy enough to lie on and leakproof. This is it! It is perfect. They also work well as travel bags for cosmetics and such.
