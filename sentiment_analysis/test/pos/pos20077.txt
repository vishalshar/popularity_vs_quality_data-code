So, I was torn in writing this review.  Let me explain a bit on why I struggled..The biggest 'issue' I have with this micro-drone is the run time.  I knew the short run time before I purchased it.  It is actually very cool to play with if you are new to flying drones which makes me sad.  But, I shouldn't drop stars due to it actually running the specified time that was described.I actually initiated several flips different ways, and it hovered on it's own pretty good without much interaction from the controller.  This is a great entry-level drone to get a taste of how a larger drone will behave.During my flights I have had with it, it has had several 'crashes' with items that got in the way (Fridge, couch, cabinet).  With that being said, it held up great!  I think part of it was due to my quick reaction in initiating the land button.  Granted I did run with the guard in place all of the time (Which really helps).  So far after 7 runs, the blades are still intact.  It does help that I have a large area to fly this indoors.If you are like myself, we rarely read the instructions when we get a new item.  We tear open the package up, and get the item out and set aside the instructions.  Don't!  Take a bit of time to read the instructions.  There is a calibration 'mode' that you can access which I did the first thing when I paired the controller/drone.  (IF you do need to replace the blades, read the instructions.  They have "A" and "B" blades that need to go in a certain orientation.)  ;)The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the guard.  The guard is necessary to protect the blades from being malformed and/or cracking when hitting an object.  The guard blocks the camera.  When I recorded video and/or took photos you see the vertical guard right in the middle.  You have to ask yourself this question.. Do you want good video with no obstructions in your video? If so, then remove the guard.  But, the blades are more susceptible to damage.  So, I have opted (for now) to leave the guard in place.I have an iPhone 7+ in an Otterbox case.  The phone case is too big to be held in the phone holder.  There has been talk about it holding the larger iPhone with the case removed, but I haven't removed my phone for testing.In order to stream the video and/or take pictures you need to pair the controller as well as your phone.  So, I opted to let my girlfriend hold the phone while I flew the drone around.  The video is good for being a mini-drone.  It's not close to 1080, or 4K, but it's adequate.  Remember, this is a stepping stone so you can get comfortable in a larger drone that costs a quite a bit more with better video.The controller responds very well.  I tried controlling the drone via my phone which is good, but I prefer the controller.  I don't have a VR headset, so I couldn't test that.I have read a few reviews that are low-rated.  It could be that they did get a 'duff' item, or maybe they didn't read the instructions fully...  I will leave that up to you to decide.
