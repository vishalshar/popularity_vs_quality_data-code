I love my Soma! It's really aesthetically pleasing and filters water really quickly. It is a little leaky if you fill it up too much, but I think that's mostly a personal problem. Soma will also send you your first replacement filter for free. I haven't had any issues with water taste...and I'm happier knowing that the filter is better for the environment than traditional ones.
