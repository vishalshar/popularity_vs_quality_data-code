Update: I upgraded to the iPhone 7, and the case fits it - mostly.  The iPhone 7 slides in to the case just fine, charges from the case just fine, and the case charges (and passthrough-charges) just fine.  The bigger/offset camera bulge compared to the iPhone 6/6s does make the top-right corner (as viewed from the front of the phone, top-left as viewed from the back) "bulge" a little bit.  This does prevent the "top cover" thin piece of plastic from attaching properly, so the top of the phone isn't protected.  And the camera lens doesn't line up with the gap in the case properly, so it's mostly unusable. (You can zoom in so that the zoomed-in part isn't blocked.). Lastly, the one complaint I had is negated - headphones don't fit the hole very well, but since the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack there, it doesn't matter!  (And the iPhone 7's supplied Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter works just fine with the case's relocated Lightning port.)While I wouldn't recommend this as a new purchase case for an iPhone 7, it holds up perfectly well for the 6/6s, and can be used with the 7 in a pinch.  I'm leaving my star rating the same.--- Original review ---I've had this about a week, and it is excellent so far.  As the name implies, it is EXTREMELY slim for a battery case, about the same thickness as my Incipit "wallet case" with no cards in it, or my Lifeproof Fre.  Unlike every other "power" case, it doesn't add noticeably to the height, being SHORTER in height than the Lifeproof case (which is NOT a power case!)It holds about a full phone battery's worth of charge - I let my iPhone 6S get to 5% battery, then turned on the case to charge, and it got to about 95% battery before the case stopped charging it.  (I was using it lightly during that time.)  The (unauthorized by Apple) use of Lightning, relocated to the top of the phone makes it very simple to charge.  I even prefer charging at the top of the phone for some uses (like at my desk where my charger cord comes from my computer in front of me.)The operation is very simple - hold the volume up button for about one second to see the current charge level (from "solid on" for full to "blinking three times" for nearly empty.)  Hold the volume up button for about three seconds to turn charging on or off.  (And it passthrough charges the phone while the Lightning cable is plugged in.)  Some reviewers complain that doing this causes their volume to increase when they don't want it.  I can see this being a problem, but the vast majority of the time I've activated it, it hasn't been a big deal - I either just turn the volume back down again, or I activate it while the iPhone is locked with the screen off, which doesn't adjust the volume.Only major problem is a problem with a LOT of cases - bigger headphone plugs don't fit.I'll update this review in a few months to reflect how it holds up over time.
