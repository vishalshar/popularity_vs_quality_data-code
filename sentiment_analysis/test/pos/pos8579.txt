It is gonna be fine. So discouraged though.  Was looking for caps to re-purpose my classico (thinner jars).  I love them and use them for drinking glasses.  But wanted to use them as well for other things.  This lid us slightly too big for the jar mouth.  I measured the jar lid that came off if the jar and it sure seemed like this should fit. So bummed.  If my classico jar not "regular" and it is not "wide mouth" I am at a loss to figure this out.  Anybody know about these classico jars? Lid size, Special lids? For pouring, for powdering? Etc.
