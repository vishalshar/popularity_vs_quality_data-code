For the most part this case meets my expectations. It was honestly just what I was looking for. While it is on the bulkier side, it holds what I need it to. I can fit about 4 bills (folded) and 3 cards. The mirror is a nice touch as well and is better quality that I expected. I know a lot of reviews said the new material for the updated cases are slippery, but I don't think so at all! Also, the flash is a little weird when used in photos, but as long as you open the back panel when taking pictures, it works fine. The back panel opens easily, but takes a lot more to open accidentally if dropped. It also goes on and off the phone easily by sliding it right on and off. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone looking to buy a sturdy phone case that holds more than 1 or 2 cards!
