I've had this product for approximately 6 weeks. I read many reviews and compared it to a similar product prior to purchase. I have found Lumo Lift to be a very effective product. I have had significant improvement in posture and am now more aware of my posture even when I'm not wearing it.I have not had any issues syncing or learning the buzzes. It's pretty easy if you just familiarize yourself with the options in the menu. You can change the goals (10,000 steps a day / 4 hours good posture) to whatever works for you.  One of the things that I liked about this product in comparison to another posture product on the market is the other one you wore 2 times per day for a short amount of time but during those two times it was important to be diligent about posture. On the Lumo Lift, you can do what the other product does by changing the coaching settings to alert you in 5, 10, 15 seconds if your posture isn't good and keep it like that for 10-15 minutes. Then you can resume your day at a 2 minute or 5 minute alert. So you get the benefit of what the other device does but you still can focus on posture throughout the day.One of the negatives that I noticed in the reviews that has been true for me is: The bra clasp does not work.  I was skeptical of the reviews saying the bra clasp didn't work but now having tried it on several occasions with several different bras, I happen to think those reviewers were correct.  You need to plan on using the regular magnetic clasp over a strip of fabric that is almost an inch wide.I did have an occasion where my magnetic strip must have gotten pushed of by my purse or something and it was lost. I contacted Lumo Lift and they allowed me to purchase a new one at a greatly discounted rate (I don't remember the exact amount but it was under $5.) No product is perfect but this is a very helpful product to help improve posture!
