The headphones arrived in A1 condition and they look and sound like $250 headphones. Good in most areas such as gaming, music, videos, as well as movies.Bought mine for competitive gaming specifically and i'm satisfied with how they sound, the convenience of volume wheels, the removable mic, and setup was easy. Dissapointed that such a great looking headset doesn't contain surround sound, but the audio is still crisp and footsteps can be pinpointed if they are set to a high volume (CoD)Overall, hardly any cons about this luxurious pair of headphones. With the price given, it's a sin to not buy them.
