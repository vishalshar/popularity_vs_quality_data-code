I think this product is overall a great idea.  It's definitely faster to get on and off then the one that came with my Phantom4 and it's nice that you don't have to remove the ND filter to put this cover on.  The only thing that I'd say, is that I feel the original one that came with the drone might provide a stiffer lock for your gimbal as it attaches to the legs of the drone, whereas this one attaches to the body.  All in all, I'm happy with my purchase
