My Macbook Pro charger wire was starting to break so I got some Sugru to mend the damage. Absolutely incredible product that saved me like $70 to get a new charger. The only downside is each package is not resealable. Luckily I also had an iPhone cable and Apple earphones to reinforce. So basically, Apple, get your s*** together and pack some Sugru with your products.
