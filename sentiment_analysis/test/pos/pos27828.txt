This kit is a great idea for kids, or people who are considering growing mushrooms in their home. It is a very simple kit, they give you everything but water and a bucket to do the initial soaking in. The only reason I give this a 4 star rating is that it does not retain enough moisture. The mushrooms do a good job of taking off, but towards the end, no matter how often we sprayed them, they still dried out. We got a sizable batch, but they never got to full size as they started to shrivel about a week or so in. I would say it is a good buy, I rarely see fresh oyster mushrooms so having them to cook with is nice, and it piques curiosity watching them develop.
