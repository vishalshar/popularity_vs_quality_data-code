I love gadgets, especially gadgets for my bike.  When I discovered a product that would save me having to position my bike 'just-so' to get the valve stems below my luggage and away from the brakes, and prevent me having to roll around in the dirt just to check my pressure, I jumped on it.  Installation took all of 10 minutes and the reading matched the calibrated tire gauge I had on hand within 1psi.The only issue I had was with my bike.  On a Buell the front brake disc and calipers are on the rim of the wheel rather than around the axle.  The FOBO sensor is a bit large and would hit the caliper as it went by.  Fortunately I found this out just pushing the bike rather than riding it, otherwise I would have lost it to the road.  The seller helped me find a solution (angled valve stem extensions) and everything works perfectly.  Excellent product, outstanding customer service, I have already recommended these to a few of my rider friends and family.
