I was so excited when I saw this lunchbox that had a thermos container that could keep hot foods. All other bento lunch boxes out there including the popular Yum Box can only keep foods that are meant to be eaten at room temperature. That very much limits the type and variety of foods I can give my toddler. As an Asian mom raised eating rice, fish, hearty soups and other warm meals, I am also raising my son with the same eating habits. This is not always that easy tho when many of his meals happen in school. The OmieBox is perfect for my problem- it puts together his entire lunch in one convenient, easy to open container, with attractive colors, and most importantly, I can pack in a hot meal with it. On my son's first day using it, he had hot rice porridge, fruit/veggie pouch, and two kinds of fruit, and he ate all of his lunch. Even the teachers were impressed. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I think the compartments could be bigger, esp the thermos. As my son gets older he will eat a bigger lunch and the OmieBox may not be enough. The price is also a bit steep. Hopefully they can lower the price so I can get two.
