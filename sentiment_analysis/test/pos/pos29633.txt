This drone is pure quality with an excellent one year warranty. Compare to DJIs limited warranty.http://m.dji.com/warranty_policies?www=v1The customer service service is first class. If you haven't purchased one yet...try calling customer service if you have any questions pre-purchase. You will probably get an immediate answer as I always have. Need help setting up (it's actually very easy), give them a call and they are happy to walk you through any issues. Interested in DJI, try the same thing as a comparison. My understanding is you will be lucky to reach someone, even after a long hold. Thanks Autel for doing it right!
