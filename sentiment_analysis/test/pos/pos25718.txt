I purchased this camera to find insulation voids in the home but it is useful for alot more. It works really well with my galaxy tablet. I used it to check cooking temperature and see if some plumbing was working correctly. it is a great camera and price. I recommend a short OTG micro usb cable for use with tablet as the image is rotated 90 degrees and for thick cases, my otter box blocks usage of this device.
