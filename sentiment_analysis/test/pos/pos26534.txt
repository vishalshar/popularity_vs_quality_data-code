We had this installed by a professional as our front passenger seat was not in the right position. A hole for the base was drilled in the floor to fit it at a right location. This mount stand is nicely built and easy to adjust once you get used to the adjustment knobs. It keeps my laptop secure with the lock down clips and it does not shift over bumpy roads or up and down mountains. Make sure to purchase the extra stabilization bar as it keeps it very stable. I am really enjoying the option to work in the car while we travel. Pair this with a mobile hot spot and you will be all set to get out of the cubicle :)
