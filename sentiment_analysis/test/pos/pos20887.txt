Worked great for Christmas baskets for our friends.  We put a DVD, some popcorn packets, two jars of this seasoning, candy and drinks in a basket and wrapped it up for our friends.  These little seasonings were perfect for that.  They are also great samplers if you ever want to try a new flavor.  Highly recommended.
