We installed it in early May and followed the training instructions.  About 550 feet of wire.  We have two 8 month old kittens so the training was not difficult and they did not find the collars that distracting.  The harness part of the training was traumatic for all though.  Now late June and they are the happiest cats in the world.  No problem with collar since they associate it with outside time.  They do not even approach the wire line as they know what will happen.  Even birds don't entice them.  We know where they are and getting them in is easy when we need to.  Also no problems with collar irritating their skin. Yes there is risk with outdoor cats but better than having them live in a zoo cage and they are so happy.  If your cat has been free roaming I could see this process being a bit more difficult.  Ours were kittens at the time so I definitely recommend for young cats that were not previous free roaming outdoor cats.
