good tasting cold brew.  it is a great help for camping and road trips, so easy to fix hot or cold,  no more truck stop burnt coffee or hotel stuff.  for me, its conveniences and very good taste makes this a great thing to have around.  going to give some as gifts this christmas too, i know some people who will love this.
