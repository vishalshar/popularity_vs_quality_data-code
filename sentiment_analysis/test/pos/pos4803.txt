I actually want to give this product 4 1/2 stars but...  The quality of construction, durability and educational and learning potential are five+ stars.  The billing that the average person will be able to make long flights right out of the box brings it down half a star.  You'll realize why so much of their video instruction is based on making a paper airplane that flies well (without the PowerUp).  It's all about the airplane.  This just straps on it's back.Do not think of this as a radio controlled airplane or something that flies out of the box.  This is a small Bluetooth controlled motor and rudder that you can attach to your paper airplanes.  If you can't build a good paper airplane this will not fly for you.  If you like to tinker and experiment I think you will love the PowerUp 3.0 regardless of your age or experience.  I also think this would be a wonderful teaching and learning tool.  It's inexpensive, easy to use, incredibly durable and provides instant feedback to aerodynamic experiments.I got it, charged it and folded the trainer airplane.  It worked, only liked turns to the left, and is under powered but I had an airplane flying within minutes.  It wasn't a great flyer so instantly I'm thinking "what if I do this..."  I can't tell you how fun I find making subtle changes and tweaks and seeing how they perform.  Fold a new airplane and see how it does.I'm a pilot and have built a full size airplane from scratch and have a good grasp of aerodynamics, center of gravity bla... bla... bla and at almost 50 I find this little thing a lot of fun.  If you just want to buy something that will fly you might be disappointed but I absolutely love tinkering and experimenting with different airplane configurations and seeing how they turn out.  All it takes is a minute to fold a new airplane and give it a try.  I'm already thinking of how to shed weight and make it perform even better.Durability... Well, so far I have not broken it.  I've crashed it onto a concrete driveway several times and once at full throttle into a brick wall and it just bounces off and is ready to go for the next flight.  Everything is small.  Small propeller, tiny rudder... so I don't think it would be appropriate for small children but it's durable enough for any detail oriented or careful handed youngster or old guy.
