Love the product, easy to set up. I like that there's a gauge  that shows if you're getting closer to your item in case you  are not in the vicinity  to hear that  beeping. I especially like the feature that you can press the TrackR gadget itself and find your cell phone!!!  I will probably use this feature most!
