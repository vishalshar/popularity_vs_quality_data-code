I am delighted with this purchase. My delight is based in part on use of an LED watch/tracking device that worked very well for several years. However, the LED on that watch was difficult to read during the day in sunlight. The step counter did not seem accurate. If I stopped while walking my dog, it discounted the ten to twenty steps before or after my stop, I suppose interpreting those steps as something other than steps, i.e. random hand movements. That other watch took several toggles to get to desired information, e.g. switch from steps to time, to calories to how many more steps to reach my goal. This seems like a small deal, but after several years of toggling, it got annoying as I never seemed to be at the right information display. And the other watch needed to be recharged every three or four days or all of the information was lost. The Withings has a nice analog display that is easy to observe time. The step counter is easily seen without having to toggle through several different displays. The step counter seems to be more accurate than my previous device and the Healthmate software is very good, tracking time, sleep and showing periods of inactivity. The Withings alarm also is great, set from my iOS device, it vibrates enough to easily wake me from sleep. The watch band is aesthetically appealing and comfortable. The visual profile online makes it look thicker than it is, it looks very much like a regular watch on my wrist. It also looks very nice on my wrist. I have two minor criticisms: 1) the hands have no luminescence so you can't see the time without ambient light; 2) I miss having a second hand to watch portions of minutes pass. After all that, I'd buy this again without hesitation.
