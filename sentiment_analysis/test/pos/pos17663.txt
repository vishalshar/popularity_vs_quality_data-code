I bought the Brush Hero as a Father's Day gift for my husband, but I was the first to use it.  My golf clubs were so dirty and I decided to see how the Brush Hero worked.  It did a great job and made the cleaning job very easy.  Then I tried it on the cleats of my golf sandals and it  worked great on them.  Golfers should consider purchasing because it is an easy way to clean your equipment.
