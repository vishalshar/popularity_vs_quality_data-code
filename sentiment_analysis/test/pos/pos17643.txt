Definitely an improvement over run-of-the mill sheets, even "high thread count" sheets.  A very cool feeling, particulary when you first get into bed.  They don't seem to stay as cool throughout the entire night -- however, still a much more comfortable sleep than others I have tried.  Have recommended to friends!
