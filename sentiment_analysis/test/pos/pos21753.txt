We just got it, and our five-year-old is super happy! All the kids on the playground tried it, and all of them loved it! The bike is very nicely done, doesnÂ’t look cheap. Brakes work perfectly, big wheels, adjustable training wheels. It was very easy to assemble everything. It took my husband less than an hour. Strongly recommend it!
