Blown away by the quality and size. The best in its price point. Perfect as a Home theater on the move. Very adaptable as a photo slide projector or for presentations. Like all mini projectors of this nature you need a dark room, however, for the portability and overall quality this unit blows away its competition in this price range. Best use is for a traveling home theater or slide projector. For business applications it is a bargain provided you are in an interior conference room with no window glare. Hope this helps! Bonus features are the mini tripod and remote included. Very High value.
