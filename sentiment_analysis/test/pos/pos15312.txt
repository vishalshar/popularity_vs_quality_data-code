Below was my original review, however, after having the cover for several months now, I must update my review. I gave it 4 stars this time around. The sticking does get a little weaker, but still works fine when needed. The cover has protected my phone when accidentally dropped.The concept of it sticking is great, however I had to get used to it sticking to everything: paper, desk, table...  I bought it to stick on my dashboard but found no where to put it as all feasible areas in the car slant the phone in the wrong direction. Not sure I would spend $40 on it again. 3 stars due to price and everyday inconvenient sticks.
