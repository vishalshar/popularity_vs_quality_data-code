This is awesome. If you download orbbasic or macro lab it becomes even more awesome. If you go to youtube and watch the 4 tutorials on ollie (they might be named sphero) you get even more benefits! My 13 year old nephew is all over this and the tutorials. His 5 year old sister is also and of course his very adult aunt has her own!!! I love it....and guess what? My dog loves it!!! Ours charges in much less than 3 hours. I'm hoping someday to see one with a 2-3 hour battery charge benefit. In the meantime I highly recommend it not only for fun but to teach kids how programming works. My next 2 sets of nieces are in line to receive Ollie as well.
