Way cooler than expected. The number of interesting configurations is huge. At first, I set it up like a conventional analog synth and was impressed by the sound of the oscillators and filter. With one hand on the keyboard and the other on the filter cutoff it's possible to play some pretty cool sounding lead and bass stuff.It was only when I brought it to work and left it out for others to play with that I realized how awesomely versatile this kit is. Every time I walked past the spot where I left it, I found that someone had discovered a new and different way to hook things up. The sequencer in particular is capable of a lot when triggered by other modules. Combining that in various ways with the envelope and filter (with the resonance turned up) creates some really wild complex evolving sounds.
