I only use this for swimming, however, I have used this for three months now and it works wonderfully!  Accurately measures my lap count and very helpful in analyzing my swimming.  Before buying it I read a lot of reviews that said there was a problem with it falling out of the band.  I really haven't had that problem and I'm a pretty aggressive and vigorous swimmer.  For the price and for the data it gives you regarding your swimming (strokes, timing, technique, etc.) this is absolutely worthy purchase.
