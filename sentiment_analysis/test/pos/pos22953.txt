This is by far the best wireless rig i have used. I have this hooked up in line with the rest of my pedal setup. The unit takes about 1.5 hours to charge from completely dead and lasts for an entire set (1-2 hours) and much more. i usually plug it back in after that but i am sure it would last around 6 consistent hours of playback at minimum. I know this is meant to be an at home kind of practice rig but i use it at my main setup. I can get 50+ feet of distance from my rig, being able to adjust my eq from the sound board and still play connected to my rig on stage.by far this is the easiest, inexpensive, high quality rig i have ever used.
