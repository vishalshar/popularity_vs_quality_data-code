I received my bellabeat Leaf for a gift at my request in Dec. 2015 and I love it! They have continued to surprise me with all the new updates and changes to make it even more amazing! Any questions and they respond immediately. I love all 3 features of how you can wear it, the bracelet is amazing and tracks my activity the best. I'm waiting for the 2nd chain and am hoping that'll track my activity level with it flat on my neck better than the regular necklace. I receive so many compliments so often and people ask what it is and are so surprised when I tell them. I think people are hitting their Leafs too hard by a few complaints as I only tap mine, sometimes I may have to tap it 4 times rather than the 2 recommended and it works perfect when putting the information into my phone. I love the new meditation on here and I play the Deep Sleep one at bedtime and my husband even likes it, he says I fell asleep to that thing you have before it was over...I love it! I fall asleep immediately which is amazing for me! I just changed the battery and it's so easy to do with the little tool that was sent with my Leaf and it alerts me on my phone that I have a low battery. Thank you so much for all you keep adding! I also wanted to say this is so much prettier than the plastic fitbits, I  love jewelry and it fits great with everything I wear!
