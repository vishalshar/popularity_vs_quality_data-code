This is an amazing device that has completely transformed my life!  I have a reliable pet sitter but she is sometimes busy and cannot look after my two cats when I want to go away for the day.  I have purchased other automatic feeders but since they didn't have cameras or any notification system, I never knew whether they had worked until I returned home.  This made it hard not to worry  that the feeder had failed and my cats were without food while I was away.  The Feed and Go Pet Feeder has completely solved this problem.  Not only can you activate it remotely on a smart phone, but you can call your pets over to the feeder and feed them while you watch.  It is really comforting to know that your pet is alive and well (and fed!) while you're gone.  After buying one and testing it against other feeders, I decided to buy another one to set up in a different part of the house so that my two cats could eat separately in peace (they are competitive over food).  I absolutely love this device and my kids love it too!  It is so fun (and easy) for them to check in on their beloved pets while we're away for the day.  It's also easy to set up (I am mildly technophobic and it was not problem) and customer service was really prompt and helpful.
