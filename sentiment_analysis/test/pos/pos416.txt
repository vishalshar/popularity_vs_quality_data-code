I have been battling anxiety for my entire life. It's a daily struggle for me, so when I saw this product on here I made the jump and got it. I am pleasantly surprised with it. Not only does it track your breathing rate but also your steps and activity for the day. You can tag your "streaks" with what you were doing at the time. I had a lot of tense streaks at first, and during a panic attack at work I tried listening to their 30 seconds to calm. It was short but to the point- that I needed to breath. I listened to it a few times but after that I was able to gather myself and get through the work day.Pros: wireless charging, and charges very fast! Less than an hour charging time for me. Plus, battery lasts as much as 5 days for me (it says up to 7 but I'm not sure about mineYour spire will vibrate when you've been tense or had a streak to keep you mindful of the moment.It secures easily to your waistline or your bra. I usually wear it on my bra between the cups and you cannot even tell I am wearing it. It is very discrete. And, coworkers have seen me looking at my breathing rate and thought it was cool. It was almost like an ice breaker to say hey, I sometimes need to gather myself even if I seem fine to you.Cons? I guess I'd say I think I'm more tense than spire believes, but maybe it doesn't list a tense streak if you regulate your breathing after the spire vibrates. I've had some moments with increasing anxiety where spire has told me I'm having a calm streak, yet I didn't in any way feel calm. Also, it could be my ADD, but I rarely have focus moments listed on my Spire, even when I'm really into what I'm doing. One day though, forgot to bring my Spire with me to work, and boy was I lost that day!Overall, if you battle anxiety and staying in the moment, this pricey gadget may be worth your money. It looks delicate but after using it, sweating on it, dropping it, it still looks brand new and works like a charm, so the build of this product is definitely of value. It comes in a nice packaging with the wireless charger and an extra USB cord that has a soft feel to it.I would recommend Spire to anyone looking for something extra to help them get through the day.
