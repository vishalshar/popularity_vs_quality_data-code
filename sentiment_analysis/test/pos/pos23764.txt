Thick and strong, this cord works well with my 35 pound dog who must go outside in my rural area. I am disabled and not able to walk him. This cord allows him plenty of room to move about until he is finished, and he comes inside to the back porch when he is ready on his own. He does go to the dog park in town for regular exercise...we are both happy..
