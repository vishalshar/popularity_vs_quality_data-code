I bought this for my husband and he LOVES it!  It is a great size and holds a lot without being bulky.  The quality of the material is excellent and seems like it will hold up for many years. He said he would have given it a five star review except that the pen holders are on the outside of the bag, instead of inside.  Otherwise, a great bag!
