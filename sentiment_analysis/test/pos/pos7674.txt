My cats seem to really like it! When switching them from their old food to this food, they'd both frequent the bowl with more of Solid Gold food than their Wal-Mart Purina brand.  I feel they prefer it!I very much like that this food is safe for both cats and kittens.  I have a 4 year old fm and a 4 month old fm.  My older cat would frequently eat all my kitten food rather than her own food.  My kitten would then eat the adult cat food and get terrible gas and tummy ache.Though this food is pricey, I feel its worth it! (though I would love for it to be cheaper lol)
