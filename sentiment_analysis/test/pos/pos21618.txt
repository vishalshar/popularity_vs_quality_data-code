I have a bit of a makeup addiction - yes, the struggle is real.  I'm an equal opportunity makeup geek - I have luxury cosmetics, bargain cosmetics and everything in between. I have very sensitive eyes and I need to be very careful when choosing eye products, especially those that contain glitter or shine.  I saw this and decided to give it a shot in the hopes that it would work for me.The Julep "When Pencil Met Gel" Long Lasting Gel Eyeliner is a medium sized pencil.  It glides on smoothly and is easy to smudge or blend if it's done immediately - the liner is meant to set quickly, so it's important to smudge it upon application. I have very dry, sensitive eyes. I had no problem applying this and had no problems with irritation. The liner stayed put all day.  I bought the shade "Bronze Shimmer" It's slightly shimmery, not overly shiny but just enough to brighten my eyes a bit. It's very pretty and has become my "go to" liner for everyday wear. It's very similar to the Stila 24 Hour eyeliner pencil but a little bit less expensive.This was my first Julep eye makeup purchase but it won't be my last. It's just a lovely formula. I'm very impressed!
