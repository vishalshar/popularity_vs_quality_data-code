So Ive put my might mug to the test. ive placed it on all kinds of different table top from wood to stone and this cup works great. it aslo fits in my cup holder in my car which i was kinda worried about before i got my mighty mug. so of the dislike of the mighty mug are as followed. the latch the seals the mouth piece dose not latch every well. also the mouth piece is very wide and longer than normal cups like this. which cause water or any type of liquid to fall out and tend to spill off the rim. other than that this product is awesome.
