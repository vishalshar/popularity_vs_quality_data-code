I've owned my Jide Remix Mini for a couple of months now and am rather satisfied with its performance. While I'd gotten it primarily as a means to watch streaming content, I've found that it's pretty robust. I can play MMPORGs and standalone games. And because it's basically an Android smart phone without a screen, some of the games you can download can be played on the big screen. I've got mine hooked up to an LG 32" monitor with a Dell wireless keyboard and mouse and a pair of Logitech speakers. It's a really nice setup that should cost less than $100 (minus the monitor...)
