For my first order, I ordered three bags of the banana flavored bites; had no issues with shipment - they arrived nicely packaged and on time.  The bites are chewy, flavorful and I really like them.  When I decided to place my second order, I discovered there were other flavors.  I ordered three bags of the banana and three of the chocolate.  Instead, what I received were six bags of the banana flavored bites.  I wrote to the company, let them know there was a mistake with the order and today, found a new package on my doorstep, with the three bags of chocolate flavored bites inside.  The packaging was perfect; the bags were packaged in heat resistant packaging and no melting occurred.  Best of all, the chocolate flavored bites were well worth the effort.  They are absolutely delicious.
