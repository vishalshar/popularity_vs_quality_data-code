We recently replaced our refrigerator, and the new one doesn't have a water filter thingy in the door. Oh no! I immediately set out to find a water filtration system that would be simple and inexpensive yet aesthetically pleasing. I found the Soma pitcher after doing some extensive research, and decided to give it a try. I was instantly hooked. The water tastes great. My whole family is drinking WAY more water than they ever did because the pitcher is so easy to use, pours effortless (no leaking, no drips, and the lid stays put), and it's also easy to refill. I think half the time my son drinks water JUST so he can refill it through the lid! Ha!We subscribed to the Soma filter replacement program, too, which makes it easy to remember when it's time to replace our filter.
