My kid kept trying to get me to buy these and I consistently refused since I'm old school.  I figured if a kid really wants to learn they should do it on the sidewalk skinned knees and all.  Then I realized how expensive health care is and bought them.  Now I realize these are genius.  I was back to doing Ollies in no time.  Oh, and my kid starting to get the hang of it too!  These are definitely a confidence booster for the kids and sometimes thats all they need to get going!
