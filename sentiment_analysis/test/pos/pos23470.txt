Okay-- so I'm not pregnant. And yes, these are coated with more sugar than necessary.  I needed a vitamin kick. These vitamins are definitely different than the run of the mill brand. I'm not even sure if you're supposed to feel "different" with vitamins but with these, I do. It's not the jittery caffeinated kind of different and, no, it's not the sugar induced energetic-spike-followed-by-a-crash experience either. I simply feel physically and mentally more up to whatever it is I need to do. I experience life without the drag that is often so subtle it goes unnoticed in the "You don't know your windows are dirty until you wash them" kind of way. I am starting to rub off the coat of sugar though. It really is unnecessary.
