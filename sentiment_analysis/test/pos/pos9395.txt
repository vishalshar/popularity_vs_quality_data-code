Bass is amazing.Every song becomes a hype song when using this.Only draw back are the lower removable hip-straps. In most backpacks a hip-strap is usually stitched on, so its there at a moments notice; the M2 has removable ones that fall off every time you put-on/ take-off the system. If you use the system outside your home, be sure to check that those hip straps are still there when taking off/ putting on the system. At this point they have become so annoying that i am trying to find ways to permanently attach them to the system straps. (1 star off)Overall it is an incredible system highly recommended.
