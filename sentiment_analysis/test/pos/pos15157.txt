I ordered several of these kits for a company team building event.  The fluency of creation with them is fantastic, and we all had a great time.  It literally takes minutes to get a basic IoT solution working.  Since then we've repurposed them for youth education and I've been very happy with using them for that purpose.  I've got lots of experience with breadboarding and a degree in electrical engineering, but when it comes to teaching a group of kids each working independently, these are a breeze.  The devices basically cannot be connected incorrectly, and putting them together "just works" as you might expect.
