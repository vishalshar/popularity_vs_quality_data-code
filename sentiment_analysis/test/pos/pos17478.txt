Quite simple to install; could require slight modification of your existing door buttons (a quick removal of the LED lights).  Alex was amazingly quick and responsive via email with Q+A.  I hooked mine up via the wall buttons instead of climbing to my openers, 15' up; way simpler and just as effective.
