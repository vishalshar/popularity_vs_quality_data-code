I really liked the crispiness of the apple chips. I was looking to keep myself away from potato chips. The other fruits included in this sampler were not crispy like the apple. The package of cherries were missing from my box, so I did not get to try them. I have reordered a whole box of the Granny Smith apple chips. My only complaint is that they do not come in single serving bags as it is hard to stop eating them once you start!
