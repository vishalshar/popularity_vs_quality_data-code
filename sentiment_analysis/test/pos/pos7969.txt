I was a little worried to purchase this exact formula because it had no reviews at the time - maybe it's just very new? I chose it because it included chaga and lion's mane as well as a bunch of other interesting mushrooms that I would like to eat more of. I'm very happy with the product. The powdered blend is a great way to get more mushrooms in your diet without buying expensive fresh mushrooms. I usually add a couple teaspoons to hot water - it dissolves easily and tastes like a mushroom based broth or tea - not sweetened or anything - very nice in cold weather. It's also delicious as part of a soup broth along with salt, collagen and seaweed. I will buy it again.
