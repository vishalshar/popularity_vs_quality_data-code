I bought the Libratone Zipp mini speaker and I do like it BUT, I do have a minor issue with the speaker.  First of all I think the Zipp mini is good not great but good.  The overall all sound is very balanced.  I believe with 360 degree speakers you sacrifice volume and though the Zipp mini is rated at 60 watts it was not as loud as I would like. NOTE: (1)I was a little annoyed that the speaker has to boot up before it connects.  (2)Then it makes this dying bird sound and I don't know why or what that indicates but the speaker worked.  (3)I had to turn the volume all the way up on the speaker and then turn up the volume on my phone the get any sound.  I did my own sound comparisons first with the Denon Envaya.  The Envaya seemed louder than the Zipp mini and the bass is much more pronounced but then it lacks the highs and midrange balance of the mini and I really like the Denon Envaya.  Second, I compared it to the Riva s, and just like on Clavinetjunkies video the zipp mini is louder and clearer than the Riva and it should be 60 watts vs. 30 watts so advantage goes to the Zipp mini.  Now I'm going to be messy.  One of my favorite speakers to listen to is the Oontz angle 3XL I know that many people don't like this speaker because of the lack of bass response but if you could combined the crisp highs and mid range of the Oontz 3XL with the bass response of the Zipp mini or even the envaya I believe you would have the perfect speaker. The Libratone Zipp Mini overall has the best balance sound of highs mids and lows and at max volume it doesn't distort and the sound stays true from any direction.  As you listen the speaker it gets better.  As for the app unless you are going to use the Wi-Fi or Airplay features you don't need the Libratone App.  I would recommend this speaker.  I wish there was a place where you can go and listen to this speaker because I would really like to hear the 100 watt rated Zipp.
