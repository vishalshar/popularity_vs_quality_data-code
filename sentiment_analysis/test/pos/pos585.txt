Overall, the concept is great.  However, as the temperature is dropping towards freezing, I'm noticing they're quite susceptible to breakage (hence the missing star).  From the original 14 (+2 diff colors), I've lost about 3 since the dip in the temperature.  If you live in a constantly warm climate, these are amazing.  Fair warning for those using it with sneakers up north.
