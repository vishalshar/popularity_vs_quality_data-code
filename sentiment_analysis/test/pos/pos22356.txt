This paper has a thin plastic lining covered by a thin sheet of paper. (I assume that is to avoid the cheese oil from soaking through the paper.) The labels have a very good adhesive.I don't know just how important it is to keep 12-year-old cheddar cheese happy but I feel better about using this cheese paper rather than keeping the cheese in the plastic wrap used for shipping.
