I was a little skeptical at first, but these bags certainly do the trick!  I've tried keeping cheese fresh in a variety of ways (plastic wrap, tin foil, tupperware, snack bag and so on), but it always ends up getting slightly damp and spoils fairly quickly.  These bags seem to breath just enough to keep moisture from building up, but still keep the cheese sealed away from microsopic bacteria and debris.  I will definitely always have these on hand!
