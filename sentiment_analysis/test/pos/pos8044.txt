This tape measure is very practical.I have owned one for 6 months. Unfortunately it got stolen.The tape have some neat features that will make measuring a breeze. The top display is crisp and accurate, it also have good viewing outside on bright sunny days. The top also features the memory buttons. There are 2. You can measure and store two different measurements and recall them at any time. You can also record over, or simply delete. On one side there's a handy pocket clip and on the other there are the buttons that do all the magic.The hold button will hold the measurement in question and the display will blink. Once you've written down or cut the material, by holding the hold button you can reset the tape measure.The middle button let's you find the halfway point of your measurement. So if you measure 4in it'll half to 2 in.  It also will work with fractions. Say you have 7 1/8 in.  It'll find the middle of it.The measuring set button will allow you to set what system you want to measure. Metric or inches.  Shows feet and inches also.The start point button will let you measure from the front of the tape, like normal, or the arrow pointing back will start the measurement from the back of the tape. This is good to measure inside corners from a window, for instance. Look for the arrow on the bottom of he display.The tape measure is very accurate. I found that sometimes I had to remove and reinstall the battery for it to reset to start measuring from the 1/16"th mark. Otherwise it would start from.  The 1/4" mark.If you want to simplify your life get this tape.I am buying a new one to replace the one stolen.Like other reviews had mentioned, you may have to baby this tape a little more than a regular tape measure. But I found no problem when I dropped mine. And I have done so a few times. Only a few scratches.  Still worked great!!!Would recommend this tape measure!!
