I like it so far, but the box is quite big and it's hard to put into carrying bag or add anything more on top of it. And the hot lunch container is slightly small, I barely can scoop in one cup of noodles, otherwise, it's a very good quality lunch box. It's also pricy too. And if we pulled out the hot lunch container to eat separately. the lunch box would fall backward since the lid is super heavy so something is hard for my girl.
