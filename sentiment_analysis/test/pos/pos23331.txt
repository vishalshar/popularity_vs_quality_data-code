I searched high and low for a proper kids bike to fit my 6 year old girl. We went to shops and spotted a couple nice bikes that were in the 200-250$ range. I web searched and found similar choices. Then I found these and read the reviews here. I purchased the 18" version. It is just right for her and should offer some room to grow on it.  These bikes are legitimate high quality. The reviewer that said these are China's secret stash is spot on. These are considerably nicer than the Walmart/target models. Specifically this 18" model offers the right ergos for real cycling.( at least more so than the others we looked at).  Everything fits and is made nicely. The paint job is superb as is the overall fit and finish. It's not 200$ bike but it is a definite step above what is commonly available at the big box stores.  The unisex is nice, I will give to her little brother when she out grows it. I liked this so much I bought another one in 14" for her brother. He is just transitioning from a strider bike the 14" should be a good stopgap until he gets this 18" one. He is exactly 3.5 years old and on a  12" pedal bike whose ergos are beyond horrible and the gearing is way to low. Most the kids bikes are just toys. These are not. Will write a separate review When the 14" comes in. Very happy with these you can't go wrong. UPDATE: We got the 14'' model in, same high quality, a very durable little bike. Bike was bought for 3.5 year old who does not use training wheels. He took to it pretty fast. The ergonomics for him are a little cramped (part of the problem is the seat is in its lowest position) but he will have to deal with it. There is not very many "real" 14' bikes out there.  One issue with the 14'' is it came with the white vinyl seat with black handle on back of seat. This just gets in the way of swinging a leg over the seat. I took a hacksaw and removed the handle. Minus the handle seat we are very happy with it. Should last him 2 years or so.He is the talk of the neighborhood zooming around on his pedal bike. Do yourself and your children a favor and 1. Buy a balance bike (strider) 2. Buy them a pedal bike after they master the strider and throw the training wheels away.
