I've been using this extensively for 3 months while traveling through Australia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Very reliable and convenient. I treat it as my backup for when I can't find WiFi, or when local internet is too slow. I ended up using it about 50% of time. A must have for those that earn their income using the internet. Also it's great to land somewhere and have internet right away.I was traveling with a friend who got local sim cards a few times, and this would get reception when his would not. It seems to connect to any tower regardless of who owns it.It's usually at least double what local pay-as-you-go data is, though. Also, it's bulky. It's not very convenient to put in your pocket, for example (so you can have internet when you go out exploring without your bags). The trade-off of having a large battery capacity.Though they didn't extend the offer to me, it looks like this company pays people to write 5 star reviews. I don't see myself as a member of the morality police and don't really care. The device works well and I recommend it.
