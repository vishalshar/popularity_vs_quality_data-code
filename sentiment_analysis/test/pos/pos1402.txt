Bought this for a nine year old boy,  and it was his favorite gift of the year.  Easy to follow instructions that he was able to follow on his own with a format that kept up interest at all times. Excellent for teaching basic circuitry. If you want to show a kid that a computer isn't some magic box this is the toy for you! Well thought out components and software that leaves room for more advanced future development.  Full support is included if needed. Love this product!!
