I'm not going to lie; it took me a while to get my CUJO working with my current modem & router setup (i use a Eero router).  But rather than just return my CUJO because i was unable to configure it correctly on my own, i reached out to CUJO customer support.  And this is the reason I am writing this review.  CUJO customer service was fantastic.  They were extremely responsive, and determined to help me configure my CUJO (based on my unique internet/router setup) correctly.  I've now been using my CUJO successfully for over a week without issue, and I am thankful to have this new layer of internet security in my home.  If you are interested in purchasing a CUJO, which I recommend, and if you have any difficulties setting it up, do not hesitate to contact their customer service as they will be happy to help you and quick to respond.
