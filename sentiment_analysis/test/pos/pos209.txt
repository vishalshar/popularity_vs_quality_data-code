I got this stuff shipped out to Asia, and it arrived as promptly as they promised - almost the longest 2 weeks of my life.Worth the wait and the money though! I have used it for 5 days now, and i've never really had a product that has compelled me to leave a good review (yeah 4 Asian stars is good).Sound Quality - Seriously GoodThis is what compelled me to write the review after all. I rushed to unboxed it and quickly got it to work with my MacBook. Paired quickly and next thing i knew, magic started flowing out of it. I've had a couple of higher-end earbuds (EarSonics SM3, Westone 3, Ultimate Ears TripleFi, UE700, Klipsch S4, X10, Creative Aurvanas), though this is my first portable speaker. I was looking for a speaker with distinct speakers for lows and highs, and in particular highs that are not covered up by booming basses. The highs are clean, the mids are robust, and the bass is not over-powering. It worked really well to the light jazz and acoustics songs that i usually listen to. For earbuds, there tends to be a break-in period where they all sound crappy for the first 100hours or so. Not sure if this needs to be broken in as well? If it sounds this good out of the box, i look forward to a better future with this little guy. I would have given this full marks, but i'm Asian and therefore stingy with giving anything perfect scores.Volume - More than SufficientIgnore what they said about the volume being a deal breaker. I travel alot and i intended to use this for hotel rooms and the occasional driving. This is more than suitable for it. I have never had to turn this to anywhere near max volume, and i've never had to enter the loud mode at all. Even with the not insignificant road noise on my good old asian Honda City, mid-loudness was sufficient. I don't do those outdoor parties though. Asians don't do parties.Battery Life - Infinite5 days ago, the dude in the speaker told me the battery was about 3/4 full. After about 8 hours of usage at mid volume (because it's enough), the guy still told me that it was about 3/4 full. A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation with my superior mathematics worked that out to infinity. This stuff is magic.Build Quality - SolidThis is something i would throw at someone. It's definitely capable of doing substantial damage while keeping itself intact.Bluetooth Pairing - PassableSo this thing pairs really fast. I got it to work on my MacBook within 20 seconds. After a while, i connected it to my China Asian phone, which it also promptly recognized and fell subject to. Unfortunately, the range is really limited to 10m line-of-sight (we use meters everywhere else in the world. That's 33ft for you). Plenty of blind spots behind walls. But it's gonna work fine for my hotel room usage. There's also an issue with patchy connection with my Asian China phone. With my American made-in-China MacBook, i had some trouble connecting it this morning. The dude in the speaker kept saying "Connected, Disconnected, Connected, Disconnected". I eventually restarted the speaker and it's working fine now.Water and Dust - Not TestedThis thing is electronic. IT IS NOT NATURAL TO BE BATHING WITH ELECTRONICS IN YOUR BATHTUB WITH YOUR RUBBER DUCKIES. And honestly, I don't usually rub $150 on the floor, neither do i toss it in the sandpit.I'll update this again if it screws up, or if the sound breaks in and i get further impressed. In the meantime, I do think i've found a gem in this without overpaying for all the branding and advertising stuff. I might eventually get another one for true stereo sound. Whatever they say about the 6 speaker drivers, this thing is way too small for sound to be reaching both your ears in a surround-sound manner. I've tried balancing it on my head, no luck.
