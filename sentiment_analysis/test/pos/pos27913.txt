I really do love this oven, but the interior is a bit smaller than I expected.  But so far, it fits everything I have put in it.  It is a lower wattage than my last microwave, but it does seem to heat everything up just as fast.  I love the color.  I know you are supposed to buy based on features, but the color is what sold me on this.  It matches my kitchen and all my small appliances.  I also love that it has a handle.  My last 2 microwaves had a press button to open them and the button went bad well before the rest of the microwave did.
