They fit really well... comfortable.  I was worried about pain because my iPhone earbuds albeit great sound, hurt my ears when I insert them.  I have freakishly small ears.  When my Earhoox arrived, I was cautiously optimistic.  When I first wrapped the rubbery things on and put them in my ears, I was sad.  The left ear hurt a bit and it didn't seem to fit flush and comfy like the right one.When examining them for differences, I quickly realized the package came with two different sizes (small and large).  I had the small on my right ear bud and the large on the left one.  Once I had both small Earhoox in place, they worked great!  I've been wearing them for about 45 minutes, something I could not previously do without my ears turning red from irritation.  I am wearing them right now while listening to Big Daddy Weave's My Story!I can't wait to go running to determine if they stay in place as well as be this comfortable - I quick jog around the house with the dogs make me truly optimistic they will be fine!  Yeah! Earhoox!
