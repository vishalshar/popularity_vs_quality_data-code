I've always had an interest in EKGs. I love the idea that you can learn so much about yourself or someone else by simply looking at a piece of paper with some random squiggles on it... so long as you know how to read them but I digress. I've been using this product for the last few weeks now and it seems to be holding up pretty well without flaw. The set up is so easy that the instruction manual basically explains how to set it up in 3 easy steps. The app doesn't take up a lot of memory at all and is just about as easy to use and set up. Too be perfectly honest I think that the people that who had issues with it might have had older versions of the software. Basically when you start up the app the first thing you will see is a giant button asking you if you want to have you EKG taken, it's that simple press 1 button!From what I've been able to tell this product is made for specifically identifying atrial fibrillation or normal heart rhythms. Anything else that falls outside of those two will get a reading of unclassified. To be fair though this is not a 12 lead EKG and I've never been able to hook myself up to one and compare the results. I will say that I'm not the target audience of this product. I'm a 25-year-old male with no known heart abnormalities or dysrhythmias.The medical program I'm in right now has me under a lot of stress and I do ingest caffeine to keep me sharp. As a result I get the occasional PVC and this device has caught it each time even though its not even belt for that..... though it could not identify what it was. If you feel a true deep concern about your result, it allows you to email your result to a tech or cardiologist for about $18..... which is a few hundred dollars cheaper than having it done at a hospital. You need to understand, hospital EKG machines misdiagnose all the time. This is why doctors and cardiologist have to interpret the results to make sure the machine didnt misdiagnose. Any slight movement, any anxiety or even a big fart could throw the machine off.The cool thing is that the first EKG reading is free! Lets get down to brass tax, atrial fibrillation is generally not life threatening but it does need to be monitored and this is really one of the better ways to give yourself piece of mind by taking control of it into your own hands.Whenever I stop and think about the future of this product I realize that this is just the beginning. As the software has time to improve, it probably wont be long before its sophisticated enough to accurately read other heart abnormalities. Eventually perhaps even myocardial infractions (heart attacks) and pulmonary embolisms. If youve been recently diagnosed with A-fib and are anxious about it, do yourself a favor and give yourself some inner peace by buy this product.
