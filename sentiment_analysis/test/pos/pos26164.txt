I love these particular products because there is no sugar added to the dried fruit. The banana chips with the cocoa powder are a little dry.  Just as as you can imagine because cocoa powder is naturally dry. The cinnamon chips are delicious as well as the natural banana flavor. My 11 year old son loves them and his lunch.
