I rarely write reviews, but I had to compliment Masontops! These are wonderful! No worries about veggies floating to the surface, the weights fit perfectly!  Also, no worries about spilling the mason jars while fermenting, the airlock lids keep them from pouring out! Mess free, worry free fermenting at it's best!  Masontops is also a wonderful company to work with!  We ordered the small set by accident and they sent us the free set!  Will recommend these to all of our fermenting friends :)
