Well, they match my Apple MacBook and iPad, so that's a nice surprise.The packaging was super chic and fancy. It really did make it look very expensive.They come with an extra plug, which is fabulous. Also, there's a nice carrying bag that will be nice when we travel and I need to pack the headphones in my luggage.We got the white, and I love how clean they look.The sound is really good. When the sound is halfway up I can only barely hear what my husband is listening to. When he turns it all the way up, I can hear everything from across the room, which means they have slightly above average noise cancellation.The best feature IMO is that they're super comfortable.We haven't gotten the microphone to work yet, but I'm still willing to think it's user error. I'll update my review later if we never get it to work.I received these headphones at at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review. My reviews are always thoughtful, honest, and completely sincere.
