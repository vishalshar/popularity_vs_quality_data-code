Amazing! I use my Samsung Note 3 to record the weekly TV program I host (in cooperation with stations in 6 countries), and the video quality is truly amazing--but audio has been a problem. The built-in microphone picks up every noise in the area, from autos and dogs barking a block away to the rustling of scripts behind the tripod (I use a Joby GorillaPod so I can anchor the phone on anything).No more audio problems now! I tried everything, and just came across this, and what a difference. I tested it by recording myself twice, only 4 feet from a sound machine (right behind the phone) With the built-in mike, the noise was overpowering. With the Ampridge Shotgun mike, I did still hear the noise, but it was very subdued, enough so that it was fine--and that in the very unnatural situation of a sound machine 4 feet away!One reviewer gave it 2-stars saying he saw no difference (I don't see how, if he did a test as I did), and then suggested an omnidirectional RODE SmartLav+ microphone. The RODE is omnidirectional, folks--meaning it records in every direction. The entire point of this tiny shotgun mike is to reduce (not totally eliminate-that's a $200 mike!) noise. The RODE will not do that.I've uploaded some of my weekly TV episodes on YouTube (search for Xingfu Fujian on YouTube or Goodle). I've done filming with Smartphones and with pro crews for National Geographic (and professional sound stages for talk shows, news, variety shows, etc.).  This Ampridge MightyMic of course is not a "pro" mike, but for 69.99 with free shipping, it is certainly good enough for me to shoot TV-ready programs. It doesn't block out all noise, but it makes enough difference that I can get acceptable audio whereas before I would just have to find another location altogether. So either use a little patience--or spend $200 on a mike that, in my experience, isn't really that much better.For detailed info on how to remotely operate your Smartphone video, either iOS or Android, with a 6 dollar remote, free Android software, and Jobe GorillaPod, check my Off the Wall blog by Googling "how to remote control smartphone videos off the wall"Happy filming!
