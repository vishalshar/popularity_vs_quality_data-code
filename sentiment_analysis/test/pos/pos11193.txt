i use this every day. we have this disappearing silverware issue at work. you leave it in your desk, it'll be gone by the time you get back from a nice weekend at home. people have even tried leaving their forks and whatnot dirty just to deter the would be thieving trolls, to no avail.these are not only very good quality, but hide well in their case. i found a label machine and labeled mine as "Herpes Meds" (i don't have herpes!)these haven't  been so much as moved yet... people stopped using my cups and such as well... any how. these are great. BUY THEM!
