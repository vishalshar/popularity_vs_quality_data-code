Some of the negative feedback on these is based on the fact that the embedded battery will run down in a year and you will need to buy a replacement (which Tile apparently will offer at a reduced price compared to buying new). While it would be nice to have a five year battery life or free replacements, I don't think it is fair to remove stars from a recommendation for that.The way I looked at it, I am willing to pay this price so that I can find my keys, phone, and other items, over the span of 12 months. If that makes sense to you, buy a set. If that does not make sense, then don't.So far in my usage the tiles pair easily and have a good, solid ring tone which makes it easy to find the item. I'm happy with this purchase.
