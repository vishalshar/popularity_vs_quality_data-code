When I was in high school I had a well made, metal pocket comb. No sharp teeth. Now most plastic combs are sharp and break as soon as you sit down. The metal ones are so poorly made they are better fish scalers. This comb is well made, sturdy and coated. No scalp wounds and fits in any pocket or wallet. The only than now is will the coating last. I'll go to five stars once I carry it for a while.
