Good illumination over a fairly wide area. The only negatives are that you have to hit the right spot on the on/off switch - it's wide but only works in one spot and I wish it projected out just a little farther on my Weber Genesis E-330. Other than that, I've done quite a bit of cooking with it after dark. That's something I hadn't done before.
