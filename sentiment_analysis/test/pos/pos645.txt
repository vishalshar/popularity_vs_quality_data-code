Are you looking to grow some of your favorite herbs in a limited space? Do you literally ONLY have a window sill in which to grow plants? Then you've found the perfect product!I've bought two of the "Back to the Roots" products lately-- the Garden-In-A-Jar Basil and Garden-In-A-Jar Cilantro. The basil has just began to sprout, so I see some tasty organic basil pesto in my not-so-distant future! I haven't started the cilantro yet, but once it's growing, I'll soon be able to enjoy some homemade pico de gallo!I'd been interested in this company's products since discovering the aquaponics aquarium (which I'll end up buying for myself sooner or later), so I was excited to see these two products at my local Home Depot.I purchased both, and was excited to learn of their "in kind" giving program, where they donate the same product to a classroom of your choice. Several of my friends are teachers, and I know one has been trying to get her (middle school) students interested in the world around us (especially the roots of the food we eat). So win-win. I bought two awesome products with two of my favorite herbs, and my friend gets two products which will engage her students' interest in the food they eat and its origins. Kids today don't always have the ability to grow a garden with their families like I did as a child, and far too often, believe food comes from the supermarket. So products like these, which are practical, functional, user-friendly, (and delicious), are something anyone can enjoy. And anytime any company pays it forward like BTTR does, I know I've found a company I want to support.This product also comes in can versions, as well as a four-pack with the herbs sage, dill, basil, and cilantro. When I can find the others, I know I'll be buying them. And since almost anything can be found on Amazon (believe me there, someone who's a veteran of the "can't sleep, may as well online shop" conundrum), or through the company's own website (...), I'll likely be reaping the benefits of my harvest of those two soon.
