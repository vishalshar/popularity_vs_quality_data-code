If you don't prefer your shoes to be tied super tight, these will work well for you. Obviously if you're going to slip your shoes on, they are not going to be as tight as if you laced them up. All about preference. They seem to be holding up well on my running shoes and now I don't have to worry about stopping my work out to tie my shoes if they come untied.
