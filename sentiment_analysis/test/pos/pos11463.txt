I purchased this to complement my other D-Link products...cameras....sensors, etc.  This installed quickly and simply.  It immediately wanted to do a software update.  The product worked fine prior to the update.  The update put it back in a factory condition, so while the device shows up on your list of equipment in the HomeLink application, it is not actually operable.In order to get it to operate after the update you have to go back through the installation process.  Once that is done it works fine.A little disconcerting.  If you are on the road and the hardware requires an update, you might be out of service until you return home.  Some of the dlink products just start right back up...like the cameras, but the sensors and smart plugs seem a bit quirky.Love the App and like the products well enough to keep using them.  Love the water sensor...give me peace when gone.
