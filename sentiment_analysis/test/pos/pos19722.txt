Works great! The suction on the bottom is fantastic: haven't had any problems. The swivel arm works well: my wife and I adjust it to where we need it each time either of us drive the car without problem or issue. We both have iPhone 5's, but I think it would work with the iPhone 6 as well, and maybe even the 6 Plus. One of the two clasp arms moves to grab the phone when you push the phone against a button on the mount. I ended up attaching a piece of construction paper to the back to guard my phone against getting hot while its on the dash, so make sure if your dashboard isn't shaded to think about this.
