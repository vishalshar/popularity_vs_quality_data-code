This is rather cute, and it's an excellent idea. My mom and I played with this for a while today before my 7 and 5 year old got home from school. This is a Christmas gift so we were curious if we thought they'd like it. I think they will, and if they love it I'll give it the five stars they indicate.Pros, it's a nice design, nice materials, well made. I really like that the control box is behind two very well bonded strips of Velcro. I didn't want to pull too hard but I think the electronics can come out completely if it gets as filthy as I'm pretty sure my kids are going to get it. That is a big deal to me, it annoys me when things are designed to be trashed instead of cleaned.The phrases are nice. They're appropriate for whatever is going on. We were surprised that it knew when it was dropped and when it was caught as different events. The responses are also short, so you can hear a response by the time you're ready to throw it back.The only con is that this is L.O.U.D. There are two volumes on the control box and of course it was shipped on extra loud. The other setting won't make your ears bleed but it's still loud. This was partly due to playing with it indoors with a 73 year old grandma whose only sense to be lost is that of smell. She's always been sensitive to louder sounds. I'm just accustomed to the quiet time while the kiddos are at school.If this was suggested because you are looking at what a hatchimal would cost from a disgustingly greedy seller, I do recommend this as a neat gift. Sure, if your little one was dead set on the hatchimal this isn't a replacement, but if you have kids like mine that had a passing interest I'd say go for it. And then join me in waiting until December 26th for this ridiculousness to be over and a few extra greedy scrooges eating the cost of their efforts.
