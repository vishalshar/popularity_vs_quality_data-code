I recently bought 2 of these switches and installed in my house. The setup was less than smooth, and if your's isn't going well either, there are 2 things to know/try:1. Android phones with Marshmallow doesn't work - at least it didn't at the time of this review. The app setup sees the switch but then cannot connect to the home wifi. I tried an iPhone and the setup worked well. After setup, you can see the devices on the Android (Marshmallow) device.2. Try power restart or WiFi reset-ting the device. There are 2 small buttons below the big switch. You have you use your fingernail to press these. Resetting instructions are found on the Belkin website. To restart: press & hold "Power Restart" button for 5 sec. To Reset: press "Power Restart", then press & hold "WiFi Reset" button for 5 sec. You have to wait 90 sec after either one for the switch to come back online.Hope these help troubleshoot your issues.
