This drink is exactly what I was looking for in a nursing support product.  Not only is it delicious, it really seemed to help encourage my supply on days that seemed a little low.The taste is great!  I mixed it right in with water and a little ice.  I love the taste!I'm very pleased with this product and have purchased it several times throughout nursing my son.  Would recommend to others!
