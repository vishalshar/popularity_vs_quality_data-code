So much fun to play with!! Sort of relaxing in a way to play with this and watch how the Ferro fluid changes when using the wand. (I am not sure if it is called a wand, but is the word I chose for this review). I like that the wand is magnetized and sticks to the top of the display when not in use, which can help avoid losing it, with kids playing with it constantly. The size is perfect for many different sizes and shapes of hands.
