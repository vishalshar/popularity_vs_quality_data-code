A nearly perfectly designed and engineered device!  I use this with the Rocksmith game and I love the freedom to be able to wander around the room while playing.  Unplugging it and plugging into the charging station couldn't be easier.  I just wish there was a way to turn off the constant white light on the charging station when I'm trying to watch a movie in the dark...
