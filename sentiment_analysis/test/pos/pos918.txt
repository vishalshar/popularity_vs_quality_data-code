Fun device, kids love the doodles, and that you can call people in the friends list.Everything I have asked of Alexa, (with the exception of battery level which she states she cannot read, but that is reasonable) she does.She turns my lights on and off like I ask, she seems to work a little better than the first generation Dot that I  have, but they have upgraded that since.  I love the instant radio stations I programmed, and she plays all my Prime music.  Speakers are loud and sound very good for a small device.I would highly recommend especially for children and elderly parents.
