I stumbled upon this one night when trying to finish my Christmas shopping at the last minute.  As soon as I saw it I had a few possible people to give it to.  My immature 30 year old brother was the recipient.  He LOVES it..in fact he "can't wait 'til parade season".  Keep in mind it's a gag gift or part of a costume...just something fun.
