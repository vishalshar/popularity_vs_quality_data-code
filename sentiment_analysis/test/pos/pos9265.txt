I wanted an activity tracker that works, is unobtrusive, that I can leave on indefinitely and not have to charge regularly. Options that hit those targets are slim. I didn't want 537 other things, just track activity and give me time. . This does more than that but those are what I care about and so far it does those tasks very well.I played with other features and everything seems to work as advertised, but I doubt swimming,  running, alarm, etc functions will ever be used by me.  No trouble handling water so far and it has been submerged multiple times.The watch doesn't scream "look at me I'm on the tracker bandwagon", but when someone does notice it it gets complements as having a classy aesthetic. I didn't know if I would like the band but I get dirty at work and play and it cleans up so easily that I doubt I will move to a different band.The app seems ok, I will likely never use all the features as I mainly just want to see the needle get to/past 100% each day to reduce the chance my lazy inner self hasn't convinced me I did more than I thought.Overall very happy with this product
