This is a great product. Handle hard to get together, takes more turns than instructed to get to stick.  really works well on concrete and on clay aisles. Get is corners. Expensive but worth it not to have to use push broom which is not efficient around barn.  Hay and straw bits do stick and have to be removed before putting away, otherwise easy to care for.  Do not know hoe long will last, but hope do not have to buy another for at least a year dur to price. Will but again.
