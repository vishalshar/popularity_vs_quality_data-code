I have to say this is really cool. it came in very good condition and worked just fine. The camera has some great features, its real time and the video is very clear. the night vision is very good as well, of course you close the color  but its clear. I wish you could talk two-way, but its only one way. Also, I was wishing the scroll to turn the camera in 360 was a bit smoother and covered more footage per scroll. its slow to scroll the whole 360. In the iFameCare app, I wish you could separate the user settings and add some restrictions to who can do and view what. Lastly, the iFamCare app is spotty and loses connection, it goes off line a lot. However, I am hoping that it gets better with more users and over time. I have to say, that overall with all of that it is still a good buy.
