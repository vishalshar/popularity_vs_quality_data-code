Love it so far. Was able to install myself in a really short time frame. Easy to hook up and connect. Love that you can set a local or nearby weather station, in order to get a more accurate configuration. The defaults save myself a ton of time and water, by not worrying about sprinklers going off on or following a rainy day.The website and information provided is nice and clean, app functions really well.It may bother some that you don't have buttons on the front to manually manipulate your zones. I've not had an issue with it. Landscaper who tends to my yard can use the landscaper config on app, or manually turn on/off at the valves.Minor suggestions is that when setting up configuration of watering zones, I wish it provided better guidelines for a landscaping novice. Setting the right type of soil or nozzle type took a little research online for myself.Lastly, I really hope they get the relationship with SmartThings figured out so that integration can happen. This is my only major complaint at this point.
