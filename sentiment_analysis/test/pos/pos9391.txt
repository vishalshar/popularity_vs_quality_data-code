This is not some novelty product that passively attempts to achieve it's goal. This is a game changing experience that has to be felt to be appreciated and understood. As someone who makes music with a large emphasis on low end, this is an indispensable tool for my studio. In the past I would often crank my headphones in a vain attempt to perceive the low end. Consequently it's put my ears at a huge risk. Now all the guess-work on what rattles a rib cage is gone. My ears are now taking far less abuse because I no longer need to compensate. That fact alone makes it worth every penny, but it's hardly the only redeeming quality. Consider this. Before technology like this existed, any time you have ever felt this much bass presence up against your body, it's almost always accompanied with equally loud mids and highs that absolutely wreck your hearing. This technology eliminates that problem.Music you've heard dozens of times will suddenly be given new context and give you goosebumps all over again with this thing. Naturally genres with an emphasis on low end will leave a strong impression, but even music without that emphasis will have you completely engaged feeling the pulse of a kick drum on your back. I have also tried using it with video games. I think while it does add a new dimension to a gaming experience, some games with constant low frequency ambiance predictably present a potentially distracting and ever present rumble. Thankfully calibrating the subpac's intensity is as simple as turning a knob and can be adjusted to taste for different scenarios and personal preferences.The hardware itself is quality and durable. While the M2 is designed to be wearable, I can just as easily invert the arm straps and attach it to my chair. Doing this allows the subpac to still touch the same parts of my back as it would if I was wearing it. Alternatively I can just lay it against the back of my chair and the pads will focus on my lower back like the earlier S1/S2 models. I find this to be an easy method of using it to quickly listen to a song without strapping it on and off intermittently. According to their FAQ there is no harm leaning against it in your chair, but it's not recommended that anybody lay on their back using it.In summary, this is a must for all music lovers regardless of whether you create your own or not.
