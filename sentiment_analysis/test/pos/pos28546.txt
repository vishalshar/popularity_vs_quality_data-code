Fabulous chip, especially for those of us following the paleo diet but needing to cheat a little with a fried indulgence but wanting to stay as paleo friendly as possible by going with a coconut oil and sweet potato treat.  These chips are delicious and allow me to get my crunch-tooth satisfied once or twice a week with a small dish of them and I can make this little bag last for about a month getting maybe five or six small servings out of it.  I don't eat them with anything but instead enjoy them solo for maximum satisfaction, although they would certainly go well with the paleo coconut wraps.
