This is the first time I bought a Posh as replacement for my Blu. I was surprise how thin the Posh was, and the touch screen reacts much faster than the BLU. Then again this Posh is a octacore, for the price of a quadcore. I love the design and color (dark blue), its almost a pity to put a cover on it. Up till now I enjoy my Posh very much.
