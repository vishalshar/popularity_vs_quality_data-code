My Leaf finally arrived a week ago!! It came beautifully packed and it's even more pretty than I imagined it would be. I was a bit suspicious in the beginning so I used to compare my results with the ones in my old Fitbit but after seeing that they show the same results I started wearing only Leaf. Ever since I got it I barely take it off, it's like my wedding ring, a piece of jewellery I always wear. I usually choose to wear it as a pendant because I find it to be the most elegant way to fit into my everyday work outfit and during the night I simply clip it to my pyjamas. I regret that I can't take it showering with me because it's water resistant, but not waterproof but I'm sure that the company will think about it for the next generation.
