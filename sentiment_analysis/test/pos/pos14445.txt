We get raw milk for a local farm.  It comes in mason jars, so when I saw this I thought it might be good for when we need to pour the milk.  It is, mostly.There's a gasket-y sort of thing on the inside that allows this to really seal onto the jar tightly.  In fact, I find it slightly difficult to BREAK this seal when I'm ready to take the top off the jar.  I've had no issues with leakage.  The spout works GREAT for pouring, and the flip top doesn't flop down into the way or anything while I'm trying to pour.The only downside I've noticed is that if you shake the jar's contents, some of the liquid gets up inside the little cap on the pour spout, and then that dribbles down and makes a bit of a mess when it's opened up for pouring.  I don't supposed there's any way around that.I like this, and would buy it again (in fact, I probably WILL buy a second one), but I try to avoid shaking the contents once the lid is on, if I can help it.
