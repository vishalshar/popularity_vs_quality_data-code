Bought this for a friend's house as a Thanksgiving present.  While watching football/movies on their nice Samsung panel, it was always hard to hear the sound (especially when there are 10 people around it).  The Enclave system was the perfect solution.  Needed it to be wireless and simple at the same time.  Setup was a breeze, kids (4 of them) had the 5.1 system up and running in less than 21 minutes (yes, we timed it).Sound was fantastic.  As soon as we put football on, the folks in the room had big grins on their face, it was better than being on the field.  It's amazing to me that kids (under 30) have really not experienced 5.1 surround sound at home - nor do older folks as it's just too complicated.  With the advent of cheap wireless speakers (even expensive ones), the quality surround sound audio experience in the home has been forgotten.  Based on the Enclave system, I hope that trend reverses!
