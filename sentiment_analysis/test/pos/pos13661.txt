I do not care for whiteboards and how they look when hanging up. I decided to try this as an alternative in my office at work. This was easy to apply to a wall and I have moved it around several times.  Removing it does not damage the wall and sticks just as well to the next location. I have also tried Writey Boards and can confidently say I will always buy the Thank Board brand in the future.My hope is that Think Board makes an even larger option for the future.
