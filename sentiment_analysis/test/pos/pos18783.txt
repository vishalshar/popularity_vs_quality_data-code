We purchased this as a replacement cover as our toddler has taken over our iPad. It's been great. He drops it and it's completely fine. The handle is great for him to tote it around. Only negative I think is it's a little difficult to plug in our iPad since the case is kind of thick. My son loved it I can't wait to travel with it soon.
