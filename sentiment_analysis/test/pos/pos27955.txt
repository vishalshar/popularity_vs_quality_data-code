Okay, first off, I did not get this at discount price or free. I paid full $100.It is a great headphone. It does leak sound, It is over the ears so you get an amazing surround sound. You will hear outside noise even unless you have it cranked up to the max volume level. But then that means you are sharing your music with the world. It is a little bulky but not obnoxious. I love the design, simple and classy. I have the all black with the subtle gold. The packaging is one of a kind! Over all I give it 4 stars. I just wish you could hear your music at a mid level volume range without hearing outside noise.
