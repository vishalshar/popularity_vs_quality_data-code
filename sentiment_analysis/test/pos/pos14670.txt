These sheets are definitely in my Top 5 list of things that make my life easier as a first-time mom. My daughter is a frequent spitter-upper, and changing the sheet is a breeze. Wrestling the mattress to change the mattress pad and the sheet "base" only need to happen occasionally, and at my convenience. My recommendation is to buy the drop-in base + 1 sheet set, and then buy two more of the zip-on sheets.
