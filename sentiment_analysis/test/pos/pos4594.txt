I bought this programmable drone for my brother as a gift. He was really excited, as he had always wanted a robot, let alone a drone! I watched him play around with it: it kept him busy for a few hours, and seemed to really love building it and figuring out how to code for it. What I really liked: just the right challenge for anyone interested in 'coding' to fly it.There are no instruction manuals; everything is on the website so don't freak out if you can't find diagrams. The website has all the tutorials, and my brother found his way fairly quickly even without my help. If you know a tinkerer in your life, this is definitely an awesome gift.
