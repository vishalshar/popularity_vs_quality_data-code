I ordered this as a second FitBark to give as a gift after using my first FitBark nearly two months. This is one of those products that deserves two separate reviews, because there are really two different things: an app and a device. I gave it 5 stars overall because the device has exceeded my expectations. The app is not yet perfect, but I have witnessed constant improvements with every update in my short time as a user. Also noteworthy - the customer service is tremendous. I have emailed a couple of times and always gotten a helpful answer back same day.The device:Things I love: it's smaller and lighter than I thought. It's very durable. Lola isn't nice to it (she starts chaos at the dog park), and her best friend is a Macaw (it's survived several times under the pressure of that beak). Even after 2 months, the FitBark still looks very good. IÂ’m averaging a week + between charges. I appreciate the attachment mechanism, which  is designed so that I don't have to remove it from Lola's collar to charge the Fitbark, which is very convenient.The app:It was easy to get started. The design is unique, intuitive, and I figured out the basics after a few minutes of playing with it. Everything felt natural, although I would have expected a bit of a tutorial in the beginning. They keep adding new features and it seems to load and update quicker than it did last month.Bottom Line: I'm a non-tech savvy dog lover and I use FitBark literally every day. I can honestly say it has made me a much better dog parent and I highly recommend it. It's one of those things I didn't know I needed and now can't live without.I've attached a photo of the Fitbark on Lola's collar (you can see it's pretty small). I've also attached a photo of the new fitbark I'm giving as a gift next to the old Fitbark Lola has been wearing for just over 2 months now. It's worth mentioning, Lola isn't nice to it. She plays hard with dogs at the dog park and we also have a Macaw at home who I've caught chewing on the Fitbark more than once. And after all that, only a few very minor scratches. I'm very impressed.
