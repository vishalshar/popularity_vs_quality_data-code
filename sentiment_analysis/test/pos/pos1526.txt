They are a good solution to use with children with special needs who have difficulty tying their shoes. Unless there is some other type of shoe fastening that I have yet to find that works better?Thought that the shoes would be easier to put on and off but they are not as easy. Maybe with time it will get easier? Hard to say right now.
