We received our Bluesmart luggage a few days ago and at first did not figure out how to turn it on. There is actually an OFF/ON switch on the battery itself inside the luggage under the lining that was set to OFF, so check that if you cannot power yours on!After turning it on and downloading the app on the Play Store (Used it with my OnePlus One running the latest Android OS), I promptly connected to the luggage to try out the features. Everything worked as advertised, lights, scale, and most importantly the lock. It has two usb ports, one inside it's front pocket, and one on the back of the carry-on.The front pocket fits my macbookÂ air perfectly and is quite convenient for that, and I could also use the inner ipad-formatted pocket to carry my Kindle around while it's loading. The main compartment is a bit smaller than regular carry-ons because of the embedded components but will do just fine for a 2-3 days getaway.Regarding the finish of the object itself, it looks smart and elegant, and it seems durable/sturdy, but $400 might be a bit pricy for what you get.I think this is a great start for BlueSmart and to be honest I'd be even more interested in a check-in sized luggage.
