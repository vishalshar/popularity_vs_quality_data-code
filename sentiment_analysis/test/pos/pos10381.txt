-- warning -- The Build and Imagine folks are offering a 20% off coupon for buyers who leave reviews for their toys.  I consider this an invisible thumb on the scale if not disclosed.  That being said, the toy is entertaining - easy to build with, altho you have to be creative to make some of the configurations work and the kids were puzzled that that meant that the scenes on the walls didn't always make sense as built.  There are lots of scenes and accessories to build story lines around.  I would have two comments - there is only one 'doll' in this toy and it would have been better and certainly cheap enough to add a second doll to be able to have interaction between two characters.  And there are quite a few tiny pieces that are easily lost.  The box is way too big for storing the pieces.  You can store everything in a large (gallon) ziplock bag.
