I am no a senior but I need the great call service because I have heart issues. I had the basic flip phone and it broke and being used to Android I found it too basic for me. So I purchased the smartphone so I could have the usual android experience. I used the advanced home screen but this phone also has a basic straight forward screen if you are new to smartphones. I transferred my service and like always the great call peeps were friendly and helpful and helped me get activated rather painlessly. The phone seems pretty good for 150 bucks and has a decent amount of memory for apps. The calling plans are very flexible and economical depending on how much you plan to use the phone. The coverage is good even in the country. The phone works well and shipping was fast thanks to Amazon prime. I think this would make a great first smartphone for seniors and the great call service is in my humble opinion so much better and more flexible than the I've fallen and can't get up button. The only downside is the lack of accessories, specifically screen protectors for it.
