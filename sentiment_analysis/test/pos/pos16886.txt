Thanks Soma for the perfect water pitcher.  The Soma Pitcher holds up to 80 ounces of water.  This is so perfect, its made  of shatter-proof  BPA free plastic.  A very stylish wood handle made from sustainable white oak.  I love the lid that opens automatically for easy filling, it's the  best feature. Perfect for my filtered water.  A well designed and environmentally  friendly pitcher.  No more lugging in water bottles.  So stylish I can leave it displayed on the counter.  The water has never tasted better thanks to Soma.  The best  part is not removing the lid to fill it up.  A great product.  I have no problem recommending this to my family, friends and consumers.  This would make a perfect gift.
