This shampoo is quite possibly the best product I have ever used on my hair. It makes it feel like mermaid hair (think Disney princess and how flawless those locks can be). Smells absolutely delicious, lathers up like a dream, and washes out easily. Worth every penny especially when you have hair that is 12"+ and all other shampoos weigh it down. I love that it is all-natural and sustainably harvested. The only con is that I may never be able to use another shampoo again.
