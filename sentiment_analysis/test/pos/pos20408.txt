I got the PetSafe Elite Large Dog Trainer Collar and then got this so I could use both collars with one remote.  This collar works great with my dog, I use the collar for when my dogs have to go outside since we do not have a fenced in backyard.  We used to just hook them up to leads when they needed to go outside but I got tired of buying lead wires every few months because they would get twisted up and impossible to fix. Now my wife and I just walk out on the back deck with the remote and let our dogs do their thing in the yard.  We rarely have to use the shock function, we just give a verbal warning then the beeps and the shock as the last resort.  We actually don't even use this collar most days now since our dog knows to stay in the yard now even with all of the distractions such as the road, tons of children running around, and other dogs running around from an apartment complex behind us.  We have had to keep the other trainer collar on our German Shepherd though because he is smart enough to know when it is not on and likes to test the limits of the yard.  We have only had a handful of instances where we could not get the collar to break our dogs fixation with a distraction.  I bought this collar because it is the best priced waterproof training collar which is important to us because we like to take the dogs to the creek/lake and let them go off leash.I only have two negatives which is why 4 out of 5 stars.  First is that the rubber piece that covers the charging port came off both collars (not sure if this will effect the waterproofing).  The second is that you need to make sure that if you cut the collar down that you burn the edge with a lighter.  I cut it the first time and did it but I left plenty of room because my dog was still growing.  My wife cut it the second time and did not know about burning the edge and now the collar is all frayed.  This was not a problem with the large dog collar because the whole collar is made of a rubber material so you can just cut it.
