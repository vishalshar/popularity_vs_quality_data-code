My absolute favorite Banana Muffin mix! I am celiac and have gotten my homemade breads and baked good recipes down to a science that most people I share food with don't even realize what they're eating is gluten free. I mastered a GF banana muffin/bread on my own without mix, but Simple Mills was always a little bit more moist and overall better.They're easy in a pinch, save time, and taste great. I feel good about the ingredients I am consuming. I use avocado oil and it works great. Amazon's price is usually right on target with Legman's, +/- $1. I always keep this mix in my Amazon cart and if the price drops, I buy, even if I have some on the pantry shelf already.
