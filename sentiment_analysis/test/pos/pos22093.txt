I saw these and thought, why not just put the cheese in a zip lock bag, lot cheaper.  Then I got some for christmas as a stocking stuffer.  Finally got around to using them and can say they work so much better than plastic bags or cling wrap.  The cheese last much longer and stays fresh.  Seems strange as they are only paper bags with a plastic lining (you can reuse them if you are careful) but they do work so while they do cost more than zip lock bags they pay for themselves by keeping the cheese longer.
