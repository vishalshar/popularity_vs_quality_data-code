After buying and returning two competing batteries that did not work to power my laptop, this battery does what I primarily wanted in an external battery pack.  The USB charging ports work for smaller devices like phones or tablets, but if the device doesn't charge with a USB port then plugging into the wall-type socket is a great option.  Now I can watch a movie all the way through on a flight that doesn't have power outlets between the seats (or, as has often happened, when the seat power outlet isn't working).
