I should have realized from the product description that the actual storage must be purchased separately.  Buy a MicroSD card along with this, folks!  When mine arrived, I was able to add it in with very little problem, and now it works fine!It has a very clean fit flush with the edge of the laptop, and can be removed relatively easily with a thumbnail or small tool.  It's also nice to have that hole in the laptop covered up.
