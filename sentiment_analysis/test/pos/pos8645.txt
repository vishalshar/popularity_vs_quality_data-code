I had a knockoff of the original Nomad USB keychain charger, but it died, and in reading the reviews of the Nomad, this seems to be a problem with any charger you keep on your keyring that has the gold contacts for either the Lightning (iPhone) or USB connector exposed. There's all sorts of things in my pocket, from keys to dog treats to plastic bags, and when the keys are in the ignition of my cars they get knocked around a lot, so it's no surprise that a solution with exposed connectors failed after a bit of time.So when I saw this available, I thought - Yes! this is going to be the solution for me, but in ordering it I found I had to wait a couple of weeks for shipping so I found an alternative option which isn't a carabiner, but does have a bottle opener built in and truthfully, I like that one much better, for one reason only - it is much smaller than the Nomadclip, which is quite enourmous - too big to fit comfortably in my pocket and because it's a carabiner, sometimes the keys get accidentally detached from the clip.So now, the Nomadclip lives on a loop on my work bag, which is just fine, and it's easier than schlepping out my whole keyring, putting it on a desk or table in between my phone and computer.My only suggestions to Nomad are: make it narrower and provide a locking mechanism for the Carabiner clip - that would rate a five star review, but given that I had to find an alternate role for this quite expensive charger, I feel compelled to take away a star for these design misses.Pros: Amazingly sturdy and well-crafted carabiner with solid metal core Easy open clip (sometimes too easy, see below) Protected connectors much less likely to failCons: Expensive Too big for most pockets Carabiner sometimes opens and keys slide off in your pocket Charging cord is actually shorter than alternative option that has a smaller profilePhoto:The Nomad and the AmaziPro8 iPhone Charge Sync Cable + Bottle Opener next to each other. See which one is on my keys....the Nomad is just too big, so it's going on my work bag.
