? A very well-made set. Glad I purchased this. Totally worth the money. If you look closely at the picture the knife is actually in the center it's very cool. The tools are sturdy. They fit so nicely in the beautiful case that matches. I put this in the back of my urban bike in a lunch bag that's insulated in a Brooklyn bicycle box. I am sure I will have plenty of use for these they are part of my biking toolkit. So when I stop at the grocery store for a salad or fruit while bicycling or even the deli that sells salads I will have the perfect addition this lovely set that I purchased in red. Would buy again and definitely would recommend!
