I liked the simplicity of this product - it has only one button and the measurement is immediate. The smartphone sync was OK; the accompanying app works well but the bluetooth connection can be a bit spotty. I'd consider the syncing as more of a gimmick compared to the primary function of this device. One bonus point for the friendly industrial design and simple display, particularly compared to a lot of "grey thermometers" with ambitious buttons in the market.
