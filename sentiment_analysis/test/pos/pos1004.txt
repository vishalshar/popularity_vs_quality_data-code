Great app for the avid golfer. Provides insight into your strengths and weaknesses on the course and provides some basic tips on the areas of your game to improve. Tap the club against the game tracker, feel it vibrate and beep and your all set for your shot. After each round, I edit the pin locations to where they actually were since the device assumes the pins are in the middle of the green.I've contacted the support group a few times with questions and they have been very quick in responding and making improvements. My home course has 3 nines and it was a pain to complete a 9-hole round and then start a new 9-hole round. The guys provided a 27-hole layout where I can now play any pair of nines for an 18-hole round. They were also very quick in updating the yardage for one of the nines. I've used for 4 rounds with no issues. Love it.
