I love this camera! I can check on my babies whenever I want. In the beginning they were very confused to hear my voice and would be howling ( although I couldn't hear it, I could tell my big boy was doing it)or hiding, which broke my heart. They would refuse the treats too. But I started to show them the camera, throw treats and talk to them every time before leaving the house. They are still a little bit confused, looking for me around the house and poking their heads out of the window, but I can tell they are excited too and are even eating the treats. I hope they come up with a version with a microphone so we can listen them too. One of my best purchases ever!!!
