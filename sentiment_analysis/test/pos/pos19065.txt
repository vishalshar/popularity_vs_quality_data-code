I didn't have a specific reason for ordering this....it just looked so darn handy, knew I'd use it for something!  Turns out to be perfect for my purse.  I put the Qlipter on one of my desk drawer pulls, and my purse stays off the floor.  No more stepping on it....rolling my chair over it...all those ugly things that I've subjected my purse to forever.  How DID I live without it???
