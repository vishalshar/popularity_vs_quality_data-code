I ordered the Grip Boost Football/Sports Towel for my son. He is very happy with it and wants me to order another. He loves that it is small and almost weightless, yet very absorbent (playing football in Ga. in August, it gets so hot). He's most impressed that it can clean and dry his gloves. I've washed it a few times already, and it has retained it's shape and is still just as absorbent. It fits easily onto his belt and stays in place throughout the game.
