ubject: The only alternative pasta my kids will eatI don't usually leave Amazon reviews but I felt like I had to write something. My kids are pasta fiends. It's important to us that they eat healthy, so I've been trying to find something better. We've tried the konjac, spaghetti squash, edamame, black bean, red lentil, green lentil. Banza is the first one they really like.Some advice: While it's close, this pasta is not identical to regular pasta. It has a hint of a chickpea flavor. That flavor is enjoyable, but we figured starting with a flavorful sauce would be best. These days we serve Banza with just butter, garlic, and olive oil and they love it, but I'm not sure if I would've started that way.Overall, so happy I found this product. It's our new go-to!
