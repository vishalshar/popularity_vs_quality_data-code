This watch is awesome! Does exactly what I need it to do. Show me the time ALL the time. Show me my texts and emails. Perfect. I don't mind saving $30 and not having a heart rate monitor either. I don't understand bad reviews for a product when it does exactly what it says. No heart rate monitor.Edit: I changed out the band with a canvas nato strap. The silicone band that came with it was very soft and comfortable but I didn't care for the "fitness" look. I think the green canvas makes it look a little more tactical.
