Let me just preface this review with saying that this is the first review I've ever written. I love the product that much! I haven't received any benefit from writing it, and I'm not associated with the company whatsoever.I used to spend $50-$100 a month on adjustments or massages due to poor posture. I spend a lot of Monday through Friday sitting at a desk or in meetings.  My posture is horrible while sitting and even when walking.Pros- The BetterBack is super light so I can carry it any where, it is compact so it doesn't take much room at all, it takes seconds to put on, and it generally sits low enough that no one knows that I'm wearing a "back brace". It 100% allows you to sit in a good sitting position, distribute your weight to your hips, push your shoulders back to an upright position, and allows you to sit comfortably.Cons- I have noticed when the chair is really bad or you can't sit with your feet flat on the ground (such as when sitting on a bar stool), my legs will go numb after 30 minutes. Like everyone probably should, you should wear the BetterBack but still get up every 45-60 minutes and walk, if possible.One last comment- I'm currently pregnant (32 weeks) and have loved using this brace for all sitting activities.  It reminds my muscles and I to walk and sit better even when it isn't on.
