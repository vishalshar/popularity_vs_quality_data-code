My kitty was a couple pounds overweight, so I decided to purchase this after doing some research. I wanted a grain free, low-calorie option and this fits the bill! I was also happy to see that it is made in the USA without ingredients sourced from China. My cat has been on this food for about 1.5 months now and she's already looking leaner! Will definitely be sticking with this food.
