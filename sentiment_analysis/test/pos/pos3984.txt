We got this last week for our elderly mini-schnauzer that has a heart condition and is on diuretics. She's constantly peeing in the house because she can't help it.  We put it in the kitchen with her for the first few days and got her use to getting on and off of it, making sure she understood that she was allowed on it.  Then this weekend we sprinkled some leaves on top of it that she had peed on outside.  Today, about a week after we bought it, we checked the little drawer and there it was all nicely collected for us instead of all over the kitchen floor causing a stink.  I couldn't smell it at all. I just happened to check it.  I would recommend this to anyone in a similar situation. The middle sized one is large enough and sturdy enough for our girl.
