I was skeptical about these, but they really work. I bought a lot of cheese around the holidays and used these bags. Every variety lasted much longer than they do when wrapped in plastic. I did not think I could reuse the bad that had stored a runny brie, but after a day, the cheese bits dried and I could easily clean the bag. They are pricey, so you won't want to toss them after one use.
