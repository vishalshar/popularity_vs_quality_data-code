Purchased the water garden back in JuneÂ—received the radish sprouts and the wheatgrass seeds as part of the kit, which makes sense, because they grow so fast! Super exciting for a kid to see happen, less exciting for me because I don't really like either. I swapped out the wheatgrass/radish sprouts with lettuce, basil, and cilantro, and have been enjoying watching it grow. I couldn't put it in a super sunny spot, so I purchased a grow light, and also got a couple snails to clean out the sludge. They powered through a fully dirty tank in a day or two! Can't wait to eat fresh salads from my aquaponic garden soon!
