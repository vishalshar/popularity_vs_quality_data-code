I've only used a few days, but I can say what an awesome phone for the price.  Works flawlessly on T-Mobile.  Day to day use has been good, battery life is average.  Camera is good, though I haven't tried any low light photos yet.  Only bugs I've noticed, had problems plugging it in to my laptop to transfer music and other files.  I had to use OneDrive to get all my stuff.  Other issue seems to be 5 GHz Wi-Fi.  Sometimes it shows connected, but no internet access.  All my other devices stay connected fine.  The Snapdragon 808 is good enough.  I bought it for $180, and for that price, you can't go wrong.
