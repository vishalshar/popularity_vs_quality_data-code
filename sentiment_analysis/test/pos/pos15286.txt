Customer service contacted me personally with my concerns. They answered my email within an hour. They are making it their mission to make me happy. For me, it's ALL about customer service. I have never been this pleased with how they are handeling my issue with the bottle top. I will highly recommend this company simply for how they deal with the customer.I'm a fitness instructor and I go through a lot of water during class. I wanted to use this bottle. One issue I have is that I have to unscrew the cap completely to drink. There is no drink spout. For me, this matters. I wouldn't mind purchasing an additional top with a drink spout if was an option. However, this bottle does not leak so I can put it in my gym bag and everything else stays  dry. Plus the shape is fun.
