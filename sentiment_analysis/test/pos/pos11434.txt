Excellent phone and features for the price. It looks much more expensive. Good construction and features like fingerprint unlock, strong flash light, nice speaker. I had the one plus one which I used for 2 years and still working. Now upgraded to one plus 2. Only minor issue is the new type of charger which you have to remember carry with you wherever you go as it is not so common.
