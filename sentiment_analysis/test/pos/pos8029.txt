I haven't used a wireless in many years...and they've come a long way since then.  And I almost didn't buy this one, because these days I only play at home.  But I hate dragging the cord around...and after they've had some use, you start hearing pops and static through your amp.  So, I pulled the trigger on this wireless after reading mostly great reviews, and watching a lot of videos online where the folks seemed really happy with it.I'm glad I did.  It works exactly as advertised!  The sound is crystal clear (with one caveat, which I'll get to), it's simple to use, and suits my needs perfectly.You can read the product info for yourself...I found the product description to be pretty accurate.  All I can add are some results I got in my specific case, which I hope might be helpful to someone considering buying this.First of all, I live in a two story house, and my guitar rig is in the corner room on the second floor.  The family room is on the other side of the house, downstairs.  Straight line distance is maybe 40 feet...but that's through a couple walls.  So the first thing I did, after pulling the thing out of the box and plugging it in, was jam the transmitter in my guitar and start walking downstairs!  Once I go to the family room, it was still working....but there were a few instances where it cut out, and a delay between what I played and what I heard.  Clearly, I was beyond the useful range of the system, at that point.  If I were that far away with no walls between me and the base, I'm certain it would have been just fine.  And I don't know if the battery was charged fully or nearly dead, either...so that might have had an effect, too!  But from anywhere even remotely close to the base station, the performance is indistinguishable from a good cable.  On a small stage, I think it would work perfectly.  However, in my experience, drunk people like to get grabby with your stuff if you wander around the bar...and this transmitter comes out just as easy as a guitar cord!  Something to think about if you're using it live and walking through your throngs of fans!  At home, it's perfect.  I have not noticed any interference from any of the devices in our home.I LOVE the way you can unplug the transmitter from the guitar silently.  This is one of the best features, IMO, cause I often swap guitars while I'm playing.  This allows me to do it with no pops or buzzing, which is also easier on my equipment!It's not perfect...you probably already know that on a strat-style guitar with the jack on the front, it will prevent your whammy bar from swinging freely all the way around.  This wasn't a concern for me...my tremolo bars are set up so they don't swing freely anyway.  Of slightly more concern is that on my Ibanez S570DQXM, the transmitter is a touch too thick to allow it to be inserted all the way into the jack.  My Ibanez doesn't have a traditional metal jack plate like a Strat...instead, it's got a hole drilled in the body.  The hole appears to have a bit of a taper to it, and the transmitter stops just a little short!  I think I can relieve the inside of the hole with my dremel, just a tiny bit, and this will fix the problem.  This is something to think about if you have an S-body Ibanez...you may want to try the transmitter in your guitar before you buy.I don't know how long the battery lasts, because I've not run it all the way out yet.  I've gone 5 or 6 hours between charges though, and it was still going strong.I like this unit, and if something happened to the one I have, I'd buy it again!
