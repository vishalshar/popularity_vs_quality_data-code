When these little bad boys arrived I have to admit I was a bit Skeptical, I thought they would not feel tight and break easily. However they did exactly as advertised they were super comfortable and did not have to worry about laces coming undone anymore. Every once in awhile one or two loops comes undone, and its a little hard to loop it back on while they are on your feet. So I end up taking the shoe off to redo, but slipping on and off is incredibly easy. Four stars only because of the slight difficultness of relooping a band if it pops, but thats just me being picky. Definitely pick up a box it does one pair of shoes
