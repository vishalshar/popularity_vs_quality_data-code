Overall I like it and plan to keep it. it's better than the ones that work with blue tooth. with Garadget, you can control the door from anywhere. the price is right too. Installation is simple and takes less than 15 minutes.One downside I think is that the app does not require a simple (4 digit) password to operate to prevent accidental operations. as long as you are logged in to the iphone, the app just opens up with a click and anyone that holds the phone can open the door. If you forget to close the app after you closed the door, you might accidentally open the door while you are far from home and not notice it. the second issue not requiring a second layer of security that I actually experienced was that while we were out and my 7 years old was playing game with the phone, curiously opened up the app and opened the garage door. Obviously he did not know what he has done, but fortunately he told me that he touched the app and I closed down the garage door. If there was a simple password requirement when app opens, this would have been prevented. But again, I like the hardware and the app. I hope Garadget fix this issue in their future app updates.
