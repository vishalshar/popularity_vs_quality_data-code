Love love love. I use these every day for a little extra volume. Easy to use and stay in place once you figure them out (I have very fine shoulder length hair). I agree with some other reviewers that the cure lets can be uncomfortable against the scalp, but it's not too bad.Officially throwing out my other rollers, these are superior!
