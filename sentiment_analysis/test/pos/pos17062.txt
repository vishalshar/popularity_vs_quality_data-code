Great device. I keep the case on my phone 24/7 and have not had any problems with it. I have two bike mounts - one on each of my road bikes and have used it for over a year now. Never any problems with it. - no shaking or rattling - no noise at all from road vibrations or anything. I've hit a dozen or so hard pot holes and the mount is rock solid. Overall perfect product! Thanks!
