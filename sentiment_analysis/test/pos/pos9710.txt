I've been experimenting with a variety of mounts that will keep my phone secure and in-view when riding. I have a garmin computer on my racing bike, and I really like the way the mount works, so I decided to look to see if there was anything like that for cellphones. The Quad Lock mount, plus the Universal Adapter fits the bill. I've been using it for several months, and it keeps the phone (Galaxy 6S) very secure, and right where I want it. I put the QuadLock Universal Adapter on my cellphone case, and then I have a suction mount in my truck, and this on my bicycle - they all work exceptionally well.
