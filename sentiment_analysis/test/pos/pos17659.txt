I got this to help me clean wire wheels on motorcycles, as well as other types of wheels on vehicles. I'm not a fan of the drill-powered stuff because if you don't keep the surfaces wet, you can damage them. If you're looking for an enjoyable product which can provide a continuous stream of water on the surface while the bristles spin, this is what you should grab--and it's brilliantly-priced.Mine came with 2 brush types, a soft and a firm, and it included a quick-disconnect fitting kit. I use quick-disconnects on all of my garden hoses and accessories, so I see the value in this. You can vary the flow of water and simultaneously the rotational speed, using an easy-to-reach thumb control.The bristle head is large enough to clean a significant portion of a wheel at a time, but is still able to fit between the spokes. When I became aggressive in my cleaning technique, I had the head pop off a couple of times--but this was because I started to go too quickly. The heads are also easy/quick to change.If I had one request for a change on this product, it would be the ability to control the flow independently of the rotational speed of the head. I realize the physics behind the design, so I know why it works the way it does at present--there are just a few times where I'd like a lower water flow with a maximum rotational speed. Perhaps this is possible in a new revision.Overall, this is a fabulous product, and if you haven't already put it in your cart, you need to.
