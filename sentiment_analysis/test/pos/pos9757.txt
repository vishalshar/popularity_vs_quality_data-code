So many uses for this little guy I may just buy a few more. This little alarm is about the size of a finger, is well constructed and gives off a good loud alarm sound when triggered. Can be used on backpack/luggage/purse zippers, attach it to your door or carry it as a personal alarm when you're walking alone or at night. Whatever you need this is a pretty versatile little alarm. Have only used this a few times since giving it to my son for Christmas but very pleased so far with this purchase.
