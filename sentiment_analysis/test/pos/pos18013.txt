I was looking for a spray cap adapter for my mason jar and I found this online. It was BPA free so I decided to give it a try. I was a bit surprised when I got it in the mail and the plastic stem was really long. No big deal, I just cut the stem to the size that I needed for my 12oz mason jar. I screwed this lid onto the mason jar and tried to use the spray. There was a bit of al leakage at first but I played around with the lid and really tightened the nozzle and the lid. Like as hard as possible. That seemed to do the trick
