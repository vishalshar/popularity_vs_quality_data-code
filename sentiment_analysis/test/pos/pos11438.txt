An excellent product with great customer support. I chose Autel over DJI because the Phantom, while well reviewed, is well known for horrible or even non-existant customer support. When I had a problem with my Autel, due to no fault of theirs, they immediately replaced it with a brand new unit. I highly recommend them!
