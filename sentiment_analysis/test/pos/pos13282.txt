Moov NOW Personal Coach & Workout Tracker (2nd Gen), Fusion RedI am just not a big fan of any activity trackers. I just find them totally pointless. The fitbit etc. count the number of steps etc. but I personally believe that data is absolutely useless. I agree they might motivate some people to reach a set goal of target steps per day. I think that motivation wont last long, and even if it does, number of steps is hardly an indication of the amount of exercise you are getting. When I watched the ad for moov, I was interested in the idea of coaching me and giving me live feedback on a particular activity. So, I figured something like that would make much more sense and wanted to try it out.And I am pleased. It gives me really good feedback and gives me short goals to reach, take a small break and again continue depending on the level I chose for myself. That made running on a treadmill(which I consider to be the most boring thing in world) engaging and interesting all of a sudden. Then the body workout is completely awesome. The fact that it keeps track of my reps and sets, and depending on how i improve, I can upgrade to the next level. Being someone who hated going to gym because I prefer outdoors but my work-times etc. don't allow for it; moov now has made me look forward to going to gym every evening. It is like a competition with myself and one to enjoy.However, all goods are coming with one bad. The wrist band it comes with is downright bad. Really bad. It is made of whats looks like rubber, and is hard to fasten and unfasten from your wrist. Always takes a bit of pulling and yanking for me. There are so many complaints that the trackers falls out of the band, and I can totally see that happening to me some time though it hasn't happened so far. The knob on wrist band that locks and unlocks keeps coming off. The moov website has a video on how to put it back, but haven't they thought what happens if it just falls of and I lose it someday. Anyway, the band is just really. I wish the company changed just the band, or maybe atleast some third party bands become available.In all, I love my moov now tracker. I have running, brisk walk, body workout routines so far. I am yet to try swimming and have to wait till spring or summer for that of course. I am going to try the boxing also soon and will update. The boxing workout sounds very interesting though.
