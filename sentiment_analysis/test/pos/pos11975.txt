I love that this product is produced from Birch, rather than from corn. And it's a good product if you don't get gastric distress from it. (I've discovered that I do, if you consider "gastric distress" equal to Dulcolax on steroids.) I've read that this effect may go away with usage (start slow and work up.) The grains are larger than I'd prefer. Five pounds of this stuff is going to last me a long, long time if I can only tolerate a tiny bit at a time!Might make "something special" to take to my boss next time he chews me out, though! (I'm thinking...flax flour/bran brownies with Xylitol-cream cheese frosting.)
