This is my second Rokform case. I had to get a new one when I upgraded to an iphone 6. The case is very rugged and I feel that it gives my phone the best protection. It has a rubber shell that fits the phone tightly and is angled on the outside. It is covered with an aluminum outer shell.  I highly recommend any of the Rokform products!
