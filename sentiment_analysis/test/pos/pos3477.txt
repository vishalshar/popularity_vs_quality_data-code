LOVE LOVE these gels!  They fueled me through the Chicago Marathon this year- my first marathon!  I had been using another gel for long runs in training-  but they were thick and kind of nasty.  I also finally figured out that they were causing my stomach cramping- not just the long miles.  Switched to these and no cramping! Yay!  The provided a good, clean, smooth, quick-acting energy, with no big crash after it wore off.  These are much more "watery :(which i LOVE), and easier for me to use on the run- texture is closer to a thick energy drink than a typical gel  They tasted good too!  I switched to them the last 2 weeks before the marathon- was nervous to switch to something new so close- but am SUPER glad that I did!  It was so nice that I got no cramping at all during the marathon!  The only con- they are much bigger than a typical gel, maybe 3-4 times the size- but I use a hydration pack so I had the room.  Can't recommend these enough!
