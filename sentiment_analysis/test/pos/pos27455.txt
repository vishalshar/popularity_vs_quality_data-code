I ordered this as a Christmas gift for our family. Specifically choosing this one over others because it comes with the smaller mouth pieces as well as the larger ones. The small ones fit our small 8 year old but it was truly a stretch to fit, but the large ones fit well for the adults. Game is entertaining as the word choices are perfect for the purpose of the game. To clean we used boiling water and dish soap which works nicely.
