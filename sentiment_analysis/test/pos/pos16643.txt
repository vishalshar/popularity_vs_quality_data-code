This is fantastic.  I just tested this unit and I am very pleased.  I let my dog loose on a trail and it accurately tracked him in real time and showed his position on a map on my smartphone and sent me text alerts. It sets up a perimeter around your house and will alert you via text if your dog leaves the perimeter. I am a dog sitter and this is perfect for those guests who are skittish or escape artists.The initial setup was frustrating; the unit doesn't like Android.  When I tried to register it, I had some problems with it not accepting my email and password.  After resetting the phone and trying several more times it did accept the registration. Then the confirmation email didn't send the first time, and when I tried to resend it, it couldn't do it.  However, after several tries after exiting and restarting the program, it finally sent the email and I was able to register.It is slim, compact and light weight, unlike other similar products. After snapping it to my dog's collar, he didn't even realize it was there.
