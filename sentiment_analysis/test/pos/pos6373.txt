Install of the mount is really easy and only requires an Allen key/ hex wrench. The color of the swivel part of the base has begun to fade due to sun. The case itself is very good and pretty easy to get on and off. The wrist strap/ safety strap attached to the case comes in handy off the motorcycle as well. The magnet feature comes in very handy. Just find a piece of the motorcycle's frame,and your phone will be with hands reach whenever you're wrenching. Just make sure the magnet is able to attach before letting go completely. The only complaint I have and its really a minor one, is the plastic 1/4 turn attach system. While trying to get used to it, the attachment point are some showing some dents. The dents come from trying to attach the phone to the mount when attachment points are not perfectly aligned. The dents are mostly cosmetic but still, and can be seen in the pictures.
