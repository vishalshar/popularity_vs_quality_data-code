I bought a few of Seedling Designs as housewarming gifts for the young children of clients of mine.  I was not sure what to expect, but may I just say that I love it!  It is so much more than I expected. The presentation is above and beyond!  I have not opened it so am not sure what is inside, but I suspect it is going to be just as good as it looks.  Well worth the price!
