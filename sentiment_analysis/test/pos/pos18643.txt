***These tasted amazing! I have created my own spawns from pieces of this one.***At first I thought I wasn't going to get another flush. But patients is key here. Try these steps to get another flush.1) Re-soak the bag in water, at least 24 hours.2) Put it in the refrigerator for 24 hours. You can also do this before your first flush to wake them up.3) Set it back to where you had it, and leave it be (possible a month or two, maybe longer).4) Don't give up on it.My recipe for a quick delicious mushroom.LIGHTLY season with-garlic powder-salt-red pepper flakes-a dry herb like oregano, thyme, basil.Be careful on the seasoning, do not over season them, they are very easy to over season. Saut√© in a LITTLE bit of oil over medium heat. Give it more time with lower heat, than shorter time with higher heat. I like to get them a little brown on one side, and I just eat them right out of the pan. But, you can add them as a topping to other dishes.
