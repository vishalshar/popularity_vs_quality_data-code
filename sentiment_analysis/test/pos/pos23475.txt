I believe that I was probably one of the first to receive my Bluesmart luggage, arriving just two days after they confirmed shipments had begun. Straight out of the box, I charged my Bluesmart, loaded the app and departed on my first trip with it. I have now been travelling non-stop with it for over 7 weeks. It is everything it was reported to be and I was hopeful it would be. The overall quality of the luggage is world class in workmanship and the functionality has been exceptional without any issues. I was so impressed during my first trip that I immediately approved  my entire sales team to treat themselves to one for their Christmas present, on me. Well done Bluesmart.
