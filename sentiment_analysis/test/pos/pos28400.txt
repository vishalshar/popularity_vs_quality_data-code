The phone is so small and light, smaller than a flip phone. The screen is so small, but I can still see and can use the keyboard on the screen. I use it only with Wi-fi (No mobile data) connection. Wi-fi connection works well. With phone stand-by and Wi-fi connection, battery lasts for more than 3 days. I put 32 GB micro SD card for more storage because the phone only has 4GB internal storage. As you can see the phone spec, it is slow comparing with recent models, but it works well.  It is like non-smart phone with Android features. I still have to figure out how to connect this phone to PC so I can transfer the files without open up the back cover and take out the SD card. (I cannot find a driver works with 64bit OS). Overall, I really love the phone and the price is good for this phone.
