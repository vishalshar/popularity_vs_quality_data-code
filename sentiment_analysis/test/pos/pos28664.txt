This isn't a substitute for a "real" smartphone, but if you can find it at a good price ($30-40) this is a great portable secondary phone. It's the smallest and most portable smartphone I've ever seen, and would be best used by swapping in your SIM specifically when you need a smaller-than-normal phone for one reason or other, perhaps because you don't want something to happen to your regular, more expensive phone. That's realistically the only scenario you should expect to use this phone in, because it has a lot of compromises to get at this size and price point. It's slow, runs an outdated version of the OS, has limited internal storage, and has a small battery. Worst of all, the display is so tiny that not only is it difficult to see, the interface elements can't all fit and they overlap (and forget about trying to type and simultaneously see what you're typing!) That being said, it otherwise works as you'd expect any other Android device to. As long as you don't try to install a ton of apps, the limited storage is manageable. Pretty much everything I have installed works; it does fine with streaming audio and video, including playing media from my Plex server! The battery is small, but is also sufficient: in standby mode it only uses a percentage point or so every few hours, and only when you try to continuously use the phone does it drain noticeably. The standby time is probably measurable in days, whereas continuous use might last you a few hours. That leads to my use case: I've decided that since I have multiple devices anyway, and have a habit of not taking along my phablet when I don't think I'll need it just because it's larger than practical, I'll just leave my SIM in the Posh and toss it in my pocket. I really don't notice it's in there, and I can carry it around all day just in case; I still have my phablet, Nexus 7, Pixel C, etc. when I want to actually use a practical Android device. So to summarize, the Posh S240 isn't a very practical device, but it's a surprisingly usable phone that won't let you down.
