Worn it twice at the gym.  Very impressed.  Just put in your ear and automatically connects to phone.  Nice not to have a wires,  cords etc.  I saw some complaints on audio quality.  It's Bluetooth so as with any Bluetooth audio devise you compromise  on audio due to the nature of Bluetooth.  I would rank this devise as one of the better Bluetooth wireless ear buds.  Did not have any connectivity issues.  Only complaint is do not use the support videos  Bragi has on their site.  They are outdated.  The set up is actually much simpler than demonstrated in these videos. I've had lots of wireless ear buds.  These are expensive but worth it.
