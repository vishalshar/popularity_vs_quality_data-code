Bought these for my kid, and they are VERY snug, so if you have wide feet or a lot of shoe, don't do this.  We did the adjustments per the instructions to reduce the tightness, and really just had to put on fewer lace holder thingies in fewer holes.  My cat's, on the other hand, love these.  Very fun for them.
