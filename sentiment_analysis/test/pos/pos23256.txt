I purchased a package of black and white Sugru after looking at many Sugru projects on instructables.com and other sites. It looked so cool! I didn't have any plans for using the Sugru, I just had to have it. After receiving the product it sat in my refrigerator for about a week before I decided to try to repair a laptop power cord that was frayed. It worked! That cable repair alone paid for the package of Sugru.I like to sleep with my Bose earbuds in my ears. Rolling around in my sleep puts a strain on the cord where it attaches to the earbuds. A little Sugru applied and the cable is securely reinforced. Another significant savings!If you purchase Sugru, be aware that it has a shelf life of around 6 months, longer if you keep it refrigerated. Also keep in mind that it will take some practice to mold it in the shape you need. It is not difficult, but do not expect to be an expert the first time you use it.
