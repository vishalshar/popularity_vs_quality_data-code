So I finally got to use the stove the other day great stuff. It's super late you can put it in really anything any bad your back pocket front pocket and you're never even going to know it's there. Great ventilation the fire started pretty easily and I kept it going with just a couple of branches I really liked it I was able to make some pancakes and some soup quickly and efficiently without having too much trouble. Now the only problem that I really found was that it is really like it is really small my pants fit perfectly on top of it but once you add a can of soup or a large amount of food just a little unstable solution that I found in order to make myself feel comfortable with this was to put some rocks inside the stove just a little bit to keep it a little bit more stable a little bit more grounded I didn't want to tip over or accidentally get blown while I was sitting on top of the rock that I was cooking. Definitely a great addition to your everyday bag maybe your carry-on bag definitely will not be more than two comfortably and I really think that it doesn't provide a large surface area for a much larger items which some people have done for their videos but I think you'll be more than okay for personal or two people camping with this.
