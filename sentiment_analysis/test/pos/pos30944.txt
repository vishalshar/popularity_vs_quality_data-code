UPDATE:I decided to dive further into the features that Luma offers.  I was already happy with Luma, because it eliminated the dead zones in my house, but I wanted to check out the internet access features.  I continue to be impressed with how user friendly the mobile app is for someone like me.  I am in my late 30's, and I'm starting to feel like any technology that was invented after I graduated from college is not so self-explanatory for me.I went back into my mobile app and started playing around with the features.  My son has his own tablet, which is connected to our WiFi.  I was able to easily "assign" the tablet to my son and then restrict the content he can access on the internet to "G" rated content.  As of now, it isn't an issue of restricting his time on the tablet, but in another year or two, I will happily start using the "pause" feature to cut off the WiFi access on his tablet, once I feel like he has reached his allowed time with the device.  I LOVE that Luma is so multi-functional and goes way beyond just giving me a stronger WiFi signal throughout my house.  I have already recommended it to so many of my friends who are parents, based on the awesome parental control features.Original Post:I live in a Victorian house and I had several wifi dead zones in my home.  It drove me crazy that I couldn't use my laptop in my kitchen, or when I would go out on my porch, my cell phone would switch off of wifi and would start using my data.  I am not a tech savvy person, but when I was talking to a few coworkers about my wifi problems at home, one of them recommended this Luma Home WiFi System.  They had experienced similar issues and had done a little research and selected this product, which they said was easy to set up and solved their problems.  It was great for me, because I really don't understand technical terminology and would have probably just left well enough alone and lived with the dead zones in my house, rather than looking into a solution.When the Luma set arrived, I honestly didn't even open the box for a few days, because I was afraid that I would have a hard time setting it up.  I dreaded it.  When I finally decided to take the plunge and set it up, I was surprised that there was no instruction manual.  I thought there must be a mistake and it was missing.  Nope!  All I had to do was download an app to my phone and the app literally walked me through each step to install the units around my house!!!  That was awesome!!!  When it comes to hooking things up like the cable box, a dvd player or a game system, my husband usually does it.  He had been away on a business trip, so I set up the Luma system myself and thanks to the step by step instructions on the app, not only did I accomplish the task, it didn't take very long and I actually did it right!  On to the important part...by setting up the Luma units in the recommended areas of my house (yes, the app actually showed me where the best locations would be), I am now able to use my laptop in my kitchen, as well as any room in my house, including my front porch, and my cell phone does not drop the wifi connection either.I am so happy with this product and will not hesitate to recommend it to others who are looking for a solution to their wifi access issues at home or in their office.  There are more features that Luma is capable of, but I haven't gotten that far, and may never set up, such as restricting the content each user on your network can access (for example, the types of content you would allow a child to access).  I purchased the 3 pack, but if you have a really large home or office space, you can just purchase additional units either by themselves or as another 3 pack.  I thought I might have to purchase one more unit, but I didn't.  The 3 pack worked well for my home, which is around 3000 sq. ft.
