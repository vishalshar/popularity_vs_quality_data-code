These are so great!! Nice and buttery. I thought they'd be really crunchy but surprisingly they were somewhat soft/light with a crunch.  Great snack, we love all the Skeeter snacks because they are nut free (peanut AND tree nut!), but these ones are my husband's favorite! All the Skeeter snack cookies are smallish sized, like the size of a quarter maybe but thicker, but having just a few satisfies the sweet tooth.  We are 30ish and eat these, the only complaint is that we only ordered one box :(
