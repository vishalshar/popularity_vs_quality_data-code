These are great to have to store your brushes and clean them properly. Keep them on your brushes and keep your brushes down instead of up when your not using them and they will keep the original shape much better. Also great for cleaning your makeup brushes because it gives you the ability to keep them upside down when they are wet which is very important so you dont ruin your brushes. The only thing I don't like is that it takes forever for my brushes to dry with these on...so I need to plan far ahead. I learned about these from michelle phan on youtube. i watched her video on how she cleans her brushes. Although they take forever to dry these are very much worth the cost. I also would like a few different sizes.
