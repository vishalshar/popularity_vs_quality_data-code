Bought this recently and it works great! True to their word, this pack charges in less than 18 minutes, way faster than my other portable charger. Would recommend to anybody looking to buy a portable battery pack.Pros:- Charges fast (Faster than any portable power bank I've used before)- Portable- Holds a nice charge- SturdyCons:- None as of right now-
