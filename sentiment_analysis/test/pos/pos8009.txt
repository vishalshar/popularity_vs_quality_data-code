I recently purchased a singlecue.  At first I had my hesitations regarding how it would connect with my TV, and how well it would work in general To my surprise the setup was smooth (you need to download an app to your phone and it walks you through the setup). I was also concerned about the air-gestures but so far so good it seems to work really well in my living-room.The sensation of communicating with my TV and apple TV without having to grab a remote kind of feel like Tom Cruise in Minority Report :)So far, I am happy with the device and recommend it to anyone that wants to make their living room a little bit more "future"
