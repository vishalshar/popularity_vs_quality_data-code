Great phone. Cant believe its so cheap. have been using it as my daily since purchase and I can honestly say its never let me down. Its as close to stock android as you are going to get without getting a google phone.Its slim, light but not awkwardly so. Its pretty sturdy although I wouldn't want to sit on it if in the back pocket. But who puts a phone there? Not me.The screen is bright although living LA the screen can seem a bit dim at times if the sun is blazing. Not a major headache as I am not one of those LA types that is constantly on my phone, even with other people in company.The speakers are awesome and kick out a good level of detail and volume without breaking up.Camera is superb. Not had any major problems with it. I am a photographer and appreciate the use of manual camera settings which as expected give you far superior results.The 4K video is good, although i have not worked with it too many times. So can't comment with confidence on it.One issue i have with it is when i have the phone attached to a speaker and i answer a call. The caller finds it super hard to hear me. I am guessing there is an issue when connected in this way, as when i talk to a caller normally via the phone speaker, there seems to be no issue.Maybe the microphone needs a firmware update or an actual physical change? Again not a deal breaker as not often you would have it physically attached to a speaker unless its bluetooth.Another small issue is it came to me with a slight bump on the back. Barely visible unless you are flat up against it with your eye. Again not an issue for me as i have theTUDIA case on it and as I mentioned, barely visible. I am guessing its down to th build being mostly plastic. / hard plastic. Maybe a heat thing?Talking of heat. I don't find it gets that hot as some other have mentioned. No hotter than any other phone i have had. Including samsung etc.The OS is beautifully simple. No bloat ware. The 3gigs or ram helps. But i have never felt it lagging. I never find myself waiting and waiting. The camera if activated from the OFF status can be a bit laggy. But bare in mind it has to turn on the screen then jump into the camera. Otherwise it all runs smoothly. Hoping they can speed this up a little with the next firmware update.The phone charges super quick and comes with a flat USB type-c cord. Its nice an baby blue which has ha people remarking on how nice it was.In fact i have had more people asking me about this phone than any other i have had. I love the shape and size and the fact that its so simple and yet looks less boring than all the other generic phones out there now.A huge thumbs up for design!The notification light is on the bottom of the phone rather than the standard top of he screen etc. At first I was unsure but the more i use it the more it makes so much more sense. Its not like you are always OVER your phone at a meeting etc. With the light at the bottom where the power lead goes i can still see it slowly flashing. Even when I am at my mac, as i am now, the phone is next to me but i am not over it. so i can see the little notification light. And if i am across the room i can see the light on the bottom. Again I think a genius idea and thought process.I would  love the ability to change light colors depending on what media has come in. Say have the choice of orange, baby blue and white, as we have now. Would be pretty easy to do.Battery life is middle of the road. With general to busy use i can get a whole day out of it. And as its a quick charger (with the fast charger) I never feel I have ran out of juice.To close. I looked long and hard for a phone that was different and one that would just do what it was meant to do without problems. The idea of spending $700 on a samsung just made me sick. Why? Why spend that cash on a bloated phone? I also didnt want an iPhone as its too closed in and pretty much useless to anyone wanting to modify anything of use.My last option would have been a google phone. My end choices were the Pixel, Nexus or the Nextbit Robin.I went for the Robin as i loved the design and IDEA behind the phone and company.The Nextbit Robin just works. And it does it with a very simple and uncluttered design and OS. Its unassuming and yet when people see it they instantly want to pick it up and have a look.Others have had issues with it. Maybe they are the types to hammer the phone daily. I personally use it for email, social media and planning my week. I watch netflix now and then and listen to pandora. Don't play games on it. Use whatsapp use the camera. A LOT.It may just be the phone you need. Especially at this price!
