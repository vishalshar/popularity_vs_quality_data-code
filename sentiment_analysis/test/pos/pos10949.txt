This is really too early to tell for sure.  I haven't found if it gives me cues when it notices that I'm over the top, but maybe I'm supposed to notice.  When I do, I have noticed and the tools on the spire stone have helped me regain composure.  That's good enough for me.  Note:  other tools haven't been used yet, but I look forward to what the promise.
