This case seems very well built and holds my iPhone 5s very nicely.  I purchased the optional magnet and actually like having the ability to stick my phone on the fridge or other places as needed.  Comes in handy when you need to put the phone down to open the car etc.  Plus Rokform is made in the USA!  which is very hard to find these days.  A friend of mine has one of these and recently dropped her iPhone 5s in a full bathtub - on accident of course.  Phone was completely submerged and recovered and was fully functional!!  Now was it the case?  Was it the phone?  Was it a combination- probably!  I was previously using a otterbox commuter case which i found to be very uncomfortable to hold due to the edges being rough.  The Rokform case is much much more comfortable.  Hope this helps.One Con:  The silent switch is a little hard to get to but overall no big deal to me.  I can still get to it.
