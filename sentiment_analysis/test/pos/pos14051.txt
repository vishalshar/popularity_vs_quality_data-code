I bought Arccos 360 after using using the first gen product for the last year+. I was very excited when they announced that second gen sensors would be half the size.Pairing: I screwed the sensors on and they seem to fit more snug that the first gen which is great! The pairing was cool. I put all my clubs n the bag and then pulled them out one at a time and basically took pictures of each sensor and that was it! It asked me to get microphone permission and camera permission so I assume that is how the sensors were communicating to the phone. Overall, no glitches and pretty seamless.Playing: After that, I took it out on the course and played a round like I usually do with Arccos. The app seems to have been updated and swiping between holes is now much better. I started the round on my home course and put the phone in my front pocket. I checked the shot detection as I played along and everything recorded perfectly! With my previous set of Arccos (get 1) I'd have to delete shots here and there when I'd throw a club around the green or maybe carried multiple clubs to the green. With this version, I did not get any extra shots and was very surprised/impressed with the accuracy. My battery seemed to also consume less power - not sure why that would be the case. Previously I was using about 50-60% on a 18-hole round but this time it was about 35-40%. I'll ask Arccos if they made any improvements there.Analysis: The analysis is the same that I've gotten accustomed to and is always insightful in tracking the various aspects of my game (driving, approach, chipping, sand and putting) so I can see where I am good and where I need work. It also provides club distance averages but that is not new with Arccos 360.Overall impressions: I have now logged two rounds with the system, It is true the system requires way less editing that the first gen - I've only had to add gimme putts when I pick up the ball. The sensors don't seem to fall off at all and fit much more snugly. They are much smaller and lighter and have no discernible impact on the swing. Very happy and excited about this product evolution and looking forward to upcoming software upgrades!
