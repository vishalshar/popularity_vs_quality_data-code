This is one of the first and maybe the most effective of a new class of wearable devices known as cognitive wearables. These devices go beyond simple pedometers and provide insight in to our mental state. I've had the Spire for a couple weeks now and I absolutely love it. At first I was skeptical about whether it was accurate, but it's proven time and again to be absolutely able of accurately gauging my stress levels and providing timely notifications when I need them.
