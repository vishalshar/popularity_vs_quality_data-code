This product is really innovative.  Gave it as a gift to nephew 9 and niece 7.  Both were extremely engaged after some help setting up their accounts and installing the apps from me.  I think they will continue to use it for some time.  Helps bring a bit more tactile simple mechanism to the modern age gadgets.  I'm not an educator, but I think this seems like a great tool for educators.  It is expensive, but the cost seems justified when you experience the innovative nature of the product.  Helps blend technology with basic (yet actually complex) tasks.  I recommend it.
