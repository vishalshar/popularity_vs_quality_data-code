This bike has been wonderful for my 4-year-old.  He loves the orange color, it's well built and sturdy.  The training wheels are easy to put on and adjust.  It was a struggle for him to transition to handlebar brakes, but he got the hang of it.  It's a good size for the phase he's in and I don't think he'll grow out of it any time soon.  It's also well built enough that I know it will be perfect for when my youngest one gets big enough to ride as well.
