I like the chocolate chip coconut Whenever Bars, so I thought I would try these.  I  LIKE  THESE  EVEN  BETTER!!  My family went out of town for a mini-vacation & I took along a couple boxes.  It is SO hard to find gluten-free food when you are out-of-town.  We ran out of bars WAY before our trip was over.  Everyone like them!!
