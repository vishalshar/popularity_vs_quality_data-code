I got this as a present for my techy, hands-on sister. She was thrilled to have it. It was fairly easy to just pick up and use, but it did begin getting "stuck" as we continued using it. I think the technology needs to be update a bit to prevent the plastic from getting stuck in the tip, but it didn't prevent us from having fun with it.
