I recently replaced the regulator/hose assembly on my grill (Amazon sold parts) and it works so well, I ended up burning my first two steaks. I decided to give the SteakChamp a try and I love it. This gadget makes it impossible to ruin a good cut of beef. I've used it around 10 times now and it works flawlessly. One tip: Activate it just before you put you steak on the grill. It will turn itself off due to inactivity.
