I ordered a white one and just LOVE it. The foldable design is very neat and very cool. It is very compact when we took it our for travel. The system is very easy to use. The audio is amazingly good, much better than any other earphones I have ever had. The image quality is very high. Very impressive theater like experience. One hint is that, you may need to look at the lens and clean them when they are dirty.
