We are really having great success with this product.  Our Mastiff is usually on prednisone and has areas of fur chewed off by now.  He literally isn't itching any more than a normal dog at this point.  We are amazed.  To be fair we started him on Missing LInk but once we added this product we really noticed a complete change.  Now we added Skin -Coat from the same manufacturer and he's doing fantastic.  Even better than just on Immunity but immunity made the vast change.  Wow we were at our wits end with our dog as he was so uncomfortable we felt bad for him.  Now he's basically normal.  I just cant really believe it.  I must whine because its expensive and you get so little.  Missing link we get a whole bag so as soon as we are in the clear we are going to try to cut back to just missing link and/or cut this to the bare minimum that we can.  Oh and we have tried all sorts of products that claim to do what this one does. This is the first one that worked for us.
