I am not completely sure how this WiFi portal works but boy does it work!  I am not in an urban area but it still had a significant impact on my network  speed.  Videos are much more stable with less buffer time.  My old WiFi was very unstable and required many reboots.  I have not had any issues with this WiFi portal since I turned it on.  I highly recommend this for anyone who is currently having issues with WiFi!  Great item!  Thanks!!!
