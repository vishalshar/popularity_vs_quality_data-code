I looked at a lot of different system for mounting my phone to my bike. I came from an iphone that had a plastic sleeve that mounted to the bike, but by new S4 didn't fit! Quite the conundrum. I really liked the way the quad lock locks the phone to the mount without relying on some sort of pressure or tension on the outside of the phone. Competitor products with little sliding arms that grip the sides of the phone don't seem sturdy and obscure buttons. I planned on using my mount on regular road cycling, hard pack with a hybrid, and mountain biking.So far it has performed superbly for those activities. I am no Chris Froome, but I do love to ride my bike a lot. I've done about 100 miles so far with this system. I have also installed a mount in my car which was simple and also works great. All the mounts have been solid with no issues with the phone dismounting on it's own or coming loose in any way. It is securely locked in it's position. However, when it is time for dismount, the process is super easy.This bike mount is really easy to install and take off. It makes it really easy to switch it from bike to bike. The look of it is just so clean too. Almost every time I go on a group ride someone comments. One guy said it reminded him of the screen in a tesla but bike style. I think this is because, when attached, you see nothing but the phone floating there on the handlebars. This has the incredible benefit of the phone being easy to access. All the buttons are there like they normally would be and there is nothing in between you and the screen to get in the way of regular phone functions. I have texted while riding my bike. Pretty amazing!My only issue with the system is a blunder I made that you don't have to repeat. I bought the Neo Hybrid case to attach the adapter to. While it works fine and I really like the case, choosing a case with a flexible back turned out to be a little aggravating. It adds a little flexibility into the whole set up. While it's nothing awful and not annoying enough to order a new case and adapter, if I could go back in time, I'd have ordered a solid case.
