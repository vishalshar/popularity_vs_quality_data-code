I've now had the chance to experience both the SkyBell HD and the August Doorbell Cam, and after using both, it's even more clear the difference between them, from an installation standpoint to an app-usage standpoint, from reliability to just general speed and intuitiveness.So let's get to it. (For reference: Both August Doorbell Cam and SkyBell HD tested via 2.4Ghz connection to an Apple Airport Express bridge, which is connected to an Apple Time Capsule AC model).Installation:Installation of the SkyBell HD is so easy, it's a wonder every doorbell camera doesn't use this mounting method:1.) Shut off power to your doorbell.2.) Remove existing doorbell, and disconnect the two power wires from it.3.) Mount SkyBell HD plate to wall with the two included screws. You may find your existing doorbell uses two screws vertically in the exact same place already, so this might go even more quickly than you imagine.4.) Take the two power wires, and wrap them round the screw retainers on the mounting plate.5.) Slot the SkyBell HD over the mounting plate, and then tighten the locking Phillips screw on the bottom of the plate to hold the SkyBell in place.Done.This is a VERY different installation process to the August Doorbell Cam, which is, for lack of a better word, a pain. You have to dangle the August mounting plate in the air while you use these proprietary wire couplers with conductive fluid inside (yes, really). Then you have to use a crimp or pair of pliers to close the couplers together, trapping the doorbell wires and the August wires together. And hey, guess what, if you mess this process up - you'll need to get new couplers or some other accessory that fits into the mounting plate that will work in their place. Oy...  Not only that, the August mounting plate can be easily broken if you screw in the Phillips screws even slightly too much.  At is point, you have to use this allen key to tighten this screw that holds the August doorbell camera in place, and because of the poor purchase on this screw coupled with the tiny allen key, its not obvious youre doing anything. I really, REALLY dont like the August installation process.Installation Results: SkyBell HD: 1. August Doorbell Cam: 0Power requirements:This is an easy win for the SkyBell HD. The August Doorbell Cam requires 16-24 volts of electricity. This can be problematic on newer houses that use two CAT5 wires to the door, with weaker transformers. Id constantly get Low Voltage errors in the August app with the Doorbell Cam, for some reason, despite reading around 20V when testing my front door wires with a multimeter. In Augusts defense, I was able to speak to their tech support team and they lowered the power requirement on my August Cam on their end, so I no longer received those messages anymore.With the SkyBell HD, this wont be an issue. SkyBell HD only requires a minimum of 10-36 volts. Thats quite a difference. The August doorbell camera also doubles as a bridge for the August Smart Lock, and has Bluetooth built in, which likely explains the higher minimum power requirement. Either way its something to bear in mind.Given the lower power requirements, SkyBell HD: 1. August Doorbell Cam: 0App:Setting up the SkyBell HD was simple, and took seconds. After turning back on the power, the SkyBell took a minute or so to get enough power (the iOS app says it might take ~10 minutes). Then the device started flashing red/green, which is your signal to add the device to your account. The process is simple.On iOS, you just go into Settings, and pick the SkyBell HD from your wireless networks (yes, it creates its own network which you connect to for you to setup from). Then, you tell the SkyBell HD the name of your network, and voila - it connects, and youre good to go.The August app on iOS, however, is a finicky beast. Adding the August doorbell in the app works, but not every time. Sometimes you need to bring the doorbell into the house near to your router to make this work. Its just not a clean process, and it doesnt promote confidence in the procedure at all.The SkyBell app is slick. From slick animations, to slick and intuitive options, - it just *feels* like the complete package. The August app is a bit of a mess, with menus all over the place, certain on-screen buttons that don't even fit properly on the screen when controls are moved (like when you're on a phone call, and the app is shoved down the screen slightly).What SkyBell HD does in its app that August doesnt:1.) Ability to set LED color on the doorbell. This is nice, as it can match your trim on your house, being able to pick from hundreds of colors.2.) Ability to set a Do Not Disturb mode. This is one my FAVORITE things. Want to get notifications on your phone that your doorbell has been pressed or motion sensor triggered, - but DONT want to hear your physical doorbell chime go off because the baby is sleeping or the dog will go nuts? SkyBell has you covered. Its surprising that August didnt copy this functionality since its been around on earlier models of the SkyBell/SkyBell 2.0, prior to this new HD model.3.) Ability to adjust motion sensitivity. August has none of that, because as of July 25th theres still no motion notifications (supposedly coming in August, 2016, too).4.) Free cloud saving of doorbell/motion/live view videos. August? Nope. Though apparently the August app will get this (but who knows if it will be free?) in August, 2016, too. Maybe August will be the month of August. Yeah, OK... not the best pun.5.) Quality settings! Not all of us are able to have our routers/wireless bridges close to our doorbells, so being able to set either 480p, 720p (high/low), and 1080p is great! The August doorbell cam? 1280x960p maximum, but it changes settings by itself on the fly. Either way, Im having much smoother results with the SkyBell HD in terms of video playback.SkyBell HD: 1. August Doorbell Cam: 0.Image Quality:It has been frustrating with the August Doorbell Cam during the day. Even without direct sunlight pointing toward the camera, visitors look like silhouettes, and despite Augusts support team telling me theyre aware of the issue - no solution has been provided as yet, despite months of ownership and use.Interestingly, the SkyBell HD suffers from this, too, but to a lesser degree, thankfully.. If you have a very open area, light is just going to be somewhat of an issue when hitting the doorbell. Thankfully, it is a great deal less silhouetting of visitors with the SkyBell HD (you can make out who they are, yay!), but maybe some end-user exposure adjustments in the app would be nice?In terms of image quality when there's no sun or brightness involved, I'd say that the August Doorbell Cam has the SkyBell HD beat for image quality during the day.. Things just look a little more natural in the distance. However, when it comes down to actual use - seeing who's at your door, these differences don't matter as much. But for reference, it's easy to tell the SkyBell HD image apart from the August Doorbell cam. The SkyBell HD has some more image processing going on, whereas August just looks much more natural in terms of color.That said, the silhouetting is much more of an issue with the August doorbell.In terms of viewing angle, the SkyBell HD has a really, really wide viewing angle. I wouldn't even need to use a wedge to point the SkyBell HD, like I needed to with the August Doorbell cam. The downside to this with the SkyBell HD is of course, some barrel distortion, but it's not an issue here. Visible usability is key, and the SkyBell wins that fight. But, since the August does provide the more natural image during the day...SkyBell HD: 1. August Doorbell Cam: 1.What else?1.) One of the complaints Ive heard from delivery people at my door, is that they cant even tell the August Doorbell Cam is an actual doorbell button! Theres a very dim bell-shaped green LED on the front, but it has no adjustments to it, and you cant see it except when its dark outside. A lot of the time, the delivery guys just hammer on my door because they dont know to push the bell! Gah!With the SkyBell HD? No issue. Its obviously a doorbell you can press, and you can adjust the brightness of the button LED easily in the app. Even on the lowest setting, its simple to tell its a doorbell button, and there is no confusion here. This, to me, is an obvious usability issue that August should have ironed out in testing before release.2.) Ive had some ongoing issues with the August Doorbell, with older, cached images showing up when people ring the doorbell (completely unacceptable), extremely slow connection to video etc. The SkyBell HD has been much more reliable. The difference is obvious within mere minutes of use after installation. SkyBell HDs notifications come through considerably faster to my iPhone than Augusts, and in general this has been a much smoother doorbell interaction. In fact, notifications come through so fast to my phone when the SkyBell HD button is pushed that it almost feels too fast. Whether motion picked up or someone pushing the button, its sensationally fast. With the August doorbell, Ill receive notifications maybe 5 seconds after the doorbell is pressed, and connecting to the doorbell feed takes far too long.3.) If you view the live stream on the SkyBell HD and then close it, you can immediately reopen that live stream without delay. The August Doorbell cam live feed needs several seconds to reset before you can use it again after initial viewing. Otherwise it just says, Connecting and times out, or just takes many, many seconds to reconnect.4.) I also like that the SkyBell HD video feed lets you snap a photo of the video feed with the little camera icon on the screen. Its the little things5.) The speaker on the SkyBell HD has different settings for volume levels. Even at the default Medium level its EASY for your visitor to hear what youre saying.6.) With the August app, if you're viewing a live feed, hitting the Home Button on your iPhone quits the feed. With the SkyBell HD, if you hit the Home Button, it does not exit the feed (think of it like a phone call).Things to improve and things August does better than SkyBell?1.) I like that the August Doorbell Cam comes with a wedge to angle the doorbell toward the left or right if necessary. The SkyBell HD doesnt come with anything like that (but it does come with a drill bit and a screwdriver, thoughtfully!).2.) This issue affects both the SkyBell HD and August Doorbell Cam: You cant hear the other person when youre talking to them. Both devices work on a push-to-talk setup, and you can only hear the other person when youre not holding the on-screen button to talk. There may be technical limitations at play here, but its a little frustrating either way.3.) The August Doorbell Cam live feed works only in portrait mode. The SkyBell HD works only in landscape mode (go figure). It would be nice to have both, since its easier to hold a phone in portrait mode when out and about. Hopefully SkyBell can implement portrait video mode in a future app update.4.) Id like to see a time-stamp in the corner of the SkyBell live feed when viewing.5.) August provides you with a WiFi-signal indicator in the app. I dont see a way to see how solid of a connection the SkyBell HD is making to the wireless router.6.) The default (and one and only) outdoor chime tone isnt my favorite sound in the world, so it would be nice if there were a way to have a different ring sound play to the visitor.7.) I like that the August app lets you use 3D Touch on the August app icon to quickly access the video feed. I'd like that on the SkyBell app icon. In SkyBell's defense, though, the app loads extremely quickly.Overall, the SkyBell HD is without doubt the best doorbell camera Ive used. This shouldnt be particularly surprising: SkyBell is on its third iteration: SkyBell, SkyBell 2.0, and now SkyBell HD. I didnt use the original SkyBell, but the 2.0 release was mostly good (some niggles aside). The SkyBell HD ups the ante considerably, bringing an easy-to-use app, a ridiculously simple installation procedure, great customization to motion sensing, LED colors/brightness, a much-loved Do Not Disturb mode, free cloud storage of videos etc. August just cant complete in this space, or - at the very least - is currently not competing.For reference, I have multiple August Door Locks and keypads, and I still recommend the SkyBell HD over the August Doorbell Cam, without question (see attached picture! August and SkyBell, side by side!). Both setups work independently "together" (as they should).Verdict: 4.5 out of 5. Highly recommended.*Sample received for objective review**EDIT October, 2016*SkyBell has added signal strength information in the SkyBell HD app's Settings -> Device Information screen. Thank you!
