I have had this computer for about 2 weeks now. I LOVE it. I will first admit that I am Asus bias. Purchased my first Asus laptop in 2010 and have been happy with them ever since. I will also say before I purchased this laptop I did shop around and look at other brands, mostly Lenovo and Samsung. Once again, I went with Asus.This computer gives you so much bang for your hard earned dollar. I was looking at the new Asus Zen Book Pro (which is also a really nice machine) but I didn't need the 4k screen and the Skylake 6700 processor is sweet but the 6500 is just fine and snappy. I could not get over the price of this laptop with the specs.Now onto the meat and potatoes.I read all of the reviews on this laptop before I purchased it and the one thing that kept coming up was the screen quality. It made me a bit hesitant to purchase since I wanted to use this computer for video and photo editing, web design, business and storm chasing. The matte screen for my needs was a plus since most computer screens are now glossy, I prefer the non glare matte finish. When I have my computers mounted to my RAM vehicle laptop mount the glare from the outside is insane, this prevents that, but most of you reading this won't be doing that! The screen quality is just fine! I really enjoy it!  Some of my programs had fuzzy text and that is not due to the monitor but mainly to DPI settings. If you have that problem just make a desktop shortcut, right click, properties, go to compatibility, then select Disable display scaling on high DPI settings.. Problem solved. If you use Chrome for your browser some text will appear really small and the format to the screen will appear smaller than usual. Go into your advanced settings in chrome and select font size medium and page zoom 125%. Everything will be easy to read and not out of place. The viewing angle on the screen is not like an IPS but perfectly acceptable. Do not let the other reviews about the monitor keep you from buying this laptop. I promise it is fine!This computer is blazing fast. There is very little bloatware. I literally had it out of the box did a little optimizing and ready to go in under 15 minutes. Boot ups and shutdowns are very fast. Start up and shutdown in under 8 seconds.*** Be sure to check for the latest window 10 updates*** I use Sony vegas pro to edit video. Rendered a 3 minute long HD video in highest setting in about 10 minutes. This would normally take 45 minutes to an hour on my last machine, which is comparing apples to oranges. The SSD isn't quite 512GB like others have stated but still offers plenty of storage. Purchase a couple WD Ultra backup drives to keep your storage open if you are a file hoarder, or purchase another SSD to place into the laptop. If you are new to SSD I will tell you this. The laptop I was using before this was getting slow and run down. I placed a Samsung EVO 250GB SSD in my old laptop that replaced the existing HDD and it is better than the day I bought it. It went from booting in 3 to 5 minutes to under 20 seconds. SSD is very fast!It's a multitasking beast. I hook up an external monitor to it and run split screen to have separate work areas and it just keeps going without a hiccup.I am not a gamer by any means so I have not pushed it to it's max from that perspective but it has never gotten warm. Stays cool to the touch. Fan does kick on every now and then but you can only hear it in a totally quiet room.Nobody has mentioned this but I found it to be quite impressive. If you like to listen to music or watch movies the included Smart Audio program is wicked awesome. Offers custom EQ for sliders for very fine tuning of your music. Match it up with good speakers or headphones and you will be blown away by the sound quality.The only complaint I have with this laptop is the trackpad. It more has to do with me not being used to it than anything. I sometimes make commands or do things I didn't mean to do.Pros:SpeedBuild QualityScreen Quality/ graphics ( Better than what other reviewers have mentioned)SSDBacklight Keyboard802.11 ac ( faster wifi speeds, 40mbps faster than my previous machine on same network )Cons:Trackpad ( Again, probably me!)If you are looking for a machine that will impress you everytime you use it and don't want to spend $1,500 bucks then look no further. It was just released in July so there is not a whole lot on the internet about this model if you search for it. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy!*** I don't do reviews typically but this laptop is too good not to do one, I am not paid or hired to write reviews nor did I receive any discounts***
