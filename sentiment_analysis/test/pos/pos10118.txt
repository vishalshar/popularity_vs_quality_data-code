This little guy is soooo cool!! Not only can you control it with your smart phone or tablet, not only does it has apps you can use to play games with both on the floor and while your holding it, but it can SWIM! Put it in a pool and watch it go! watch your cat or dog go crazy, just don't throw it and play fetch lol. The only down side is it takes time to learn to control it good and the main app won't work on my iphone 4, I just downloaded another app to control it. But it's worth spending $120.00 if you have the time to get use to it. 4/5 stars
