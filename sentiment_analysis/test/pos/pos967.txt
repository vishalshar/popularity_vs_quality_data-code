Well, it definitely works and is reasonably accurate, comparing to a Home Depot hand held temperature scanner. They agreed to within a degree or two, but honestly, can't tell which one is closer to ground truth. Bought on AMZN Warehouse for like $170, vs brand new $299. Worked fine out of the box!The FPS on a Nexus 6P is like 2-3fps, and I am sure that's a limitation of the device. Probably it's sending across raw data on a USB2 bus, and then the host processor, i.e. the phone, is doing some data cleanup etc.Use a Micro to Type-C adapter, this is the one I got here at AMZN and it works just fine:VicTsing USB3.1 Type-C to Micro USB Convert Connector ,Support Data Transfer and Charging, for MacBook 12inch 2015, ZUK Z1, MI 4C, Nokia N1, Chromebook Pixel 2015, Nexus5x Nexus6P, OnePlus 2, and other Type-C Supported Smart Phones and Tablet-Sliver.I went outside to track a person walking around the sidewalk, mid day, SF area, and totally fine, it tracks her walking, and the human form is clearly distinguishable (as opposed to a moving blob) at probably out to 50-100 yards. That's fine for me, if this doohickie can make it to 100-200 yards at night, it's a winner, to identify any animals or people in my yard.The app UI is a bit hard to grok, but after a while of touching here and there, you can find how to turn on the temperature indicator.The 200x150 approx sensor resolution is a nice consumer win, for expensive bolometer technology, esp at $170!!! There is enough detail to understand what you are looking at. Watching cars going by, those tires are hot!The FoV of the XR is really narrow, but I don't see that being a problem at all. I appreciate SEEK coming out with a narrow FoV to concentrate the available pixels so as to get more detail at a farther or mid range. Thanks Seek !Overall, this product is a win!
