I sometimes come home with a little too much energy and need something to help me wind down.  I've used Dream Water for the past year and only drink half a bottle to help me sleep real well through the night so I wake up refreshed.  I've used over the counter sleep aids prior to Dream Water and sometimes felt sluggish with those other pill type aids.  Dream Water has done me wonders the past year and has helped me keep a positive outlook in my day time activities just because I am able to sleep well.  My favorite flavor right now is Paradise PM and the Snoozeberry is my second.
