This is a great product -- it saves me the hassle of carrying a long cord for my phone and it's very well made. I like that the cable is flexible but still sturdy. Only caveat: if I plug this into my macbook, I have to lay my phone facedown, since the macbook usb port is upside down. Not a deal breaker since again, the cord is flexible enough that I can twist and look at my phone whilst keeping it plugged in, but it is annoying. I blame that on apple though.
