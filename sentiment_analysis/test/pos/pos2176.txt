Mionix is a cult favorite for a reason. For a company with so little mainstream recognition, Mionix is putting out some of the best modern gaming miceÂ—over and over and over again. And now they've created one that could actually go mainstream, considering it's their most broad-appeal mouse yet.I like the Castor a lot. It's simple, it's versatile, and it's just luxurious enough to give it an edge over Razer's similarly-equipped DeathAdder. it's a good starting point if you're in the market and need something that does it all.
