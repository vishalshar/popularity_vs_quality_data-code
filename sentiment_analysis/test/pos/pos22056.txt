My brother purchased this product and recommended it to me.  I bought it and love it!  I was very easy to install and is very sturdy.  It is well made and I am very impressed.  I drive alot and work from my car and found it easy to use.  It comfortably swivels to position the computer in front of me so that I do not have to turn my body all day.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
