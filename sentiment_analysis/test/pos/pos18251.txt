Build Quality and Materials:The build quality is excellent! Almost the entire mouse has a soft touch rubber surface. It is very comfortable and enjoyable to hold, but beware it does feel a little slippery, though I haven't actually had my hand slip yet. There's a textured rubber grip for your thumb but not one on the right side of the mouse (just smooth rubber). The RGB lighting system is really nice looking. There's not too much lighting, like some other mice. The cable is braided and seems to stay out of the way just fine.Buttons/Scroll Wheel:The scroll wheel is pretty traditional, but performs great. I've tried mice with the "infinite scroll" technology and just didn't care for it. The scroll wheel has a comfortable rubber coating as well. The main L/R buttons have subtle grooves for your fingers and are effortless to click. The placement of the side buttons is pretty good, but might be a tad bit too far forward. I find that one of the side buttons is easier to reach than the other. The extra middle button comes default for DPI switching and is placed perfectly. I don't think you'll have any accidental button pushes when using the scroll wheel.Performance:The tracking on this mouse is excellent! The two large feet allow for an extremely smooth glide. The software is also pretty good. You can customize 3 different DPI settings as well as assign button action/macros and a whole host of other settings, and save up to 5 presets. I use this for photo editing and light gaming and it performs exceptionally well. Absolutely no acceleration.Conclusion:After spending 2 days researching gaming mice and watching virtually every online review video, I decided to try this mouse. My hand is about 8 inches (from the base of my palm to the tip of my middle finger), and this mouse feels very good in my hand. I use a hybrid claw/fingertip grip, but this actually feels best when using a palm grip. So much so that I might actually change grip types. This performs so much better than my Logitech M510 and Logitech MX Master. I debated heavily between this and the razor mamba, and after seeing pretty bad screen crawl when lifting and setting down the mamba (on another online video review) I opted for the Mionix Castor and am very happy I did!
