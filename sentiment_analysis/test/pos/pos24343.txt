Love love love this device. We actually have seen a cost savings in electricity because we now can tell when lights are left on and we turn them off - even if we are not home. It works with Apple Homekit as well as Amazon Echo. If you are even halfway handy, you can easily install this yourself. If you have a three-way light switch, you will need to utilize the remote. Make sure you follow their directions and mark the wires as indicated. If it's a standard light switch, it's a piece of cake.
