This is an excellent pencil, made the same way as antique advertising pencils. The Midori pencil is perfect for my sketch set, as I can keep a good point on it. until I need it. Plus, this has a brand-new eraser, instead of the black ones on the antique brass pencils. Unlike mechanical pencils the lead won't break before it can be used.
