I've had it for a couple months now and I love it.I've repeatedly received compliments on its appearance, and people seem really surprised when I tell them it's also a fitness tracker.I've enjoyed the fitness tracking capabilities too. It may not be quite as nice as some others (I've had a fitbit too), but I'm much more inclined to wear it every day. (And I love the fact that I don't have to constantly charge it.)
