This tape was purchased to be exclusively used in the game of Bocce. The digital readout is indisputable as to which is the closest ball during the game. For the most part, the device works as advertised however there is one thing I wish the manufacturer would have included. That is a button to disengage the four different selections that are in a circle in that white donut area. It's normal to hold the body of the tape on both sides while reading the digital readout but it is very easy to push one of those setting while measuring which throws the measurement into a cocked hat. So one has to carefully squeeze your thumb and index finger in a corner of the tape body while still leaving the top open for a read out. It's doable but awkward. This should be corrected with a improved version of the product. Other then that it operates pretty well.
