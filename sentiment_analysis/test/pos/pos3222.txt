Excellent product. Does what it says it will.  Cannot give it 5 stars because the fingerprint recognition works about 98% of the time.  There are instances where you have to re-scan your print or wipe off your finger.  However, I've never had it not work after rescanning.  Great product.  Definitely worth the money.  I think they dropped the price, which is even better.
