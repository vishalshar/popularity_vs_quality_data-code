I ordered this piece by mistake & while I have it I realized it didn't come with a USB-C port & that's the only down side to this multi-port adapter. It would be a perfect product to me if the USB-C port was included or just replacing one of three USB ports that way I can still charge my PC while working on many other things through the Juiced System. Other than that the color is more than a rose gold but, it works great.
