Super nicely put together. Definitely different than any other fitness trackers. If you walk a lot and have bad posture, this will definitely help. I've turned some of the notifications off to fit my exact needs and app is simple to use. Every fitness tracker has it's own strong suite and this is the only one that provides posture correction and look good while doing so. Also, being able to exchange out strap to match outfit/mood is a definite plus. My personal favorite is the tan leather strap.
