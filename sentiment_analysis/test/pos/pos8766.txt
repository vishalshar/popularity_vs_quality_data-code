This is currently my favorite pasta. Without question! It is reasonably price, it is perfect for anyone that has significant food allergies, and it  tastes great!  I cannot tell that it's made from chickpeas. To me it taste like regular pasta made from wheat.  The lentil pasta cannot compare to this chickpea pasta.  It comes in many different shapes and sizes and it's very easy to make, and Ashley only takes between five and 10 minutes to cook.  You can mix it with many different combinations including a home homemade Parmesan sauce or a tomato base sauce.  You can also make a type of macaroni and cheese with that if you add  American or cheddar cheese.  If you have a dairy allergy, it works very well with coconut cream.  It was delivered quickly, the dates were car it, and the condition was very positive.  I will definitely be re-ordering! This is a staple that is a must have in my home.
