This is definitely one of the better purchases that I have made.  I like the fact that my ties are not ruined with the tie pins that I have used in the past by poking through the material.  I have received many compliments and the magnet has been strong enough to keep everything in its place.  I am hoping that Tie Mags will have new designs soon (as I do not prefer the other 2 designs) and I highly recommend this product.
