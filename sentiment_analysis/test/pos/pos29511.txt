I've been using this for about a month now, and really, REALLY like it. If I had one complaint, it's that the bluetooth radio in this watch doesn't see, to have quite the range of my Pebble Time Round, so disconnections happen more often. That said, bluetooth runs on similar wavelengths to cordless phones and microwaves, so various devices interfere. If I'm in the kitchen and the microwave is turned on, it's not uncommon to lose the connection.Still Screen is MUCH brighter than on the Round, so I'm happy with the trade-off. Add to that the battery life (I hit 60% after FOUR DAYS, but I also probably get fewer notifications than most people), and I'm sold. The heart rate sensor is what it is -- optical heart rate measurement at the wrist is inherently unreliable at this point in the technology's development. That said, I find it tracks fairly accurately, though especially in sweaty, jiggly moments (exercise), the numbers can fluctuate. It's not a chest strap, and it's pretty unreasonable to treat it as such in my opinion. Voice reply to text messages (I'm on android, if that matters), was a surprising home run. Hint -- if you say "Question mark", etc, it adds the appropriate punctuation.Sorfware could use tweaks and development, but since Pebble went under, don't plan on that ever happening. Fitbit is currently committing to keeping the services running through thet end of 2017, or at least that's how their press release reads to me, and the Peppble developers hired by Fitbit claims they are trying to make the watch less reliant on cloud services, and the developer community may also work on these things, but right now I'd assume that if you buy this, plan on some functions not working after 2017. Which is sad -- I love these watches. Still, if you can find one used or on sale at a serious discount (like I did), it might be worth it to you. Also, there is a third party Android app that purports to run most of the watch's functions without the Pebble app or cloud servers (Can't remember the name, and I haven't used it so can't say how it works) that some like. At any rate, it seems some of the fuctionality of the watch that is not cloud-based will contionue to work well beyond 2017, but things like weather updates and voice-to-text services? To be safe, I wouldn't plan on it.If the company was still up and healthy, I'd recomend this watch to most people in a heartbeat. If you're looking for a watch that does notifications with tremendous battery life and is always-on, it seems that these functions will continue to work. But it's still a gamble -- there is NO guaranteed support continuing into the future from either Fitbit or Pebble -- and that includes warranty support!Oh -- and get a screen protector. Yes, it's gorilla glass, but that stuff isn't indestructible. Scratched the hell out of my Pebble Time Round absentmindedly brushing it against a stone wall as I walked. All it takes is a single moment of distraction to thunk your wrist against something, and your watch screen is now scratched.
