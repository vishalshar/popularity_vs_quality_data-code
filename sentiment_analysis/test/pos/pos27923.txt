In terms of what it is advertised to do, this product works flawlessly. However..As mentioned in another review, the fit isn't as tight as you would think, or hope. And for this reason, I give it 4-stars; they got everything right, from the performance to the texture of the hub, but the fit is like the difference between wearing snow gloves and latex gloves - both will cover your hands, but the latter is far more form-fitting. Although it is very unlikely that this would cause problems - as I've used my Macbook on my lap without the hub falling out - it seems like a fairly simple adjustment that the company could have, and should have considered.-- WARNING --In case the pictures do not make it obvious enough, this product will NOT work on most Macbook cases. I have the Mosiso 12'' case (Mosiso Macbook 12" Case, Retina Display 12" Inch Laptop Computer [2015 Release], Hard Shell Protective Case, Smooth Matte Finish (Wine Red)Â and am constantly having to remove the bottom unit to use this product. Is it annoying - certainly. But, this USB-C hub seems to be one of the more promising solutions to the issue all Macbook users have to deal with.Overall, I'd buy it again primarily because I need the USB and SD ports.
