So far it has been a great product. I have used for over a month. It started out with rocky start. It was not calibrated correctly. I would drink an oz and it would tell me that I have had 16 oz and I have met the goal for now. After couple of emails and screenshots, they sent me a new bottom part of it (which is where the bottle measures water intake) and now it works great. The App on iOS has been updated and getting better. Calibration process is much more intuitive than it used to be. It definitely has improved my water intake through out the day. I definitely recommend this product.
