I purchased my Korner unit after a few break-ins in my neighborhood in DC. The set up was pretty easy, although you should use a butter knife when taking the caps off the sensors. The app is quite straightforward and shows you every single move you, or anyone else makes in terms of your doors and windows opening.I live in a basement studio apartment and just needed something to give me peace of mind while I was away. With the app, you can just check in and see if there's any activity at all. However, it may be likely wannabe-burglars will be deterred by the Korner sticker you get with the package.I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a simple and easy-to-use home security solution.
