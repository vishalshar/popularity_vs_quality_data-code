I'm really glad I purchased this GPS Tracker.  I've heard stories of people losing their pets, and if I could do anything to find him, I would.  The cost of the tracker and data plan are well priced.  I have people walking my dog, and I am able to keep track of him.  I did have a technical issue with my tracker, and I contacted Whistle, and they shipped me out a new device, so they stand behind their product.  I'm hoping that I never need to use it to find my lost dog, but glad he wears it from the time he wakes up to the time he goes to bed, to have some sense of security when he is out.
