My two cats track a lot of litter out of the box, and Scoop Free is rather sharp to step on.  I had another mat that was supposed to cure the problem, but it did relatively little good.  This one works much, much better.  It doesn't catch it all, but it has greatly reduced the problem.  I consider it an essential adjunct to the Scoop Free litter box.
