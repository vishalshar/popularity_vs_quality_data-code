I love it! I've had it for a few weeks, and I'll regularly use it to charge my phone for multiple days straight rather than plug my phone into a wall. And it's saved me a couple times when I've been biking in unfamiliar places and my phone (and thus Google Maps) dies on me.I haven't used the AC port on it yet aside from verifying that it does in fact work to charge my laptop (though I immediately unplugged it).
