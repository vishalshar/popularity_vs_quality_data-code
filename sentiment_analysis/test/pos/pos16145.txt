******YOU HAVE TO BUY A SUBSCRIPTION FOR THIS PRODUCT!*********I purchased this product because I am paranoid that my Pomeranian will get out when others are taking care of him. Nowhere in the description does it say that you need to purchase a subscription in order to receive the GPS tracking capabilities. It is not cheap, but not expensive either. I believe it cost me around $150 for 2 years. For all intensive purposes I do like this product because it allows me to track my dog's active time, inactive time and location. There are a few things I do not like however... The "home zone" does not simply include your home, but spans a 3 house bubble in terms of a standard neighborhood. This means that my phone would not be alerted that my dog is not in the yard until he is more than half a block away and I live close enough to a major highway that this is very concerning... Also I do not like that there is not a smaller size option for small dogs. This product is the perfect size for medium to large dogs and is great if you are not concerned about your home zone not being restricted only to your home if you do not live on a large plot of land. Overall, I would recommend this product if you are okay paying a subscription fee.
