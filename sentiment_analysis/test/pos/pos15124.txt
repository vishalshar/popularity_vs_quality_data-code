These worked great. We are temporarily in a rental home and have to use a shower curtain (I hate shower curtains).  It was sooo annoying to take a shower and having the curtain constantly blowing in while trying to shave my legs, wash my hair, and bathe. It was very aggravating. I saw these on Amazon, read the reviews, and figured WTH, it can't hurt to try it. What a difference!  It's so much more enjoyable to take a shower again. Don't get me wrong, I will take a shower door over a curtain anytime but this sure has made a difficult situation better. The plus side is that these would be so easy to take on vacation and use on those annoying shower curtain.
