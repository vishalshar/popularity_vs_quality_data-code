My dog loves this food!  It is a little higher in calcium that I would be comfortable giving a younger, faster growing large breed puppy, but my dog is over 8 months now and his growth has slowed significantly.  His stools are firm, and he gets more excited when I open his food container than with the few other foods I have tried.  His coat looks amazing, and he's got more energy than ever!  Highly recommend!
