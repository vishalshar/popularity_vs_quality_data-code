UPDATE.  A few app updates have fixed a number of the previous problems.  I would recommend, unless you are purchasing for the smart watering feature which still under-waters 50% of my lawn.  Updated my review stars from 2 to 4.ORIGINAL REVIEW WITH UPDATES IN CAPS:Just not ready for prime time, I feel like I paid full retail to participate in a beta product trial. I should add I am very familiar with home automation products.  Nest - Kwikset Kevo - Logitech Alert - WeMo - SmartThings product line.  Lots of potential, developers seem to be going in a good direction, but cannot recommend as of now.  I am 2 full weeks of ownership in now, 1 week on vacation 1 week at home.  While on vacation would verify if system was working by remotely watching security camera system we have. Lastly, my experience below was with: iPhone 5s, good 4G connection, home has high speed cable internet connection, wifi router and Blossom connection device were about 40 ft away from each other and 1 wall.  There shouldn't be any data connection problems.  I WILL NOW EAT MY WORDS, IT IS READY FOR PRIME TIME.  SOME FEATURES ARE LIMITED (SMART WATERING), BUT ITS MORE POLISHED IT IS A VERY NICE SYSTEM.I set up the system, and made sure everything worked.  This is my next two weeks:  NOW HAVE 2 SUMMERS WORTH EXPERIENCEPros-Installation is a breeze  STILL TRUE!-Very nice looking device  STILL TRUE!Con's (The one I can't get around is that it just isn't reliable)  MOSTLY FIXED, IT IS RELIABLE NOW.-No manual / tangible interface on the unit to monitor / operate sprinklers.  I knew this going in, but it was compounded by the fact the system often doesn't turn on through the app. I wish I could go to the unit and manually turn it on.  Instead I have to mess with everything for 15 minutes just to get it started manually.  The competition's product has this interface, but was only 8 zone (I need minimum 9).  I can't stress enough how much the average person will want a manual interface on the device itself.  I STILL WISH IT HAD A MANUAL INTERFACE, TO THE POINT IF THEY MADE AN ADD ON THAT PLUGGED INTO THIS DEVICE I WOULD BUY IT.  I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED A DIFFERENT SYSTEM IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE ZONE LIMITATIONS ON THEM.  THIS MAY NOT BE THE CASE ANYMORE.-App is a work in progress and it shows---Simply doesn't work too often. FIXED, APP WORKS CONSISTENTLY NOW---"Start Sprinklers" has a success rate of about 50%.  Its one thing when I am at home, and can see nothing is turning on, but on vacation when I return to find out my lawn has clearly not been watered when I thought it was is very frustrating.  FIXED---"Stop Sprinklers" has success rate of <25%.  Once your sprinklers turn on, just give up they are on until they are done with their cycle. FIXED---I will be standing in my yard after I hit "Start Sprinklers" and the app will say "Running Sprinklers" and nothing is happening.  Frustrating. FIXED---No ability to see current status of sprinklers more than just immediately after hit "Start Sprinklers".  Are they on?  Are they off?  What is going on. FIXED---Limited ability to know if app is actually communicating with device, needs status "connected" or not. I will try and start sprinklers, nothing happens.  Then I will try to adjust schedule and am told I am not connected to unit, so I have to log in again.  Would have been nice to know that right away or when I tried to Start Sprinklers. If I were gone, and tried to start sprinklers, I would have assumed they ran and the app was communicating with the device... when it wasn't.  FIXED---Very limited History.  I am on vacation, I tried to manually start sprinklers yesterday, where can I see this?  FIXED---"Smart Watering" isn't smart.  Our home is south facing, the front needs water every other day (rain or irrigation) or I have a weak yellow lawn.  The all day sun just beats it down. Smart water wants to water once a week. So I will manually "Start Sprinklers" then smart water pushes the next water date out even further.  Its useless for me.  IT STILL ISN'T SMART. A GOOD ATTEMPT, BUT I STILL DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE.---"Smart Watering" will tell me the 10th is my next watering date.  10th comes and goes.  Next watering date is now 16th, but history shoes nothing.  Did Smart Watering decide nothing was needed on 10th as it was scheduled (no rain leading up to or on 10th), or did it water but history isn't recording it well?  I STILL DO NOT USE SMART WATERING BECAUSE IT ENDS WITH A YELLOW LAWN FOR ME, NOT SURE IF THIS IF FIXED---Basically, if I left my lawn's health to "Smart Watering" I would have a lawn on its way to death. STILL TRUE---No ability to set up a manual schedule, and turn off smart watering? Because of smart watering's deficiencies, I just want to set a good old fashion schedule.. and yet can't.  The "Schedule" feature is simply when you will want "Smart Watering" to decide if your watering should be allowed.  FIXED, BEST FIX OF THE UPDATES.  I HAVE A SCHEDULED SPRINKLER SERVICE NOW, HAPPY WITH THAT.-Needs web interface as well, like Nest and other home automation products.  Having just an app is not enough.  STILL NEEDS WEB INTERFACE.Unfortunately I am frustrated by this purchase, and would not recommend it to others. If anything changes I will update the review.  UPDATED AS PROMISED.
