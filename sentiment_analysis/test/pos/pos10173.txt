I absolutely fell in love with the leaf months before I bought it. I got it in black and rose gold and I wear it as a clip on my bra, it doesn't show under a shirt, but I could clip it to my shirt and it would look great too. I noticed how many people were upset that it didn't start recording your steps until you have been active for more than 5 minutes, however, I really like that feature, I feel it gives me a more clear picture of what I actually did that day instead of making me feel better because my number would be higher. I did hike a 14er (about a 6 hour hike round trip) and my bellabe at said I did 19,000 steps and the pedometer on my phone said I did 38,000.. So big difference there. I did take some breaks so I don't know how much it actually recorded, but that's why I just use one on my phone too to get a few different counting devices.. I love my Bella beat and I Havnt been without it since I got it in the mail.
