First of all, i've been using fitbit and jawbone for the last couple of years for steps/distance/sleep tracking. I got to say this withings is just what i need in terms of accuracy, looks and functionality. One of the key features for me is battery life. I dropped Fitibit (i used fitbit charge hr) is because its horrible battery life which lasts 4-5 days at first and after 4 or 5 months of use it only lasts a couple of days (im the kind of person that always walks around with low batter in phone, if i can barely remember to charge my phone imagine the fitness band). Jawbone was more consistent with battery life but it gave me a rush on the skin and i had to constantly change it of wrist until i finally drop it. I decided to look for a fitness tracker with long battery life and nice build (i hate when people ask me "hey whats that in your wrist" and have to explain its a fitness tracker blah blah blah). So as you can image this watch its perfect for me.Steps counting: after 1 week of using both fitbit and withings sapphire, i found that withings its a bit more accurate for my life style, i do a lot of cardio in a treadmill and around 30 minutes of walking in the street. Both fitbit and withings do a good job there. Fitbit is a bit more accurate tracking things like running when you pause a lot (say, 5 min walk, 5 min run, then 5 min walk, 10 min walk and so on) whitings will detect probably the longest run while fitbit will summarize the runs. Its not a big deal since i care more about steps walked a day. I always noticed that fitbit adds a couple hundred steps every 30 mins or so when driving. while withings adds only a few dozen for the same period, when you drive between 1.5 and 2 hours a day like me this adds up to be a big difference (this only happens in city traffic where you have to start/stop and turn a lot, in highways both seem to be ok). So im pretty happy here with withingsSleep tracking: Fitbit and withings both automatically track sleep. I found withings to be much more accurate than fitbit. With fitbit i had to adjust 3 different days the wake up hours and one day it did not tracked any sleep at all (a sunday that i slept 3 hours) while with withings it tracked perfectly my sleep/awake time without any adjustment for every single day. Withings  did a pretty nice job here, couldnt be happierBuild quality and battery life: I owned a few other Swiss watches in the past, i got to say the withings feels a little flimsy and to be honest i dont entirely trust its build quality (time will tell) but it looks solid on the exterior, it came perfectly in box without a single scratch and working fine. Also, i found it to be an eye catcher for ladies (heads up guys with big wrists, the dial is smaller than it looks in pictures, you might feel it to be too small if you are used to big watches, luckly for me i have fairly small wrists so it looks perfect). About battery life i dont know but not thinking about charging it every couple of days is already a big win for me. ill report later on with battery life stats.Overall: i have to say this watch is one of the best purchases i ever made in the fitness tracking area. so far i had no rush or skin reactions from the materials, no reminding of charging the battery and specially pretty accurate and spot on tracked features. I would recommend it to everyone not looking for a smartwatch per se, but a cool nice looking watch with fitness tracking abilities.
