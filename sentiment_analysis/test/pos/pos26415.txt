As someone involving in analog synthesizers since the 1960s, and an owner of an original Arp Odyssey, this kit caught my eye immediately. I gave one to my daughter for her birthday, and she loved it. As she explored each configuration I could see her grasping the concepts immediately and relating each sound to the waveforms she was creating.This kit is not only fun to play with and incredibly educational, it's actually a completely useable analog synthesizer and sequencer. It would be great for creating unique background tracks, compelling leads, and sparking your musical creativity. Highly recommended.
