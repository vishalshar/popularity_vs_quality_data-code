Tired of the janky connection between my Pebble and it's original charging cord I decided to take a chance on this.  Works perfectly with the round and Time 2.  Great product, not only would I by again but I did already as a gift.  I would not hesitate to recommend this to any Pebble user. Thanks for making this, it removes my only issue with the Pebble. The fact that it connects to a standard USB is just a bonus.  Takes all the headache and fiddling around out of charging.
