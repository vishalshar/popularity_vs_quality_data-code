This is the ONLY hair conditioner that I purchased that my wife likes. She usually buys her own and always says she doesn't like the ones I buy. It is more expensive than the brands she and I buy, so it will be reserved for use by the 2 of us - no kids or grand kids allowed. I will definitely buy it again !  It's the only conditioner that makes my scalp feel happy !
