If you have a bunch of ir devices:Tv, Receiver,ect..Or TiVo orAmazon EchoThis is a must have to tie it all togetherA little skill on setup but once setup just what the dr ordered.It does macros and can even learn from your remotes.Just get it works on iOS and android.Yes it's pricy but it does everything it's the missing link.Bluetooth connection to Anymote so great distance or wifi direct to tivo.LOVIN IT !!!Tech support nice 24hr response no complaintsOnly regret is not buying it sooner.Alexa tell Anymote to pause tivo :))FYI - if your phone or tablet has ir just get the Anymote app. Only Anymote device can learn ir codesNot all downloaded remotes work so I created my own and learning ir codes took several tries before working so use the test option before saving. Add a rating system to downloaded remotes so one can know which ones work better.Update 7/17/16AnyMote's plugin for Tasker gives you all your remote commands combined with Sharp tools plugin for Smartthings v2 hub enables me to flash a light blue or toggle a light switch and pause my tivo automatically when my phone rings or I receive a txt. This Tasker plugin earns AnyMote device and software 5 stars. For those disabled and or hard of hearing this is great news
