I love this lotion--I'm a total convert. I feel great about using it, because it's all natural. It applies easily in a matte finish, not at all oily and makes my skin look great without any breakouts. And it has an awesome natural fragrance that is very masculine, so you feel like it's tailor made for a men's needs and skin. Even a drop goes pretty far, so one bottle lasts me a long time. For the price of drug store products filled with all sorts of chemicals and preservatives, this far exceeds in quality and value.  I can't recommend Thrive enough--their shave oil, facial scrub and facial wash are also fantastic and have become my go-to products.
