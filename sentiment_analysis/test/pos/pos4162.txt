After some initial difficulty with the Windows Phone (10) Vector Watch App (version 1.7.1), I finally found that by swiping the text at the very top of the app -- where it says "Watch Maker" on the default start page -- only then will it scroll to the other screens for "Store", "Activity", and more importantly "Settings". In the settings section of the app, there are options to change 12/24 hour time as well as Metric/Imperial Units. So that solved my biggest concern for use, and I'm now rather pleased with the watch.I have a Windows 10 phone (Lumia 950), and the app could use minor improvement (as most apps on Windows could), but it does seem to get the job done. I was stuck for a while trying to figure out how to just change basic settings (like 12/24 hour time and metric/imperial units) until I looked it up online. The screenshots of the app on other platforms show that it should have a menu on the bottom, but the Windows 10 version is missing this UI feature. That was initially frustrating. However, after seeing another review for the watch on Windows Central, I noticed a screenshot of the Windows app showing partial text for "Sto..." at top right, which led me to believe I needed to somehow swipe to access the other sections of that app. With that revelation, I was then able to access the complete functionality of the app -- and therefore the watch. It's much better with more apps, streams, and settings! :)Before the Vector watch I had a Microsoft Band 2. I became used to the having the notification from my phone on my wrist, which I liked. However, I only had that watch 1 year until the rubber band started to crack. So I was looking for a smartwatch replacement that worked with Windows Phone. (I didn't mind the lack of fitness sensors, GPS, UV, heartrate, etc -- thinking that only having to charge once a month would be rather liberating.) I've only had a couple days now, and it's at 88% -- so I would suspect it should easily last weeks on a full charge. So that's cool for a smart watch that's always-on.The notifications seem to work pretty good so far. Sometimes I've noticed a several second delay between receiving on the phone and then seeing on the watch, but that's not a major issue. Also, I found the music controls will work, but only if I start music on the phone first, and then the artist and song appear on the Music app on the watch, and I can pause (middle button) and adjust volume (top/bottom buttons). So that reminds me of the Band, but is perhaps more tactile using physical buttons rather than swiping on a touch screen.
