You would not believe the amount of headphones I've gone through in search of the perfect pair. I am a gamer, but you don't have to be in order to enjoy this set. As a matter of fact, I haven't even used them yet while  gaming. I've just been enjoying them as a music headset with a normal smartphone. I'm not an audiophile, but I like what I like. Do yourself a favor and get these headphones. They sound incredible! If you're a gamer, then this is the ONLY all-around option.
