I have been looking for a smartphone connected garage opener to save me the pain of having to find and bring one of the original garage openers : they are usually kept in my cars and this just add one more thing to busy life.Products I researched: MyQ, Open Sesame and gLink.[MyQ:]Pros: it's also sold in Apple Store and must be a solid product to be chosen by Apple.Cons: it's a bit pricy. In addition, some reviews on Amazon said it uses the traditional access code mechanism to communicate to the garage control console and for some old models, it requires some extra efforts to make it work. I had lots of issues related to "access code" when I tried and failed to connect my garage control console to my car's Homelink button so I decided to pass MyQ.[Open Sesame:]Pros: Price is reasonable; and it was featured "#1 new release" by Amazon under Garage Doors, Openers & Parts category.Cons: it requires battery.[gLink] Price is good; just like Open.S, it talks to the console via Bluetooth but doesn't require battery.I finally decided to give gLink a shot. The package looked a bit primitive but the installation is straightforward.  I have used it for almost one month now and found 1 minor issue: sometime it stopped working but then after I disable-and-enable Bluetooth from my iPhone6, it worked again. I encountered this issue twice so far.Other than that, everything works great. I will report back if I have more updates on my usage.
