I love my Withings Activae Steel! I like to wear a watch and I found it delightful to be able to have a tracker that is also a watch! I also love that it shows the percent of my step goal rather than a step count. I'm just starting out, have a bad knee and I don't need anybody sniggering at my modest step count. I bought the strap pack of three other colors because it's fun and easy to swap out the bands. I love the sleep tracker too and the alarm function. I also love that I don't need to charge it. It never comes off my wrist. Since it's waterproof, I wear it in the shower too. It'll track other activities as well, but I haven't gotten there yet. I love it!!
