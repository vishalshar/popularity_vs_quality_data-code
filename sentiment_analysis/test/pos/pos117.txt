I first received my Bluesmart and was very disappointed with the product I received  I plugged in my charger and my suitcase would not charge, even after leaving it plugged it in for an entire evening. It was also very frustrating for me that the instructions manual that is included with the bluesmart was rather vague, and I did not get a firm understanding of every functionHowever I reached out to their customer service team and, though it took awhile, was able to receive a replacement for my defective unit sent directly to me at my home.The new suitcase I received, along with more information from their team about the features of the product allowed me to have a much better Bluesmart experience! I recently took my suitcase on some travels and the battery charger was very helpful for myself and my family to stay charged right before our flight.That being said, the suitcase is small and I had to bring an extra check-in to fit my stuff.My favorite feature is probably the unique and modern design. The suitcase just looks cool! It turned some heads and got a few people to ask about it which is pretty cool for a piece of luggage.Given the help from the customer team and better clarity on the features of the suitcase, I am a satisfied customer!!
