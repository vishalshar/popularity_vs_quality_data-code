This mouse is wonderful and has no apparent negatives, except in the software you don't need to use more than once.(0)The Sensor: 5/5The NAOS 7000 uses the Pixart(1) PMW3310DH IR-LED optical sensor, with no jitter, prediction/angle snapping, or acceleration. It is the best sensor I have ever used.The Mouse: 4.9/5The coating is so smooth it almost makes the mouse feel soft, and has never left my hands feeling sweaty. The ergonomics are great, but be wary that your ring and pinky fingers may need to sit more curled than you're used to to utilize the rests. The coating starts to look worn due to skin oil, but can be wiped clean if found bothersome. The cable is braided, approximately 6'/2m long, and isn't as stiff as other braided cables I've had. I don't notice any problem with the grip/ergonomics, but it hurts my wrist.The Software: 4.7/511 languages. 5 profiles, each with customizable button layouts, sensitivity presets, and lighting/color options. No automatic profile switching.Mouse Settings: Polling rates in Hz: 125, 250, 500, 1000(2). All 7 buttons are customizable, however scroll up/down is not. Available functions are: left click, right click, scroll click, forward, back, dpi up, dpi down, profile switch up, profile switch down, profile roll(3), scroll up, scroll down, single key assign, assign record macro, and disable button. Double click and scroll speeds are adjustable as well as acceleration(4). Would be nice toSensor Performance: Sensor x/y can be adjusted individually in 50dpi increments from 50 to 7000(5) with 3 steps to switch between on the fly. It also includes a "Pointer Speed" option(6),  adjustable lift off distance(7), and a "Surface Quality Analyzer Tool"(8)Color Settings: One of the most interesting things about the mouse. LEDs can blink, pulsate, breathe, or solid. Color is set with R/G/B 0-255 values unless you choose to light or color the scroll and logo independently, in which case you get to choose from a 20 color predetermined spectrum. It can also "color shift", but it kind of goes Purple-Blue-Aqua-Yellow-Pink. Would rather see ROYGBV or an option to set your own color order.Macro Settings: I don't have much use for macros, but I tested it out for sake of review and it seems to be as good as if not better than other macro software I've tried out.Support: There's also a support page with links to the F.A.Q., registration, customer support, and software/firmware update pages.0: Some people recommend uninstalling software after you've set up your mouse as it may cause interpolation lag, but they might be crazy.1: Avago sensors are now Pixart sensors.2: Increasing poling rate lowers latency and possibility of prediction, increasing smoothness and accuracy.3: Profile roll functions like profile switch up, except at Profile 5 it goes to 1.4: The only application for acceleration is needing pixel perfect precision at low speeds. Otherwise it just makes you less consistent.5: 7000 dpi, in case you suddenly have a 20k x 20k monitor, or a game wants to reduce your ability to move the camera/cursor.6: The "Sensitivity" setting just changes your windows sensitivity, which will either divide or multiply your dpi. Just use the dpi settings.7: I haven't tested for speed failure, but usually the lower the LOD, the faster you can move the mouse before it fails to track correctly. Also, increasing the LOD can help the mouse track on less favorable surfaces.8: SQAT tells you how well you should track. Basically, if anything goes wrong with tracking, it probably wasn't the mouse's fault.TL;DR The only things this mouse lacks are automatic profile switching, a scroll wheel you can rebind, and pretty rainbows. Also it hurts me, and I don't know why. 9.6/10 would buy and return again.
