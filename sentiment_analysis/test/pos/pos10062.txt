I love this product. When I bought these I was so excited because the day before I was on youtube and I saw a video on how to clean makeup brushes and the girl in the video used this product to have her brushes dry. She said that they helped the brushes keep their shape and dry faster. As soon as I got these I wanted to try them out so I washed my fan brush and the next day after it dried I took it out of the brush guard and it was in the shape of a fan brush not a powder brush like I thought it would be. I was so happy. Now I use these once a week to wash my brushes.
