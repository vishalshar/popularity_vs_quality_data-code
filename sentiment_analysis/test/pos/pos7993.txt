Everything you need to replace a broken screen.  The YouTube video along with the written instructions were extremely helpful and easy to follow.  You really need to take your time when swapping the screens out, plan for at least a hour or so.  The pre-installed screen protector is heavy duty and definitely an added bonus.  The provided tools worked great but the suction cup to lift the screen doesn't work to well if your screen is severely shattered (like mine was)  so it took a little longer to separate the screen from the aluminum frame but everything worked out in the end.
