We love our Build it Kit by YOXO! First of all, I felt great about the fact that the kit was made from recycled materials, and there wasn't any waste in the packaging.My kids got into it right away. Typically my son needs help with building projects, but he just started building on his own! After a while I got in on the action, and I enjoyed it as well. Thank you YOXO
