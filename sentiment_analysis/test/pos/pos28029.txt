Just spent the afternoon getting every question that I could think of answered by the rachio team.  They were fantastic!  After installing it (easy) and setting it up (easy), I was concerned about the watering schedule that the computer set up.  I have no fears about the outstanding support from Rachio.  A welcome change from the normal. For example, I bought a smartwatch and a vacuum directly from samsung, and it's been a complicated and weary communications process which even after 3 months, i'm not sure if they will give me a refund on a backordered item.  Go with the companies that stand behind their products.
