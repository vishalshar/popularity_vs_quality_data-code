I have been using high end creams of one sort or another for 20 years. I eventually settled on La Mer when I was financially flush and Estee Lauder when I was struggling a bit. I now have a new favorite, finally. Seaweed Bath cream is so refreshing when it goes on. It keeps my skin moist for a long time and it is moderately priced. Finally, the ingredients are all healthy. Well done.
