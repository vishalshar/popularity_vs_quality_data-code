We got these for our daughter and her roommate who just started college away from home. It is not quite as loud as we had hoped, but will hopefully deter a would-be assailant because unless someone else is fairly close by, it will not be heard by anyone else (they also have pepper spray and a pepper spray gun on the way!) I did not test it in the parking garage, only in an open lot, so perhaps it would reverberate more effectively in there? Definitely would not rely on this little guy alone, though.
