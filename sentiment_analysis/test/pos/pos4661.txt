This product works just as advertised. For me I like to keep a carabiner on my keys and be able to have a lightning cable for my phone. Now I can have the best of both worlds and be able to have a cable that won't break on me when it is closed up. The only weird thing is that when you plug in your phone the carabiner can have a weird resting position but with slight adjustments it is perfectly normal. Great product despite the price tag.
