I really like this litter system. I'm a single mom to a toddler as well as going to school and I don't have a lot of time to scoop and take care of the litter and I don't want my cat in a dirty litter box, or my son being expose to it. This has been great I know that my cat is going to the bathroom in a clean litter box and when I want to throw the box out  I take the top that I have placed onto the bottom of the box during the month that she uses it (it stays very clean for that amount of time) and put it back on top and then just dispose of the entire product.  It is a very nice disposal process and I couldn't be happier with them.
