I got my mug two days ago and I am more than impressed, My main concern was size--I was afraid it would be smaller than it seems (I know its ounces are listed but you know that doesn't always translate into a practical size), For the 16 oz. I purchased it easily holds a fair amount of ice and an entire can of soda. I do not drink tea or coffee so I can't help you there. All in all, it isn't going anywhere. I have tested it and it works as intended. I work with sensitive and sometimes confidential information--I can't have drink spills on my desk or keyboard. I've had one good drink spill at my desk and it was not good. Also, I have had one of these trendy, huge mugs for months and they are not meant for the office. I would recommend this product over them--plus it's not nearly as expensive.
