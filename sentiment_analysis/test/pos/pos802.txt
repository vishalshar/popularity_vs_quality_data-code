I was looking for a gaming laptop that is not too heavy but is capable for most of the games. This laptop has reasonable price for 960M and 512G SSD. 8G memory and 6500U is a little concerning, but not too much. I would prefer a 14 inch laptop but it is difficult to find one with similar price. After about 4 months of uses, I feel like this is mostly what I need, with some caveats:1. 6500U seems okay (maybe I am not playing CPU-hungry games), but 8G memory sometimes is not enough.2. The screen is the part I did not like (I will definitely buy an IPS next time). It does not mean it is a bad screen, but I personally prefer IPS. a lot.3. Battery is just okay.
