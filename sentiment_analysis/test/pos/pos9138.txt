Yes,  this is expensive for the basic functions of offers,  but it does a great job.  The styling is great,  and I don't even know I'm wearing  it.  The use of batteries is a real win too.  How can a person track fitness when the device is on the charger.  I tried my wife's jawbone,  and  my  daughters Garmin. They each promise more,  but as with anything  the more things that something says it can do,  the less are done well. Both were more something you needed to get used to wearing and if you have a nice watch or jewelry you like,  it  would need to be worn on the other wrist. Buying this  was  was a great purchase.
