I received a Bakerstone Pizza Oven for my birthday last year, and after using it a half dozen times, I really like it.  The assembly was very simple and straight forward, and the build quality is great (all powder coated metal parts, and precision cut stones).  On my standard 4 burner Charbroil grill, this thing preforms very well.  In about 20-25 minutes, the interior temp reaches between 600 - 650°F and stays there.  This is for the bottom, the top and the sides - very even temperature all around.  A 10" personal pizza will cook in about 4 minutes, and tastes great.  It does have a taste that is typically associated with being 'wood fired', and that is from the charring the crust gets from the bottom stone.  The reaction is different than the dough against stainless steel as in a typical oven.  We've had a couple of build-your-own-pizza parties, and while kind of messy, are a big hit as people can experiment with toppings to suite their own tastes.Making your own pizza from scratch is kind of time consuming, and a pretty involved process, and so is not for everybody.  But if you do like doing that, this is one of the best ovens to do it with.  A friend has one of the gas fired dedicated stand alone pizza ovens, and it is difficult to get that one up to anything over 375°F (which takes a much longer time to cook, and doesn't get that charring), so this beats that $300 oven hands down.I think the only criticism I'd have is that the cover that it comes with is not for outdoor use, and disintegrates pretty quickly.  I would like the option of a solid UV rated cover that allows you to store the oven outside.  Other than that, I have no complaints about this at all.
