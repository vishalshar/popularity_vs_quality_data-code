This is absolutely my favorite filament to print with so far. I think the other reviews pretty much cover it, but I had to add my voice to the crowd.The matte black surface is gorgeous. I'm pretty new to 3D printing, but I bought a lot of filaments to experiment with, especially non-standard ones like carbon fiber, wood, and bronze fill. I have yet to use a material with a comparable/better surfce quality. I've been printing at 200C/0.1mm layer height and the texture of the carbon fiber seems to hide the layer lines on the side of the printed object so you can barely tell they're there, especially on more complex outer surfaces. And it really is easy to print with, as easy or even easier than other PLA I've used.The filament is quite brittle as other reviewers have mentioned, so careful when loading -- I haven't had any trouble, though. But the rigidity is an aspect of this material -- when printed, it's surprisingly strong. I printed a 150mm x 50mm x 10mm bar with 60% infill (I included a picture of it being printed), and I couldn't even bend it slightly with most of my strength.I also really like the spool itself (looks just like in the product image). Proto-pasta just has a cool sense of style overall, from the unique materials to the code in the background on the spool. I've already run through my first spool, and I've ordered another as well as some other interesting materials from them.Overall, I would recommend anyone to buy this. It's definitely worth the price.
