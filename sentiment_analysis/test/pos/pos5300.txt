Yes, it's pricey for a pet feeder, but given how reliable and well it works (not to mention how sleek and high-tech it looks) it's worth it! My cat has been waking us up to eat by knocking things over and running around at 5AM nearly every single day- and this thing solves that. I wake up, and he's already been fed hours ago. The website portal is extremely easy to use and simple to log in to from your phone. Only cons: The camera's resolution isn't great, but given that it's really just to see if your pet is eating, it doesn't really matter. Also, the motor is a tad loud but after a week or so of it going off you kind of don't even notice it anymore. I love anything automatic/electronic for pets that makes my life easier and this is a really awesome invention. Thank you!
