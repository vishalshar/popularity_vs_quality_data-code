It's a really nice, sharp looking piece of equipment. The USB charger section worked well and the size and portability is quite nice. Unfortunately I had to return mine because the AC power outlet part wasn't functioning at all; perhaps mine was just a defect. This would make a great gift for travelers on the go that might not have access to an outlet.
