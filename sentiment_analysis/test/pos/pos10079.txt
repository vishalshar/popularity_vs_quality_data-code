My dog hates it!  We have a golden retriever.  She is a very sweet dog.  She is also a very convincing dog.Whenever anybody would walk into the kitchen, she would look at them, glance at her food bin, back at us.And then with true puppy dogs eyes would communicate that she had not been fed yet.  Maybe not even ever.The kids may ask about to see if anybody had fed her.  Or they may just feed her as she was very convincing."Did You Feed The Dog?" changed that.  It sit s on top of the puppy food bin and clearly indicates if she hasbeen fed the normal twice a day.  In the week that it has been here, I have noticed out dog is getting a bit lessthick about the middle.  Maybe she was better at looking convincingly starved than my initial guess.I love Did You Feed The Dog? as it is a simple design solving a issue as old as the canine/human partnership.
