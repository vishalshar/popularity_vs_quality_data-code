The online instructions are pretty clear, and I was able to put the kit together in a little under four hours.It has been ages since I soldered anything, so I had to buy a few tools, but nothing major.The batter came charged, and the device came on right away with no problems after it was assembled. It started taking measurements right away, and got a gps lock in a few minutes.
