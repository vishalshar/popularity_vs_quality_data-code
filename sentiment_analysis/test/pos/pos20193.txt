The Brush Hero is amazing. Instead of dragging out the pressure washer to clean some wooden chairs, I used the Brush Hero. It was so much easier and it didn't tear up the wood like the pressure washer had in the past. I was impressed with the amount of torque it generated. It easily powered through the dirt build up. The construction is very solid. It should be able to handle anything I throw at it.
