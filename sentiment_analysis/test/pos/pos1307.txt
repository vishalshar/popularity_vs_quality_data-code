Ordered one of these and after a couple months it stopped working for some reason.  I suspect that internally the cables strain relief was not sufficient due to the metal casing, and eventually some internal connection wore out.  Luckily, this product has a Lifetime Warranty, and after contacting the manufacturer and explaining the problem they let me send in the broken one & sent out a brand new one.  Now I have a working iPhone cable again!Be careful how you bend this thing!  I wouldn't consider that the broken one was overly bent at all based on the usage in my experience, however it did fail somehow, and I suspect the internal cable connections were presumably broken with normal usage.  Giving this a 4-star rating for the company's responsiveness and willingness to honor the Lifetime Warranty!
