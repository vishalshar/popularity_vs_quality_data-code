This is the perfect way to G-Shock your Apple Watch. I am 6'1, 225 and this really adds some bulk to you watch. The factory strap that is comes with just seems to feminine for my liking and everyday use.There are plenty of reviews out there that say this thing sucks and the crown does not work. Here is some advise, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, when you bring both sides together make sure they are flush, turn the crown and push the buttons just to do a quick functions check. Once you tighten the upper and lower screws (tools are provided), start off slowly and continue to do a function check. This should help you make sure that you do not over tighten and effect the function of the watch.Seems pretty rugged and well built, I haven't had any issues with the watch coming loose. Definitely recommend this, although I would have liked to have it in black the grey will suffice.
