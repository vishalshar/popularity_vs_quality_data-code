This solar charged light really works. I have to admit it gives a better light for reading than the bedside lamp I have plugged into the mains. And the charger works too. Everyone should have (at least) one - but for us from outside the USA the prices need to come down. I was also very pleased that my purchase enabled someone in really dire circumstances to get one for free under the "buy one, give one" scheme.
