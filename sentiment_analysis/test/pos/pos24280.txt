I ordered this chair for my girlfriend who had just recently built her own gaming computer. When the package arrived she took the parts out of the box (which were very well packaged) and assembled the chair by herself in less than twenty minutes. The instructions were very clear and she felt confident from start to finish.She's been sitting in it now and absolutely loves it. She has adjusted it every which way to find a setting the fits her perfectly and has been very happy with this early Christmas present!The only thing that I would deduct for (which she and I argue about a little bit) is that the padding on the armrest is a bit more firm than I like. Since it wasn't for me I'm rating it 5 stars because the recipient loves it so much!BTW, I own a DXRacer and feel that gives me a great comparison for this chair. For me the DXRacer is slightly better because it has a model to fit me, I'm 6'3" but I feel this chair is very close in build quality, styling, and hopefully durability!
