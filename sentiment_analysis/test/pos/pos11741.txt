I love it !  I am so enthusiastic about WINK and it line of products that adding this make this product 10 time more worthy. Why?  Because it is not just smart, it is part of a system that combines features which makes our life somehow less stressful. Using time and detection, the "Robots" do by themselves whatever we should have taken the time to do. Remember that the setup will need a firmware update. Make sure you use a guest network with a simple password, otherwise installation can fail. Would strongly recommend to who has a Wink system
