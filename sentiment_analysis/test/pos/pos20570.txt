My husband and I recently purchased this mattress. I have to say we are pleased, but after sleeping on a spring mattress with a pillow top for over 10 years- it takes a little getting use to. I read all the reviews about the mattress on Amazon and they are very accurate. The only complaint I have is my shoulders being a little sore. But the firmness has helped my lower back pain. In the past I was a belly sleeper, but have not been able to sleep on my stomach in about 2 years. I thought the firmness would allow me to go back to sleeping on my stomach, but I was wrong. I don't think anyone can go wrong with the 100 night trial they offer- but be mindful you have to order from the Casper website for the trial and warranty to be valid! Also, with the trial- if you are not pleased after the first 30 days, they will send a topper to try as well. We have not opted to try the topper yet- but haven't ruled it out. We also sprung for the sheets and pillows. For the price, I wasn't overly impressed with the sheets. But they are nice. And the pillows are nice and fluffy! Which is kinda nice for the contrast in firm mattress. Here is my link to get $50 off!![...]Also, when we opened the box, there was no smell and was fully ready to sleep on in about 5 minutes. The instructions also said to open with the little tool they sent starting at a little dot. My husband and I never saw the dot, but we're very careful not to cut into the mattress as other reviews had warned.
