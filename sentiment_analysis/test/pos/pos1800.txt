Previously I've owned a couple of bluetooth speakers, which worked fine but I've often had connection / range issues. Sugr Cube is my first Wi-Fi speaker. I got it as a birthday gift from my partner and we like it very much. The build quality is excellent: the authentic wooden surface feels great, and the color fits well in my office. The touch and motion controls are cool. The battery life is pretty good. As a stress test, I used it for 5-6 hours a day, and the battery lasted for 3 days without recharging.The Cube app could use some improvements: for example, the radio stations sometimes don't work well. Fortunately these are software issues that can be fixed over time, and the firmware update is fairly painless. The Spotify Connect feature is currently my favorite. There is also a stereo feature that allows two cubes to form a stereo pair, so I may consider getting a second one.Overall I am very satisfied. It's a little pricy but it makes a great gift.
