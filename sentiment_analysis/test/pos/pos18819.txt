Update: ThinOptics got in touch and offered me a free replacement case, to solve the problem described below (I see from the reviews that at least one other person had the same problem), which I appreciated. However, as explained, I had already returned the glasses to Amazon so that didn't work.So I gave up on Amazon and ordered a pair directly from ThinOptics. They didn't come in the fancy packaging Amazon used, but they also didn't have the problem I was experiencing with the ones from Amazon.I've now had a chance to use the glasses for a while, and I have modified my rating accordingly. I like them, and only refrained from a five star review because when I first put them on each time, I feel the pinch on my nose as slightly uncomfortable. However, that quickly goes away (or I get used to it).Ironically, after my complaints about not having been able to attach the case to my phone, I have decided for now not to do so. This is partly because the case extends slightly below the edge of my Moto X, owing to having to avoid covering the flash lens. However, it's more because I don't always have the phone with me, esp. when I'm at home. Instead, what works well for me is to keep the case in my shirt pocket.The glasses themselves are fine. My problem is with the mechanism for attaching the case to a phone. This is supposed to be a separate double-sided piece of adhesive, as described in the instructions, one side of you are told to attach to the case and the other side to a phone or whatever else you choose.Neither item -- the original or the replacement I ordered when I had this problem with the first one -- arrived with a separate adhesive strip. Rather, when I took it out of the package, the adhesive strip was already attached to the case on one side and to a piece of cardboard, part of the packaging, on the other. It proved impossible to separate the cardboard from the adhesive without leaving a residue of cardboard. As a result, there is no way to attach the case securely to my phone.I may try these again from a different source because I still like the idea, but I've lost confidence in Amazon for this product.
