OK I am giving this switch 4 stars, because it does work flawlessly with the amazon echo, and the phone app works.  It loses a star because I could not get the damn thing to work with IFTTT - which was why I bought it.  I spent many hours testing it, reinstalling software, that was frustrating, especially when I bought a WeMo smart plug after that worked perfectly
