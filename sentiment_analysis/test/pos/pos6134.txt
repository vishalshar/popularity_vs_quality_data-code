Okay so if your anything like me you do a lot of research before making any purchase especially when it comes to phone purchases. You wanna make sure your getting a good quality phone for the money your about to spend on a new device. At $160 the Robin is perfect. (And that's coming from an iPhone fanboy).××Build××Now a lot of reviewers give their opinion to help guide your decision yet none of the reviews I've seen, read or watched really gave this phone the credit it deserved. The build quality on this thing is exceptional. Kickstarter project that actually turned out not half bad. Everything is put together like it should be and this phone feels premium. (as much as a poly carbonate phone can feel) It's the perfect amount of heft to make it feel secure in your hand while also being very light weight. (It's lighter than my 7 plus I switched from) the screen is a close second to my iPhones 7 Pluses IPS LCD display. At 5.2 inches it's not as big as my 7 but watching movies on it (by the way "Storks" was an excellent movie) is very doable and YouTube videos look crisp.××OS××Now like I said I'm an iPhone fanboy so Android is something to get used to. If your like me and switching from an iPhone this phone is the perfect middle ground as Nextbit OS (a lightly skinned version of Android) is very close to iPhone like homesceen setup with all your apps on the home screen and no "app drawer" (however adding a launcher can add that feature and more if you want an even more stock Android experience). The fact that this isn't full of bloatware/apps you really don't need makes this phone snappy out of the box. The Mint color throughout though may bother some people but it doesn't bother me. Nextbit is also good at every minor detail (when you swipe through screens you get a cloudy underlay behind your apps and above your wallpaper. Looks like a foggy cloud but it's really cool!) The phone ships with Android 6.0.1 with Nuguat coming soon. So it definitely will be updated to support newer emojis and etc.××Camera××This will probably be the shortest section but if your use to Android then this camera is a close third to it's Samsung/LG/Pixel counterparts. It's not iPhone quality but it's not security footage. It's doable. The back camera (13mp) is good takes nice photos in excellent lighting so outdoor shots will look gorgeous. The front camera (5mp) is, again, not iPhone quality but it's good. It's Snapchat worthy.××Battery××This phone has a MUCH smaller batter than I'm accustomed to, however, reviewers don't give this battery credit. The first day with the phone you will need to leave it on the charger because downloading and installing apps, getting your contacts synced, setting up your accounts, etc. Will drain your battery as is expected the first day you get a phone. It comes with a USB type A to USB C cable but no charging brick. I would recommend buying a charging brick (wall port, brick, square piece thingy whatever you call it) that supports quick charge 2.0 because without it (or one of those apple chargers that come with iPads and such) your phone will charge mediocrely slow if your trying to charge and use it at the same time. This phone does however have a great battery for moderate usage and it has easily gotten me through a full day's worth of tasks (and I'm considered a power user)××Connectivity××Okay here's another vague topic that many don't talk about... It says that it doesn't support CDMA which is true HOWEVER both Verizon and Sprint use LTE which is a GSM technology. If your Verizon or Sprint phone has a sim card it CAN in fact be used with the Robin. You will not however get 3G coverage when outside of an LTE service area. Besides that you can use it on any GSM carrier as well. It has NFC so it supports Android pay. It doesn't have the magnetic field version so it will not work everywhere but only where it's supported. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 are in here as well and get great connection to both.××The Cloud××You get 32 GB storage on the phone (24.9 after formating) and 100GB additional cloud storage (free of charge). If you use up your 32 GB your Robin will automatically start backing up photos (recently Nextbit has started rolling out support for video as well as mines backs up videos) and app data to the cloud to make room. Need something just bring it down and it will be restored like it never left. Best bet is to leave the "Backup on Wi-Fi only" and "When connected to charger" settings alone unless you have an unlimited data plan and are okay with draining your battery a little faster.××Overall××It's a great phone for the price however it's not for everybody. Its for a specific niche. Also, If you want this for the fact that it's different and you like the design definitely get the Mint color as it will turn heads (I got midnight and it's interesting still but Mint will get people talking). Too many reviewers try to put it on the level of phones built by OEM's that have the money to back a phone with better specs at a lower price however nextbit did a GREAT job with this one. It's not a Pixel or iPhone but it definitely will be competition very soon later down the road. Oh and Nextbit support is great. There's only one other company with support like Nextbit and that's Apple.
