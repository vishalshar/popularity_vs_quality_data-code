Was very easy to set up using the included instructions as well as those of the IOS app. Make sure your device is on a 2.4 Ghz channel for set up; I was using the 5Ghz at the beginning and it would not connect. Once the batteries were installed (I bought two), I did test the fire alarms and the notification came up on my phone. It is a neat concept and so far I am happy with the batteries.
