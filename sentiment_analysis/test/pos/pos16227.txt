We have been using this lunch box for my kindergartener every school day for the last month and a half and it still seems brand new. I have been able to pack everything from homemade french fries to casserole in the thermos and LOVE that it stays warm, and isn't something separate she has to carry with her to lunch if I pack something hot. The lunch possibilities feel endless with this lunch box and I am so happy I found it. I have been telling all of my friends and hope they will have more color options in the near future, as I'd love to order one or two more. The only thing I could change would be the ease of using the thermos - sometimes my daughter says it's too hard to open and other times I twist it too tight and it falls open. It's not usually an issue as this is at home, and so far hasn't leaked or anything in her backpack (where it is stored until lunch time).
