I bought this for myself (and two others for gifts after) using mine on an airplane trip. I put my cell phone, ID, and lipstick in it and wore it until my flight was over, rather than constantly, hurriedly looking for those things in my purse. I did not ever feel concerned that anything would fall out of it, as they felt secure.Since then, I've also used it for shopping, or even at home when I wear slacks without pockets for my cell phone.I usually wear it over my T shirt, as is a little hot if it's directly on my skin. Most of the time, I don't even notice that it's there.I like the choice of designs/patterns,I can even fit my keys in there, too, with everything else I mentioned.
