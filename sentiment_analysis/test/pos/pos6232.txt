Fun little hobby kit but not a real producer for the time put in. Ive harvested mushrooms from a bulk coco substrate mixed in rubbermaid totes and your pulling gallon bags of mushrooms every other day. This kit will yield you a small handful each day for a week or two but still very cool for the countertop or for kids and family who have no idea how mushrooms grow and are cultivated!
