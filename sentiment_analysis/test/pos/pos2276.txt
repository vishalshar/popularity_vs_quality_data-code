This product is one of the best natural products I've ever come across. I bought it by friend's recommendation as I've been really stressed at work due to urgent projects. It took some time before I started using it but when I did it worked like magic.I just add one packet to a cup of hot water every evening after coming back from work. It relaxes me totally, makes me feel good, and let's me sleep better. I also have more energy on the morning when I wake up even I wouldn't sleep as much as I used to do before. Just amazing! Good taste is a bonus and it has this little exotic anise taste and stevia makes it little sweet too which is nice.After using Reishi I started doing more research on medicinal mushrooms in general, and next I'll try the other ones for sure. I hope they'll make me feel as good as reishi. I don't know how it does it but I'm convinced for life.
