I buy everything in bulk. I store everything in Canning Jars (especially 1/2 gallon) & these are so handy. I have a black one that is on my all-purpose flour. Then they released them in colors. This blue one is now on my bread flour. I've also ordered a red on to go on the sugar. These make it so convenient to pour dry goods out & into measuring cups. I haven't used them for any liquids yet but I can see tons more in my future.
