This was a very expensive toy. When I got it I was on a business trip. Got home went through several Utube videos. When I went to use it there was a problem that was not in the book it kept coming up with magnetic interference. I called tech support and told there were sun flares or some such nonsense. I was told to take it to another area and test it out.Well we got it to fly and about 20 feet off the ground the controller disconnected with the drone. Again the magic words of magnetic interference came on the controller. I expected the thing to fall to the ground. Nope it was like an untrained dog let loose. It hovered for a moment and took off like a rocket ship. I have spent the last couple of hours looking for the da* thing. So much anticipation and so much disappointment.UPDATE....On Sunday Afternoon I was given a call by Tom and he assured me they were going to send a new drone out tomorrow. Fingers crossed but they seem like honest people so I upgraded my one star to a two star. Might go higher we will see. However if your a comedian and need some material hit me up. It was rather funny. I swear the thing gave me the middle finger on the way out. All I can say is it is a machine with alot of computer technology. If artificial intelligence is on this thing it was a Chucky doll gone crazy. Sounds like the name of a new reality show "Drones Gone Wild".So far the company is doing things to make this right.Seems to be the best support one could ask for. Yes there is issues. However when you find the customer support this company provides the issues become a learning path to success. I would recommend this company at any time.
