System was very easy to set up, you download the app to your phone and it configures the unit to then connect to your wireless network. It has been an awesome way to keep in contact with my cats when I'm away for weeks at a time for business. The ability to switch to night vision is great for when it gets dark too, no worry about never seeing the antics your pets get up to for a handful of treats!
