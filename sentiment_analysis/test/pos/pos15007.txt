This thing came to the rescue on my trip to florida. People in my family grabbed their samsung cameras, tablets and phones but forget to bring their adapters. On my entire trip, we all recharged our devices from this AC powered power station by purchasing cheap and inexpensive microusb cables. Definitely was a headache and trip saver. The positioning of the hubs helped keep the wires apart. If you're worried about unsightly cables, then this box isn't for you. At home I use it to charge two phones, 2 bluetooth headphones, a bluetooth speaker, and tablet. I made a wooden charging station to clean up the looks of my devices while they were charging, but that,again, is a matter of personal taste. Definitely recommend for any house that has multiple usb-powered devices.
