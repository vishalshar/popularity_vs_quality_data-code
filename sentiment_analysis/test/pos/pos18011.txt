these are fantastic, ive been using mason jars for my soap dispensers for a while now and the jar i bought had a metal lid pump and after a few months it was really rusty so that is why i bought these plastic ones, it will eliminate that rust all together and the white looks really good to, i would recommend these especially if you are using a metal lid and i love the look of the mason jars
