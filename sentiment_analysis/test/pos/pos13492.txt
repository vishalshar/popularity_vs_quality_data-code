i struggled with the idea of buying a tracker for some time because even though i could see the value in it, and used several phone apps to perform the functions that this one product could provide, i just felt that all the products on the market were not very attractive looking and i would never wear them. Also, it was very obvious what they were and i dont feel like i need to broadcast that i am keeping track of my personal information. Lastly, they all just looked very plastic and tacky to me. when i saw this product i immediately was drawn in by the lovely design and all the various options on how to wear it.  i have gotten many compliments on it already as a bracelet and a lovely piece of jewelry.the product works great, as as i said earlier, replaces several apps i was using to track the same things.  the app is very straightforward and  easy to use.  i only held back the last star because, as a runner i would like to see the app expanded to be a route tracker and keep track of my running time and route.  also a way to get my heartrate at rest and during activity, but i see these as improvements that will come to the app with time.
