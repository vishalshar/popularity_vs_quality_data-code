This is a wonderful gift for kids! I got this for my son for Christmas and he loves it! Keeps him busy with his brother for hours and it someone that he doesn't get board with. He always talks about different levels and how he wants to save money to get the smart ramp that comes with it. The app was easy to down load and it's great because they don't lose controllers for the cars because they use their ipod. Be careful where they play because we just got new base boards in the house and they could get beat up really quickly if you don't outline a place for the kids to play!
