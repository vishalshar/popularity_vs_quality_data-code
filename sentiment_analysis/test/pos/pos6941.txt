I've used GameGolf for 10 rounds, and while it's certainly not perfect and improvements can be made, it's a very good first gen tracking system.First, be aware of older review of their site from pre-June.  GameGolf has updated their website and data that they report since that time, so the review may be outdated.  You can easily create an account to see what kind of data it will report.Certainly the main feature of this product is to get average and median distances for your clubs.  Yes, you can do this now with a number of smartphone apps, but in my experience, the inconvenience of carrying a phone with you (I don't like a big device in my pocket when I swing), and having it charged to boot (GPS drains phones) is a real problem.  Where GameGolf shines is the ease of use in "tagging" your shot.  Touch the tag to the bottom of the device, feel the vibration and hear the beep, and you can ignore it.The main letdown I've found is GPS accuracy.  In my testing, the main problem is GPS lag... it takes a few seconds for this thing to realize where you are.  If you ride a cart, it could be 30 yards off if you immediately get out of your cart and tag the shot.While I've only had that happen a couple of times, I've changed my routine to tag the shot after I've made it.  This gives the unit a few extra seconds (probably 10-15) to settle into your location.  Since I've been doing that, I have far fewer edits to my rounds.I do look forward to continuous improvements to the website and data analysis, and like others would like to see some raw data dumps available.By the way, I'm a 3 index, and while I know my "good" shot yardages very well, it's interesting to see all shots rolled into one, and has helped me on club selection in the process.
