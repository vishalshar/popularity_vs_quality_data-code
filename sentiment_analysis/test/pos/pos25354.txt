I am really impressed by this product. It is so great to see such high quality products by startups. I was going to buy a nest camera on amazon but after seeing the canary and watching reviews on youtube i decided to buy the canary instead. Here are the pros and cons.Pros:1) excellent attention to detail. every aspect of the camera is just high quality. I couldn't bring myself to even throw the carton out because of how well it is done. The cables included are very nice and the camera itself is very pretty. The app is great as well. The features that are included are just perfect for the house - temperature, air quality and humidity sensors are great. The auto arming feature is really a nice touch as well. The entire product is very well though through.2) Great camera. Good fish eye lens, 1080p and very clear sound.3) cloud for video: The base video package is free and is actually very usable. So they don't sell you a camera and then try to make more money by forcing a cloud package on you. I will be upgrading to their 50$ per year plan and adding two more canaries.4) one cloud account supports up to four canaries. This is a big deal. it is because of this feature that i will be adding more canaries in the house. I don't mind the upfront cost, but the monthly fees can bleed you to death.5) Constantly improving. I have read through most of the reviews and clearly the issues that were reported by users have been fixed. This bodes well for long term use.Cons (more a wish list):1) Backup battery - If you pull the plug on the canary the unit immediately shuts down which means that if you sound the siren a thief could possibly just pull the plug on the unit. It would be good to have a backup battery to let the alarm sound even without power. Also this would be a good way to check on your pets during a power outage.2) ability to tilt the lens up and down. The lens is fixed which means that if you place it too low or too high in the house you will essentially be catching the floor or the ceiling. it would be great if i could tilt the camera to fine tune the video.3) out door model. It would be great to make a waterproof version of this camera with outdoor temperature and humidity.4) pets trigger the camera.
