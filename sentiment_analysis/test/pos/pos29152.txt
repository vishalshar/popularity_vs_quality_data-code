These multi flavored whole food vitamins are MUCH tastier than the all cherry flavored bottle I mistakenly ordered the last time! I only gave it 4 stars though because the vitamin amounts are pretty low and there's no vitamin d3 in them at all!! But we supplement with that daily anyway so it's not a huge deal, and the fact that these vitamins are WHOLE FOOD vitamins and in the form of a tasty gummy bear off sets the negative......Wish there were more childrens vitamins out there made from whole foods!!! These are THE ONLY one I know of that are a whole food GUMMY vitamin first of all..... There are others kids whole food vitamins out there but they are all nasty chalky tasting chewable tablets! So these are the best I've found so far!
