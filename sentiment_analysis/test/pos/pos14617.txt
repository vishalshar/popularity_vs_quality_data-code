I am so glad I decided to get the brush guard variety pack! They are amazing and I love how they work! I will be repurchasing many more of these. I don't want to try to diy make these myself, I love how these are made and I think the price point is spot on as well bc of the amazing quality of the guards! I'm actually surprised they don't cost a lot more than they do to be honest.I plan to buy a couple more packs of these babies. If you want to take excellent care of your brushes, I suggest u get these brush guards!!
