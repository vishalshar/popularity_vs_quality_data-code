I haven't tried it with soft cheeses, just Parmesan and Cheddars (which I tend to use in smaller amounts than soft cheese liked shredded mozzarella). The hard cheeses last at least as long as before. I haven't actually had any cheese go bad, so I am not sure how long it would take, but I am happy with them. I used a P-Touch to label the bags, and they are much neater in the fridge than the random packages / sizes I had before.
