I now own 12 of these WeMo switches and they have been working perfectly for the last 6 months, but that wasn't always the case. I got my first WeMo switch before Christmas 3 years ago to control my Christmas lights. Every month or so they would drop off my home network and the WeMo app showed them as "Not Detected". They just quit working. I would have to unplug and plug them back in to get them working again. It was frustrating, but I thought it was a small price to pay for the convenience. I purchased more WeMo switches to control table lamps and my porch Light but the more I had, it seemed the problems go worse. I was resetting these things weekly and sometimes more than once in a day. I wanted to throw them out and customer service didn't have clue.This may be a bit too techy for some people, but this is what I did.One day I had an idea. I know that when a network device has a DHCP assigned IP address, the IP is "leased" and will change once the lease expires (typically 24 hours). I thought "what if I set a static or reserve an IP address in my router that never changes? Voil≈ï, that did the trick!! I haven't  had a single problem since, and that was about 6 months ago that I made to change.I would recommend to anyone having problems with these switches, as I was, to try setting a static IP address before giving up. It's not too difficult, and for me it was well worth the 20 minutes that it took.
