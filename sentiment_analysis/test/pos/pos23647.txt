These headphones are phenomenal. They come with silicone and foam ear tips in various sizes so you can find your perfect fit. They do not have noise cancelling capabilities, but because they fit so well into your ear, they effectively block out a lot of ambient noise. The sound quality is very high and the control buttons (located on the right side wire) are easy to use and intuitive. I highly recommend these headphones.
