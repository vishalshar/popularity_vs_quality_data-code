I'm a real estate agent, and this little camera/imager is great for finding hold and cold spots in a house. So far I've used it to determine which windows in the house were leaking air, and to find the location of a heat duct in a wall. This is not going to replace the value of a home inspector (and their more expensive equipment) but is great for quick use and to identify areas that the inspector should check out.It doesn't work with my iphone due to the cutout size on my case, but it is perfect with my ipad mini.
