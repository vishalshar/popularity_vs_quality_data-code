I've officially been through my family's first virus with the Kinsa smart ear thermometer and I absolutely love it.  As long as I get the probe all the way in my children's ears, the temperature is one of the more accurate ones I've used (the Kinsa was giving really high readings on my three year-old so I double checked with a rectal temp on a regular digital and the Kinsa temp matched).  I have three kids (all who were sick), so having the app to synch temperatures (with times) and symptoms (as well as being able to note when I gave medications to each child and the time) was so nice.  No more trying to remember temperatures and times at the pediatrician (with three kids, this is pretty impossible!).  Each child has their own profile in the app.  The temperature/app synch over bluetooth and set-up was a total breeze.My only complaint is that sometimes, the synching process is a little more sluggish than I'd like.  However, this is really the coolest thermometer I've used.
