I am in the process of automating my home and currently have the SmartThings hub, the Philips Hue Bridge, Arlo, and a number of switches, sensors and locks all of which interfaces with Amazon Echo quite well.  I also wanted to include into the mix my Ozeri table fan, Ozeri tower fan, Favi projector screen, security monitor and my Minka-Aire ceiling fan.My goal was to minimize any type of rewiring as much as possible.  For some reason, the Z-wave switches did not work well with the fans.  I was able to turn off the fans with Echo but was not able to turn the fans back on.  Similarly, I wanted to not only power on/off my projector screen but also wanted to lower, raise and stop the screen as well.After reading about AnyMote, I decided to give it a try.  When I received the item, the setup was very simple but I was discouraged when I could not find the remotes for the items listed above in the Anymote app.  Shortly after, I received a welcome email from Color Tiger wanting to know if I had any questions or concerns.  I sent back an email explaining my situation and was pleasantly surprised to find an immediate response.  After exchanging a few more emails, I soon discovered that I was able to record and add any type of IR remote not on the AnyMote file.  The best part of all is that the added remotes worked and I was able to control the Ozeri fans, the Favi projector screen and the security monitor via the Anymote app.  I was not able to add the Minka-Aire remote because AnyMote only accepts IR and not RF signals.As an added bonus, my Amazon Echo can now control these devices as well.  For example, I can say, Alexa, tell AnyMote to turn ON my table fan, or Alexa, tell AnyMote to SPEED my table fan, or Alexa, tell AnyMote to DOWN my projector screen.  The name of the actual button has to be used in order for Alexa to acknowledge the commands.  I am also trying to set up a couple of Automated Task to occur every day in the AnyMote app but have only got it to work approximately 50% of the time.It has only been a few days since Ive set up AnyMote and Im sure I will be encountering more challenges ahead as I continue familiarizing myself with the app.  However, based on this short time, I would give this product four (4) stars.  Im still uncertain about why the signals sometimes drop or why Alexa sometimes will not recognize the specific remote (and I have to repeat the request/command several times for it to register), but then again, there have been glitches occurring even with my other existing hubs (i.e. television and lamp turns on in the middle of the night for no apparent reason).  I do plan to purchase another AnyMote and place it strategically near the items that I want to control.  The good thing is several AnyMotes in one room will not interfere with the signals of another AnyMote (as was confirmed by Tiger Color).As far as customer care is concern, the service Ive received thus far from Color Tiger has been amazing.  I would give them a five (5) star rating for their outstanding customer service.  In my opinion, their response time and good understanding of the product and app are excellent.  I look forward to future possibilities and improvements with AnyMote and the Amazon Echo interface.
