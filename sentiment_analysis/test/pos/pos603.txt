I have never loved a protein drink more!  This is perfect for an after workout protein boost!  Light and refreshing and sweet (perfect if you love pina coloada or have a sweet tooth).  It's not thick like the traditional protein shakes, but it does somehow leave a smooth and creamy mouth feel that I actually really enjoy.  I really feel like I'm having a splurge on a coconut cream infused pina coloada.  Only 1 gram of carbs too.  I need to look now and see if there are other flavors, though this pina coloada will be hard to beat!!!
