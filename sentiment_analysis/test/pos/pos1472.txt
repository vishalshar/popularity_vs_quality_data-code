Well this isn't a high quality infrared cameraquality.  I say this since I bought it to find  air leaks.  You really have to have an extreme difference in temperature to see small leaks.  It does show you where studs and rafters are.  And temperature gradients of large objects.  So in that I think it's hombuyer worthy.  Commercial grade it is not.
