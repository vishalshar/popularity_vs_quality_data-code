These are very luxurious socks. They arrived in a nice box - perfect for a gift!  They're ankle socks but don't have a thick band around the ankle.  The soles are very cushy. You'll definitely notice the springy layer between your foot and shoe. They're soft on the inside and thick enough to be a cold weather sock.  Style wise, I wouldn't wear a sock this high on my ankle with shorts but that's personal preference. What they are absolutely perfect for is to wear with boots and booties. I wore them with leggings and a pull on style boot which normally causes socks down to bunch under foot or sag around the ankle.  These absolutely stay put all day and provide plenty of padding to prevent any rubbing. The ankle length is perfect to tuck under jeans or leggings and not add extra bulk around your ankles and calves.  I will be wearing these everyday this winter!
