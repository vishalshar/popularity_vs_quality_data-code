I spent several months to investigate nearly the entire pet feeders in the market, and I can confidently say that this one is the best among all. The design is pretty, looks like a very high-end feeder, and very convenient to set-up feeding time, voice messages etc. The tray makes very loud sound when it turns, and my cat was very scared at first that she didn't even want to come close to it. It took ~1 week for her to be comfortable with the feeder, and now it is working perfectly for us. For the next model, I hope the company considers finding ways to eliminate or reduce the grinding sound from the tray and also adjust the angle of the camera to be able to see the remaining food in the feeding tray (or add a motion detector). It was difficult to know whether my kitty was eating well while I was gone for few days because she does not come to eat right after the tray is turned to provide fresh food. (but I think my suggestions may not be needed for dogs) But overall the quality of the feeder exceeded way beyond my expectation, and I am very happy with it.
