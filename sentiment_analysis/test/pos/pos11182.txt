Worked right out of the box and i got luck and got one that came with a Bonus pack valued at $30 that has a bag a nubby cover and glow in the dark ramps and the cradle that you can keep it on when its not charging is glow in the dark. Also if you don't want to have to play it like a game with the regular app just download that first to make sure the firmware is up to date then download sphere drive and you can do what you want like a free mode.
