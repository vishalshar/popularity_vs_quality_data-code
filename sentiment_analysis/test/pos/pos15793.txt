These work great for making milk and water kefir. On the other hand, when I fermented a spicy Indian vegetable recipe and the juice briefly came into contact with the Pickle Pipe, they were stained and I couldn't get the smell out. Even after I soaked it overnight in vinegar. So, I can't really use the affected ones again. The ones that were unaffected still work great!
