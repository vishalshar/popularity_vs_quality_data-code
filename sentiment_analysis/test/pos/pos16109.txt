I love that this product delivered as promised. I had seen it previewed in a YouTube video and was glad that I got it here for a great price. It does not interfere with the CD player and is great when I am using the GPS/map function. No it does not move or adjust for easy viewing, it the simplicity of it vs the price made it worthwhile to me. The ONLY downside is that to use it I have to remove my phone case, but that's bc I am an idiot and not read the directions. Luckily for me my cover is easy on and off. Even my wife agreed this was money well spent
