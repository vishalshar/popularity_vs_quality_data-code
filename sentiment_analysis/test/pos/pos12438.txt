The IR is brighter than I thought, I can see the entire room from my wifi camera as if it was daylight. It does feel a bit warm to the touch while the bulb is on IR mode thought. But aside from that, it does its job. Would be nice if there was a way to turn off the IR from the app, which I hope will be fixed soon enough.
