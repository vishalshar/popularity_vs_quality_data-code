Works great - make sure to get the right size. Follow instructions; have it lined up correctly and fit as directed then you will have no problems. Controls a pulling dog like no other walking harness or collar I have tried. Does not hurt the dogs neck. Just make sure it's not pinching the dog but also it will not work properly if too loose. My dog doesn't particularly care for it as he is highly energetic, liked to pull and do his own thing. Now, he turns easily, the correct direction and will stay by my side in the "heal" position. Work with to dog to get used to it but after 4-5 times....we have no problems now. Highly recommend it.
