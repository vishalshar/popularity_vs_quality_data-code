These wipes are AWESOME!!! Used many times after running half marathons and they really leave you feeling clean and fresh! Start with your face and end with the private areas. They are thick and big like a cloth. They are packaged well and easily fit in my hydration pack. They take up very little room. Would be great for people that camp, back packing trips, a long day at an amusement park or outdoor festival.I wish they were a little cheaper.
