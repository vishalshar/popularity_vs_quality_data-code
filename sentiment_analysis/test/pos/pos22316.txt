My son usually can't sit still.  He has trouble focusing and staying on task.  Since starting these we have seen a major improvement.  Like night and day.  We go into a store now and we enjoy it, before it was constantly don't touch that, put it back and on and on.  He sits and completes homework with out constantly fidgeting and messing with everything in sight.  We are VERY pleased with the improvements we have seen. Would recommend to any parent that has a child that is "spirited"/
