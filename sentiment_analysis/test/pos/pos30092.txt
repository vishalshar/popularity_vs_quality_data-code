It is in fact not too small as most of the reviews say, and I'm happy about how it protects the camera. I do hope it has a flop to cover the screen also but since it's an old product I don't think they'll make another model...I bought the camera for around $50 just to try out how the technology they've been described and see if I should get the $1500 Illum,
