My cat has been an indoor cat for 7 years. We recently moved and now have a large yard that we wanted him to safely roam in. Setting up the fence was easy and we set the collar on low to start with because some of the pictures of hurt cats were scary. It did not take my cat long to learn the boundary. Even got some funny utube videos out of it. It has now been less than a month and my cat loves going outdoors. I leave him outside all day long, and only bring him back in at night or if I leave the house.In reference to those scary pictures - the owner must have set the level wayyyy toooo high. There are 5 shock settings so that you don't need to BBQ the cat to get the point across for him not to cross the line. Also, once your cat knows the line, they won't get shocked anymore.
