I use an Easy Walk Harness for all of my dogs to minimize pulling.  But when they wear this glittery version, they look both stylish and obedient.  At least one commenter noted that the material is rough and can cause abrasions.  This is true.  The harness scraped one of my dogs a bit  when I walked him after he got a buzz cut.  But no problems occurred after his hair grew a bit.
