This is a great little camera. it took a few times of using  it to figure out the best place to wear it and get the best pictures. I have used it around the house, at parties and while hiking through the Arizona Painted Desert/Petrified Forest. The pictures are remarkably clear and the camera is so light that you forget you are wearing it. It's easy to turn off, I just put it in my pocket or turn it face down on a flat surface. The uploading to the Narrative website is painless and you can edit the pictures before posting them to a shared folder. I love it and am looking forward to taking it on vacation this summer.
