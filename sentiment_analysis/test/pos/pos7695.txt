I dont use this as a cap to drink from so i cant vouch for the leaking issues others have mentioned. My only real qualm is that you can bet if the canning company made this it would be 1/3 the cost.That being said i LOVE this lid! I am on a liquid diet by medical necessity so i make and use alot of different broths and liquid soups. You can imagine how annoying Tupperware is with that so i switched to the much more eco friendly and useful canning jars. The downside to that is that with my arthritis even the plastic caps are difficult for me to get open. Nothing like staring at a fridge full of things you cant eat because you cant free them so this seemed perfect to me.Works great for me. I can open easily though i do need some help occasionally getting it off an empty jar (usually a gripper pad after letting the jat come to room temp does it). Doesnt leak when i need to shake things to recombine the sediments (like liquid soup or fresh juice). Wide enough spout so my thicker stocks can still be poured or shaken out.Plan to get more but its cost prohibitive so i get one a month for now until i can find a better price, ale, or item to replace it with
