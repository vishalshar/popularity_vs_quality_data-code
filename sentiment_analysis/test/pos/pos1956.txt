Love this thing.  Makes a really decent espresso on the go.  I get a lot of complements on it at work.I grind my one coffee and have been experimenting with different grinds.  I've noticed a medium fine grind does the best as apposed to an espresso fine grind.  With the medium fine grind you to do a light tamp without having issues of a seal blowing out or lossed quality in taste.  I still get a nice crema too.The finer grinds I've noticed the device has a harder time with the pressure build up almost feeling like it will blow a seal.Other than that I love this thing!!
