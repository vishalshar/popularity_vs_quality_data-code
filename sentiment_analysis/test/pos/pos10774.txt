This is the most amazing camera ever!  I've lost power and had internet disruptions and the minute they come back up my camera automatically logs back on.  Had it up and running in less than 3 minutes.  For the price you can't beat the quality, ease of use and flexibility to move it around to various places within your home or office to suit your needs.  I've used it for as a pet cam, to monitor when subcontractors arrive and leave and for security purposes.  Have one at my mom's so I can keep an eye on her after surgery. AWESOME!!!!
