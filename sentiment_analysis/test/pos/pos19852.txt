Heard a brief plug for these devices on a podcast I listen to and as I've been looking for a bluetooth speaker I thought I'd give it a go, although it was a little more expensive than I'd have liked.To give a baseline for the review, I'm no audiophile so as long as sound quality is adequate, I'm happy, also, I've listened to much more in the way of podcasts than music using this device and that is likely to continue.First, when I originally ordered and received the item (in Australia) the delivery was reasonably quick (as always) and I was pretty happy with the device, however, after about 3 days it died, could not be paired or powered on, but was visible to a computer if plugged in via USB, but none of the other functions worked. I contacted Fugoo support and after a short support call, it was determined the speaker should be sent back. As they are a relatively heavy device this cost almost AUD50 which added significantly to the cost of the device, however, after about a month I have a new device and so far so good.The volume is pretty good, if I working in a noisy environment like the garage, I can still hear the media I'm playing pretty well, battery life seems to be good so far, I'd estimate I'm going to get about 10+ hours of playback (mostly podcasts), the few times I've played music the depth of sound was good and the bass response reasonable for such a small device. The bluetooth range seems good, being 20m away from the phone in our apartment is no problem.My wife has a Bose SoundLink Mini which is also pretty good, though I think the Fugoo puts out a bit more volume, the Bose has a more refined look and a charging pad which is a nice feature, though again, I prefer the unusual look of the Fugoo.Overall I'm very happy with the device and while I wish the original hadn't died and had been replaced faster, overall I can't fault their service. I'll update the review in a month or so to confirm the device is still working ok but so far it's been a good purchase.
