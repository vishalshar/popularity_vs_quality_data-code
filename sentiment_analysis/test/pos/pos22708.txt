The Vurtego V4 Pro is simply an amazing piece of American engineering. Due to a combination of great quality and outstanding customer servic the Vurtego V4 is impossible to beat.  I actually purchased two Vurtego V4 Pros. I ordered a Medium for myself. I am 5'11" and I weigh 195 pounds. My daughter is 10yr old and weighs 70 pounds. I bought her a Small.These pogo sticks will last forever. All parts are replaceable if need be and customer service is excellent.UPDATE: After a few days of use, I wish I could give this a rating higher than 5 stars. Product quality is amazing. Our family of 5 has had so much fun with this. Age range from 37 down to 6. Lots of laughs, fun, and GREAT exercise!!My recommendation: BUY THIS POGO Stick!!  Once you do, take time to watch the instructional videos on the website. The videos are so well done and very helpful.I sent a thank you email to the company, and got a reply direct from the Owner. Customer service like that is a rare gem in 2017!!A+++
