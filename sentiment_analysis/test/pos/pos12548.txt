Overall great product. I received it quickly from Amazon and can't believe how easy it is to use and setup.  I attached it to a reusable grocery bag and with the range alerts I never leave the parking lot without forgetting my bags in the car. I plan on expanding my hive and buying several more, and for gifts as well.  Thanks Pebblebee!
