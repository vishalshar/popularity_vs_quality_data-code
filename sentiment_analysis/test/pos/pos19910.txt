This tastes exactly like sugar however it's probably much healthier.  It is grainier so it takes a little stirring to get it to dissolve.  There is no aftertaste.  I will definitely buy it again.  Does anyone know why it isn't available in grocery stores?  I wish it were less expensive however my husband is diabetic so it's worth it.  A friend gave us a one pound bag to try so I knew what to expect.
