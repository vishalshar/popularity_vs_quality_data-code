I purchased this for my 8 year old son after promising him a "laptop" for his birthday.  As someone who grew up building computers with my father and having my own IBM PC Jr as a child, I have been frustrated by how detached my children are from the technology that we use.  They have no idea how anything works.  Everything is an "App".  The operating systems are so dumbed down that there is little use for a keyboard anymore, let alone a mouse.  Point and click has been replaced by a tap and swipe.  Anyways, the Piper Computer Kit bridges this gap in a way that is beyond anything I ever expected.  You not only get to build an actual computer, but you also get exposed to programming, circuitry, switches, electrical current, etc. all through a tailored Minecraft story.  The pinewood case has an antiquated, almost heirloom quality about it and the electrical components are equally well-crafted.  As I my son races to connect the blue wire to the 5th pin so he can connect a switch in order to ambulate his character on the screen, I can tell that these are memories that he and I will both cherish.  Thank you, Piper.  Well done.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
