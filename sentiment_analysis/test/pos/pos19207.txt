I received these chews as a gift from the weeSpring Parent Panel and I really like them. I had my digestive tract all happy with the OTC prenatals I was taking but it went all wonky again when I ran out of them and started taking the prescription prenatals from my doctor. I was so irritated by this that I stopped taking my prenatals after my baby was born, despite the fact that I'm breastfeeding. Now that I have this Premama Digestive Aid I'm back to taking my prenatals because I've found that taking one or two of these in the morning with my vitamin keep things going. The chews are slightly bigger than a caramel and almost as yummy. I really enjoyed the flavor, though I agree I wouldn't eat them like candy, but I do find that they leave my tongue feeling a little fuzzy for about 20 minutes after eating them. They were wrapped in a wax type paper which is easy to unwrap. Inside the box is a silvery resealable bag (which needs to be cut open the first time) and I like that the chews aren't just floating around in the box. I would definitely recommend these chews to other mamas. Thanks to the weeSpring Parent Panel for sending me these chews!
