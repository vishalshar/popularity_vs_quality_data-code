I use this laptop for a mixture of school work and gaming. Not only does this laptop pack a powerful punch, but at the same time is extremely light. Coming for an Asus G73JH, this laptop blows that one away. This laptop is two,if not three, times faster. The aluminum chassis not only gives it a professional look, but it gives it an excellent build quality with no weak spots. Coming from an Asus G51 and an Asus G73JH when I saw this keyboard I knew exactly how beautiful of a keyboard it is. The backlit keyboard works beautifully while typing at night. The hard drive is extremely fast, and the RAM is excellent while having an available upgrade. I would recommend this laptop to anyone and everyone.
