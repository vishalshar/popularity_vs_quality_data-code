This I have to say is a very creative and unique stylus. I love the carpenter design of the stylus which makes for a pretty comfort fit. Also I think one of the most unique things is the material its made out of. By being made out of wood your stylus is unique to you, no one else will have the same wood design which really helps for that unique pristine feel. Also the boxing for this stylus is really awesome, when you receive this package it will come in a cardboard tube which has to cardboard holders that hold the stylus in the middle. This is an awesome box because you can then use the box as a stylus holder so that it doesnt get damaged in your bag or other compartment place you place it. It however does not work on screen protectors and android devices but when your screen protector comes off of the Ipad this thing works wonders. The rubber tip is decently hard and allows for pretty smooth and easy control. Once this stylus is setup, it becomes pretty easy to use, with its simple design there is no hassle of pushing any buttons. Also if you pull at the tip the hold stylus comes out of its casing which has a built in USB for quick charging. This whole thing is well put together and allows for some really unique uses. Currently the company 53 is still working on some other apps and utilities to go with the stylus which means there even more to expect from this stylus in the future.
