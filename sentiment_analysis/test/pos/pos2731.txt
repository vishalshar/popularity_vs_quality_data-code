I spent 20 yrs as a product analyst so it went again my grain to make an impulse purchase.  After approx. two weeks I narrowed my decision to the Bose Soundlink, UE Boom and Fugoo.  In spite of all the great reviews on the Fugoo, I purchased the UE Boom as it was readily available at the Verizon store whereas the Fugoo was mail order only.  The UE Boom meet all my expectations until i couldn't resist the urge to proceed with ordering the Fugoo.  Once it came in I compared the two and suddenly the UE sounded muddier in comparison.  The Fugoo has fantastic sound clarity with outstanding range from bass to treble.  As a matter of fact, I prefer to listen to the music thru the Fugoo rather than my F150 which has a Bose system.  I would suggest to anyone looking for durability and exceptional sound quality NOT to pass up the Fugoo.
