Sometimes you don't realize how much better a product can be until you start using something that reimagines the entire experience from end to end. The Starry Station wireless router is one product doing just that, raising the bar for the entire category by making managing your wi-fi connection as easy and elegant as the rest of your digital devices.I'm a reasonably tech-savvy person, but definitely not a geek. As I kept adding to the number of devices that connect to the internet, my old router was starting to struggle at times and I was interested in getting something that was a step up. Given what I had heard about Starry Station's ability to easily set up your network and help make sure that you get the most out of your internet connection, I thought it was worth a try. I'll also admit, having a beautifully designed and unique piece of equipment that you'll want to display in your home was an added plus.Starry definitely rivals the best Apple experiences from the moment you receive the box. Elegantly packaged and simply presented, the router is incredibly easy to set up straight out of the box, with no manual necessary. You simply plug in the power adapter and the ethernet cable to your modem, and follow the directions on the touchscreen display and Starry does everything  you never need to install or run any software to set up your wifi with Starry, which makes you wonder how we lived with terrible router experiences in the past.Starry makes your wifi connection information a lot more interesting and useful than I would have expected. Through the onscreen messaging, I could understand a bit more about how using 5Ghz made a difference for certain devices, or just tracking overall general usage. While I didn't need all of the data available, it was nice to have an easy way to feel assured that things are working as well as they should.Performance of the router is very good so far. It does seem to help optimize the network for a growing number of devices, and it improved my signal across my very long but narrow apartment, without having to do anything else on my own. After a couple weeks of use, it's still going strong and the signal hasn't been interrupted once.I also appreciate Starry Station's small but thoughtful features, like the automatic wifi password generator and call button for customer support, all of which are accessible from the touchscreen. All in all, this is a great product that changes the game for wifi routers and the overall experience, which bodes well for their forthcoming internet service that could prove to be even more exciting.
