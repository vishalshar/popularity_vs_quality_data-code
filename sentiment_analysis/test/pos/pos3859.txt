This stuff really works to bond polish to your nails! I've used a variety of other bonding base coats and they don't seem to hold as well as this one does. I'm pretty rough with my nails during the day and with others I chip so easily, but with this one I've noticed the polish will definitely last me longer than others. It's kind of pricey, but definitely worth it.
