This is amazing, I love it and I've already saved friends and family from the torment and frustration of throwing another cable away.I am blown away every time I use it. Nothing I know compares.There's more than enough in each of the ten packs for most jobs. One pack is usually enough for two breaking wires, unless the cable is in critical condition (which has yet to happen to me).Make sure you work with it quickly (one could lose track of time while playing with it), it could start to stick to your fingers, but good scrubbing should get it off without too much effort.
