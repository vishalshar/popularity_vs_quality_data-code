Batter life- Really good. Lasts about 12 hoursSound quality - It's good and even better than most gaming headsets priced similarly. I have a wired setup to use my Audio Technica M-50 which is awesome at price level that sounds better but I prefer LS30 because of the all in one package.Setup with PS4- really easy. Got it working in less than 3 mins. Cans Came charged so I was able to use immediately.Voice Chat- really clear Chat.Comfortable while wearing for long. Range is decent- I sometimes walk to another room (about 10 feet away and I still have connection)Flaws so far- listening to Spotify while gaming prevents chat function from working. Stopping Spotify and unplugging & plugging headset transmitter from PS4 seems to fix it.I will update this review as I continue to use it
