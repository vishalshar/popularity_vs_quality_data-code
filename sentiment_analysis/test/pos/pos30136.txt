I bought this with high hopes- it's a lot of dough to drop on a stylus. I will say I am glad I sprung for the wood version- the wood is lovely and the wood pencil shape feels great in my hand. I'm a trained artist so I'm very comfortable with this kind of pencil.I love the Paper 53 app more at this point-it is cleverly and beautifully limiting. I do believe that they have not quite hit the right balance though, and this stylus factors into that belief.The first thing I will say about it is that there is a learning curve. It's pressure sensitive and it takes awhile to get the hang if it. If you don't push down hard enough, you get a weird annoying smear. When I am shading I naturally use quick, light strokes, and that is one of the things that causes the smear, so it gets frustrating. It's counterintuitive. The tip is squishy feeling, which exacerbates this issue. I'm both a graphic designer by trade as well as a fine artist/illustrator so I need a tool that can accommodate both precision and detail, as well as more loose, expressive strokes. Here's a link to some of my work on Behance if you want to see what I'm trying to say:  www.behance.com/MetaphormidableI did find that once I practiced for awhile, I had an easier time of it and was getting better results, and for sure better than a plain stylus. It is a fun toy for me at this point- I don't think it is useable if I'm under the gun to actually produce something.I think if a few of the issues I have with the app were corrected, the stylus would be infinitely more useful. Paint badly needs a layers option. It also badly needs options to adjust tool width and opacity. Just those two simple things would bring it into a whole new realm of usefulness. I do understand imposing limitations similar to actual media, and why they would want to do that, but honestly, if my marker is too thin, I go pick up a thicker one. If my paint is too opaque I water it down.... That should be part of the paradigm for this app if they are truly going for realism.For example- if the app had layers it would be practical to do your watercolor on one layer and then be able to draw with pen and ink on a layer above it. It's no different than waiting for your colors to dry then pulling out your ink and pens. And your pens will most likely have more then one tip width.But I'm not supposed to be reviewing the app- I'm supposed to be reviewing the stylus- sorry, I digress.As far as smoothness, like I said earlier the stylus is a little mushy. There's space between the end of the tip and the actual end of the rubber bit over top, so it has to be pushed down against your screen when you draw. This is not the smoothest technique. Being able to flip it over and use the eraser is nice though. I do think overall the good outweighs the bad, and I would buy it again. At the same time, they really have no business charging the amount of money they are for something that feels like it is still being developed.So on that note, it's really got the potential to be a fantastic tool, so I hope they keep developing this.Update: I've been using this stylus for several months now, and already some of the things I fussed about in my review have been corrected. (Such as Paper53 adding a layer in the workspace). I've also had more of a chance to really use this stylus and figure out where it fits. Also more and more apps are compatible with it- big bonus.I love the feel of it even more than originally. It really does feel great to hold. It definitely has a little "familiarity curve" for lack of a better word- I found that I needed to get the hang of using it over time in order to really appreciate what it could do. I find that it's a great tool for drawing and painting, and I seldom get through a piece of work without pulling it out at some point.To get an idea of how attached I've become, two days before Black Friday I misplaced mine. Panic ensued. I searched everywhere but never did manage to find it. More panic. Then I noticed Paper53 had a great BF discount going, and promptly plonked down forty-some dollars for another one. I draw daily and i realized it's really become pretty essential to my work. I couldn't get through more than a few days without it.I still enjoy how easy it is to connect, and to charge up. I wish they'd include something to carry it in though. Also worth noting- after about 6 months of pretty heavy use I had completely trashed the tip and replaced it.So I guess that means I have to up the stars to 5. It's not perfect- not by a long shot. But it's a great tool to have in your arsenal.
