Works well for sous vide cooking. The seal holds as long as it's not submerged. The silicone is a little stiffer than ziplock bags, but it is flexible enough to form an adequate vacuum. The only drawback is that the bags are too small - you really can only cook small portions of food. I contacted customer support and they said a gallon size bag will be coming out in March 2017. I am really looking forward to that!The bags themselves are very sturdy and made of very high quality material. They will probably last years!
