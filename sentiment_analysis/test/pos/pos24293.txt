Just got hold of the iPhone 7 rugged case. I have had a case for iPhone 6 and 6 plus. Both of these cases have endured multiple drops from 4-5 feet with the iPhone on all cases coming out unscathed.  The case however like many users have commented will crack in the area between the apple logo and the camera. The new design for iPhone 7 took away the replaceable magnet insert and instead buit it into the case, thus getting rid of the problem of a thin piece of plastic acting as bridge between the camera carve out and the apple carve out used for mounting the case. This I think will render the case sturdier IMHO and getting rid of the biggest issue with this case. The case is also ever slightly lighter and minimally smaller. It has the carve out for the stereo speaker rather than the headphone hole. In terms of hand feel the case feels better than previous cases with single hand grip. However my case has some sharp edges in areas where the bumper meets the plastic. It will be a nicer feel if they had smooth these edges. Overall Rokform took the customer concerns and improved on it.  As for the reception with and without the magnet, it is negligible as far as I am concerned. If you have never had one of these cases I strongly recommend it to you. I use it my phone as a GPS and it fits beautifully on the dash with a very inobtrusive magnet base. Once mounted it withstands sharp turns and bumps and hardly even moves.
