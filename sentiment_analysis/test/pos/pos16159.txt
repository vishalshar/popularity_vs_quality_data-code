I have a Nexus 5, which has a built in magnet to align the wireless charging coils to a charger. I was happy to discover this mount is strong enough to hold the phone without the adhesive plate, even over sharp bumps.I can't go back to anything less, it feels great every time I let my phone go and it magically floats in it's proper place ?
