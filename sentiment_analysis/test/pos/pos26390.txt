We just received the Prime Climb math game the other day and really enjoy it. One of the kids, who is less interested in math than our other, was doing multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division without tension or help. The game is enjoyable. My kid that isn't terribly excited about math or games for that matter was super excited to play the following day. This excitement has only happened with a couple of other board games (Cover your assets and Sleeping Queens).If your family likes math games like ours, I definitely recommend the game.We used to live in Seattle and have done math salons, a camp and had private tutoring with some of Math for Love (game creators) folks. They are well loved in the in Seattle and by me for showing me how exciting and fun math can be for kids. I'm happy to see this great team find success with Prime Climb - it's really fantastic.Note: In the picture I added, there's a piece that doesn't belong to the game. My son likes make up his own pawns (lego men, electronics parts). Just didn't want anyone to wonder why there game didn't include a Fremont Distillery Poker Chip. :)
