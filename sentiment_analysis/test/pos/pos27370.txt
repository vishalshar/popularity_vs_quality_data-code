Great product, great ideaÂ— and it works as advertised. I've kept it on my keys for a little over two weeks, and already I've had to use it twice! The only thing I would say is that i wish it came with a clip (kind of like some of those keychains) so that it could be taken off and put back on easier. But, everything works great. I definitely recommend anyone who's ever forgotten their charger and been stuck with a dead phone or buying a new full-priced charger somewhere, to buy this.
