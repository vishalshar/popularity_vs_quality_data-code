OMG. It's working well for me; my elbows were all red and bumpy for about a week now. I tried tea tree oil and other products but didn't want to go the steroid route so I gave this a try and within 2-3 uses the redness has subsided quite a bit and elbows feel so much better already. It also helps knowing that by using this cream that has all natural ingredients I am not compounding to my already compromised health.
