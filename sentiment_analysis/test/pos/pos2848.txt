Take my word for it. This is a great product.I like the fact that this has the release buttons that you have to press in from both sides to get the phone out and a button on the back which locks the phone into place when putting in on the holder. This makes it a great one hand operation compared to the others where you have to hold one side of the arm and pull the other arm open to put you phone in. That eventually will make the mount slide out of the CD player.Recommended 110%.
