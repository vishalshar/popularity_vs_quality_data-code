Fava beans are one of my favorite snacks, but I have to be honest, these arent my fave. I'm used to them being salty and savory, but these had a strange sweetness to them, and hardly any ranch flavor. They're a bit too overwhelmingly sweet for my tastes. I dont know if I just got an off batch, or what. They do still taste good, I just prefer my fava beans to be more salty than sweet.
