Can be a little tricky to bend the way you want and to attach a phone/tablet.  You'll have to figure out where you want to charge your device and then bend the cord to fit that ONE spot as flexing and flopping it all over the place each time you attach a device like an OEM cord is out of the question.  Seems pricey but when you add up all the OEM cords my two cats have taken a liking to (I swear there is a conspiracy with Apple and they coat their cords with tasty treats as my cats have chewed a ton of -just- Apple cords) it is cheaper than replacing many destroyed cords.  Cats have mouthed these a few times then given up in disgust.
