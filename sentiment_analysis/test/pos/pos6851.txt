I recently went on a pack lightening spree and this was one of the things that I picked up as a replacement for a much heavier stove. Initial response- This thing weighs almost nothing, total weight of the entire store in less than 1/4 pound. Assembly to not terribly difficult ( comes with directions but really didn't need them) and I was able to fully assemble the unit in less than 5 minutes. One note of caution ( it's in the the directions I didn't read at first) the edges are very sharp and could (and did) result in cut fingers. If I had to find something to complain about with this stove that would be it. The directions say to take a piece of sandpaper and knock off the sharp edges-Why wouldn't this be done in the factory before shipping??Functionally this stove works very well. With a little tinder and a handful of twigs I was able to boil 500ml of water in about 9 minutes. Not bad for something where you don't have to pack in the fuel!Overall this seems to be a very solid little stove for someone who is trying to keep their pack weight down to minimum and is willing to pay the price for titanium to do so. I plan on using this for several extended trips this summer and will report back if this changes my initial rating.
