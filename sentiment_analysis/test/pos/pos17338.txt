Well loving this so far. I am elderly with some weakness in my hands but it was very doable to put on bike by myself without assistance. Directions could be clearer but just looking at it it was straight forward to assemble....less than 2-3 minutes easy. Holds phone in nice position & seems sturdy although could not say if bike went over but then would anything? Wish I had bought sooner & most likely will buy another for my spouse!
