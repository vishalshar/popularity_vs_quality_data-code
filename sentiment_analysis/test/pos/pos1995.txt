This is the first portable charger that I have bought and it may be the last. I love it because on one full charge, the Flux portable charger was able to fully charge my 5th generation iPod touch twice. The Flux charger is also quite thin and doesn't add much bulk when I'm carrying it around with my iPod. It's about the size of my iPod, but just a little shorter, so it is still comfortable to use my iPod while holding it and the portable charger, too. Secondly, I really like how the lightning charging cable is built-in to the charger. I don't have to worry about bringing my own charging cable along with the portable charger and it cuts down on the bulk when I'm carrying it. The portable charger also has four blue LED lights that show how much juice is left in the charger, so I know when I need to recharge it. The only thing that I didn't like so much was that the included cord to charge the Flux portable charger is quite short so when I charge it from a wall outlet I have to use one near a counter that the portable charger can sit on so it isn't hanging from the outlet.
