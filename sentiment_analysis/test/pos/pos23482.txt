The taste is wonderful but I think if they made their assembly line a little bumpy or had an area at the end where it shakes the popcorn, they would triple their sales. There are not only kernels on the popcorn as expected, there are also many, many kernels in the bag. You have to eat the popcorn very carefully so you don't have a mouthful of kernels.
