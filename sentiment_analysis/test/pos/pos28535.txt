It's a nice solution for home monitoring. I mainly bought it not only because of security reasons, I also was extremely interested in what my dog does all the day.I'm not sure I'll have a use of motion detection because of that. But you can really watch the video live or pay and have it recorded.There's two-way-talk functionality, so you can communicate with someone at home.I'm giving this camera 5 stars for now, as I don't see any disadvantages for me.
