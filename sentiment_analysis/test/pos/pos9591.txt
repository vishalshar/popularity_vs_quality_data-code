Fence - This takes time and planning. We choose to do the loop method. We have a rectangle backyard with a six foot wood privacy fence. The cats could fly over it with one jump. So we ran the loop starting at the transmitter all away around the backyard six inches off the ground. (Stapled the wire to the fence and buried it four inches down where there wasn't a fence. Then we looped the wire back around at five feet high careful to keep the wire from coming closer than three feet to eacher as that will neutralize it. You will have to scratch/dig out two trenches if you go in the ground with the loop method, each at 3-4 feet apart. (That way they can't jump high and over the boundary wire.)  This method worked. HINT: Put the wire in a short section of PVC where it comes out of the ground so you don't cut it off with the weed wacker or lawn mower. (We have had to fix every in the ground point, which are all now in PVC sleeves.) We drilled a small hole in the house and ran the wires in to connect to the transmitter indoors. Grounded outside. We did all of this two years ago and it has held up perfectly. Invest in a box of water proof wire nuts if you are like us. Cat's won't fly over the fence now due to the wire being up so high. Cat's can't get on picnic table or tree and launch themselves over the ground boundaries. It really works.. Easier than child proofing a home!!
