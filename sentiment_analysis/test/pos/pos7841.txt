We bought the kit for our son for Christmas as he previously had a mega blocks motorized building set that he loved to use to create creatures and vehicles. Although expensive, the kit has high quality parts and a detailed instructions book. At our sons age (9), it has taken him a while to understand all the things he can do with the kit but I believe it is going to be a great next level play for him, especially in combination with legos and other small toys. I would recommend it to any child that is interested in engineering type play.
