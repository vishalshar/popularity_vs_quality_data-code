Used for second home at first to control entry for cleaning folks and local family.  Just did the front door.  Very easy to install by non-handy man - easier than changing a full lock.  Its sturdy and larger than I thought but not ridiculous regarding size (but close).  Its more robust than I thought it would be with heavy duty metal and mechanical workings that make you feel comfortable.  It has been great for sending people invites (and then stopping if needed) with full notice of when it is ever locked/unlocked and by who and when.  Bought several more for additional doors just for convenience and cool factor.  I paired with a Ring video doorbell versus August's doorbell version because I just liked the Ring better.  I can open the door remotely if a delivery comes or didn't know cleaning/maintence people were coming.  I have had a few occasions where it would not pick up the lock and would loop.  Usually  would self-correct or when I was near the lock it would re-register.
