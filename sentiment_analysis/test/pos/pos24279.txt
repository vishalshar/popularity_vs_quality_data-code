This is one of those things you'll buy and probably not want to tell your friends how much you spent on it.  Not one of my friends spent more than $125 on their chairs, and you can tell.  The Ferrino brand is just going to have to be my little secret.  It's built like a rock, even has a metal base..who does that these days?  Love the chair.  It'll last me for years to come.
