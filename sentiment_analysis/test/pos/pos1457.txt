I love my amazfit tracker!Background:I've been a long time user/owner of Fitbit trackers. I went from the first edition of the Fitbit Force to the Fitbit charge. 5 Fitbit tracker after, I was in the market for a new kind of tracker.Style: I love how lightweight and compact it is compared to the Fitbit Charge. A couple of my friends had pointed out how stylish it is without the knowledge of it being a tracker. When I explained that the bracelet is a tracker, they loved the idea of it.Weight: It's lighter than the Fitbit charge. I've started to stop noticing that it is on my wrist.App:The app is very easy to use. I've had trouble syncing it at first but realized I had to press the tracker to the syncing screen. The app tracks sleep, steps,  miles and calories. Everything is very straight forward.Tracker: One thing I love about this is the phone call vibration. I always keep my phone on silent but the tracker has been amazing at notifying me when someone calls. I haven't tested out how far away I could be from the phone but it seems to be working really well every time.I haven't missed a call since!Request to update: Since I've been spoiled with the Fitbit interface and technology, one thing I miss is the silent alarm feature. I wish for that to be on this tracker.Overall, I've replaced my Fitbit charge with this tracker and am very happy with my purchase. I'm excited to get the other bands and necklace band. I've attached my progress with both trackers.
