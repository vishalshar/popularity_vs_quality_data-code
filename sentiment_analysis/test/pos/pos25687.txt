I've had this on my furbaby for a few months now. I'm so glad I bought it. They should tell you there's a monthly service for it to work up front!But it's like having the same tracking abilities as your phone attached to your dog at all times.It gives you some peace of mind in the likely hood your baby should make a quick escape anywhere with anyone, like camping, hiking, or just walking.It's also like having a FITBIT or your dog. Let's you know if they've been a couch potato today while you've been at work.
