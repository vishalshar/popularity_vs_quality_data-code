I received my TrackR earlier this week and wanted to test it out.  I had my 3 year old hide it around the house and found it every time.  Set up was very easy.  I did have to search around a little online to fully understand the functionality.  I have it on my keys right now and I can see myself adding one in my backpack and wallet.  This has a range of about 100 feet and there is a gauge that shows you when you are getting closer.  If you are constantly leaving things around the house or calling your phone to find it, I definitely recommend this item.
