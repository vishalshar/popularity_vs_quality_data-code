HOLY CRAP IS THIS MOUNT STICKY! I first put it on my windshield, because I never trust "sticky" dashboard mounts on my work truck. The dash isn't very clean and it's also textured. They NEVER work! Well, I decided to give this one a try. When I went to take it off the windshield, I COULDN'T LOOSEN IT! I had to stick a flathead screwdriver under it and actually damaged a small piece of the sticky gel. I thought, "this is it... it's definitely not gonna work now..."I couldn't be more wrong. Even with one small piece damaged by my Midas touch, this thing is STUCK on my dash! I have no idea what it'll look like when I remove it, but it's just a work truck. It'll survive.Oh, and stickiness aside, the function is ON POINT! I mean, it's FUN to mount and dismount my phone in this thing. It feels like I own a tiny Transformer on the dashboard of my truck. Oh, and it also works FLAWLESSLY with several mounts and dismounts per day.You won't be disappointed with this purchase.
