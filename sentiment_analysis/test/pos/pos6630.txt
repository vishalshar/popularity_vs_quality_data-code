I didn't realize this when I ordered this item, but this is a lighter avocado oil. It is not like the Extra Virgin which is dark colored and flavorful. That being said, this is a nice neutral oil for sauteeing, frying, and for making salad dressings. This is also a great ingredient for making soap, body butter, and shaving lotion.I wish the Extra Virgin was on S&S, like this one is. Overall, this seems like a good company. Their avocado oil is much better than another brand I was buying before.
