I must have oddly shaped ears because I have problems with the various ear phones staying in place, and earbuds hurt my ear canal. Because the "hoox" are soft and flexible. It easily adjusts to hook into the ear without any pain. They were fairly easy to slip on, but discovered you can put the wrong hoox on the wrong ear piece. The sound isn't blocked by the product. Each order/package came with two sets; one with larger hooks than the other. So, one of the two will work. They don't claim to block out noise, so I did expect to hear outside noises. Great for working out because they stay put. If you accidentally pull the earphone cables, thus pulling out the earphone, the soft material doesn't hurt the ears. All in all, great idea, design, and service (the products arrive really quick). There were several times where one or both hoox came off in my laptop bag and backpack. Probably from rubbing against the bag. Never had them come off while in my ear or around my neck. I don't store them in my pocket, but assume it could slide off if it did so in my bag.
