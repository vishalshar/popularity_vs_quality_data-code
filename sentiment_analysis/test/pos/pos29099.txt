After ordering Formaticum cheese paper a few times, I decided to try the bags.  So far I've used only one of them, but it sure is a lot easier to pop a chunk of cheese into the bag fold it over and seal if you like.  I actually had some stickers left over from the cheese paper roll so I use those.  This is a lot more convenient because all that's needed is to open the bag and remove the cheese and put it back into the bag.  If using a hard cheese like Parmagiano Reggiano I would think that it's possible to re-use the same bag.  This is a great product for keeping cheese longer in the refrigerator.  I highly recommend it!
