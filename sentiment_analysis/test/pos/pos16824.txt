This stuff is amazing!! Only problem I have is trying to figure out where and how to use it. When using it open the package mold it like playdoh for a few min then mold into place and let dry for 24 hours and its set and done. Need to remove it at any time, no problem simply cut off as much as you can then peel and push the best off. I've used it for repairing a screen door handle, regrout a floor, add a handle to a screen door at a lower level for kids. I've also added a magnet to my drills and tools to hold other bits. I've used it to hold shower caddy in place. I fixed a foot base plate that broke off.
