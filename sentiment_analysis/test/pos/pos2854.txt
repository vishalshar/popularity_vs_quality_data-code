This was a fun toy while it lasted.  What I learned is that I needed more sunlight than the amount I was getting.  The tracker was easy to wear, with an awesomely strong magnetic clasp, and it weighed next to nothing.  Unfortunately, my little SunSprite did not survive the laundry cycle.  Imagine my dismay.  :(Update:  Changed my rating to 5 stars, since GoodLux Technology replaced my SunSprite pronto, unsolicited by me.  How nice was that?  Thank you, Snoopy54.  :))))
