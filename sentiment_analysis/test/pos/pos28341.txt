The stylus came yesterday and I love it already. I love its responsiveness on a touch screen and how easy it is to handle. It's nice being able to use it while holding it almost completely parallel to the screen instead of having to constantly suspend it above the screen like with other typical styluses. My one and only complaint is that, while it works amazingly with the 53 Paper app, the 'pressure-sense' that's supposed to let you change the thickness of drawing lines doesn't react as well as was advertised. I'm still working on getting the right response. Other than that, it works great. It's a wonderful stylus whether you're using it with the Paper app or just as a regular stylus. It's big enough in my hand that it's comfortable to hold for long periods of time, but still sensitive enough that even with the broad tip it doesn't press multiple buttons at once. I also like that it comes with an extra tip and eraser for when you wear down the first set. I'd thought about buying the multi-pack replacement but was worried about losing them among all my other stuff in the time it takes to wear down the first set. The magnetic clip on this one is also a bonus. I can just stick it to the back of my iPad mini case and it stays put.
