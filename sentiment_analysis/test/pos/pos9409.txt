After finding out that French laundry uses a sous vide for all their steaks, we had to purchase this low cost rendition of what used to be a thousand dollar commercial kitchen only machine.  It seriously makes the best steak ever, and turns cheaper meat (eg hanger steak) into the tenderness of filet mignon.  A few notes- 1. the fan can be loud if you use this with stainless steel pots (it reverberates against the metal) - we recommend using a large plastic food safe container instead.  2.  It is especially adept at handling salmon and rack of lamb- you can cook things to an exact internal temp. 3.  A friend told us that this makes perfect poached eggs, but we have tried this a few times at a few different temps and still haven't managed to get it right :-(. In short, it's a great kitchen tool and present for the chef that has it all.
