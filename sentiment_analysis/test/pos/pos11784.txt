I've went through a few of the cheaper band/case for the 42mm Apple Watch and was disappointed with most. I did like the cheap Supcase, it was close to what I wanted. It just didn't last long. But for the price who cares.I purchased this one and really love it. The band is comfortable and the case is high quality. I usually wore Invicta watches before the Apple Watch and wanted a beefy band/case. This one fits the bill! The band it self is very comfortable, best I have had so far. ZERO issues with the buttons, knob and sensor. Works like a champ. Thinking about trying out the water resistant one next.
