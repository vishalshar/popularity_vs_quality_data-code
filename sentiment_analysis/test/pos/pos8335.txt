This is one of those needle in the haystack finds. This battery case has so much to offer with little sacrifices, compared to other battery cases out there. What I enjoy the most is that it feels like a normal case.Pros:- Slimmest while giving a full charge of battery- Supports lightning cables with charge through- Syncs when case is on- No signal degrading like other battery cases- Smooth finish with decent grip (Black model)- Easiest battery case to take in and out of- No camera or speaker problem like other casesCons:- Headphone jack works only on Apple headphones or very slim cables. Wasn't able to plug in a auxillary cable from Beats by Dr. Dre- Turning on and off case is a little counter intuitive and more difficult then other cases  - Same with checking battery level of the case- Top part of case seems to always come off when you pull the phone from the top either from a pocket or bag, doesn't seem like a tight or secure fitAnother thing is the little tab you need to pull out for the charging port is really stiff at first but after opening for awhile it becomes loose and easy to open.The cons are definitely more on the minor side for this case.
