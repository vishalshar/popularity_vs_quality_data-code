We purchased this for a second dog with the Elite Little Dog In-Ground fence system.It's been the right size for our pups as they've grown from 8 lbs to 12 lbs.  So far we're still on the original battery, but we take time to turn the collar off when it's not on the dog.  Our pups are eager for us to put on their collar because they know it means they get to run free on our two acre property.I plan to modify the battery holder as others have done so that it can use non-OEM batteries.  My brother-in-law made this mod on the same collars for their two Pomeranians and it works great.
