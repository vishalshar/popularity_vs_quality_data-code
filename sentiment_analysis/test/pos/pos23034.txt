I have three different Sun King solar lights and love them all, but the Pico is my favorite because it has a built in charging panel. Makes a unique gift. Great flashlight, perfect reading light, lasts for hours, kids love them and they will charge sitting on a windowsill. NO BATTERIES. One of my favorite things ever.
