I am having twins at the end of the month and needed something EASY!!  The crib sheet zip on/zip off is so easy to use! I bought a crib pad rather than a "fitted" crib pad for extra crib protection and it they work great together.  I simply zip off the the top, pull the pad, wash and then reattach.  I have practiced a couple of times because I wanted to make sure it was worth the extra money and lack of colors.  It is!!  I know this will make my life much easier when the babies arrive.I am using:Crib: Fisher Price Charlotte TraditionalMattress: Serta Nightstar Eco Balance Ultra Organic Blend Woven Cover Crib & Toddler MattressMattress Pad: Naturepedic Waterproof Flat Crib Pad, 28 x 52*Wash and shrink before usingSheets: QuickZip Cotton Crib Sheet, 1 Zip-On Sheet + 1 (I bought extra zip tops)Everything seems to fit snug and smooth!**FYI - It is a little tricky putting the QuickZip Crib Sheet base on the mattress but once it is on, it is a dream!
