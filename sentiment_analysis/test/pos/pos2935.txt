It's more expensive than a normal security cam but it has the treat shooting and voice option so I can't complain. My puppy scare of it and don't really care to come but I think it understandable. I would freak out myself if I hear mommy's voice and couldn't see her any where.I hope she will get use to it and come when I call her. For now I use it as security cam to check on my puppy and my place sometime when I am away.I wish in the future they will have the option to let me listen to my pet.
