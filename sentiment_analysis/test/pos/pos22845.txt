I love this phone.  Had a trac phone but everything was too small to read easily.  Complicated instructions for use.  But the Jitterbug is just the opposite!  Big keys with big letters and words and numbers, so easy to learn to use immediately.  Has a dial tone which I found adorable.  Haven't learned how to text or use the camera yet, but haven't taken the time.  Meanwhile it is so easy to use to make calls.  I love it!  If you are as technology impaired as I am, plus my aging eyes aren't that great, by all means this is a great phone.
