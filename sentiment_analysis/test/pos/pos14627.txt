I put this on my key ring because I keep losing my keys.  It was easy to set up on my phone with the app.  The app will locate the general area on a map. As you get closer to the object a set of bars gets greener.  You can also elicit a beep and light, but the beep is not very loud and the light can only be seen in the dark. I would give it 5 stars if the beep and light were stronger.
