Wasn't sure about the quality of a sub $900 laptop with a gtx960m and 512gb SSD. This laptop is the s***.This laptop performs amazing. The keyboard has a nice click to it although sometimes you don't press hard enough it doesn't register. The screen has good quality but it has poor viewing angles. Unless you're doing some crazy side viewing it shouldn't really matter though.
