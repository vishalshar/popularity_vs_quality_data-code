I'm in a wheelchair, and I have been looking for that "Perfect" bag.  My closet floor is riddled with bag's that just weren't designed for use with a wheelchair. One day last week I stumbled across a Youtube Review of the Man-PACK CLASSIC 2.0 Sling bag and after watching the video, I knew I had found a bag that was different than the other bags, so I ordered one.  Because I'm a Prime member, I was able to get delivery of the bag day.As I began putting my usual items in the bag I began to notice something unusual - I still had room in the bag for more items.  I decide to put it on and see how well it worked when sitting in my wheelchair. It became obvious that the design of this bag was well thought out.  The Man-PACK may be one of the best-designed bags for a person in a wheelchair on the market today!Confined to a wheelchair or not you will be delighted with this well thought out Man-PACK. In the City, out on the town or in the woods you will find this bag to be perfect for all occasions?.
