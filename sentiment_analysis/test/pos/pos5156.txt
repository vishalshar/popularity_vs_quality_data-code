I can't have corn products so this is a nice alternative to Cheetos. This is my favorite of the flavors (I've tried Sea Salt Truffle, Aged Chedder, Sweet Chili, and Herbs de Provence). They taste about how you would imagine a healthy Cheeto to taste, but are not as salty as you might think from the name. The truffle flavor is noticeable and good.
