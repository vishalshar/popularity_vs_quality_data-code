This is what I like: Made in USA. Can push a button to call the police. Can "snap" more pics. Can set up a number or numbers to be alerted if I don't respond and can select the amount of time between a "trip" and the alerts to other numbers (my godson and police and private security etc). Sensor and base station are both on batteries. My router is on battery backup. Power is not an issue. Can actually talk to person in USA and give suggestions. (I would like to be able to set the number of pics per trip and set multiple sequences to get pics that can yield a face. As this is software driven, they said this is no problem)I like them because I have an older smart phone. Had a problem with occasional false trip upon arming and sensitivity issue (had it set too sensitive). I decreased the sensitivity and they did an upgrade to the app. Two days later I downloaded it. Works like a charm.If you can put 2 screws in a ceiling and use a smart phone you are there!
