My favorite of all hot sauces - and I do love hot sauces!  Medium heat, with curry overtones - some sweetness, some tang.  Some perfect!  I'm on my third bottle with two more on order.  I've been using it on everything from eggs to chicken to casseroles.  Mix with mayo for a dip, wonderful on hot wings, great mixed with barbecue sauce.  Yes, it's expensive - and I don't say this lightly - it's worth it.  LOVE.  Wish there was a case discount!
