The AnyMote is a well designed universal remote. The app is easy to use and it's pretty easy to set up. It does everything it advertises and it is extremely lightweight and effective.The downfall for me was it's integration with Amazon Echo and the use of my cell phone as the remote.Alexa commands are complicated and when you do get them right they are not always executed. An issue that will likely be resolved in the future.Personally, my phones battery tends to be dead a lot so my phone as the primary remote doesn't work for me. Which could be solved by me shelling out for another device.Both problems I had with the product were resolved by the Logitech harmony hub and companion. I have a simple universal remote and easy Alexa integration. So if your goal is to consolidate to one remote and integrate with your smart home functions I would recommend a the Logitech harmony hub and remote.
