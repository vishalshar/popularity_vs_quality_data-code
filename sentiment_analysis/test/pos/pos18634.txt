My mushroom kit is working very well.  When I received it at the end of January, the block was covered with white mycelium.  I followed the instructions.  At day 5, I saw my first little mushroom.  Now at day 8, there is another big clump starting.  One thing I am doing differently from the instructions is I cover the box loosely with a plastic bag as my home is very dry at this time of year.  I also mist the cardboard box as well as the "window" to keep the humidity up.  I plan to try to keep the culture going in my coffee grounds.
