I think this is overall a good concept. It definitely has some flaw like the temperature and humidity being off. Also, it seems the sensors are on the back cover which is odd and makes it difficult to make the numbers accurate. I was very interested in seeing the map station as the advertisements states but it says it is still under development. Overall it is ok.
