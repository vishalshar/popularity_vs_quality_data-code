My kid lives playing with an old smart phone I have him so this seemed like a good match. It requires and recent android firmware to be installed on the device your using.  His phone was not up to date so the apk wouldn't install.  It took me hours to figure out how to update his old phone.  After that it worked great. They should really figure out a way for older versions of android to work with the apk.
