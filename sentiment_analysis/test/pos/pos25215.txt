I'm rating four stars for now,  I will update if I notice any improvements or hopefully get pregnant.  I've only been drinking this for two weeks now.  All the people who say it's gritty havent given the product time to dissolve into the water.  Let it sit for a minute after you shake it or stir it and then shake again or stir if it's in a cup and you can't even tell you put anything in your water.  I'm hoping for the best and the best for everyone out there trying who have had no luck so far like me.
