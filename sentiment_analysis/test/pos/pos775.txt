Tested with a brown ale. It worked better than imagined. From my first to last cup it was good to the last drop. My wife and I home brew and are not ready for kegs, but will NOT bottle. It looked like we were doomed to drink flat beer and Gruit flavored wine like nature intended. Yuckish! But then our uKeg 64 came into our lives. It change everything. As I said my wife and I home brew, mostly 20% ABV Gruit that will not prime and taste great flat and lifeless. The uKeg took that flat mouth watering Gruit in my carboy and breathed bubbly life into it. I can not tell you my favorite p.s.i. since I have yet to find a setting that is less than super yummy. I will be getting the large one next. Great great great.
