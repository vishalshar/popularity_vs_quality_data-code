My kids cannot stop playing this game! It was a bit confusing for them and the pizza making since you have to base it on the characters facial expressions, but as they played more they got the hang of it. It helps with math also so they're learning and don't even realize it! There is a Junior mode that helps them with simple math so when they become more confident they can play the regular version. Great game!
