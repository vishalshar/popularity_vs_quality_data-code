I can't give this set a 4 or 5 star because two weeks after using the gradient ND filter, the "plastic" gradient lens came off from the  filter frame. I expect more from a product for 'action' cameras. Not recommended. 12/20 UPDATE-I called Polar Pro and told them of my impressions on this filter pack. They were very responsive and sent me a replacement filter. I will be testing it out and will report back
