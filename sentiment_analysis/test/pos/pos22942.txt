Got my package 3 days early so that's a huge awesome and there is absolutely no flavor. I put it in my water and it completely dissolves. Love it. I've only been taking it for 2 days so hopefully with all these great reviews from women who have pcos (I also have it) I get to have a positive pregnancy test in the near future!
