I like the whole set up and it certainly holds the phone in place.  It blocks the speaker so if your using a MOOV app and pod, Forget about hearing anything unless you wear buds.  I have it on my mountain bike so wearing buds is out of the question when I'm on trails with others.  If you are use to fingerprint mode to unlock your phone while riding, that won't work either, since it won't read through the protective cover. I've had several other types of holders on my bike and either they move all over or you'll need to be careful that your phone doesn't come off.  Today I went and rode some serious trails where the other holders failed.  This unit keeps the phone firmly in place and has a quick release.  Those are the two most important features to me. At the end of the ride, it was in the same place as when I entered the trails.  I normally keep my iphone 6Plus in an otterbox.  I would like a Quad Lock that can be used with the exterior portion of an otterbox in which you can hear and use the features of the phone as you ride.  Also I purchased this unit used from Amazon.  This was my first time and you won't be dissapointed,  it was a savings of 24 plus dollars over new.
