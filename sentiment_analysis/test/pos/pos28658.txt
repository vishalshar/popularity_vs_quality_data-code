I've been using his phone for over a month now and I absolutely love it. Yes, the display is small but it's super colorful. The Google Play Store, lets you download plenty of apps that are compatible with this device.However it is a 4G phone, and my SIM is capable of LTE meaning I am not used to the slowness of the data. If you're connected to Wifi there shouldn't be a problem, and if you're used to 4G data then then you should be okay.It has a 2 mega pixel main camera and a VGA front camera, and if you came here for a good camera... Well probably not the best place to look. The main camera typically gets the job done however.With 4GB of internal memory, adding an SD card is a good idea especially if you love music and lots of apps. I haven't used very much of the data so I don't have many complaints.The charger is mini USB but the metal part of the charger that connects to the phone is a tad longer than your average USB so don't break it or lose it.Overall it's a very good media player and I don't regret purchasing it. I hope this review helps!
