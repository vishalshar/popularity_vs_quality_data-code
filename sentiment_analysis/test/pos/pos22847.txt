I am, really, shocked that these papers work!  I bought them hoping to extend for a few days more the life of the cheeses we buy.  I also purchased some other brands, in order to compare their effectiveness.Last month, we had occasion to really give these a workout.  We had to leave home suddenly because of a family emergency, and we were unable to return home for 4 weeks.Guess what?!?  The cheese in the Formaticum Cheese Paper was STILL GOOD!!  No slick, wet moisture on the outside!  No mold!  The cheese tasted perfect!  I don't know if it works on all cheeses, but the Manchego we wrapped was in absolutely perfect shape.I did not expect to put it to the test for such a long time -- I was hoping for a week or two.Well, I'm sold now.P.S. The other brand, Gourmet Trends Forever Cheese Bags, worked pretty well, too, with a different and slightly softer cheese, but not as well as the Formaticum papers.  I didn't know I would be conducting a 4-week experiment, or I would have used the same type of cheese.
