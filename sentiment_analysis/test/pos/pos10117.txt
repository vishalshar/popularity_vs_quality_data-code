I got it originally to play with it with my cat and he either chasing it or run away from it lolThe apps are amazingly easy and the variety is awesome not to mention the controls are just brilliant along with the dances and stuffIt is now one of my favourite gadgets that i ever ownedJust an update i forgot to includeThe only flaw that u will get with sphero is carpets and specially the think ones are really annoying with sphero but i got the rubber cover for sphero and it performs better but slower than the normal speed unfortunately
