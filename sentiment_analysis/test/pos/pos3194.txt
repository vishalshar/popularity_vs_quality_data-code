Finally went back to an iPhone after being on HTC for a few years.  Liked my Commuter case on the HTC One very much, but couldn't get one for my 6 as quickly as I needed it (2-3 weeks!), so I read a few reviews and very happy I did.  This case is awesome for the iPhone 6 (4.7).  It adds minimal bulk, and the fit is pretty spot on.  But the material is the best part.  It is a near perfect combination of grippy, tough and slick.  I don't know how they managed this, but the phone is grippy in the hand, yet still slides easily in and out of the jeans pocket.  Not "rubbery" at all.  I added the HD Ballistic Glass and am extremely happy with this set up.  Oh yeah, fits perfectly in my HTC One Smart Tap car mount, so no need for any other new gear.
