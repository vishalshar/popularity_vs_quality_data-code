Great Speaker. Went white water rafting, strapped the speaker to my life jacket. I fell in the water, got dragged back into the raft 7 minutes later. Hit a button on the Fugoo, and it was back to tunes! Impressive loud sound from a small speaker. We were the official "Party Boat" Everyone was impressed with the Fugoo. This is the speaker you want. Buy it!
