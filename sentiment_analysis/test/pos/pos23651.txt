I would like to start off this quicky review with the fact that I consider myself an audiophile. I am not the kind of person who likes a flat sound though. I like a balanced sound. I like a lot of highs and mids, with a clean bass his on the drums. I own a pair of Sennheiser HD598's and they are almost perfect.These headphones are great overall. Not my favorites though.They have a fairly flat, mid heavy sound.I listen to a lot of different types of music.They have a pretty clean bass drum hit, without being Beats By Dre messy.In my opinion they are severely lacking in highs and mid/highs. I have tried messing with EQ's, with no luck though.Quality of the headphones themselves are top notch though. They are made of a strong metal. The remote works well. The ear tips need some improvement. It comes with a ton of them, and you will lose half of them the first night you bust these open. None of them are comfortable for my tiny ears. None of them make a good seal for me either.If you like a more of a flat sound. Get them.
