Really easy to take on trips.  It is as compact as they say.  It is too hard for my 4.5 year old to buckle herself in though. So that's the only reason that it is getting 4 stars.  We were in a car accident the 3rd time we used this and she was able to walk away with just a tiny rub burn on her shoulder from the seatbelt. So I would say this did its job.
