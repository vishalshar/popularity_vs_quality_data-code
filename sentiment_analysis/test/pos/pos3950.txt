First off, they feel wonderful.  I wear an 8.5D shoe and had hoped that the medium would fit better than the "one-size-fits-all" socks I've been buying.  Close, but still a little big in the foot.  I'll check back after I've washed them a few times.Better after a couple or washings. Happy enough that I ordered 3 more pair.
