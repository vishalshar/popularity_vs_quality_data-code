pretty red color, the mickey ears are sometimes hard to see, bread must be just right. bagels fit great, but will not see the mickey ears on them ever. the inside is deep, so all the bread is toasted. we purchased this for a long disney world trip and liked it so much that  we are now using for everyday in our kitchen.
