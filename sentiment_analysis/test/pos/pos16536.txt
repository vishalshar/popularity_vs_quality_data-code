It's an acquired taste. First few times were pretty tough.. They taste pretty horrid. But it's a trade off for the effectiveness (because believe me, they work!) As another reviewer noted, it does remind me of adderall in a way. I eat usually 1-2 cubes before work everyday and get the kick and focus I need without the jitters or crash. You're never gonna find them delicious but After awhile you get used to the taste and eat them no problem. Bf does overnight shifts and runs on this. Just bought my third box!update: i took away a star for inconsistent pricing. they were already expensive as is at 59.99 a box. when i noticed the price dropped to 39 i got super excited and spread the word, promoting them even more. i now see a rise in price again..
