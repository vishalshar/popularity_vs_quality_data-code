It is bright, lightweight, my little yorkie mix loves it because it moves with him.  As for not having a handle... not a problem... one end has a knot and the rope is already sealed.  A couple of zip ties and vavoom!!  custom sizing !!!  I don't know if it is truly going to last a lifetime, but if it doesn't, I will certainly buy this  cord before any other kind..bravo!!  nice when someone gets it RIGHT....
