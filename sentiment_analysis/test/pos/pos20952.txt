Such a great product.  I've known about Sous Vide from cooking shows like Top Chef, etc but never really had any idea how to go about it.I then heard Joe Rogan talk about it and tweet about it, so i decided to purchase.It may be the easiest thing to use.  Clips to the side of your pot, plug it in, set the temperature and you are done.No mess, no cleanup.  We cooked Strip Steaks and they were unbelievably perfect.  I'm a huge fan now.
