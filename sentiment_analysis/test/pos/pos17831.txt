It's a neat idea, but now everything is head to USB-C.  It's still great though to have a microUSB wire around when you need one.  I would say the only thing about it is that it is bulky.  I think that the bulky needs to be there, but that would be my only grip knocking it down a star.  And the only reason that the size is an issue is because I carry it around in my pockets.  The bulkiness kind of hinders hooking it around my belt loops all the time.  If you're going to just hook this on to a backpack or something then it's perfect.  If it was just slightly smaller it'd be great.
