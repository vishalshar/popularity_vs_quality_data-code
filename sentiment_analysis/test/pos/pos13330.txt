I have just had for 8 hours and so far - exceeds expectations and in some odd ways.  Got primarily to find out where the cold spots are in the house.  To my surprise, the dryer vent pipe that ran to the wall as measuring at 45 degrees in a heated room.  After some investigation we found that the dryer vent had gotten jammed open by some lint and was never closing all of the way.  Would have never known that is where the cold was coming in.  You can see by the attached photo how easy the vent issue was to identify.Second application was around doors.  You know in a hurry that you have a weather stripping problem when the top of the door is 47 degrees and the bottom is 65 degrees.  I was able to spot these things because of one of the features I did not know existed when I ordered.  There is a mode that will show you the highest temp and the coldest temp of any area you are scanning.The third use of the day was not planned.  We are watching a family members dog who decided to have an accident on the carpet.  We stopped him quickly but when we went to grab the cleanup supplies we were not able to see where exactly he had done it because of the small amount and the carpet color.  Turned on this thing and bam - there it was,,I would say the only issue would be long term use.  This is something I will use a lot know but definitely not an everyday tool.  Would be something cool to be able to rent or rent out...
