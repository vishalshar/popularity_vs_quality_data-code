I bought the Brush Hero to simplify cleaning the allow wheels on my cars and it has not disappointed. It saves time and does a much better job than I have the patience to by hand. However, the best thing about this thing is the many other tasks it makes easier.  My grill grate has never been this clean since it was new and it does wonders on the drivetrain on bikes and motorcycles.
