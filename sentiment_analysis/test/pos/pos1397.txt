My son loves Piper. It was a lot of fun to watch my 8 year old put it together. Great introduction to circuitry buttons and switches. The next day he figured out how to get to the linux command prompt at which point I realized this product is no joke. There's a world of exploration in this fun instructional based kit. Kids love boxes with stuff in them and this is a like a magical box for the next generation. Great job Piper Inc.
