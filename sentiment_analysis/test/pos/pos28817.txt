I bought this kit awhile back and it took more than 10 days for the mushrooms to grow, however they did grow after two weeks and cooked up nicely. I did a little digging online and I concluded that it was possibly the chlorinated and fluorinated water my city uses. Some cities like mine use Chloramines which wont naturally evaporate from the water and are deadly to microorganisms whether beneficial or not. When I buy this kit for friends, and I will, I will suggest to them to use filtered or spring water for soaking and misting.I'm not sure the manufacture would agree with my theory, as I said, its what I concluded.
