Took awhile but I finally figured it out. The USB connection is very difficult to find and almost as difficult to fit the cable in. But it's doable. Although it didn't plug in quite a fully as most USB connections, which was cause for some confusion as my watch was actually LOSING power when I thought I was charging it. Anyway, I kept trying and finally got it to work. Note that there are no instructions. Check on youtube for installation instructions if necessary. And, yes, you will need another cable for home use if you want to keep your phone well charged at all times. This thing is best to bring to work, on vacation, or whatever, but not for regular daily use.Hint: Some people say it's hard to fit the entire cable into the unit. But you can push the cable down into a gap on at least two or more revolutions to help save space. All that said, it's a nice backup charger and I'd recommend to friends and enemies alike.
