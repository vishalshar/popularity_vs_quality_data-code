Impressive scooter that grabs attention from onlookers. It gets me around my neighborhood pretty well, without much trouble on moderate inclines. It takes a bit for a 50-something man to operate; startup and braking are abrupt, but okay when you get used to it. Riding one-handed is almost unthinkable. I really enjoy tossing it in my trunk and taking it to the lake bicycle/walking trail. I wouldn't mind commuting a couple miles on it. I have not tested the range as it goes as far as I like between charges, which is typically about 5 miles. Its 10-15 mph top speed is plenty; you'd want beefier tires, better suspension & steering to go any faster.
