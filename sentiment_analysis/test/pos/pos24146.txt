If your pets are like your kids, you can't go wrong with Petzi.  We are able to say hello to the dogs and cats while at work and throw them a treat on top if it.  I had a little trouble at first getting things up and running but their customers service is very good and they had our unit up and running in no time. My wife and I are really having a lot of fun with this camera and are very happy with our purchase.
