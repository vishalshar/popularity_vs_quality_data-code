Wow.  What an improvement on an already amazing product! My wife and I are thrilled with our purchase of the Canary Flex.  As owners of the original Canary monitoring device which we use to watch the inside of our house, we were thrilled when they introduced the newest version of their home monitoring devices.  We already were pretty happy with our original device, but were very pleased with the addition of the new device to our household system.Pros:1. It is so versatile with it's flex mount.  We mounted it to the inside of the wood beam above our front porch to monitor who is coming to our door while we are home and away.  This was perfect during a busy holiday season when package thieves are common.  Originally we were concerned with mounting it upside down outside, but the magnet is SO strong, that sticking it to the wall mount was very easy and secure.2.  This device is so much smaller than the original and is so easy to take off, recharge and put back up.  It's inconspicuous and super clear.3. The second device merged so seamlessly with out other device and on the mobile app, you simply swipe right to go to your next device.  Super easy and simple 3 step integration.4. As with all Canary devices, no subscription/extra charges needed!  Just buy the device, set it up via the free mobile app and watch any area of your house at all times with constant motion alerts, alarm capability and instant emergency contact in case of a real emergency.All together we couldn't be happier with the next generation of Canary monitoring.  We trust the system to watch over our house while we are away and would recommend the Flex especially to anyone looking for feel comfortable about their home security without paying outrageous home security system costs.
