When I first got this game I tested it out with teachers. We were laughing out loud so much that other people popped their heads in the room to see what were were doing! I tested it with kids - same reaction. I created a "DonorsChoose" request to get Osmo for my students and it was funded.  The kids ASK to play the game again. Kids who are not in my class asked how much the game was - they wanted to tell their parents to purchase it for them.  GREAT game!  Well worth your money!  Better still, you can create your own games and play them yourself.
