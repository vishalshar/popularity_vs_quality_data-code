We were pleased with the quality of the iFetch, though we agree with many of the reviews that the balls are not very durable. Our two Havanese like to denude the balls and are very successful doing so. Unfortunately, the dog that likes to fetch hasn't caught on after a few days, and the other dog is a bit leery after being hit in the nose with one of the balls, though he does chase them once they are thrown (we are still working on the retrieve part).
