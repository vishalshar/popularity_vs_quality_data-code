The deciding factor for me to buy this over the cube was the comments about the customer service. Within the first few days my video became very pixelated. I contacted customer service and was responded to that same day. It was fixed pretty quickly. AND add to the fact that they are constantly making updates was also a huge plus for me.The cam comes with free dog teats FYI. I have a cat so I didn't need them. But any treat no larger than an inch works fine. After giving my cat a few treats from the camera, she now jumps over to the cam whenever I turn it on!  Great buy!
