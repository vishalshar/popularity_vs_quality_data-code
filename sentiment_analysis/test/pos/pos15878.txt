The rubber sleeves are meant to keep your skateboard wheels from rolling so that you can train yourself on ground tricks without that extra (sometimes quite dangerous) variable. Now, obviously we all want to be able to heel flip over a trash can while moving at 10mph, but you have to start somewhere. I don't know about you, but when I was young I used grass, gravel and sometimes cracks in the sidewalk to keep my board from moving while I attempted to learn the movements to complete tricks. Well, they all had various disadvantages that kept them from being the perfect training tool.Enter SkaterTrainer2.0. These are so simple, that my first thought was "why did I not think of this??" They are made from a heavy but flexible rubber that stretches over your skateboard wheels to essentially block them from moving.....and they work...really well!! This 36 year old guy got the bug a while back to start skating again, but I found that I had become a lot more tentative about trying tricks because I knew how badly I could get hurt. Mind you, my name is not Jaws and I am not trying to kill the Lyon 25 (search youtube to get that reference), but I want to be able to pop the usual ollies, shove its, and flips.As I am learning again I find that I am much less able to pop well because I am so focused on that little bit of roll that the wheels have when you are getting ready to jump. As soon as I put the SkaterTrainers on I was easily able to get the muscle memory back again. It was truly amazing, and in my first session I was actually able to land a pretty clean heel flip! That is a lot for me btw.So, in short, this old man is sold. These do what they say they will and I could see anyone of any age using them to gain confidence in doing ground tricks. I know that some skater ridicule them saying that it's not real skating. Well, not everyone does everything the same way, and these are a viable tool that can help you gain confidence. If you use these to get the movements down to do tricks, learning them rolling will be much easier. Definitely check out my vid, ask questions if you have them [...]
