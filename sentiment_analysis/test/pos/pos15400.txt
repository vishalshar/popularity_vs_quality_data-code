I use this prior to an obstacle course race on my receiver gloves (which work great for the rig, monkey bars, bucket carries, etc.) and before I do any training. As long as it is not a muddy venue, the grip boost lasts me through the race. If it is a muddy venue, I'll take off the gloves and fold them into each other and carry them in my shorts and take them out when I need them. The Grip Boost renews the gloves nearly instantly! It is especially handy when training. I'll do pull-ups without my gloves, and when my grip is exhausted, I'll put on my gloves with a dab of Grip Boost, and crank out a few more. This stuff will forever be in my arsenal. Highly recommended.
