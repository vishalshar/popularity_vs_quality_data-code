When purchasing my X-Star Premium drone I didn't know that it already came with 8 propellers. So under an impression of it including only 4 propellers I purchased a set of extra propellers right away. This set includes 2 propellers (one red and one silver), so if you are looking for a full set replacement purchase 2 sets. These propellers are exact same as the ones that come with the X-Star Premium drone.Propellers appear to be made out of a high grade plastic. While these propellers are relatively inexpensive, propeller guards (Autel Robotics Propeller Guards for use with X-Star and X-Star Premium Drones, White) may be recommended if you are flying indoors, or in a tight space to ensure a safe flight.I have flown my new drone for a while now without any propellers breaking. But it's nice to have extra parts so that in the event of broken propellers my flights are not delayed.
