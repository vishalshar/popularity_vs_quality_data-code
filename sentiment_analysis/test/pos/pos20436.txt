I bought this case after first buying the Lytro sleeve-like case which was too small for the lytro itself to fit in and not usable.This larger case is functional, well made, very elegant and with some nice touches. For example, there are several magnetic closures on the case for the main flap and on the interior. They work well and add to the very clean look of this case.It is sized to easily accommodate the lytro, the lytro AC adapter and the lytro tripod stand all of which I bought. This still leaves a small amount of additional room in the case should you need it.Given the clever refinements that have gone into this case and the visible quality of this item, it is worth the price and I recommend it without hesitation.
