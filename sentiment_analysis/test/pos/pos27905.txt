This has been a great game, to me it's like a happy medium between spyfall and the resistance. It has the same kind of feel as you get playing spyfall as you try to come up with arguments to defend yourself or accuse someone else. The nice part though is it's much less stressful to be the murderer than it is to be the spy in spyfall. In relations to the resistance, it kind of feels similar with one person being the traitor and everyone trying to say why they think someone is or isn't it, but you have more substantial evidence to back up your claims opposed in the resistance where it seems it always ends up with one person saying "You're the traitor!" and the other person just constantly saying "No I'm not for god sakes".
