I have one wide mouth mason jar that I wanted to use in the kitchen, so I was excited to find this little invention.  As a bonus, it's made in the US!Originally, I was sent one that didn't have the gasket, so it wouldn't attach to the jar properly.  I ordered a new one and sent back the defective one, and now I can use the cap.
