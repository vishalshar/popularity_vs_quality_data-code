These bulbs may be pricey, but it is worth every penny! These lights are bright (1100 lumens) and offer a large range in colors (supposedly 16 million colors and 1000 whites). The LIFX App is very easy to use and smooth to navigate. Lights can be individually controlled, group controlled, or all controlled. The app includes various whites from warm to cool as well as a full color wheel and scenes for quick mixing and matching. Lights can also be set to strobe, flickered, ect Furthermore, LIFX offers connection with other apps such as Smart Things and Alexa.Alexa is where these really get fun! Add the LIFX skills (one gives you control of turning lights on and off and dimming, the other gives you control of colors) and begin controlling your lights with your voice.If you want a bulb that provides you a fairly infinite range in color and control, these will really do the trick.
