I wanted a smartphone but I did not want to pay a fee every month, so I purchased Posh Titan Max HD Smartphone. I tried others, but this one is a keeper.It is an unlocked GSM phone that you can use a Tracfone SIM activation kit that you can purchase from Walmart. (See attached photo)You can download a PDF manual if you contact support on their web page. And let me tell you about their support. Its fantastic! I had several questions and their email response was very fast.I contacted Tracfone and I was up and running in no time. Go to play store and download the Tracfone app to keep track of you service days, etc. Don't pay any attension to what some users say about the app because it does update triple minutes, txt and data.This is one fantastic phone. The size is perfect, 6.5 by 3.3, with a  6'' screen, the same size as the Iphone 6. There are no cases available but if you search Amazon for a Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 phone, you will find many styles to choose from. All it takes is a  little modification, my husband cut a notch on the  right side where the power and sound buttons. Use the clear plastic case and it should fit perfectly.I've only had the phone for a short while, but I will update my review in a couple of months.Can you tell that I'm very happy with this phone? Buy one and you won't be disappointed.
