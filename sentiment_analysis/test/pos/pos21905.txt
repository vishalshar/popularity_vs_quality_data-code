I am very picky about headsets and spent a lot of time searching for a new one that had all the features I wanted. A lot of PS4 headsets don't have the option to mute or adjust game and chat volume from the actual headset and that was something very important to me. This headset has it all and I am very pleased with it. It also has the option to mute the game volume from the head set which is pretty cool too, I've never had a headset like that before. I have only used this headset for about 6 hours, but it was very comfortable. As long as the headset lasts a long time then I would never doubt buying another headset from LucidSound. I honestly never heard of them before, and took a chance when I was reading a review on another headset I was about to purchase when they suggested these instead. I am very happy I went with this headset instead!
