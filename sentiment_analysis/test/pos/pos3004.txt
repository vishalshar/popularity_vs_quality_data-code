I am an ER dr and work rapidly (say in one week period even) changing shifts. My insomnia and sleep disturbances are the stuff of nightmares. It's also very hard to fall asleep after a shift. This is the only thing I found that reliably helps. I give it four because of the price and I'd wish it work faster (but I can't hold it against them because that's the nature of the ingredients)! If you work shift work it's worth a try!
