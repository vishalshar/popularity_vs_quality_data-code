Bought this for my wife when she needed a bike. She's only 5'1" so she wanted a smaller bike that didn't look like a kids' bike. She LOVES this bike. It rides really smooth and as she describes, "looks retro cool". She still has to reach a bit and lean to one side if she stops and wants to stand without getting off the seat. If the seat was able to come down just an half inch more, she could stand with both feet on the ground and still sit on the seat.Packaging was substantial, but it still came with a little dent on the front fender. We were able to mostly hammer it out. By the time we discovered it, the bike was almost all the way put together, would have been a huge hassle to exchange it for a dent. No scratches on the metal. Took some time in putting it together, about an hour, and probably could have taken it to the bike shop, but I've put many bikes together before so it wasn't too complicated. Two people make it a lot easier when getting things like the brakes installed just right. Another set of hands to hold it keeps the bike from falling over.I'm sure this will get a lot of miles on it. Great bike, great price.
