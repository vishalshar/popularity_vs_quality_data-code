!IMPORTANT! You need to have a candle warmer plate (Hosley White Electric Candle Warmer Large 5.4" . Ideal for aromatherapy, dorm rooms, hotels or any place that you cannot have an open flame.) and a holder (Candle Warmers Etc. Cast Iron Tart Warming Skillet) in order to use the GENTLE BEES SPEARMINT BEESWAX MELTS.These square cubes have a nice spearmint scent that reminds me of gum. The scent isn't overpowering and it will only dissipate as the cube melts on the warmer. So far I've gotten more than six hours of scent (3 days at 2 hours each) and that's on one cube! The included directions say to burn a melt for as long as the scent stays after which you clean out the wax, throw it out, and place a new one down. It took about 30-minutes or so before the one cube started melting and releasing the scent so be patient. I've included pictures so you can see the progression.I've never burned these scented melts before so I had to buy the candle warmer and the little iron skillet that I use in the above links, but so far I'm impressed.There's no smoke associated with burning these melts like with candles or incense and there's no flame that can cause a fire. However, you shouldn't leave the warmer unattended for extended periods of time.In the package are six SPEARMINT BEESWAX MELT CUBES and you can either cut or break off one of the cubes to separate it. My large bedroom has a nice scent now, but the scent doesn't stay very long after you shut off the warmer and the wax cools (much like a regular scented candle).
