This phone is really amazing. It's even smaller than it looks in pictures. I plugged in my sim card and it was ready to go. Bluetooth, WiFi, Data, and GPS all work amazing on this little thing. It's by far the cutest phone you will ever see. I've shown several friends and family and they all are amazed at how small this thing is. The worst part is trying to type on the super small keyboard. I changed it to Google swipe input and it is 10 times easier to type.
