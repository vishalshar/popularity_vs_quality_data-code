I have mixed reviews on this because I had to get 2 different units. The first one I got was out for over a week with no action, but to be fair I've had 3 different traps over the last few months and this little genius was still roaming free, in broad daylight! Then 2 days ago I was up and heard the little jerk messing around in the kitchen amd when I went to look I saw he had been in and out of the trap with no zapping. I set it back up and not 30 minutes later he went in and out again with no zapping. I thought perhaps my bait was too large and he was avoiding the zapping plate so I changed bait again and put 4 small pieces of chocolate in it. The next morning 3 of the 4 pieces were gone and I knew the trap was the problem, not operator error, so I ordered a second one yesterday and put it out immediately baited with the last small piece of chocolate. First thing this morning the red light was flashing and he was zapped! I'm fairly certain that the fact that he went into the last one with no consequences was helpful because he had a false sense of security, so I would recommend baiting but not arming for a while to achieve the same thing, but man am I thrilled to be able to take my food out of the plastic bins it's been stored in for months! I would have given more stars if the first one wasn't defective, but this thing did the trick!
