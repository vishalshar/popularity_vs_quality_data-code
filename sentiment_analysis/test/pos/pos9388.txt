We have three cats and couldn't be more pleased with our Petcube! Now I can check-in on my pets using my iPhone when I'm at work. It was super easy to setup! I've given my close friends access to my Petcube who have enjoyed playing with the cats as well. The laser pointer works really well and the Petcube has allowed us to capture some truly hilarious moments. This sleek little box makes it so easy to give our pets the attention they deserve! Highly recommended!!
