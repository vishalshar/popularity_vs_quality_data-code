Fun item.  Low resolution, but works on my iPhone and my iPad.  Simple application.  Have not spotted any ghouls in the backyard yet, but it is fun to try!It has a mechanical repetitive click when powered, but that does not seem to be a problem.I wish they had made the lightening connector a bit longer.  I have to remove the case from my iPhone before I can plug it in.
