Has the right ingredients for my dog with many food allergies but the taste seems to not be his absolute favorite. The other three suitable ones that I have found for him he seems to like taste wise better but this is nevertheless a great option with high quality ingredients for dogs with food allergies, even the picky eaters. My dog is allergic to several things but three things that exclude most dry foods are fish, grains and potato. Highly recommend.
