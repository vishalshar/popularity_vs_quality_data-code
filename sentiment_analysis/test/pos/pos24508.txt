Great for Cooking Kabobs in the oven and it couldn't be easier to rotate all 6 of them while cooking due to its Ingenious Design! Haven't used it on a grill yet as its winter time. Does require assembly but a quick view of web page and you can determine which way it goes together! The flat steel holds veggies and shrimp in place and not spinning like a top! Threw it in dishwasher when done cooking and the stainless steel cleaned up nicely. Great Gift Idea for someone that likes to cook as I Gifted 2 of these for Christmas!
