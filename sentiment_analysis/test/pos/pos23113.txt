So like others said, this is so small and yet so powerful. I have to admit I am impressed with it, bearing in mind I had purchased a sleep tracker with a sound machine that frankly didn't have good enough noise to be a worthwhile investment. I went with this and will say I am happy.The downsides for me:* I have to scan through the sound in order to find the sound I need, which is kind of annoying.* There is no volume button which could be nice.* It comes with a USB cable but not with a plug.Overall though, a solid product especially for someone like me who uses earplugs but needs white noise to drown out noises that go through the earplugs.
