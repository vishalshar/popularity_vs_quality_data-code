This product has changed the way I approach my dog's health. I am, admittedly, a lazy dog owner. My dog is older, so I used that as an excuse for brief walks and lots of downtime. Her first week with the FitBark, I realized how little activity she saw throughout her day and was appalled by my own behavior. Since using the FitBark, Maggie May is having more active days and is sleeping better because she's worn out and happy. The app is easy to use, the company is SUPER responsive and fast, and my partner is able to keep track of Maggie's activities, too! I highly recommend the FitBark to anyone with a busy, distracting life. It keeps your dog's needs in mind, even when you can't.
