Both my dog and cat love this treat.  They both run to me when they see me get it out of the cabinet.  I have to ration it out because I seem to go through the largest size bag every six weeks.  I only wish there were more pieces and not as much chicken dust in each package.  (They do love the chicken dust - it just has to be poured into their food bowls instead of being handed out as a treat.)
