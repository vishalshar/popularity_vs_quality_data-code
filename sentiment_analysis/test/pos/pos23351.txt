If anyone saw it I gave a snarky review of this kit... and did not contact the seller before posting it. They very kindly responded to my post with great customer service. I should have contacted them first before venting. I also work with customers and want them to contact me with any problems before ranting to others. Shame on me and thank you to Back to the Roots for being so gracious and helpful about it!
