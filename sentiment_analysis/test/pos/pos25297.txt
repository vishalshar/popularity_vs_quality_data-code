After minimal online research and reading a few reviews I decided to bite the bullet and and order this pitcher. It has surpassed our expectations,  taste is very good. My girls drink more water now. We leave it on the counter because  we are constantly filling up our glasses. We have used Brita in the past and have liked it just fine, after the top fell off and broke mid pour we wanted to try something else I'm glad we did. The design is neat, fun to fill and the water taste great.
