Great travel on suitcase for short trips. The added features (especially to use as charger for your phone and Bluetooth controlled lock) are very helpful for business trips where you have little chance to charge your devices elsewhere. Seems the gadgets come at the cost of the inner space, so more suitable for short trips.
