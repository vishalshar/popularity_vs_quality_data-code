shipment was good. I love this sponge, I don't know how I lived without it. Wash rags are too harsh for daily use, and my makeup was ruining them anyway. This sponge provides a deep cleans without stripping away my natural oils, and saves my wash rags to be used for a light drying action. I can see why these are so popular. They feel kinda squishy, and they dry out by hanging it from the plastic suction hanger it comes with. It re-hydrates in seconds next time you use it. I plan to replace it every 3 months.
