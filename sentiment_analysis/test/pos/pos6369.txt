Use it for my bicycle .. map the ride & play music right from the screen with ease .. Not the cheapest, but rock solid/stable ... Between the case & the safety lanyard, there's no way you're losing your phone with this .. Unlike most similar items, NOT a cheap attachment by any means - more like a standard part on the bike ... Would recommend for any application .. A+++
