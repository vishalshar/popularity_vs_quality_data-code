RokForm has a new customer for life. I went from an Otterbox case which would typically last about 3 or 4 months before the cheap rubber pieces would wear out, or the plastic would crack. I've had a RokForm case for a litter over a year, and I could not be happier with it.I've dropped my phone multiple times, and RokForm comes through, time and time again.The only complaint, which isn't a significant downside, is the rubber piece that goes around the RokForm, it tends to stretch out after a while.
