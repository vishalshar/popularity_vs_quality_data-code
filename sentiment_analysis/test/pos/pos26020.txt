These socks are so soft and comfortable when I was walking to get my mail, a bird s*** right in my mouth, but my feet were so cozy and soft that I didn't even get mad. I was just like "we'll I guess this is what falcon poop tastes like" it was very runny and a kinda gritty and a little sour. Great socks.
