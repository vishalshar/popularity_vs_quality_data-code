I bought these as an xmass present for a 12 year old girl.  She loved them so much we designed them that very night together.  Sound quality is great for the price.  The decorstive silver square studs that come with it are impossible to stick on without a glue gun, their peel and stick backing is useless.  We own a hot glue gun so it was fine.
