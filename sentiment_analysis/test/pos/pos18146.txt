They are a little large but I am hoping they will shrink over time; not a deal breaker.  They came packaged in a box that shocked me at how nice it was; like the outer box of something very pricey. They are thicker than your average dress sock so keep that in mind; halfway between a dress sock and an athletic sock.  Not so thick that you need a larger shoe size. I bought these because my old dress socks were wearing out.  Also my daily wear dress black shoes were too tight and hurt after a few hours.  I decided it was time for some new shoes and socks.  The new shoes were too big so I'll have to exchange them. I wore the new socks with my old shoes and they actually made those shoes wearable again. I highly recommend these socks; best dress socks I've ever had.  I'll order more; just 19.99 for three pair; I thought the box would cost that?
