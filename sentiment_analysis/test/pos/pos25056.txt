This litter box and the refills are awesome!!!I have THREE cats.I have THREE cats.I HAVE THREE CATS and I am not OLD or CRAZY.I have THREE children and through happenstance I ended up with THREE cats. Three beautiful boy kitties all under the age of four. Once the third baby cat arrived, the cats began to drive me crazy and I started to get a glimmer of why people get the nick name of crazy cat people.If the cats do not have a fresh place to go, they start making new places and act out. I hate cat smell in a house. I hate it. This was really getting to be a struggle to keep up with before I bought this liter system. I now have only one box and I change the litter tray out once a week. Sometimes it goes to 9 days if we are busy. Who am I kidding, we are always busy. I have had this system for about six months.Before this system, nobody wanted to change the litter boxes of course, and even though I had the boxes in the garage, it was a huge hassle. I have used other electric systems that were more expensive and basically broke down, leaked, or the replacement cartridges did not work right and caused major problems, and smelled pretty terrible. I do not like using plastic so much and feel bad enough about all the waste in our landfills. I tried scooping and I have had up to three litter boxes at once. Three boxes, that were perpetually needing cleaning and this ONE box does the work efficiently and because it stays fresh the cats are happy. The only thing I wish about this product is that they had a frequent buyer program. I have done the math and based upon the cost of big containers of litter, dragging them home, scooping them, cleaning up the mess and dreading the cleaning, only to find little clumps all over the house the cats have tracked in because the other litter sticks in their paws, this system has added a little bit sanity to my life, which is essentially priceless. This is not taking into consideration that the smell factor on other systems was icky, which with this system is really not noticeable. The kids or I change the tray out and it takes a couple minutes and is easy. This system is worth every dime I have spent.
