I previously owned this pedal, then sold it because it was to hard to go from song to song for me while I was doing all the other one man band stuff I do. I bought the pedal again, because this year they made the patches and tempos controllable by midi so now I can use my ipad program, Onsong, to send midi commands to beat buddy that auto changes the patch and the tempo. Brilliant.
