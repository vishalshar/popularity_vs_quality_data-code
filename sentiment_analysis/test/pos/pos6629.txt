At first glance you may say,  "how much for oil?!" but rest assured, your money is being spent wisely.As far as luxury oils go, this is not that expensive, but the quality is still top notch.I use this to pop popcorn and fry a few different things in.  It is a healthier alternative to canola or vegetable oil.Try it - you wont be sorry!
