My 8.5lb Yorkshire Terrier goes bananas for these treats. They are by far his favorite. I break them up into small pieces to give to my guy, but man does he love them. I like that they have glucosamine and chondroitin for his hips and joints. I've tried all three flavors and beef is definitely his favorite, but he likes the other two too. The salmon however is quite salmon-y -- which is to be expected and a good sign (it's real). However, because we break it up into a ton of small pieces to reward for "potty" throughout each day it's a bit too much salmon all the time. I totally recommend this product based on ingredients and my dog's undying love.
