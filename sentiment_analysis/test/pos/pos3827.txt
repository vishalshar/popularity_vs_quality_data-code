I'm not a pro and thus I  can't say I've gotten 100% hair free results. This product definite takes practice and patience. That being said, the jar is very nice and the contents are of pretty good quality. It comes with a few cloth strips, but I find it to be more effective to spread the wax, letting it get dry/tacky for a few seconds and then ripping it off with my hands. Another method is the "sugaring" method where you lay a small section of wax, let it dry and then rub/roll it off. The hair comes off with the wax.Personally I'm on the lazier side, and i think I'd rather just shave or pay to have a pro wax me. But this product is good for smaller areas (like ur arms and of you're flexible enough to hold tur own skin taut: the armpits). If you have the dexterity and the patience, go for it!
