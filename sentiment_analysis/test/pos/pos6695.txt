I've just received this item and gave my small dog with very bad skin allergies a double dose of it and the skin and coat. I am not sure of it was the supplements yet or not, but she had a very flaky red rash going up the back of her leg and tummy, and today it looks like its almost gone. I was about to take her to the vet yet again for her skin issues, where I'm sure they would have handed me more steroids and prescribed benadryl, but I do not use the steroids due to their side effects and I only use benadyl when she is having a very bad allergy day.  I feed a rotational diet of two brands of premium grain free dog foods and give grizzly salmon oil with each meal. I believe this and the super food supplements given everyday will make a huge difference in her itchiness, which was already noticeably better after adding salmon oil. I mix these supplements up in a little bit of plain yogurt in the morning and she eats it right up. I will edit this review in the future to let everyone know if this product has made a significant difference. As of now I give this supplement and the skin and coat supplement 5 stars.
