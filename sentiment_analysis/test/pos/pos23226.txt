This has worked well so far. It was easy to set up and schedule feedings via the website. It sends e-mail when a new serving has been exposed. I gave me trouble only once when I was setting it up the night before a trip: while trying it out with a feed-now command, the tray rotated only half way; I immediately received an e-mail saying it detected a problem and provided instructions to press a combination of buttons on the top of the feeder to reset it, which worked.The camera on it is really blurry, and at least with mine does not point down so that I can see that the new serving has been exposed.Note that all communication with the feeder is done through the website, and there are no instructions for alternate connection. If the company goes out of business it appears it will become useless, like so many other Internet-of-Things devices (except it will continue its current feeding schedule).On the recommendation from a friend, I got one of these to provide an evening serving of canned food for my cat while I'm away (due to allergies, she is unable to eat dry food, even supposedly non-allergy ones). The night before my trip I prepare single servings of the canned food, placing them in saucers (search Amazon for Dean Jacob's set of 4 bread dipping saucers - these circular porcelain saucers fit precisely in the tray and negate the need to clean the feeder tray daily, at least for my cat who is a clean eater). I wrap the saucers in wax paper and put each in a sandwich bag in the freezer. My pet sitter comes in the mornings and provides a serving of fresh canned food, and also puts a frozen serving into the feeder so that it will be exposed that evening, by which time the food has thawed. He rinses the prior night's saucer and puts it in the dishwasher. This has worked well since I got the feeder a few trips ago.
