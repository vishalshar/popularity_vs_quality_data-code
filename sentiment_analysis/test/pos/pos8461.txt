Great slim case that wraps around the front. I have dropped it several times and there was no damage to the phone. It's very easy to take on and off and fits the phone very well.I love the felt but it does pill rather quickly. It's hard finding a case that is more grippy and less slippery. I like when I put the phone on my lap it doesn't slide off.I wish it didn't have the logo.UPDATE:After about a year of heavy use, the felt is starting to peel off. :(Perhaps that's a reasonable lifespan?
