I used some duct tape to seal the hole so it's now just a dry bag with some nubs on one side and a narrow clear window along the side.The Laundreez is not nearly as nice construction overall, weighs a bit more (5.3 oz vs 2.8) and doesn't roll as compactly, but the mesh bag helps with the agitation and most of all, the large valve allows you to wash and rinse without opening the bag back up.While the Scrubba is rubberized nylon fabric, the Laundreez is a thick vinyl - kind of stiff, though with warm water it becomes fairly flexible.  You can really see how clean the clothes are with the Laundreez while the Scrubba window isn't very effective, particularly when washing darker clothes.I'd probably say that the Scrubba isn't worth the extra money over simply using a camping dry bag, but the Laundreez offers some real advantages.Sample provided for evaluation.
