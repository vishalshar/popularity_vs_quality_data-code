It's pretty easy to use and gives you a cold brew in about 2-3 hours as opposed to the 24 hours the usual filter pitchers take.The packing was great...it comes in what looks like a big milk carton. The set-up was easy. And the results were good.  The coffee I got out of it on my first try was not as smooth as I've gotten from the filter pitcher method, but I think that has more to do with having to experiment with the grounds and process. I used exactly 30g (weighed, although there are markings on container) of freshly medium burr-grinded coffee.  I may try a more course grind. I am also going to let the grounds bloom a bit more with some water put on them before letting the cold water come through.I also used a lot of ice, which sort of formed a solid clump and didn't melt all the way. Next time, I'm going to use less ice and just more cold water.All in all, a great little "machine".
