Love it! I had an iPhone 5s and a targus wallet case. I didn't upgrade until I had a potential case to put it in. I bought about 5 different wallet cases (non-folio). Hands down the EYN wins. It adds bulk, but I'm fine with that and in fact lets me hold the phone better than without a case. Matte finish. Holds my 5 cards just fine and still clicks shut, and still has room for a few bills of cash folded up. The wallet part flips open to be a kickstand for landscape-viewing too (and technically for vertical also) and the cards don't fall out. Seems to take pictures fine too (was scared bc seems to have hood) and flash worked ok. Audio is a little weird at first, but okay, the sound seemed to almost echo a little through the case when talking on the phone so it was like hearing in stereo. The bumpers around the edge do come up slightly so they should protect the screen in the event of dropping the phone. Bottom slides off super easy if you need it to (if your charging station or earplugs won't fit past the case) and the phone slides in and out that way so you don't need to wrestle with the case if you want to take it out.
