I just got this product, but I love it. Nabbed it at the $20 sale price and it is a great way to start my home automation! I was hesitant with some of the reviews, but I think there must have been an update that fixed all of the problems.The set up took a few tries, but when I got it connected with my android nexus 6p, it worked great! I have no problems with turning it on and off, or using it with IFTTT. The strip looks a little dorky, but works so well!
