This is a significant upgrade from the original nylon & velcro holster that came with my Gerber mutli-tool, in terms of both fashion and durability.  While the price was at the higher end of my budget, the materials and construction are both of superior quality.  My standard-size multi-tool just barely fits, but with some wear I expect the leather to stretch and form itself perfectly to the exact shape.  I'm very much looking forward to breaking it in, and will keep this company in mind for any other leather goods I may need.
