I am so glad I ordered this.  I think every French Press should have these filters.  The two filters and optional paper filter (which I use every time) keeps the coffee grounds from getting into your coffee cup, and eliminates that cloudiness that you get in the coffee without all the filters. So you get the great taste of French Press coffee without the undesirable parts (to me, anyway).  Love it!  I threw my previous French Press away - I had bought it at Starbucks.  No comparison. Yeah! Finally!
