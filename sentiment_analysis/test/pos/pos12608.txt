I am using these at work as a notification device for the forklift drivers to move material.  It took a bit of work to figure out exactly how I wanted everything to work, and a little programming, but I now have a light for each area set up on two forklifts that flash a different color for each person in that area that needs a material pickup.  The setup is expandable and easy to see and understand.  I hope to have the entire shop floor rigged for this soon.
