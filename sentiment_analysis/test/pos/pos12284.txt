I bought these specifically to wear inside of athletic shoes.  I've had foot surgery and needed some extra cushioning, especially since I'm pushing a little on the limits my podiatrist set.  When I took them out of the box they felt good and thick in my hand.  When I put them on my 11 wide feet, they slipped on and conformed to my foot like they were custom made.  They felt great during an hour and a half of cycling, footwork, and heavy bag work.  The only thing I can't attest to is durability.  I've only worn one pair of the three and just haven't had them long enough to say anything about that.  I'm buying some more...
