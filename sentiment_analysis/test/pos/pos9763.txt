Mixed reviews thus far as bought one set for me and one for teenage daughter but had to return one set as it would not do on/off consistently with touch if ear piece.  Other see worked fine.Thus my feedback is on a good working unit really like it.  It's effective and easy and the clicker on the one ear piece to run controls is very efficient.  We dropped them into different helmets with no problem.  So overall very good when they work
