The product is good, however I have one remark.If you have an iphone/ipad bought in Europe, the system may not work as it comes. This is due to a limitation in the volume that exists for European devices. I think this is not a "detail" and should be mentioned clearly. Hopefully I have an ipad that I bought in the US, all my other devices are from Europe....
