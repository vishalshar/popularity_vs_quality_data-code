I have a number of reading glasses spread around my house, in the car, etc. and I need them!  However, not being a systematic person, I can never find them or lose them again once I have.  I nearly always have my phone with me or know where it is.  The case the optics (pince-nez glasses) come in fits perfectly on the the back of my phone so that when I need to read something unexpectedly (tiny print on a label, for instance), I just slip them out of the case and I can!  They come in different strengths but 2.0 worked fine for me.  I use my regular glasses for a longer read since, being 'pince-nez' ('pinch the nose) I do notice them after a while but I also have completely forgotten about them if I'm absorbed in my reading.Oh, the fact that they're so thin means that when I have the phone in my shirt pocket and they're in the nearly equally thin case, I do not notice that I have 'glasses' with me.I highly recommend them!  I wish they were less expensive but they're not. I would definitely buy them again and am thinking of giving them to a friend for her birthday.
