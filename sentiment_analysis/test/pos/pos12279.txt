We got these socks because my husband has been having trouble with a sore and swollen left foot, and we wanted something soft and comfortable.  These turned out to be just what we were looking for.  They fit nicely and were comfortable right out of the box, and still fit nicely and are comfortable after washing. I'd give them 5 stars except that we've only had them a short time so I don't know how they'll holdup.  So far, they're perfect.
