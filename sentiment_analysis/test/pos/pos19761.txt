This drive is great for a kid to carry to school.They can't lose the top because it's connected.  Also, the child can push the drive in by holding the case, instead of a "slide switch" that slips.It is a little difficult to open sometimes.  My son noticed, though, that if he does it a certain way (holding the edges, instead of the flatter sides) it opens easily.  He is required to have a flash drive for school because some of his texts and much of his work is done on the computer.I really wish it came with a lanyard that had a safety break.  I had to order that separately.My son says, "This drive Rocks!  It's RED and looks cool."It seems to operate just fine.
