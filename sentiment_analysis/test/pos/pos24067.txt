Great phone case!  My brother has the same case for his HTC One M8.  He left it on the top of his car and it fell off while turning the corner at about 15 miles an hour and bounced off the road.  When he picked it up, Just a minor scuff on the back of the case.  He did also have a glass adhesive screen protector on it as well (highly recommend the glass screen protector too).
