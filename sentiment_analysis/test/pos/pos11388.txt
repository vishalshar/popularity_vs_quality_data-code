exactly as advertised.  The base sticks to the night stand without any issues.  I charge an iPad mini in the back and my iPhone in the front.  The iPhone has an Apple leather case and the iPad has a plastic back with a triangle style front cover and both fit perfectly.  The base is a little pricier than I would like but it does everything they advertise and looks nice.  It is also nice not trying to find the charging cable when it falls back behind the night stand anymore.
