Day 2 Review: So far I really like this little dude. I got this for xmas (how she got it in time who knows). Unboxing was easy, setup was easy, and I was up and running within around 5 mins of downloading the app and typing in the wifi password to connect to Coz. I like that you unlock games and earn Spark, all gimmicks to keep you coming back but is a good thing. I seem to unlock them a little too fast IMO. I am still afraid that after I show some friends cozmo will lose his novelty. Hopefully they can keep adding more apps and tricks to keep him interesting. I will update after a while on whether or not the novelty wears off.
