I'm known around the office as "Spilly." There hasn't been a day where I didn't knock my cup over and spill water all over my desk. So when I heard there was a drinking apparatus that wouldn't fall over, I had to put it to the test. I was skeptical at first, but it was true! I tried purposely pushing it over and it didn't. Then I tried "accidentally" hitting it to see if it will spill but nope, it was still standing. I'm quite impressed and not to mention really amused by the engineering of this product. Love the non-spillable aspect of the product and it's great to drink from too. One of the better purchases I made in 2016 and it made my everyday life run so much smoother.
