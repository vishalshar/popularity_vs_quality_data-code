I came across this product while searching "how to hide a scar with makeup" on YouTube.  I had already purchased a product called Glamoflage after watching a video, but found that trying to rub makeup into the scar only created more redness and made the scar more pronounced.  Then, I came across a few videos on Dermaflage, by consumers, makeup artists and right before my very eyes, I was sold!  I immediately purchased Dermaflage.  The directions are easy and I was able to get good results on my first try.  I have worn this product twice in public after getting it 3 days ago, and feel confident and secure.  The product will only come off if you peel it off.  My scar is in between my eyebrows and was the first thing I saw when I looked into the mirror.  NOT ANY MORE! I feel like I have  a "do over" from a fainting accident and am no longer self conscience.  Thank you Dermaflage,  Life is better with you in my makeup drawer.
