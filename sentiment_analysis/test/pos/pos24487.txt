As a business owner, having Remocam is like being in two places at once. Ive looked into other security systems but most require a lot of cable wires and monthly payments for a static IP address. Remocam did not require any of that, it was very easy to setup (took me 3 minutes) and did not require a monthly payment. I could easily see whats going on inside my store during the day and at night I can record and be able to see because of the night vision capability. I can also listen in on conversations between employees and customers and have the option to talk back if need be. The HD resolution is amazing, everything is very clear.I couldnt be happier with this product. I will definitely be purchasing another for my home.Remocam-Smart Home Security Camera for All (Wireless, Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, IP Surveillance, HD, PTZ)
