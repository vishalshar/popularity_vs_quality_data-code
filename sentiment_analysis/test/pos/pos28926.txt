Great, rugged, and durable case.  I love the fact it has a magnet on it.  Very useful. I have had no problems with this case either charging it or listening to external audio via an auxiliary cable.  I have dropped it a couple of times and it has taken the impact with no damage to the phone.  Great Case and would recommend it.
