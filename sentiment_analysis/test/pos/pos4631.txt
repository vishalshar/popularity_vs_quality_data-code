Love Love Henry's Humdinger's Infused Honey!! Arrived on time, packaged beautifully with a very helpful recipe book! I've already sampled all of them & can't wait to dive into all of the recipes & make some of my own!  Particularly to use Naughty Nana (mild pepper & ginger) and Grumpy Grandpa (cayenne & garlic) in my savory dishes!! Thanks Henry & your humdingers...A Big Austin Texas SALUTE!! BRAVO!!
