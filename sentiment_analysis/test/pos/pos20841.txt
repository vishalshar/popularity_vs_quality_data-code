Honestly, I cant understand the negative reviews. Yes, if you use these as your primary reading glasses, you will be disappointed. Yes, if they break and you didnt take the time to register for the lifetime warranty, you will be disappointed. Registration takes all of 30 seconds, which is actually longer than the time it takes to pull these out of my pocket, read some fine print and put them away. I have 20/15 far vision, but at age 51 find it difficult to read without good lighting and large print or longer arms. I have dozens of pairs of readers, but never seem to have them when Im at a restaurant or grocery store. These things are so convenient that I no longer have to guess what my dinner bill is or what ingredients are in a package. I initially stuck the case to the back of my cell phone. It fit easily on the 4s without blocking the camera or light. After a few days, I realized that I typically dont carry my phone all the time so I pulled the case off the phone case (it was stuck very tightly), removed all the residue boogers and have been carrying it in my wallet or front pocket when I dont want to pull out my wallet. I get a few stares and questions from my server when Im looking at a menu since according to my wife, I look ridiculous, while my daughter just rolls her eyes and says typical Dad. But at least now, I dont have to ask my wife to read me the menu or take care of the bill.Edit: I read some reviews about difficulty putting into case and decided to make a video showing how easy it is to do. It is actually easier than the video shows since I was reaching over the top of my phone to record while balancing the phone under my chin.Overall Recommendation: Definitely worth the price, just make sure you register for the warranty** I paid full price for this product.  My reviews are honest and reflect my opinion on the product based on the advertised price regardless of the price I paid.**If after extended use, there are any significant changes or the product fails to perform as expected, I will update my review.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to ask any questions. If you found this review helpful, please click Yes below.Update 10/17/16 : I enjoy these so much that I ordered 2 more pairs. I now have 1 on my keychain, 1 attached to my phone, and 1 for my wallet just to make sure I always have a pair handy.
