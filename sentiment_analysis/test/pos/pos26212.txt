Excellent shave. Razor is balanced and heavy so little to no pressure is needed. Blade reveal leaves no nicks and cleans easily. Only downfall so far is the slick thin handle. While it has a non slip surface, it does little when your hand is wet and has shaving soap on it. I will be looking for a better handle soon.
