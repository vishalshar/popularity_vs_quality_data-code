I needed a "portable pocket" for cycling and dancing.  I purchased the Tie Die Friday pattern.  It's very pretty.  The pockets are not overly large (on purpose) but will hold absolute necessities.  I carry my IDs, a cell phone, Kleenex, and my house key.  The belt lays flat, without bulk and bulge, and securely holds its contents.  I like the adjustability of the waistband and the clasp.  I wouldn't mind having a couple of other colors but because of what this item costs, I chose the one I thought would work best.  I received it promptly with a handwritten "Thank You" on the receipt which I appreciated.
