I recently purchased the Grip Boost towel for my son, who is a running back. During the game he has his towel hanging from his belt to keep his gloves dry to prevent fumbles. It has proved to be a necessity in Florida, where it rains nearly everyday during football season. His gloves get wet and muddy, his Grip Boost towel still dries his gloves....even while wet itself! Thanks Grip Boost
