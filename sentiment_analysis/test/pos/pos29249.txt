It's elegant. This mouse is a thing of beauty. The LED accents are subtle but noticeable, and the light diffuses evenly through them. The body is made of a lightweight matte plastic that feels solid and high quality. There is no creaking when you rest your palm on it. The curves that make it feel so comfortable hold also give it something of a luxury car appearance: sleek and expensive.The buttons are perfectly responsive. The left and right mouse buttons click when I want them to: no accidental clicks or presses that were "too soft" to register. The thumb buttons have the same click and response as the main mouse buttons, which was a pleasant surprise -- and they are ideally placed. You don't have to shift your hand in order to use the them.There are some nuances about the mouse to note, which will be pros or cons depending on your preferences:- The mouse is unweighted. At first I was taken aback by how light it is. A mouse mat with a bit of friction can offset the lack of weight. I adjusted within about an hour of use.- You need a good mouse pad. It would barely register on my desk or other surfaces (Wacom tablet, book, etc.). As I mention below, I use one by Corsair that works beautifully.- The scroll wheel takes slow, deliberate steps. You won't be able to "spin" it, and there is no side scroll. This is great for some games and not optimal for others.- After a long session of gaming, the oils from your skin will start to show on it. These don't appear to degrade the plastic and disappear after a quick wipe down.- It's got a cloth cord with a decent amount of length and flexibility. Rooted firmly at both ends.The software that allows you to adjust the settings of the mouse is a breeze. It spreads out the range of settings into sections that are easy to parse. It has the standard DPI, lift off, tracking, etc., which are easy to tweak and make for some top of the line performance. The feature for adding macros is simple to use: click "start recording," perform your macro, click "stop recording," assign macro to button, done.I have several computers, Macs and PCs, desktops and laptops. This mouse works with all of them the moment it's plugged in, as the profiles that tell it how to behave are stored on the mouse itself.Note on the Surface Quality Analysis Technology (S.Q.A.T.): the first mouse pad I tried was a plastic surface one made by Razer, which registered 100 on the test. The second pad I tried was a Corsair that registered a 50. Take these numbers with a grain of salt because while it had a higher number, my mouse skated across the Razer mat like soap on fresh ice (and was about as easy to control). The mouse handling on the cloth Corsair mat was perfect, and I noticed no loss in quality on screen -- the pointer always went smoothly to where I wanted it to go.I play a wide range of genres, and this mouse is serving me well whether I'm breaking blocks in Minecraft, landing skill shots in League of Legends, or flying frigates in EVE Online. The macro feature helps my performance in all of these games, and I'm damn thankful that those thumb buttons are so easy to use.Overall, the ergonomics of the mouse and the technologies that power it make the Mionix NAOS 7000 feel like an extension of your mind.
