I wanted a camera I can interact with my dogs. I did not want to pay a bunch of money. Based upon reviews and ratings I decided on Petzi. It is easy to set up. My puppy enjoys the cookies shooting out. They are still trying to figure out the voice coming out of it. The facial expressions are priceless. One minor issue is the treats sometimes don't shoot out every time. The support people of Petzi are very prompt to answer any issues and always follow up.  I do wish there was a feature which the dogs can see me. Otherwise, I recommend Petzi for any pet parent. The mini Milk Bone cookies are the perfect treat for it.
