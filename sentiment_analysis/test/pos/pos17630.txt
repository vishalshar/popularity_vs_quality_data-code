These filters totally changed the game.  I was trying to film wakeboarding and waterskiing in the bright sun in 4k and the videos just constantly looked washed out. With these filters I can bring the frame rate down significantly allowing a much smoother looking film. Also drastically increases the range that I'm able to pick up.  Would highly recommend these.  They fit perfectly and they come with individual bags for each lens.  My only wish is that the bags were labeled so I didn't have to check each bag to find the right filter.  Also, the gold color looks spectacular!  Highly recommended and worth the money if you do any video shooting during the day.
