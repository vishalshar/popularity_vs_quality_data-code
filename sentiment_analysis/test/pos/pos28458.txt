Wow, we both LOVE these apple chips!  They are sweet and crunchy both.  Now we can feel good about snacking on something crunchy without grabbing that bag of chips.  These apple chips go GREAT paired with a soup or sandwich.  One bag is ample for two people to split for a lunch. In fact in this case the bag is labeled as 2 servings, it is truly 2 full servings that is enough to satisfy as a snack for two older adults, at just 90 calories per serving.  I highly recommend, my husband is already asking when we'll order more :-)Features per the label: Baked, No Preservatives, Fat Free, Gluten Free, Non GMO, No Added Sugar, No Cholesterol, Good Source of Fiber.
