I recently purchased the Libratone Zipp bluetooth speaker and I really love it.  I've owned several wireless speakers but this is turning out to be my favorite.  It's portability allows me to enjoy sound in every room in my house.  It works great streaming music on Spotify and Pandora.  It simple to use just plug it in and download the Libratone Application to start listening to your favorite tunes.  I will definitely recommend it to friends.
