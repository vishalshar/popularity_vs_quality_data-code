I bought my first one 3 weeks ago and I bought 2 more after that. This is a very useful product. I put it in 2 bedrooms with my children and one in the kitchen. It immediately starts sending me alerts when we burn a bread in our toaster so I am very confident that it works well. I still donÂ’t know all the details of the Voc numbers even after reading the guide but learning. The one in our kitchen I use it as a sleep light and we love it. I wish it has a schedule or timer that the light colors would change automatically. I hope they add this to the app.
