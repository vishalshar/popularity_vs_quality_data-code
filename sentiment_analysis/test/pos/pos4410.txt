Love this device! When my daughter got her license I wanted a way to be easily able to track the location of the car and her driving style. I just hate having yet another monthly charge on my credit cards on top of the 10 other things we're already paying for. Automatic does a wonderful job. Works perfectly - GPS is very accurate. App is beautiful - shows a map of every trip taken. It gave me a notification when my daughter's car's check engine light came on and indicated what the problem was. I even allows you to reset the 'check engine' light to see if it reappears (eliminate one-off false positives). I also love the fact that it can detect collisions and automatically call me or 911 in case of an accident.I have no problem with the fact that notifications may be 10-15 seconds delayed. My guess is because data is pre-paid, they try to space out the updates to save bandwidth. I ended up buying another for my wife's car and will get one more for mine (as soon as they have them in stock!)I also understand that the feature list is not a full as the original Automatic app - and does not yet have fuel level indication.The Android app does have a bug - when you try to look at the location on a map when the car is being driven, it starts out with a zoomed out view of north America and you have to manually zoom in to see where the car is at (they acknowledged the bug - hopefully will be fixed soon).My feature wish list:Give me an ability to see total mileage by day/week/month (I can do it with IFTT but that should be easy to add into the app)Add a notification everytime the adapter is unplugged and plugged back.
