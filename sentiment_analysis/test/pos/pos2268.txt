I just tried using the Soma water filter and it makes a surprising improvement over Seoul city water.  It eliminated the off taste of the tap water and personally I think eliminated some of the smell.  I do have one gripe as I was filling the pitcher for the first time the handle broke where the pitcher joins the handle.  It's too much of a hassle to return the pitcher and I think some super glue will hopefully do the trick.
