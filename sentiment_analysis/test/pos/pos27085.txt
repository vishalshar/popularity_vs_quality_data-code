As most did I'm sure, we saw the Fizzics Beer System on Shark Tank, and immediately ordered it up as a gift for my father's birthday. We gave it to him, and tried it out this past weekend (11/5/2016), and I have to say, it was incredible! The only beer we had on hand were some very low quality light beers. Did the side-by-side, Fizzics vs. hand pour, taste test and it was remarkable how much better the Fizzics made the beer taste! I don't understand how it is possible, but an obvious improvement. Great head retention, smoother almost naturally carbonated mouth feel. I literally couldn't believe it. The difference was so obvious that I actually took the hand poured mug, and ran it through the Fizzics so that I could tolerate finishing it. I had no idea that it would make such a drastic improvement, even to the less than desirable quality beers, but it does! Highly recommend!!!
