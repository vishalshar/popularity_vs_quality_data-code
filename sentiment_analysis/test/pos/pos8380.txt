I have a teenage boy Lacrosse player, which means our house has smelly pads and clothes.  This detergent is super effective at eliminating order without adding a strong perfume smell.I have found that you only need to add it every 3rd or 4th load so it will last.Also, love that it was developed by a former lacrosse player and we can support the lacrosse community by purchasing.
