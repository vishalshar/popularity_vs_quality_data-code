I have to say this was a hit right out of the box with my Yorkie mix about a year old. She sometimes even snuggles with it when it is turned off. As soon as the ball hits the shoot it sends out a high pitch sounds and no matter were she is in the house she knows her ball machine is running. We have had it about a month and she is not playing with it herself but soon very soon, she just loves it that much. Now I will say I also have 2 Shih Tzu's (about 7 years old) and they find the machine a bit too fast. Not that they don't love to play ball they just prefer the old fashion way of a good slow toss. So one out of 3 dogs is a fan, but in our case our Bella is our youngest and the very hardest to keep entertained. So I say a complete hit!
