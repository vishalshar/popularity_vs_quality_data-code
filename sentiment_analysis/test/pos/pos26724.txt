Easy to use, lot cheaper than the $$$ alternative. Only complaint is it came out of phone one night and I thought I would never find it. TAPE IT ON WITH ELECTRIC TAPE to save yourself some grief. I've used thermal devices that were very expensive and this isn't as good but it does the job at a fraction of the price.
