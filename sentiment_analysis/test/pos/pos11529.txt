I have been wearing my Mira activity bracelet for about 2 months now, and I love it! I have not used a FitBit or any other fitness tracker before-- primarily because I could not see myself wearing a prominent, silicone plastic bracelet everyday. The Mira is attractive, does not feel cumbersome, and blends in with my lifestyle and aesthetic seamlessly. Thus, I actually wear it everyday and get the benefits of tracking my daily activity. I especially love that you can check it with just a gentle squeeze of the opal. An added perk is that it makes for a great conversation starter, as it looks cool :)I have not experienced any problems with accuracy. I charge it once a week, and it charges within a few hours. My only qualm with the bracelet is that I occasionally get a rash on my arm if I leave it on for prolonged periods of time (e.g., sleep with it on for multiple days in a row).
