This has shown me a ton about my game without interfering with my round, taking up time or distracting me from attempting to enjoy golf. By my 2nd round using it, it became habit to take my practice swing, tap the device, and then hit. I keep it clipped to my belt and it reads through my rain jacket and would probably read through your pants if you wanted to keep it in your pocket. It's very accurate and the website/app are great too - Easy to use and upload the info and then analyse your round. The device holds a charge for at least 2 rounds at a time and is easy to set up. The tags are quick and easy to install on your clubs. I haven't had any issue with any of the hardware or software. It has changed the way I play ( showed me that on average I actually hit my 5i longer than my 4i because I'm so inconsistent with the 4i. And that I hit my 9i about 10yds longer than I thought). I just started getting into golf last year and I'm still a 21 handicap, but now golfing every weekend. This has taught me a lot about the shots I hit, what I need to work on overall and the decisions I make on a shot-to-shot basis during a round.
