Pros:1. Looks good. Simple, clean appearance.2. Two way locator - find phone with your trackr or find your trackr with your phone. This is extremely useful. I find the alarm sound to be plenty loud in normal environments.  For people who frequently lose track of their keys or phone, this is the way to go.3. as long as your phone is within range of your trackr (keys) its going to keep reasonable close tabs on where they are located4. battery lasts a long time. battery is replaceable.5. small unobtrusive size - fits great onto key chain great6. leave one in your car and you'll always know just where you parked the car7. The flashing light when you sound the trackr is useful. In the dark, it is visible.8. The battery indicator in the app is useful.Cons:1. once the device is out of range of your phone - its gone.  The "crowd source" locator simply does not work.  I've had a trackr on friend's car for 1 month.  The car still shows the same location as when I put the device on - one month of driving through many areas, parking lots, etc and the device did not locate once.  Similarly, I left a set of keys in a cab.  The trackr showed the exact spot where I got out of the cab.  But it never updated, despite a week of the keys being taken in the driver's home, then dropped off at the lost and found center.  In an entire week, not a single update from the crowd source feature.  Still, the fact that it showed the point where I got out of the cab enabled me to successful realize where I'd left the keys, and get them back.2. The second feature that simply doesn't work is the "separation alarm."  The idea is that when you are separated from your device (on your keys, for example" an alarm will go off.  Again, the thought is brilliant, but in practical reality its too sensitive.  With many false alarms.  Phone and keys will be sitting next to each other on desk.  They will go off several times a day without being moved.3. The paint on the metal chips and wears quickly. The bare metal version might hold up longer.This is the first and only tracking device I've owned.  It has definitely helped me find my keys and my phone more than once.  I lose both frequently.  For me, the ability to find my phone with my keys when it falls into the couch or under the bed, makes this device a good choice.3 to 4 stars
