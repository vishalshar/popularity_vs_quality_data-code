This is one of the best products that I've come across. My old sprinkler controller started to fail, and since I live in California (and we're in a drought), I figured that I should replace it. I really didn't know that such high-tech devices such as this were available. I started out looking for a replacement for my old controller. However, I came across this one on Amazon. What really helps me decide on a product that I'm not familiar with is the reviews that the people post regarding the product on Amazon. Needless to say the unit seems fantastic. Since I installed it, it's been raining like crazy in California. It looks impressive on my garage wall.You can control everything from your phone, PC, tablet, etc. and its compatible with the NEST system. If you're the type that has purchased the NEST thermostat, you definitely need this controller. This controller is pretty pricey but I highly recommend this product.
