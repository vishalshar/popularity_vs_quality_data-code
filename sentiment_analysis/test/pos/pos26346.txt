Ok when I bought this I wasn't for sure how it'd work. But for the price and size of this little guy it was worth it.  It's small and easy to take anywhere, comes with multiple hookups for phones and hdmi (at the time of purchase it didnt come with an iPhone connection).  During the Fourth of July I hooked up my Xbox and we played on the side of our barn. It was a little blurry, but honestly not bad for how big of area it had to cover. Around a 6'x7'ish
