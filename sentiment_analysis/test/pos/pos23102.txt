This is my second iOttie  one touch Cell phone holder. The first one I had was for my Galaxy S6 Edge Plus and also had the Qi charger built in. I purchased this one for my new iPhone 7 Plus.iOttie has impressed me yet again with this unit. I've found  both of these units to be robustly built with very little movement when everything is locked in. The suction cup adheres and secures the base to just about anything. The options for position, height, angle and extension are endless. The auto secure feature makes phone placement and release super easy.I highly recommend this unit for anyone looking for a quality built, multi position mount for their cell phone.
