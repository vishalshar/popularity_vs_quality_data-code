I bought based on reviews, but still wasn't sure what to expect. Holy insanity was I surprised! These were so freaking comfortable I wish I could wear them all the time. Super soft, nice support, no rubbing/chaffing, I wear them mostly for swimming and haven't had problems with them wearing down like other products. When I run in them I fell no rubbing. This was big for me because I used to run a lot and was skinny, but since school I've gained a LOT of weight and my legs rub, but with these on I didn't even notice. If I wasn't a poor college student id definitely buy more. If you are wondering if these could really be worth the price, YES they really are!
