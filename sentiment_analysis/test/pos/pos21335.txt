We bought a new Subaru Outback in September 2015. It is still off gassing. I don't want those VOC's polluting our family's bodies, so I tried this charcoal adsorber. Well, I put it in the car one night last week and NEVER smelled the off gassing again. On hot days, with the windows shut, I open up the car and NO off gas odor. We are impressed and relieved. I tried those tiny charcoal bags prior to this and not only did they not work, but they offgassed cigarette smoke INTO my car. So, needless to say, I love this product. I am buying one for my husbands car.
