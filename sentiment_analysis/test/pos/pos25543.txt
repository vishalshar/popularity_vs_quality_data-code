For the person or foodie who has everything, this is a great gift.  It's unusual and really works.  It's not that complicated.  Just follow the direction and mushrooms bloom.  Once we harvested the first round, we re-soaked the block and were able to get another bloom.  Instructions make it seem like you need some pretty specific conditions to get the mushrooms to grow.  We just placed the block in the back of the kitchen, away from direct light, and sprayed it with the water bottle (provided) in the morning and evening.  Voila - we had mushrooms.
