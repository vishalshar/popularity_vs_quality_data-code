Let me say right up front, I am an RN who doesn't believe in ADHA medications (or the rate at which they seem to be handed out, like candy, these days) So, when the public school all but demanded our 7 (at the time) y/o grandson be medicated for a disorder he has never been diagnosed with and told us "he may never catch up with his peers," we were both furious and devastated at the same time. We now home school.  We noticed his lack of focus even before pulling him from public school. He's "all boy" with plenty of energy and at times has an issue with impulse control. However, he is not hyperactive, aggressive and doesn't fit many of the other symptoms of ADHA. He has since then been diagnosed with a "processing delay" and nothing else.  We have always been conscious of his diet, limiting sweets, pop & HFCS, which is pretty tough in processed foods. At first, we tried a regular multi-vit. No change in a years time. Then, we saw the "Focus Formula" vitamins and tried those for three months, with little change. After reading some of the reviews, we decided to try "Smarty Pants."  He's been taking them for nearly four months and the change is profound. When even a 9 (nearly 10) y/o says "I can feel the difference when I miss taking them in the morning, Mawmaw" Then CLEARLY they work!! He is more focused with his school work. He is much less improperly impulsive, but retains his active personality. I will buy them two months ahead to be sure we don't run out.  Keep in mind, everyone's body chemistry is different, what works for one may not work for another. BUT, that being said, I would absolutely recommend you try these. We have been home schooling for two years Feb. 2015 and he IS caught up with his peers. He was reading at a first grade entry level in the middle of 2nd grade, in spite of ALL of the schools "interventions." OT, ST, & an IEP, (those of you with special needs children will understand what all of those are) and three of the four years of pre-school. In less then two years, he is reading at grade level, scoring "advanced" on every Math assessment and passed his OAA's with a 401!!  Granted, home school definitely helped him get here but without him being able to focus, I don't know if we could have gotten him this far. These vitamins absolutely help him. I highly recommend giving them a try. They are a bit expensive but IF they work, no price is too high for his (or your child's) future.
