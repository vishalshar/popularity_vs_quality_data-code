These are amazing!  I bought them originally for my grandchildren who do not know how to tie their shoes.  A lot of the tennis shoes they like do not have Velcro fasteners.  These did the trick!  They come in such a variety of colors and go with every type of tennis shoe.  So, since I saw how well they work, I bought myself some.  They absolutely look fabulous on my Nikes!  The only drawback is that they were a little tight in the beginning.  After a few wears they loosened up.  Very easy to put on your shoes.  Much faster than lacing shoe strings.  Now I just grab my shoes and slip them on . . . . . .no more tying!  Great for when you are running out the door.
