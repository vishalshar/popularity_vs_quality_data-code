Discovered the Lash Mask many years ago and just love it. Don't expect this to be a mascara  - it's not. I use it at night to condition and protect my lashes and it looks super - very subtle but adds a little zing to your eyes.  Tip: if you want to give your lashes a break from mascara, or just want a more natural look you can use a lash primer and then add this over to colour your lashes.
