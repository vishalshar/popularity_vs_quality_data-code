I love this stove.  It is sturdy, light, very stable in operation,and flexible in fuel usage.  I bought the Fireant to replace the Esbit fuel table stove because the Esbit is heavy, small, and can only be used with fuel tablets.  The Emberlit Fireant is perfect for fuel tablets when the top tray is in place and you have the option for using wood.  However, the small size of the Fireant makes it less than optimal for using with wood although it is possible.  The Fireant is also too small to use with a Trangia spirit stove.  But overall, the Fireant is perfect for my emergency kit and my BOB.
