This is the most rugged built chair I have ever sat in. I am over 250lbs and this chair fits me like a glove. Tremendous back support, firm side supports and a very comfortable head rest. Only my impatient assembly cost me the two covers on the sides of the back rest, pounding them in was not was as I cracked both with the palm of my hand. This is not a flaw just take your time.
