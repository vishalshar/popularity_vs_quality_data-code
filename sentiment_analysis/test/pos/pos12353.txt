I received the Misfit Shine 2 shortly after its release. I like the styling of the new Shine; thinner, but a bigger and more readable display. This initial release of the product has a inferior band which allow the tracker to fall out. After contacting Misfit the tracker and a new and improved band was receive. The only negative comment is that it would have nice to be compatible with the MisFit Link option.
