This is a brilliant product. I use it with a Weber Genesis three burner grill, and cook with the cover down. With each burner set to half way mark it gets to 800 to 900 degrees in about 20 minutes. It also works well to make a just like being there baguette or to bake chicken pieces or pork chops (use a pre-heated cast iron grill pan.) It replicates high heat, and omni-directional heat radiation, of a professional pizza or bakers oven.The pizza results are dramatically better than using a baker stone in the oven.Some suggestions:- It uses fuel. So have at least half a tank.- Can be cleaned by turning grill to high, with cover down, for  half hour or so.,- I have better results making my own dough than buying dough (Google no-knead pizza dough; adding a little olive oil to recipe and using 00 flour make dough easier to stretch.)- If trying to make just like Italy pizza use a small amount of sauce and few toppings. It cooks at 800 to 900 F in 3 to 4 minutes. If you want a NY style pizza (more sauce and toppings but not to extent of a West Coast open faced cheese sandwich of a pizza) lower temperature (600 to 700 F) and increase cook time to 6 to 8 minutes.- Use flour not corn meal to slide pizza off peel. Corn meal burns at this temperature.- Its a lot easier using a wood peel to launch raw pizza, and a metal peel and long metal tongs to turn (should turn it once half way through cook), and then remove pizza.- Its really hot. A high temperature glove with a long cuff is a useful safety tool. And absolutely needed if you are using a cast iron grill pan to cook something in it (grabbing the handle of a hot cast iron pan with ones bare hand, or even a flimsy oven mitt, is something one should never do, and in any event will do only once.)- IR thermometer is helpful to verify interior oven temperature but not absolutely needed.
