OMG!! where has this stuff been all my life! Yes it is a little on the expensive side but for what it can do and does, its a great product to have!!!I just fixed my dads "TV EARS" with it, they are a wireless head set that is used for watching TV, by people with hearing problems. he is 90 and stubborn as a mule, hates his hearing aids so he'd rather crank the tv as load as it goes.. .lol so we got him the head set which works great but must be made out of recycled soda cup lids or plastic coffee stirring sticks because both "arms" snapped within one year. He used tape to hold them together but it was flimsy and weird looking plus with the thin, as cheaply made as the rest of the thing, wires running through the arms, it was only a matter of time before they broke as well. Enter Sugru! What a life saver. it works perfectly, holds strong and has a lot of flex and support. My only regret was not putting a small piece of wire or paper clip around the arms first, to help hold them stiff, then put the Sugru on over them. I was just afraid that the wire would end up poking through the Sugru over time but... oh well... it was my first ever time using this stuff so I was Naive, forgive me! maybe I will add them later if need be. but for now, this stuff is holding like a champ, I almost want to coat the whole item in Sugru to keep them from ever breaking again... well, I would if Sugru were cheaper...lolnot that im knocking the price. its worth it but it is costly, same as a caddy is worth the price but not everyone can buy one or two or three! If you want quality, you have to pay for it!  lol. Anyhow, Thanks Sugru, I will be looking for more uses in the future! you've made a life long fan!
