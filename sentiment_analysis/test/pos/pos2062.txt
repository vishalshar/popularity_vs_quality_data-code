My kids are 7 and 5 and they loved the Switch Witch. Every morning they had a great time finding where she was hiding. The great thing about her is that they can touch her too (unlike the elves which r we do in our family too). Halloween night they were excited to give her all their unwanted candy and in the morning, they loved her gift to them. This is a great way to get rid of candy!!
