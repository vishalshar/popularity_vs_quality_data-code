I love Anchor Nutrition Bars! I experience motion sickness frequently, when reading in cars, riding on boats and trains (even though I LOVE both trains and boats...definitely puts a damper on my travel experiences!). I've started carrying a bar in my bag and eating it as soon as I feel the first hint of queasiness. Within about 15 minutes, I'm feeling better. I also like the taste and find that it's a good quick energy boost if I'm just feeling hungry or sluggish. I'm looking forward to more flavors! Any plans for something with chocolate?
