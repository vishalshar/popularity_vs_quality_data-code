Extremely well made & well engineered product. And affordable. Purchase price and then monthly service (under $10) makes this product an incredible value. The battery management system gives incredible life to collar unit. I'm getting 2 weeks between charges. I can't say enough good about this product. I read some of the negative reviews and simply can't say I experienced any of the concerns posted by others. This is the real deal.
