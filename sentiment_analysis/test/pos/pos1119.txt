I've been doing endurance events and ultramarathons for over 10 years.  GU and other energy gels appeared to be a necessary evil for energy and electrolytes but they get harder and harder to stomach the longer the race and the harder you are working.  I was getting a lot of gastrointestinal (GI) upset and still getting debilitating calf cramps after about 2 hours of hard exercise.I first tried barnana about 6 months ago and found it not only was easy and relatively pleasant to eat no matter how hard I was working, it also caused no GI distress and my cramps were gone.  Barnana is literally just partially dehydrated banana (which is why it is chewy rather than like the banana chips we all know), so its packed with potassium, which seemed to be just what my body needed to avoid the dreaded calf cramps.  They do look a little odd as they are little brown lumps, but for me, all the other advantages easily exceeded the issue of appearance.I found a full bag is perfect for a marathon - 1 chew each mile from mile 4 to mile 22 and I ran a personal best (almost 30 minutes faster) in December using them.  You can put them in a sandwich bag and there is no mess like you have with the sticky energy gel packets.  Price wise its about the same as doing 4-5 gels in a marathon, so it was a no brainer to switch for me.
