Moov is not any other fitness device out there. It is NOT for people who simply want to simply count their steps or track their sleep. It is much more than that. It is indeed like a personal coach and pushes you to achieve your goals. The biggest advantage it has over any other is it, waterproof and can be worn at all times. The design for strap might be a little flawed, but i'd live with it. I'd highly recommend this poduct
