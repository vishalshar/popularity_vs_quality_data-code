I have to admit, I was skeptical at first. It is a little flimsy feeling, but it is built pretty sturdy. When my puppy becomes a real dog (about 60lbs or more) then my ideas on it may change, but if you live in an apartment on the 3rd floor, this is invaluable for potty training. My puppy was using it fairly reliably in the first 24 hours of coming home with me, but it does take diligence to ensure you are with them every second the first few days. I chose this over the "porch potty" due to its lower price and the porch potty you have to pick up the entire potty to get to the collection pan, where this one the collection pan is easy to just slide out. There are only 2 issues I don't really care for. The collection pan hold about 1 quart. Now, while that is fine for urine collection, you still need to rinse it off every day, and that requires 3-4 quarts to get it pretty clean, so have to pour, wait to drain, empty and repeat 3 more time. The "grass" is very cheap, but it does allow excellent drainage.
