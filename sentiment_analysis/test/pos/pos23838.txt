We have 5 of these in our office as a trial and people love them.  Instead of a mess of wires and adapters, having to use a shared computer or being stuck presenting from a specific seat at the table, people now walk into a room, connect the app and get down to business.  We are looking forward to the ability to extend your desktop to an Airtame (instead of showing only the Primary Display) - when that day comes these will be 5-star devices.  They have been generally trouble-free - in a month I've had to 'reboot' one - and are incredibly simple to use.  Time is money, and these have each paid for themselves already by not wasting 3 or 4 or 10 peoples time trying to get a meeting started.
