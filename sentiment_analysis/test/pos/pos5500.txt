Just replaced my old controller.  The installation was easy and fast.  So far, the new netAQUA is meeting my expectations.  It gives me a complete picture of my watering cycles and allows for aliases to make that picture easier to read.  It also has plenty of options for watering cycles and allowing for slopes.  I told it to use a local weather monitoring station over the Internet to adjust watering as needed.  Our weather doesn't vary much but it will help if it avoids windy mornings.  I'm going to install a rain sensor to further help on the one or to days a year we have a good rain in the early morning (nothing worse than sprinklers going while it's raining and you are in a severe drought).What I like best, besides the software features, is the buttons and screen right on the unit.  I can, if i want, control the unit without any computer connection.  I may never use this interface but I'm glad the option is there with detailed instructions to remind me.  I also like the simple, clean look.I'm looking forward to new software updates.  Features such as historical activity and email alerts would be nice.  The owners have been very responsive to my inquiries so far.  I would recommend this unit without hesitation.
