I bought it for myself, as my Christmas present. When I unwrapped it, my 22 year old granddaughter told me SHE had a Beta that was 'living' in a glass jar! Well I 'surrendered' my present to her and ordered another one (that night) for myself. We read the the instructions and there are so many features that should make this tank easy to maintain. Happy to recommend this to others.
