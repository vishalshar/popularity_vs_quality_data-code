Perfect for my use - I have a 25lb dog, and occasional pet sit my bother in law's 15lb dog. This way when I pet sit I can just clip them both to my regular leash and go for a walk. The adjustable part works well. My dog is well trained to walk on a leash while my brother in law's isn't, so I shorten his side to be right up next to the hook and then give my dog a longer lead. When I tried to walk them on separate leashes I'd always have the one pulling and running back and forth tangling the leashes. He still pulls, but it's much easier to manage with my dog and me both bracing against his pulls and no more tangling of the leash.
