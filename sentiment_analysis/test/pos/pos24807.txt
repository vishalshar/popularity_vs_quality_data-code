I have had the Mis fit shine 2 for about a month now. This was one of the best investments I have ever made. Don't pay attention to the other people out there that say the wrist strap is faulty. If you put the Mis fit in with the action clip correctly it won't fall out. I've also swam with the watch and did dives with the watch on, but the Mis fit shine is still Securey on my wrist.
