After much research, we've found Smarty Pants to provide the most complete and best profile for our 2-year-old (RD best friend even reviewed and gave green light). We love these vitamins.With that being said, my gal has an allergy to strawberry flavoring, so I have to parse through the bottle in order to fish out the yellow and then I spend time trying to decipher between the orange and "red" for the strawberry flavor. Every bottle seems to vary - some are very red and it's easy to distinguish from the orange and some are so close I end up getting rid of close to half of the bottle. Quite expensive to only use 1/3-1/2. I called earlier this year inquiring about single flavor options, and was told they hope to offer by the end of this year - we're still waiting. Just a bottle of orange or yellow would be great! Then men's comes in different flavors - why not the kids too?
