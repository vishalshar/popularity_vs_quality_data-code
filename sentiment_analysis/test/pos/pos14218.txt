I'm hard on toys, I break most everything.  I was really excited to read the reviews of this phone mount and thought if anyone could break it, it's me.  My local mountain biking spot has a lot of trails thru the woods, following a river.  There are tons of downed logs and exposed roots, I've broken several rims over the years.  I've crashed out three times big since I've started using this mount.  Once I hit my pedal on the uphill side of a steep slope which sent me tumbling downhill fast.  I hit a tree with the side of my body and managed to hook the bike with my uphill foot and toss it a good 30' downhill from me.  I lost a shoe, hurt my ribs pretty good and my backpack came completely off.  First thing in my head for some reason was my phone mount, lol.  I went to check on it and it hadn't budged, and the video on my phone was still recording.  I refuse to post it on youtube because I can't explain the little girl/pig noise that came out of me when I hit the tree.  Haha.  I snapped off my front brake lever and twisted the handlebars somehow, but my phone was rock solid.  I've also crashed twice more pretty good since then and it hasn't moved at all.  I'm seriously impressed.  I show and tell everyone I meet about it and I'm sure a dozen more people have ordered them since I got mine.  I've found a weird buzzing noise during filming video when moving fast, it's not wind or bike noise, and doesn't appear to be vibrations.  Best I can figure is it may have something to do with the magnets?  If I ever figure it out, I'll post up a followup review.  Until then, music over videos!  Buy this product, you won't regret it.
