It's a great thing, to have on a keychain.  I backed their indiegogo and this is a redesign (probably to make it truly MFI).  I bought this while I was waiting for them to upgrade me, and it was great, but after a month or two the key began to pry apart.Great thing is that nomad has a GREAT support team Chloe! She cross shipped me a replacement key free of charge!
