I purchased a number of these to use with Amazon Echo.  It works perfectly.  I am able to say Alexa, turn on kitchen lights... and boom they turn on.In respect to the WeeMoo switches they are very easy to install... just follow the instructions or reference the Youtube video on Belkins channel.I had some of the older style belkin weemoo plug in switches that would sometimes drop connection to wifi.  I am pleased to report these new switches do not (at least for me) suffer from this issue.
