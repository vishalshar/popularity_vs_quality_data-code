This stuff is INCREDIBLE.I have suffered from hyperhidrosis since puberty (almost 20 years ago) and have EASILY tried 50 different deodorants in this awkward and self-conscious-about-sweating adult lifetime. There have been a few over the counter deodorants that were okay, but all else have FAILED. MISERABLY. When people claim to have a "clinical strength" product, they obviously have never met anyone with a sweating problem. The only other product that has completely resolved my problem is the prescription stuff - the chemical infested, seemingly acidic deodorant that burns your armpits. Which was something I dealt with at one point in time until I wisened up. (Sweating sucks, you guys!)I began using natural product after natural product, and while yes some worked okay, I still marched on in my deodorant quest...until finding THIS PRODUCT. As mentioned before, this stuff is incredible! I approached Primal Pit Paste with my normal amount of hesitation, and it went above and beyond to show me something could actually work! Not only does it keep me almost mostly dry throughout a normal day, but it keeps me SMELLING GOOD! I've had a couple of times where I've felt like I needed a refresher, so I just applied a little more and any unwanted scent went away. With other deodorants to be effective I would need to clean my armpits first and then reapply.This is 100%, without a doubt the best, most effective deodorant I've ever used. (Next to the bad prescription stuff.) Without hesitation, I would recommend this product to anyone with or without a sweating problem. It smells great (lavender), work's great, and doesn't stain your clothes. Also, I've found it's most effective to rub in the product slightly beyond where you think your underarms end.Buy this product! Give them your money! It really works!THANK YOU, PRIMAL PIT PASTE!
