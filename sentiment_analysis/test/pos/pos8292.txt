I had been looking for a while to find a filament that could withstand the heat inside of my truck during these summer months and this finally did it. I followed the manufacturers instructions to heat treat it and it came out really well. I did notice that while heat treating it started to finally curl up on me just slightly. Not a big deal becaus what I was printing was roughly 6"x3" and I allowed some tolerance because something around that size generally would curl up. I will admit that I thought it would stay clear, or become more clear when heat treating. This was not true, it actually became more foggy inside. I still like it. I had an LED underneath and was still able to see it glowing slightly which was what I was going for.
