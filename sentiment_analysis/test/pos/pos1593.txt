This new air purifier works wonderfully in our large master bedroom.  Neither of us have any sinus congestion or problems when we wake up after a night's sleep.  I thoroughly researched other HEPA air purifiers before making my decision and could not be happier.  I could have purchased one that was equivalent in quality for several hundred dollars more, but why waste the money.  This is a great and very efficient air purifier.
