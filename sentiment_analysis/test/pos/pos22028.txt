My 11 year old son has been wanting a VR headset ever since my daughter bought a Viewmaster one. I was a little on the fence about whether or not to spend close to $100 on it when I saw many others for less. But I'm more than happy with the product and my son loves it.Pros:LightweightComfortableEasily adjustableMade of flexible material so getting devices in and out is easy.Phones fit without having to remove the case that is on your phone.Opening for augmented reality appsAnother opening to allow for the use of headphones.Great protection for device if it's dropped.2 buttons for use in games.Adjustable to each users eyes.Fits with glasses on.Cons:Only available in purple. (At first my son was thrown off by the purple, but once he and his friends began using it, the color did matter)Concerns:The flexible, foam-rubber-like material is great for getting your phone in and out and comfort but I'm wondering how long it will actually hold up to all of the stretching and pulling.Overall we are very happy with the product and I feel the money was well spent. It has already produced hours of fun that the whole family can enjoy.
