Pretty amazing..I have managed to crash it a couple of times but is somehow survived...This drone is pretty much idiot proof but Autel didn't count on me...I have learned...Flies great. Pics are steady and pure....If you don't to anything stupid, it's hard to crash...Always allow ample room to land on a flat surface..Always return at enough height to keep it out of trees...Keep your checkbook ready if you have to hire a tree trimmer to retrieve it...Was 250 for me..Although expensive, it was a good lesson for me..Love it..Love it...
