Misleadingly advertised as the size of a credit card. This is actually smaller than a credit card and doesn't fit my wallet. If it was the same dimensions  (L x H, depth isn't a critical dimension) of a credit card than this would be a winner.Update: To clarify, my wallet is the DM1 by Decadent Minimalist. It's a minimalistic designed wallet designed to hold only credit cards. Since the gocomb isn't the size of a credit card it doesn't quite meet my needs. I can fit the comb between the other credit cards in my wallet but it's not ideal. I completely understand that I'm in the minority of customers that don't use a traditional wallet.As for the comb function itself, I absolutely love it. The comb is coated which makes the teeth of the comb very comfortable on your skin and hair. The card is also thin which helps with the feel of the teeth as well. The honeycomb patterning on the side of the comb helps give a nice grip in your hand. If the size was right for me then this would easily be a 5 star product!I would also like to add that the owner/designer, Heather Burkman, reached out to me to discuss why I this card did not fit my wallet. It was a delightful conversation and I appreciate the quick response and dedication that she had to work with customers to understand the end use of her product. I'm all the more happy to support such a company and appreciate the other design elements of this comb. For me the biggest issue was the size (I guess size does matter, ha!). If a new design comes out with the same dimensions as a credit card, I'll be the first one to purchase it!
