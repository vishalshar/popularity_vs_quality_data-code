im impressed with this little device, I only have one con: It won't if in my phone with the case on so every time I need to use it I have to take the case off. There are several modes to choose from, you can switch between thermal and actual views with the swipe of a finger just keep in mind the thermal mode uses the device lens while the actual view uses the phone's lens for picture while using the device lens for temperature reading so when up close in actual view don't use the pointer on the screen but instead point the device at what you want to measure. The thermal view has a bit of a narrowed or zoomed view and its sometimes difficult to determine what you're looking at especially when there's not much of varying degrees. Other than that it's great. I initially got it to check the temperature of grow lights on the leaves in my garden but the possibilities are endless
