I'm giving this 4 stars for now only due to a broken plastic cover piece on the side of the chair.  I've left a message with Rapid X at their Facebook page regarding this.....and am awaiting a resolution.  A replacement piece for one they will make me purchase.  Full disclosure-- I'm the one that broke this piece during installation.  I WAS following the directions.  Both the paper copy and the youtube video Rapid X has posted.  I feel this piece should not have broken and maybe should be easier to install.BUT....I didn't buy the chair for aesthetics....at least not entirely.  I bought this chair so my hours long gaming sessions didn't leave me with a sore back and half asleep legs.  So far this baby fits the bill!  I've only used this chair for one gaming session of 5 hours.....but man what a diffence from my old office chair.  Once you make this chair your own with the numerous adjustments possible....you may find, as I have, that it's the most comfortable chair you've ever had.  I've always been a fan of the over-cushiony office chair.  This one is not that.  It's firm....but very comfortable.  I left my 5 hour gaming session feeling relaxed and not sore.  This chair fits the bill.  I have a pretty low desk at home......and the lowest height setting of 13 inches is optimum.  I picked the Brown/Black chair.....I'm pretty conservative....and those colors were perfect.  I could easily take this chair to work and replace my provided  $1000+ office chair....and be mucho happier.....but I need it for gaming.......and can't afford two right now!  I will add....this chair is badass looking.I was a bit concerned by a previous review I found here on Amazon.  Someone said that the seat area was too narrow.  I disagree.  I'm 5'9" and 180 lbs.  I found the seat to fit me quite comfortably....and with room to spare.  I could probably gain another 20-30 lbs and would still fit comfortably in this chair.  The chair itself is max rated at 265 lbs.Assembly was pretty easy....except for the plastic side covers as mentioned earlier.  I was able to put it together by myself very easily.  It took me about 30 minutes.....but I read all the directions and watched the youtube video first...just to make sure I wouldn't mess it up.  Mission (almost) complete).The lumbar and head cushions are going to take some getting used to.  I messed a bit with the placement on my first 5 hour gaming session with the chair.....and am pretty sure I won't be taking either of them off the chair.  My body thanks me for the extra support for sure!  But it will take some time to get used to I'm thinking.I would rate the quality of this chair at an 8.5 out of 10.  By far the best chair I've ever had for gaming.  This chair is only bested by chairs in the $1000+ price range.  The materials seem to be quality and well put together.I plan to update this review when I get some heavy hours of game-time sitting in this thing under my belt.Right now....I highly recommend this chair!EDIT (5 Jan 2017):  I'm up-ing my rating on this chair from a 4 star to 5 star.  I messaged RAPID X via their facebook page regarding the broken side cover piece.  Within an hour of my message they responded that they would send me out a replacement that very day.....no charge.  It is rare to find customer service so responsive and accommodating these days.  When I find a good company that stands behind their product.....I become a life-long customer.  I'm looking forward to Rapid X's next generation of chairs....although I think it will be hard to improve on this one.  5 stars for a 5 star company with a 5 star product.
