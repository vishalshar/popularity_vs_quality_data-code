My dachshund loves this! There are a couple of issues- After 15-20 minutes use, the ball will get stuck and my dachshund will knock it over *which means any one of us can get pelted with the ball). The balls are cheaply made and expensive but the Kong minis seem to actually work better in the IFetch anyway so I will buy those. If anyone has had an issue with there dog rolling the whole machine around and has found a solution to what I call Russion-IFetch-Roulette, please let me know! Other than that, it has brought hours of entertainment to my weiner dog and us!
