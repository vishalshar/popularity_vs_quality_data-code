Only one week into this, but as a VALUE, the recent sale price was too much to say no to.  And I dId need a new phone after losing my old "new" phone (1 week, duh).The modern stylish look and feel I like.  Rectangle is cool.  Got a great case, too.PHONE Part - Callers to me are crisp and clear.  They report I sound good as well.With the 6.01, all actions feel "snappy" and quick.Battery life, so far, is more than a full day.  Pleased.I am disappointed in the available Documentation online.  As in there isn't any.  Yes, the obligatory marketing Quick Start guides, but I want to know about Everything.  I hate the click and peck and go back trial and error electronics user method.  For example, the Camera.  How do you work the camera?  I dunno.Regardless, will update this in a while. At the price, very pleased.
