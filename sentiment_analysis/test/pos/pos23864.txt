I received this for Christmas and have used it almost a dozen times for various workouts. I chose the wahoo because my sister in law has one and I really liked that she was able to know how far  we ran and how many calories she had burned based on her stats (heart rate, height, weight, etc.)  I workout 6 days a week running, spin classes, strength workouts, and general cardio workouts. I really wanted a device that would give me accurate feedback for all types of workouts. The wahoo is nice because you can track all different types of workouts and record them per the type of workout you are doing. The wahoo takes your personal stats for height, weight, and age places them in the software and calculates your target heart rate for maximum workout potential on different levels per your need/desire. It is great to see exactly what I am getting out of my workout based on my heart rate, distance, time etc. The wahoo records your workouts and saves them to a grid that allows you to see how many days you have worked out that month. The instructions that are included in the box are a little over simplified and make it slightly difficult to set up the wahoo. I downloaded the app to my Android phone and tried to use technology intuition to navigate to the app. However, there are a few tiny things buried in the software that allow the TickerX to track specific workouts and unless you know to go into the app in a certain area and sync every type of workout you have chosen, the TickerX will not track/record any of your data. (FYI: open the wahoo fitness app, click on the sync icon on top, choose your saved device, go down to profiles click on the pencil or edit icon, check every box next to the workout(s) you want to track and click ok. Your wahoo will now record data for the workouts you previously added to your profile by opening the wahoo fitness app and clicking on the icon that looks like walking man, clicking the add icon and choosing the workouts you enjoy).  I did call the company and got this and several other questions answered with ease, but more intuitive software would be nice. The only other small issue is that I have a small chest and even with the strap at its tightest it wants to slide off during my more intense HIIT workouts, so I tuck it under my sports bra and it is no longer an issue. Other than that the payoff is great. I just snap it on and start my workout. It is nice that I do not have to wear a wrist type tracker and I do not have to keep it on all day. I do wear a fitbit zip to count steps, but I rely on the wahoo for true workout results. It is comfortable to wear with no pinching or irritation no matter how sweaty I get!
