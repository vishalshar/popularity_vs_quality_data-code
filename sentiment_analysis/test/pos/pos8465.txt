For a brief period of time, I ended up with a rose gold iPhone that I bought from a friend, though the pinkish color of the device was not exactly to my tastes.  I searched far and wide for a case that oozed masculinity, and uniqueness, while offering good protection - my search ended here.  For the most part, I loved this case!  It felt (no pun intended) great in the hand, covered up most of the phone's back and sides, and I received many a compliment while using it.  I'm a bit weird, as I tend to keep my devices in fun, colorful socks to protect them from...  whatever.  This one ended up in a pink SpongeBob sock (don't judge me).  The case had a tendency to attract lint from that sock, leaving little pink fuzzballs behind, and would probably do the same with pocket lint, or whatever other type of lint you tend to generate where you keep your device.  I'd just pick them off, but over time, the felt on the case itself began to fray, turning itself into a knotted up affair.  The once smooth felt on the case, now was rather bumpy, which did not feel sexy in the hand at all.  Please note however that this is expected wear according to F?Z Designs, as the case has a break-in period.  They advise that the knots should just be pulled off during this period, and that should be the end of them.  I ended up using a lint shaver to get rid of the knots, and though it worked well enough, it was just never as great as it was when new.  This all took place over a period of maybe three weeks - I really loved the case initially, but would probably think twice before picking it up again.
