I spend a lot of time in my car, which means I am frequently trying to find meals on the go. There have been several times when I've picked up something from a grocery store in an effort to avoid burger chains, only to realize I have no way to eat it. Enter GoBites. These things are AMAZING. To start, I'm a sucker for things having their own cases. This makes it easier to locate them in my bag, and prevents the items themselves from becoming damaged by the other things in there. The case itself has cutouts for the utensils that hold them into place. It's very sturdy although I'm sure it would break if you stood on it - but why would you do that??As far as the strength/usefulness of the utensils, they are awesome. The knife actually cuts and the spoon and fork are very durable. I haven't tried cutting a steak with the knife, but I have no doubt it'd work.All in all, this is one of those products that you don't realize you need until you see it on here and think of 100 times it would've come in handy. I like knowing that I have it and don't have to search for cheap plastic cutlery when I'm on the road. I keep this set in my bag, and am considering ordering another to keep in my travel bag for the nights I order takeout in a hotel. I could also see these coming in handy if you're going on a road trip with children and want to bring snacks that require utensils.Seriously, buy them, you don't be sorry.
