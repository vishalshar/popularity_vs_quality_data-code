BRIGHT! Really lights up my face when using Hangouts or Skype from my laptop, and doesn't seem to mute the built-in mic too much even though it covers it (Acer Chromebook 14).  The light swivels 180 degrees, from straight down to straight up, and has two light levels: really bright and I'M BLIND.  I picked up a 4"x 6" pouch to carry it in (it doesn't come with one), and it and the micro-USB charge cord fit the small bag perfectly.  Fits the top of the Chromebook screen perfectly, but it's non-adjustable--it may not fit thicker screens or phones.  Opening is 3/8" wide, if it was adjustable it'd be perfect across the board.  As it is, it's a good, solid 4 stars and if it dies I'll buy it again.  It does have a non-scratch surface inside the mounting bracket, which is a nice touch.
