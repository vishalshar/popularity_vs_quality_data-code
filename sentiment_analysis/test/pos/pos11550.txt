Don't normally write reviews, only when a product is really good or really bad. Just got this today, and have flown it as many times as possible. Amazing drone, amazing camera, this blows DJI out of the water. This beats all competition on every point, especially price. Great purchase, would recommend.Have gotten up to about 34 mph consistently, and get about 23-25 minutes of battery life. Everything works flawlessly, plus you've gotta love the blaze orange.Will follow up in several months after more use.
