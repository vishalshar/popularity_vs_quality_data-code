I have had a hellish time sleeping due to my medical history. I was rarely able to fall asleep easily, never slept through the night, and woke up exhausted.I have a cal-king sized ghost bed now and it was the best choice I've made for myself in my life. I can sleep less, feel more rested, fall asleep quickly and stay asleep. I'm sleeping better new than when I was a teenager. It was worth every penny.
