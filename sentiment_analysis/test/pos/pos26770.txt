Works great! The instructions are a little broad (which can only be found online), but most will be able to figure out if not there is a lot of information on their message boards within the app. Note, I highly recommend purchasing additional reflective tape (can be found on Amazon for about $4.00). There reflective tape provided is quite small. I have had a slight issue with the laser dot staying in the little spot as mine seems to have a slight drift (completely tighten and secure), so I purchased the extra tape and made about a 6"X6" section. This helps with any drift, and have not had any issues with it since this has been done. I no longer get yelled at by the wife when I forget to close the garage in the morning. Just set the app to remind me after 10 minutes of being open. If I forget I get an alert and just close the garage through the App.
