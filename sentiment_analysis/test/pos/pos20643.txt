Overall, I'm happy with this product in general.  It could stand some improvements, much of which could be made to the app.  I've had this product for about a month now.Pro's:*  Installation and setup was easy and didn't take very long at all.*  The app itself is very intuitive and would be easy for most people with limited technical know-how to operate.*  The quality of the light fixture is very good. Actual frosted glass for the shade and not plastic.*  Perfect for those in an apartment/rental type situation, where you may not be able to/want to deal with pulling cables and drilling holes through walls as you would most likely have to do for a traditional wired/locally recorded security camera setup.*  Image quality is pretty good at 720p.*  Settings are simple, yet flexible, with the ability to schedule when the light turns on and off, whether to only turn on the light when motion is detected and either only at night or anytime.*  Ability to share access with others if desired.*  The alarm, pre-recorded messages and ability to speak to visitors is a nice feature*  The camera is very inconspicuous.  Especially at distance, you wouldn't know it has a camera.  My neighbors pass by this light several times a day and I don't think they have realized there's a camera.*  You can zoom in to quadrants of the live video feed, but the image tends to pixilate quite a bit, especially at night.Con's:*  The app could use more work/features.  It can be buggy when it sends a notification to your phone that it has detected motion.  You seem to have to wait until the camera stops recording to view what's going on.  You can view the animated thumbnail summary, but actually trying to look at the full-screen live view or recording while the camera is actively recording an event, results in an error that the recording can't be viewed or you get the spinning wheel you see when the app is trying to process information. (using Samsung Galaxy S5, Android ver. 5.1.1).*  The fact that you can only access this camera through an app on your phone is very limiting.  There really should be an ability to login via Web browser to a portal where you can view recordings/live feed/manage the device, particularly if you are paying for their cloud storage service.*  The option To locally record to your PC would be a nice feature to have, particularly if Kuna happens to end support in the future for older models or something happens to the company, at least you would still conceivably be able to continue using this without having to rely on Kuna's services/success.*  No ability to record your own messages, only three pre-recorded messages are available at this time.*  The alarm is stated to be 100 dB, but it really doesn't sound that loud to me.  This could just be due to the location I have it and possibly the stucco absorbing some of the sound.  Not really a big deal for me.*  I've noticed the motion sensor can be a little erratic on detection.  I may just need to find the right sensitivity settings, but I did notice false detection on a partly cloudy day where the sun would poke through.  It seems as if the motion sensor picked up on shadows cast on the wall/ground. And I'm fairly certain it has missed a couple of valid motion detections.*  Night recording is limited.  The light helps out, depending on placement and environment, it works for me but maybe not for others.  There is no IR night vision mode or anything.  That's a limitation that Kuna should seek to improve in future products.*  The app doesn't appear to be updated regularly in the Google Play store, but I've had this for a fairly short amount of time.*  I'm not sure what frequency the wireless operates on, but it's a bit of a security concern for me.  2.4 GHz is vulnerable to being blocked, but the likelihood of a common criminal having the know-how to disrupt the camera's connection is low.*  You can't zoom in to a recorded event.  Perhaps it is possible if you download it to a PC that has a video editing suite, but I imagine you would lose quality.Other Thoughts:*  Reading a review from PC Magazine, the reviewer noted that he had occasional loss of connection to his wireless network.  I've only had one instance so far.  I realize there are many variables at play here, including distance from the wireless router/access point, the quality of the router being used or crowded frequencies/channels or other sources of interference.*  If you are a home owner or have permission from your property manager, in the case that you rent, you might want to consider a more robust, traditional security camera system.  There are many out there that are comparable in price, but may have more advantages: More cameras, better video quality, on-site recording, night vision, more security (wired v. wireless) and flexibility with how data is stored and accessed.Conclusion:*  Despite its limitations, this solution works well for me.  Time will tell whether this has longevity.
