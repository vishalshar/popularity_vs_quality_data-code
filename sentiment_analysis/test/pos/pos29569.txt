It works while your bluetooth is turned on but shows up as a keyboard input on u have to turn that off each time you connect if you want to use your qwerty keyboard. One other problem is that having bluetooth on all day drains battery which is not helpful in the everyday struggle of keeping charged. Overall I thinks it's a good multifunction tracking tool but is cumbersome because of the different settings you must change to use it each time you connect. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
