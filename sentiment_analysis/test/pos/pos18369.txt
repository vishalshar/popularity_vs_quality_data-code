I had side by side, the peachtree DEEPBLUE2 and the marshall WOBURN, to choose as a present.I like a home stereo HiEnd equ for many years, from Accuphase class A to tubes, 421AWE, 2A and 300B, I have a Margules, MBL 120 and Genesis speakers, with no more words I am inside HiFi.Mi wife wanted a portable speaker for the iphone. I wanted to use my ears and experience to choose one that I liked at least. I finished in the peachtree and the marshall Woburn.1) Marshall apareance is beautifull, controls and the aux cable is like a guitar amp, lovely lovely lovely. Peachtree is simple, modern with a bulky shape, clean lines withouth class, simple and unatractive.2) The peachtree speaker can be moved for my wife, its rather heavy but easy to move.  Marshall Woburn is heavy, my wife did not like to move it, the speaker is bigger and more obtrusive.3) Marshall woburn is louder a bit, 110db before distortion at 1m distance vs 105 with the peachtree. Personally my wife dont need a max volumen to play with it.4) The peachtree has more fine detail in the presentation of the accoustic music, with the voices, with symphonic music, jazz, pop , world music, progresive rock ald folk. The heavy metal as loud as you want sound better in the marshall Woburn. Electronic music is a mix, because Marshall guives more contrast in the sounds, and the peachtree guives much more spatial and 3D movement and distribution of the sound, more silky and alive.5)Actually Peachtree is 400 USD, Woburn is 600USD a .50× more.My wife and me decided for the Peachtrçee Deepblue2. As far as I Know the music in one box only sound good with tubes and horns. If I wanted more sound to fill a big, big room, I would decide for a pair of wireless speakers instead of one, and in this field you have very good options for the same price as the Ruark M1, Dynaudio or Paradigm.Peachtree is lovely, bulky but you can move it rather easy, the sound is the best that I know in single box wireles at afordable price, not to elegant but you can live with. And the most important the sound is natural.
