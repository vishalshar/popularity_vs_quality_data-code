THE GOOD: Fizzics turns your store bought beer into a surprisingly capable imitation of draft beer without needing a keg or a gas cartridge. It's lightweight, portable, and compatible with a variety of bottles, cans and growlers.THE BAD: Some beers, particularly sweet ones, taste better after the Fizzics treatment, but the way it smooths carbonation and brings out the malty flavors hurts the complexity of hoppy beers.THE BOTTOM LINE: Fizzics isn't for everybody, especially beer drinkers that value bitterness and don't want to alter the way their beer tastes. For those who enjoy experimenting and value a smooth mouthfeel, a creamy head, or a sweet flavor profile, it's a fun gadget that's easy to use and not overly costly.
