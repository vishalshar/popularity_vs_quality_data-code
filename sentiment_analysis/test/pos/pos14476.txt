This steel griddle is on my gas stovetop or in the oven. It is transfers heat well for eggs, pancakes, bacon, steaks, burgers, hash fries, etc etc. It can be supplemented with a press, or a dome to add to complexity of certain tasks. You control the quality and then easy to clean, re-oil and always ready. Add liquid additives carefully and in the spot needed, not making everything a stew.  Much better than a teflon or cast iron pan. Trough around edge is good for controlling excess grease. Paper towel wipes excess. Only issue is splatter so do try to be careful! Yes it is better than a stone for pizza, so be prepared for reorders as they are smaller diameter.
