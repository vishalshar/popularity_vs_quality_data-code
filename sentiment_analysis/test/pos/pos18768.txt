I've been using this on my road bicycle for a couple of weeks, and I'm generally pleased.  I use it to hold my iPhone 5s.  The adjustment feature should permit its use with a variety of phone sizes.  Placing or removing the phone from the unit is easy.  Permits an unobstructed view of the screen while riding, and I can hear the verbal GPS route instructions.  Reasonably easy to securely mount on the handlebars.  Comes with a couple of different inserts to accommodate different diameter handlebars.  When properly tightened, holds your phone securely and bumpy roads will not dislodge it.  However, you have to be careful to fully tighten the clamps around the phone, or bumpy roads will send your phone flying.  I wouldn't trust this for mountain bike use without some sort of back-up, like a couple wraps with a bungie cord.  The unit is all plastic, which will probably eventually crack and fail, but at this price point I wouldn't expect otherwise.  Main clamping unit easily unhooks from the base mount, so you can avoid exposing it to the elements/theft when the bike is parked.
