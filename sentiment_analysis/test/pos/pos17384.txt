Brushing my teeth is a nightmare as a woman with Asperger's Syndrome, which I exhibit tactile sensation issues. Most of the toothpastes on the market from my school days were so rough, it felt like sandpaper with a coarse grit.This was originally chosen for its flavor as I don't like mint or cinnamon flavors and I have been trying various things.I would buy this product again once I run low.
