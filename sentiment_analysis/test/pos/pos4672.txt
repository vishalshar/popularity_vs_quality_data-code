Used it on a 13 hour flight. It worked pretty well. I didn't sleep deep, but I was able to sit in my seat relatively comfortably the entire time and sleep.Then a few months later used it 2 nights in a row to reset my sleep schedule after travel and it worked well. Will definitely use again when traveling.
