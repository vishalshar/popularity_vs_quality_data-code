This is a review for the Royole-X mobile theater. I saw this on some online article ever since it was announced at CES 2016, which piqued my interested and I took the plunge after seeing all the positive reports. I received this in the mail a few weeks ago and have been using it quite extensively since then, including on a trip to Hawaii.The Royole-X is an interesting consumer electronics product. It is a highly personalized, and takes a little bit of fiddling to get the eye-piece to fit intimately over your face - you have to make sure that the headband is not too long or too short. If you do everything correctly, you wouldnt feel the weight of it at all on your nose or on your face - all the weight should fall on top of your head. This means that if someone else wants to use it, they'd have to take some time to adjust it, which is fine with me, because I don't intend to share it with anyone else anyway. Like I said, this is a highly personal piece of equipment.I must admit, at first I was a little skeptical about putting OLED displays right in front of my face. I'm a tech junkie so I've tried a bunch of different VR/AR products such as Oculus and Avegant Glyph, and they've always given me headaches and made me feel super uncomfortable. But the Royole-X is something different: I took it with me on a 5 hr plane trip to Hawaii and watched two movies and not once did I feel my eyes hurting or dizzy. The manufacturer put in a lot of effort into designing the Royole-X for optimal viewing experience and ergonomics, and the result really shows. It's not just the OLED display, but also the way they've designed the headband, the eyepiece, everything. Some similar products I've tried have this nose-bridge that sits right on top of your nose (like what you'd see on a pair of glasses, which is what the Glyph uses) and it's super heavy and super uncomfortable. I believe the way Royole-X uses a piece of cushion to sit on top of your face is the best possible way of achieving comfort in near-eye displays.The display itself is phenomenal. It's a very super high quality AMOLED display and the colors are incredible. I saw some review below complaining it's a little small, I think it's just about the right size. It's about as big as going into the movie theaters and sitting in the back rows - just the way I like it. Again, to each his/her own.I also cannot speak enough good words about the sound quality. These are really high quality and high fidelity headphones that comes with the Royole-X, and comparable to a lot of the audiophile-grade headphones I've owned from like Sennheiser and such.The product comes with 16GB internal storage - something I havent had much of a chance to make use of. I prefer to download movies from like iTunes and stuff and watch on my Apple device, so I usually make use of an HDMI adapter and connect straight into the Royole-X's HDMI jack. The manual claims to support several different connectivity options which I will probably get around to checking out in the near future.In summary: this is the best solution for watching movies on the go, especially on long plane rides. And the best part: those pesky next-seat neighbors on my flight would never be able to spy on what I am watching ever again.
