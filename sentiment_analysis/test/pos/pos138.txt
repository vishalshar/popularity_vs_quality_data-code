I live in Miami, FL and was looking for a toner to wipe out impurities that accumulate on my face throughout the day from the constant sweat (Miami is humid as hell!). I came across this item and bought it first for its look but boy what a product! It is very refreshing and you can feel the action of the witch hazel! It also has cucumber in it, which is one of my personal favorite skincare ingredients. Great pick!
