Preliminary review (two days in):Packaging:You have no hope of re-boxing this for a return. The factory must have spent as much labor in packaging as making the toy. It's one of those packings there every part of the toy has been tied to the cardboard backing by hand. Overall, you have to destroy the packaging to unpack it. Apart from preventing people from unboxing it in a store, I think this is done so that you cannot return it.Quality:There were marks--minor visual defects--on the robot and the remote control. Given the above, I am confident that these were from the factory and not because this toy had been returned previously. In other words, this toy looked used, in terms of finish, right out of the box. Again, this all seemed cosmetic, but this is an expensive toy. I've seen better quality control from much cheaper toys.Robotics and general use:Remote control use is limited by line of sight. In other words, you (especially kids) need to point the remote quiet close to the robot's face (where sensor is located) to make it move.I bought the toy for a 6 year-old who was desperate for a remote control robot. When he unwrapped the birthday present, it was like his dream came true. However, play didn't last very long at all. Maybe he will come around to it, but we spent 30 minutes learning the remote and what the robot could do, and that was about it on Day 1. He hasn't learned everything it can do, and he is probably too young or impatient to program it yet, but he played longer with a domino game. Again, I'm skeptical about the value for the money.I'm sure we will get some more hours of fun out of this toy. Right now, the favorite thing is the "dance" command, and watching the robot boogie to a version of "You Spin Me." However, I think Robosapien will be collecting dust on the shelf before too long.
