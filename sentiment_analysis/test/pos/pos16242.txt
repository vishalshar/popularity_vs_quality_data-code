I got this after a friend and real estate agent told me she had a rather frightening encounter with a viewer during an open house.  While she wasn't assaulted, she was afraid.  I ordered her this alarm along with mace.  I know it is fail-proof, but a deterrent indeed.I was please with the loudness of the alarm and it make a unique chirping and loud sound that it's not like other alarms most people would ignore.  It would at least startle someone.  The strap was a little disappointing as it is too tight for an average wrist but the alarm itself works great and I highly recommend it especially for kids, runners and people outdoors who may need to startle someone and get passersby attention,It's too bad it appears to be disposable, I would have liked to have the option of changing the battery.Overall I am very pleased, it is loud, makes a unique alarm sound, isn't going to go off willy-nilly and is small enough to carry easily and discretely.  I think they should add a light too, just for added notice-ability.
