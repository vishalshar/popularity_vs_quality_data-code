I really considered getting a Mophie but I hated how bulky it was. I also didn't like carrying a portable charger everywhere. ThinCharge was the solution.I can spend all day at Disneyland and still have power when I get home.I'm also super clumsy and drop my phone A LOT and I only have one crack towards the top of my phone.My ONLY complaint is that the top part slips off easily. I had to buy a new case after losing the top part of the case. It was ONLY worth it because I went to the actual company website and used their 15% off first purchase coupon.
