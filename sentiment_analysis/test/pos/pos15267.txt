I have been setting up my "home automation" system (AKA playing around) and have tried a few products.  I purchased this LIFX bulb through Amazon and it arrived very well packaged and has worked well for me.  I only have one LIFX bulb at this point.  I feel it is a 5-star bulb at a 3-star price with a 2- star app.  However, the automation experience is improved and the app becomes less relevant by integrating with the 3rd party app IFTTT.I have the light being controlled with the switches and sensors from my z-wave system attached to a SmartThings box through the app IFTTT.  Once I figured out the IFTTT app, automation was easy and straight forward so I give an overall rating of 4-stars.SET UP:I downloaded the LIFX app and screwed the bulb into my light socket.  I have it in a recessed ceiling fixture that is large enough to accept a BR40 bulb.  I followed the simple instructions and the light paired with my Wi-Fi network and worked.  I had to provide the Wi-Fi password and the light was discovered right away.With the app I was able to change color, brighten/dim, turn it on and off, etc.  I did not find the controls on the app intuitive.  There is a circular graphic with graduations and shading (whites) or colors and I wanted to just point to the color I wanted, or slide my finger to the color I wanted, but the app does not seem to work that way.  It is like there is a slider and anywhere in the circle you touch, you grab the slider and move it around.  I eventually just moved my finger around the circle and watched the light change color to figure out what I wanted.  It is clearer on the color wheel.  From box to changing colors it was just a few minutes and that is nice.The light turns on quickly at full brightness when the wall switch is turned on (not a soft start).  Compared to the overhead spot lights (BR-40) this bulb is quite small.  It is shorter than the bulb that I removed and I had to adjust the arm in the top of the can light so that the bulb set lower in the housing (more toward the floor) so the light was not too far recessed into the housing.  There is a gap around the light which is probably good from a function standpoint in that there is more cooling possible.  It does not look as "finished" as the bulb that I removed.Overall setup was fine.  The app leaves room for improvement, but I review that separately.  Instructions were good and so 5-stars for the setup.LIGHT PERFORMANCE:Without considering the automation or the app interface, all of which can be changed later by the manufacturer, I was interested to consider just the bulb and light.  I am comparing it to the Philips 432690 Hue Personal Wireless Lighting BR30 Single Bulb, Frustration Free which I use in eight locations throughout the house.  All my Hue bulbs are BR30 bulbs used in recessed "can lights".  Immediately, I noticed how much brighter the LIFX was than the Hue.  I do not consider the Hue to be bright enough for the 65 Watt rating that Phillips gives it.  The LIFX was nice and bright.  To me, the Hue is similar to a 50 Watt incandescent light while the LIFX is similar to a 75 Watt light.Lumen is a different way to measure light output than what most people are accustomed to.  If you are interested, there are some nice articles that you can search for.  Lumen is the measure of the total light emitted and is adjusted for how your eye perceives that light.  A spot light that directs all the light into a small area will appear brighter than the same amount of light (lumen) from a light that shines in all directions.  I like the performance of the LIFX bulb in that it illuminates the area below the light very well, but seems to spread the light out quite a bit so a large area is illuminated.  I had to adjust the blub so that the light emitting part of the bulb was recessed about 1 inch up into the housing.  If it was recessed more than that, it looked too much like a spot light.The color performance of the bulb seems superior to the Hue bulb.  This is very evident in the green tones.  The Hue bulb fails to provide a good green color.  The blue and red tones were similar, but the brighter LIFX bulb seemed richer in color.  I do not think the color was any different, but because the color is projected with high intensity over a larger area, it looked better in my service.  I prefer the yellow based colors in the Hue bulb to the LIFX bulb.The one area that the hue bulbs seemed to outperform the LIFX is in the various "white" colors.  This may be an app "problem" as much as anything, but I think the yellow tones on the Hue bulb are better than the LIFX.  This was noticeable when testing the color ranges, but it seemed to really show up when trying to mimic the various color temperatures with the two bulbs.  The Hue bulbs are excellent at replicating the yellow/orange morning sunlight right through to the normal daylight and into the intense sunlight you might get when surrounded by snow and bright blue sky.  My hue bulbs start the morning with a soft light and get "cooler" in color as the day moves on.  The lights in the ceiling of the two story entry turn to daylight or blue daylight in the middle of the day and it almost seems like I have a skylight in the ceiling.The LIFX bulb was able to produce tinted light, but it seemed fake or unnatural in some way.  The cooler (blue) tones seemed better, but the soft light that you might want to read from is not as comforting.  I do not think I would ever think the light from the LIFX was "natural" sunlight.  It all looked like indoor lighting.  Perhaps I just have not found the setting on the app to make this work.  The Hue lights have nice defined scenes and light recipes that you can pick for your light to produce the soft white, reading, intense, etc. light.  More on this in the app section of the review, but being able to pick an item on the app and have it provide good white colors might help.Overall, the light generated from the LIFX bulb is exceptional.  The colors that can be produced are intense and the bulb is "bright" and diffuses enough to light a good sized area.  The white tones were slightly lacking for me, but still superior to most compact florescent bulbs that just have one soft tone.  Overall, I think the bulb itself is a solid 5-star performer!CONTROLLING THE BULB:  LIFX APPThe LIFX app downloaded from the Android store quickly and installed without a problem.  It found the bulb at setup and I was quickly able to change color and dim the bulb.  I liked the simple and clean look of the app and it was easy to see how to turn on and off the light and how to dim itI still do not know if I know how to properly change the colors on the light.  It may be the reason that I cannot get the whites to appear as natural as I would like.  If I select random colors, or select "blue" as the color I want when having the app IFTTT (more on this later) I get a deep blue.  When I try to select blue on the app color wheel I get a whiter blue that does not look as rich and intense.I like the concept of how (I think) the color wheel works, but I am obviously not doing it right.  I miss the ability to select a picture and point to the color in the picture that I want the bulb to be.  Hue does this very well.  Providing quick picks of some sort might help.  If I could select dark blue on the app and then the color wheel just moved to that spot and let me fine tune from there, it would be better.  Quick picks for the various intense colors and white shades would be a good first step.There is no way to use the app to schedule the light to turn on or off or change color at a particular time.  There is no way for the app to link the bulb to a motion detector or turn on when an event happens.  With the light and the LIFX app, all you can do is use the app to turn the light on and off and change the color.  That really does not cut it in my opinion.  The LIFX website suggests using a different method to automate the light (see below), but for the price paid, I think they need a robust app that allows for alarms or integration into the popular SmartThings and Verde system.  Overall, the app is really lacking and only gets 2-stars.CONTROLLING THE BULB:  IFTTTIF-This-Then-That (IFTTT) is an automation system that runs on the android platform (and iOS but I have not used it in an apple device) and allows automation of tasks across many platforms.  There is a learning curve, but if you stick with it, you can automate a lot of the tasks that you may do with your phone.  Look it up for details, but simply put, you can get data/trigger from one source (the IF-This) and then take an action on a different source (Then-That).  As an example, you could have the program monitor a weather channel and IF it is going to rain during the day, send you a text message at 6:30 AM to take an umbrella.This same system can be used to control a LIFX light(s).  It will take IF statements from SmartThings/Verde and send information to LIFX to control the light.  In this way, you can have motion sensors or a schedule to turn on the light and change the color throughout the day.  If my garage door is open, I can have the LIFX turn red.Activating the LIFX channel in IFTTT was not easy.  When I first set up my lights, it asked for an email address, but I did not have to set up an account with a password.  The IFTTT app asks for a password to your account.  It appeared that I did not have an account.  I tried the LIFX web site and could find no way to create an account.  There is a spot in the LIFX app to activate IFTTT, but not to create the account.  I clicked several times for it to send me a link to reset my password from the IFTTT activation screen.  I eventually received two password reset emails and was able to get an account set up.  Not an easy way to get set up.Once set up, the automation was straight forward.  You cannot pick the exact color with the IFTTT app, but you can select basic whites and colors from the drop down list.  (FYI - the whites from the IFTTT app are what I used when reviewing the white performance in the section above).  I am able to use all my SmartThings sensors as well as date/time to control my LIFX light.  I do not like that I have to use so many different connections to be able to control my lights.  In my case, SmartThings to IFTTT to LIFX.There is a rather steep learning curve and LIFX has not made it easy, but the functionality of IFTTT makes the automation result quite good.  I personally will not go "all in" in LIFX until there is good integration between SmartThings (or other z-wave technology) and LIFX, but it does work right now.CONCLUSION (Finally):Overall, I like the bulb and how well it represents colors.  That part works well.  The implementation, app, automation, etc. are all lacking and need to be improved.  Fortunately, that can be done incrementally without having to purchase a new bulb.  When providing a final rating, it feels like a 3-star evaluation.  However, since this is an emerging technology and one of the few offerings in this space; coupled with the fact that the bulb its self is excellent, I feel the 4-star rating works.
