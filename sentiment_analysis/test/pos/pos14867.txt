I love that these apple chips are baked and there is no added sugar and zero grams of fat. Other brands I've tried are laden with fat and calories, but these are not. In fact, this is one of the cleanest ingredient statements I've seen.  These Apple Chips are my new favorite late night snack.  I brought a Costco-size bag to a BBQ and they were literally devoured by adults and kids alike.  Great for my kids' lunches and snacks too.
