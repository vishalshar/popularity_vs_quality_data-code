This notebook is super high quality. I love the idea of one side having a dot grid and one side being ruled so that you can keep track of all your notes - whether they're stream of consciousness chaos or detailed and organized. I do wish that it had an index and numbered pages, but I just made my own index in the first few pages and numbered them myself so that I can reference back to specific notes later. It doesn't have a ribbon bookmark, back inner pocket, or little elastic strap-thing that most MOLESKINE or Leuchtturm notebooks have; at first I thought I'd mind not having those things but I actually really like the simplicity of not having them. I like that it lays flat. The pebbled leather(?) material feels and looks very nice. I also like the idea behind its creation, as laid out on the back of the box it comes in (see pics). Would be a great gift for a loved one or for yourself. Overall, very happy with it and would buy again.
