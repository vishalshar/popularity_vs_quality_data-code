Really cool! Spouse followed the directions and had a lovely crop in about ten days.A note: If you let them keep growing, they may release spores. Not a big problem, but for a few days they left white powder on the countertop. It never bothered me and I'm allergic to everything.He hasn't used the other side yet, but the first batch was fun. =)
