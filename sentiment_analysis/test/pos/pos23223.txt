This feeder literally changed my life! I have 3 cats, all on different prescription diets. Oliver is the overeater, and he has IBD, so restricting is access to food and feeding him a portion controlled diet was essential. I had food bowls for the other cats on window sills and tables to keep them out of Oliver's reach, and it was driving me nuts.  I did a lot of research and this feeder was by far rated the best. I was hesitant about the price, but it has already paid for itself since I don't have to have my pet sitter come twice a day when I'm on vacation. I feed both wet and dry food. I put refrigerated wet food in the compartment for the evening meal. Oliver has had no problems with it. It did take him a couple of weeks to get used to the motor - it turned out that my voice recording freaked him out lol. But he is now fully trained. And all cats are back to eating on the floor. The best part is that I can tell my pet sitter how to fill the tray when I'm away and then I can program the feeding schedule remotely. It been great and Oliver is actually eating less!  The webcam is fun - ironically I have the feeder in a place that shows my entire living room when I turn the webcam on ... So I can also use it as a security camera! Definitely worth the price. Oh - and customer service is amazing. They are very accommodating and have a fast response time. Don't waste your money on cheap versions that are unreliable. This feeder has stopped the endless begging, and Oliver is much healthier!
