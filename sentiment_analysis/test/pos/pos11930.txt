We are big into fermenting vegetables and usually use either Celtic Sea Salt or Himalayan Salt. For a change we bought Omnivore Salt which (in our opinion) does not ferment as well as the other two salt options. The flavor, however, is nice so we have started to use it for culinary purposes instead.
