I travel a ton (at least 2 business trips a month).  One of the key criteria for me in buying a suitcase is having something lightweight, especially since I have herniated discs in my back from a car accident and can't lift anything heavy.  I really love that my Bluesmart is really light.Bluesmart is my dream suitcase!  In addition to the bag being really light weight, it's also the perfect size. I always hated having a slightly oversize carry-on and this one is perfectly compact, but roomy enough to pack a few days of clothes, a pair or two of shoes and my toiletries.  Lots of tech-savvy people, in particular, have stopped me to ask about it, which is kind of cool. I mean if we all have smartphones, why not also have a smart suitcase?  Definitely two thumbs up.
