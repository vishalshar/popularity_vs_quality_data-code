I was looking around for a replacement band for my gray Activité Pop, which I've had for about a year, when I saw the white Activité Steel. The temptation was too strong, so I got the new white Steel watch and a replacement nylon band. I put the band that I got for my other watch on the White Steel watch and it looks super classy.I've had other fitness tracker wrist bands, and I really like the Activite watches. Things I like:- No charging; coin cell battery lasts for months not days- Withings is actively working on improving their existing products, whether it's an update to the app or a firmware update for the watch- Looks nicer than most fitness trackers bands.- The silent alarm! Some friends who have other trackers don't use any of the sleep functions because they sometimes charge it at night. Not an issue with this watch.Things that I don't like:- The absence of the alarm is usually the first sign that the battery is almost dead.- More stringent on step count than others. Not sure if that is because the step count is more accurate. Either way, I know the calculated distance is accurate enough. Just beware if you like to boast about step counts to your other tracker friends, you may have to adjust your goals too.- You can't set a goal for sleep in the app (yet?)Overall, I've been very satisfied. I didn't give 5 stars because of the silent alarm battery issue.
