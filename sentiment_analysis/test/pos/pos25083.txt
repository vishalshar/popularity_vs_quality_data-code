Love this case. Definitely protects the watch and looks badass while doing it. I like the larger scale it gives and and I am a bigger guy, so I like the bigger band, etc. so far it has held up great with no issues. It also has an integrated band clip and comes with it. Makes it a little more slick for function and look. I will say that occasionally it will boot up Siri. I'm assuming I someone pinch it just right. No big deal, a minor annoyance.
