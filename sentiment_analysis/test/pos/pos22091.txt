This paper is great for those cheeses you don't use often.  But for the day to day cheese I prefer the bags. Both the paper and bags are a big success in our house. We may, at any time, have 10 - 12 different cheeses.  Not to see the green, blue or black colors attacking our cheese is a huge savings. I am no longer afraid to make additional purchases because mold is no longer a problem.
