It def reduces the jingle of a regular key chain and it was not too difficult to put together (be warned, it does hold 7 keys without an issue, but the rod is not very long, so you have to put half on one side and half on the other side). all things being equal, i do like it and pulling out the keys was not has hard i thought it would be.
