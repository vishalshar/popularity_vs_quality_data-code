I bought this stove along with the triangia spirit alcohol burner as a combo and I have to tell you it works well as an alcohol stove and as a wood stove. It is much smaller than I anticipated even before I ordered it. This thing is small but will hold a Dutch oven or an iron skillet. There is a small learning curve on assembly but goes together well. Installing the spirit burner is a finger flumbling experience until you get the hang of aligning the slots up so it sort of "snaps" together and is secured. Removing the spirit burner from the stove requires flexing and bending but once you figure out how it goes, it's easy enough.After the first wood fire is used, the stove changes to a rainbowy color starting at the areas that were most hot and spreading out when in use. I did notice after several really hot fires that the entire metal surfaces will all be the same rainbow color. I did notice that the stove after several uses burning wood that the stove felt a little "loosened up" and was a tad wobbly but still held its shape well.Now on to the wood stove part. After watching a great video on their website and YouTube from the inventor it really helped to understand how the stove should be lit. Because it has a solid bottom tray, the stove can actually be moved while stove begins to light allowing easy access to the feed hole to blow air into it to help ignite the tinder. After that and a bed of coals are established, adding larger wood through the top and the after setting a pot or skillet on top, feeding through the side hole helps maintain a good fire box. If you wish you can use as a small campfire like fire to keep warm and help keep the fire contained and safe without leaving burn marks on the ground.Letting the fire cool down is relatively fast as the titanium cools down quickly for fast packing up. Nice job for a little stove!
