Bought this as a gift.  Larger then  I expected but looks to be good quality and like it will be fun.  I was disappointed that the shipping box was pretty beat up and appeared to have been openned and returned as the manual bag was torn open.  Since I bought it as a gift I was not happy to see the packaging in such poor condition.
