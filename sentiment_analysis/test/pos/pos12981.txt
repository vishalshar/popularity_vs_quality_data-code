Everything works as advertised and will probably help me improve my gas milage and keep tabs on the things going wrong with my older vehicle.The only reason why this doesn't get five stars is because of the "speeding" warnings. When you're going at or near 70MPH it decreases your score and gives you a speed warning... you can change the speed at which you get a warning, but not the speed at which your score is negatively impacted. This is a serious problem for me because the highway that makes up most of my commute has a speed limit of 70. I obviously don't want to fall below the speed limit (especially because nearly everyone is already speeding on that road), but there isn't any other way of keeping my score up without taking some weird alternate route.And what about the roads that go up to 75? or 80? That would be even worse. I hope this gets fixed soon...
