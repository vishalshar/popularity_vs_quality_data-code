Wow this product is amazing! Flew it all day for a week straight when I first got it. This is my first drone but you can really tell the quality from other drones (reviews videos etc). From what I can tell this is pretty much the same thing as a Dji but a lot better plus great customer support. The only bad thing about it that I could find is the battery only last for about 23 minutes  (about the same time for most drones) but it feels like 5 minutes. The camera is super steady.... super super steady, tried this out in pretty harsh winds and the drone was wibbly wobbly but the camera was steady, couldn't even tell there was wind. Also the drone left flying in the air without controlling it will most likely go up and down a little. Love this drone a bunch going to buy another battery soon. Also I successfully crashed a bunch (accident of course) going into tree branches kind of lightly, smack in a trunk going about 20 mph, (first time flying lol) and a few times it fell over while taking off (unlevel ground) and it looks and works like it just came out of the box (propellers have a few scratches but they provide an extra set). Unless you want a $5000 drone this is THE drone you should get. Very easy to get used to and haven't crashed in a while. If this video hasn't sold you here's some more stuff. If it goes out of sight, there is a helpful feature on the app there's a map showing which direction it is facing and where it is and it's very accurate, found its way home easily
