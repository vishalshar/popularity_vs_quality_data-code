I purchased this for my five year old to use on his iPad.  The handle is a nice feature, and makes it easy for him to tote around, and provides protection if he drops his iPad.  The hole for the headphone jack is a little snug so I usually have to help him push the plug in, but that might be fixable if I were to stretch that hole out a bit.  The case will come off if pulled on too hard, but we haven't had any issues with it coming off unexpectedly.  The bright colors are nice, I showed him all the pictures and let him choose which color he liked best, and he picked the yellow and blue one.  I would definitely recommend this case to anyone with a little one!
