As fast as advertised ... which is screamingly fast. I use this with a CyberPowerPC Fang i7 laptop which has a 1TB Samsung SSD 840 EVO (ST1000LM014-1EJ164) hosting Windows 7 Pro SP1 OS. Copying files using one of the USB 3 ports to connect this external SSD is so fast you might think it's wrong/lying. It is not.
