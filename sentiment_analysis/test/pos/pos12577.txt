These are awesome speakers, i said "these" because i bought two of them. When you pair them together the features on these speakers are really showing off. Not just the benefit of true stereo sound you are getting but you also get all these cool things down here:You can set one speaker to the left and another one to the right depends on where you seated. With this setting you will get a very powerful stereo sound and you can easily set yourself so you are in the triangle sweet sport.You can set both of them at Full 360 sounding and with two speakers it sounded like you are in the sweet spot everywhere you go. These speakers does a good job doing 360 degree sounding.I set one of my speaker to equalizer preset to something more focus on low and high range Rock The House and the other one really target on vocal and mid range like Jazz Club. The result is a very wide dynamic range since each speaker focus more toward a specific range. You can play with these setting and find out your own taste.There are many features that i havent have time to play with but im very happy with them. They doesnt feel cheap, all parts came with them also look very nice. The apps user interface also very clean and neat looking. Im gonna stop writing since I start to feel like im a marketer for Libertone. :D
