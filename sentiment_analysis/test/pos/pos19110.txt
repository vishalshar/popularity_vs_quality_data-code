I LOVE these! Sure. They are a bit tight but inside the package it gives different ways of threading the laces so they have a looser fit. I am SO happy I found these! I was hoping to get them by Wednesday even though they were originally expected to be shipped Friday but it looks like, well, they read my mind! I couldn't wait for them to come in! The shipper was so fast that this is actually package 2 of 1! Package 1 hasn't even arrived yet! I would definitely recommend these to ANYONE!
