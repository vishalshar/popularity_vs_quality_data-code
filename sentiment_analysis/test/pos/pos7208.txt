Anonabox takes all the hassle out of using the internet and not be tracked or bothered but retailers, websites etc.  Browsing speed is just a little slower but once you get going you don't notice.  Read the instructions for installation and follow recommendations given along the way and it is actually plug and play.  I will take this with me traveling to keep intrusions to my computer to a minimum.  I highly recommend Anonabox.
