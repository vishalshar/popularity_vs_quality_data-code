I gave this stylus to my son for his birthday and he loved it! This is a really kid friendly product. The interactive apps that come with this are all free. I found that with my kids, they no longer stare at the tablets for extended period of time, instead they go out and explore the world around them. They started listing out different colors they would like to capture. We have been using this product for a week now, and it is still working great. For parents out there, this is a really cool product!
