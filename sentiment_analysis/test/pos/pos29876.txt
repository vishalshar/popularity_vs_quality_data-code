These are super easy to install and work flawlessly with the Lutron App. I also synched them with my Echo and Alexa turns on/off my lights as well as dims them just with a simple ask. I replaced 2 (3-way) set ups in my living room and kitchen as well as the pendant lights on my kitchen island. By  installing the remotes as switches in the wall they look and act just like a 3 way switch.  The hub connected easily and has never lost connectivity (1 month so far).  I replaced Lutron switches that I had already so I am a fan of their products and this one simply works great and easy to install and setup.
