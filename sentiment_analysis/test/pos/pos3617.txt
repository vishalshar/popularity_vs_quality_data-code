This has been great fun for my 15 year old daughter and her friends since I gave it to her for the holidays.  Today, though, we had a mishap and the rod is now bent.  Is there a replacement part for this so all is not lost?  Also, we need more directions for exchanging the tips as we purchased that add-on and can't figure that out.  And, for future customers, perhaps specify more clearly which of the refills fit this product as we spent money on some that are just too large for the device.Great fun!
