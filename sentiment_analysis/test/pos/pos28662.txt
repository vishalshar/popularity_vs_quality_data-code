I have been using the Posh Micro x s240 for a week or so and it is positively liberating. It is small but does messaging, email and web access as you need it. Its not for gamers but people who just need connectivity all the time, it weighs almost nothing, fits in a shirt pocket and really works well.It is as small as two packages of matches but the screen in legible and once it is configured very useful; we all have a phablet or a PC somewhere to do serious work, after all.But, for on the road and weekends, this thing is a charm. Good and long active and inactive battery life and so light it is easy to forget it is with you. I love the thing, it does essentials and is not like lugging a 45 automatic around all day long! It is unlocked so do what you will, don't fall for the Apple, Samsung, etc rhetoric for $90 dollars this thing does all you want! Its even cheaper on Amazon!
