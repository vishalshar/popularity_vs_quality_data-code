Nice taste for my air popped popcorn.  I typically mist my popcorn with olive oil, then sprinkle the seasoning.  The olive oil helps the seasoning stick.  I tried all the flavors and they all taste great, but I do have my favorites.  Unfortunately, some of the seasonings caked and didn't come out easily.  I would recommend not opening them all at the same time - just enjoy them one or two at a time to avoid the caking I experienced.  Watch out the Jalapeno one -- it makes me sneeze every time I use it ;-)
