So far, this phone is amazing.  I was hesitant when it was in the kick starter phase but for $300 you can't go wrong.  Young company with some issues going on.  They are very responsive to these so far and the community is awesome.  In my opinion this is what the Nexus 5X should have been hardware wise.
