This is the most precious AND useful sleep item we have in our nursery!  Our 4 month old was waking up every 2 hours and very unhappy with his crib.  A change to his eating schedule and introducing this sleep sack made all the difference!  We call it the magic sleepSack - it's beautifully made, super warm and cozy and safe for the crib.  Baby now sleeps for long stretches and seems super comfy!!!
