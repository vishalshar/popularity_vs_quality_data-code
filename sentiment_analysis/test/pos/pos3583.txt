Love this thing. Have been in pursuit of the perfect homemade pizza for years. Used ovens, grills, pizza stones, etc. Saw this, decided to give it a try. I have an old, VERY old grill. Old fashioned 40k btu H burner and it works fine. Remember to burn off grill first. Then I set it up on the grill, and get it going. It takes anywhere from 15-20 mins to get up to temp. I was using the oven with 2 pizza stones and it would take almost as long to get up to temp (500+). We use the best crust recipe ([...]), put on pizza peel, use light amount of sauce and go easy on the toppings for best results. Throw it in the oven. It takes longer then stated, maybe 5-7 mins, depending on how brown you like it. I turn them 2-3 times during cooking. Absolutely love them, and, living in FL, especially love the fact the heat stays outside and not in the kitchen anymore.
