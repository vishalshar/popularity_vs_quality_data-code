I bought a Misfit Ray about a month ago and I have absolutely loved it. Unfortunately, it started malfunctioning so I sent Misfit an email stating the problem. They were very quick to respond and in 4 days, I had a brand new Misfit. Even though the first one broke, I am still content with their customer support on the issue.
