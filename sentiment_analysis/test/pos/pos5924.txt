I've tried A LOT of pillows and I've finally found the PERFECT pillow.  It does have a weird smell when you open it up but it goes after after a day or so.  It never goes flat, I don't wake up sweaty and it holds it shape perfectly.  It's not like any other pillow I've tried.  I love it so much I'm considering buying their mattress too.
