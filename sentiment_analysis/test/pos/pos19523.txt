A few weeks ago I had to throw out all of our bath toys and start fresh due to mold.  My 2.5 year old wasn't really digging the rubber ducky variations anyway, as she was a bit old for that.  Now she has cups/bowls/etc...things she can pour water in and out of.  Inevitably, every single night we'd end up with a puddle of water on the bathroom floor.  I started brainstorming about ways I could solve the problem, even wondering to myself if there was a market for a solution.  Alas, a quick search on Amazon showed me I had been beaten to the punch (which is quite alright with me...I'm busy enough!).  Yes, it's basically just a piece of plastic, but nonetheless I have a ridiculous amount of love for it.  Now my daughter can line up all her cups and related items and pour water in and out of them to her heart's content (sidenote: It is amazing how a kid can fill/dump a cup of water for 45 minutes straight, and it's just as interesting to them the 20th time around as it was the first).  Anyway, this shelf filled a need, and now my floor no longer gets wet.  5 stars!  The only downside is that I cannot store it in the suggested fashion - on a sidewall of the tub.  It ends up sliding down the side of the tub within 5 minutes.  Could have something to do with moisture.  Regardless, I don't feel it's worth taking a star away from the rating over that.
