I bought this watch for my son who is in elementary school, and it works just fine. It gives him a visual of his progress, and it helps motivate him to do more. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 stars, is that the only way to track his progress is if my phone is close by. It would be nice if you could track from the website or some other way.
