I very much like this bulb. I am using it with Amazon Echo. It is kind of finicky and there is still a little to be desired from the app. I absolutely recommend it over competitors though. I feel the few problems it have can be cleared up easily enough and I think the app is being actively improved, which I lile.Whites: The whites are great. There are plenty of them and the dimming works great. It's never weak or flickeringColor: VERY Vibrant. I initially choose Lifx over Phillips Hue because reviews said Lifx got better color. I can see why it says that. The colors can be light or deep. It doesn't, of course, get dark colors like Navy on account of it's being a lightbulb but you can turn it as deep a blue as you want and it remains very bright. (I hope this makes sense, you won't get colors approaching black but you can make very rich colors, which are also dimmable.)App: This is where there are some problem.First of all, the colors are defined as a 360-degree number and a brightness percentage. So Blue can be 200 - 260 (cyan-blue through true blue to blue-purple) and that can be between 1% brightness and 100% brightness. But when you go to use it with other apps, the options are generally "Green" "Yellow" "Red" "Blue" "Pastel blue" "pastel pink" OR some of them allow you to enter the color in Hexadecimal. There is no obvious conversion process. Maybe there is and I just don't know it... It'd be nice if the app could give you a hexadecimal equivalent. Even if it's not exactly it'd be nice to know "Lifx understands this Hexadecimal to produce this color"The special effects are nice, all of them work as I would expect except color cycle. It only cycles blue and purple colors. I expected it to behave more like "If red is set, cycle colors within X degrees of red" Because it does have the ability to choose how far the colors cycle. But it only does blues and purples.I like the scheduling but I wish I could schedule it to "Turn on at 5 am to soft white" or "At 5pm turn to dim warm white." As near as I can tell it will only turn on and off to the last color.The grouping function is very nice and the app works well. It's very responsive but it does have some weird problem on the Nexus 7. It is flawless on my phone.Amazon Echo: I have been using this with Echo and both the skill and IFTTT can be a little tricky to get the hang of. Echo installs new modules called skills. Where other lightbulbs have flawless integration (you can say "Alexa, turn my light on") For Lifx you have to say "Alexa, tell Lifx to turn my bedroom lights on" and she doesn't always get it right. I've fixed that using IFTTT triggers which can be "Trigger shut down" or "Trigger cold boot" Since I have to say 'trigger' I've been trying to make it the phrasing more natural but I think it's just making it sound like I live in a space ship. Which I'm ok with.IFTTT: Ok. I do love this. When my alarm goes off in the morning, the lights breathe on and off BRIGHT GREEN. When I have a notification, they breathe the appropriate color for it. When my boss texts me they flash red. Setting it up is very easy and can be done by anyone.Loved the added Echo support.UPDATE: As of Feb 29, my bulb has stopped working entirely. Two months to the day it arrived and one day after the 60 day return period... I'm extremely disappointed and have contacted Lifx customer support.
