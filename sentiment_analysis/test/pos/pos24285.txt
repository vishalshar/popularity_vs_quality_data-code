I am using these for the PS4 Pro. Ive used the new Astro A50 wireless sets, the Steelseries Arctis 7 and the hyperxcloud 2's. I can easily say these are the best sounding and closest to surround sound I've ever heard.I was disappointed early on as I thought the volume controls weren't working. I didn't realize it was the outside wheel on the headphone ears that increased volume (I thought it was the inside part where you can mute the game or chat). Also sound will come out of your tv as well just mute it and turn up the volume for in game and prepare to be amazed! (Make sure your audio device is set to output sound for chat only. Since early on I was using the wrong wheel to turn up volume you can imagine my disappointment )once I learned this I was blown away by the sound.Far better than the astros and much better sounding and more comfortable than the arctis 7's.One flaw that doesn't affect me particularly is the USB dongle and the optical port attachment. You can not use this with an Ethernet cable as the optical in doesn't fit. The USB dongle is also too large for the front ports on the Pro. (I believe these will work with the slim just no surround sound, since there is no optical port on the slim.)Overall, amazing headset. Highly recommend! Will update on PC use later .
