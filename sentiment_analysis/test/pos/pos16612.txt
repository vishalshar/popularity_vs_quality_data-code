Pros: 1.only system I could find that could be controlled remotely and could be installed outdoors for such a good price.  2. Installation took all but 20 mins including just plugging in the bridge into the modem and powerline.  3.Very easy to control through the smart phone, app is decent.. pictures allow me to know what areas I'm watering and setting up the duration of watering for each zone individuallyreally helps.  4. The test feature is awesome to easily identify zonesCons: Doesn't seem to work when there is a power outage and there is no battery backup.
