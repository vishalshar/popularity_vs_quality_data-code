Chess + Checkers + Magic: The Gathering?  Thats my best desciption of this game. Its a really great head to head game. The artwork is amazing, from the game board, to the cards, even down to the elemental pieces.  Game mechanics are pretty easy to learn.  A quick run through the rulebook and we were up and going with only 1 or 2 rule checks throughout the game.  I like how your power resets each time you score.  Makes for interesting strategy and also keeps the game balanced so the person who is behind always has an opportunity to catch up.Both decks contain angels of the same powers so each deck is fairly balanced.  As in the case with our game, card draws were a huge factor.  All my higher powered angels ended up being stacked on top where as my opponent's were stacked on the bottom (despite his claims, that was not intentional).  As a result, I steamrolled him.  Game time lasted about 30 minutes, but if each draws were equal, I could see this going back and forth for a while.
