Update: Within an hour of leaving my original review,  customer service responded and subsequently sent me a new camera overnight. I have had it on for 1 day and it still works... so hopefully it will stay working!  Fantastic customer service, and great product assuming it continues to work... so 5 stars!-----The only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it was great for the 3.5 days it worked.  On the 4th day I was at work and turned on the laser from my phone... The laser turned on, but would only move in the bottom right of the screen. When I tried to move it elsewhere, it only stayed in that area. I tried the recommended calibration, but only 4 of the calibration positions (out of 18) were visible on the screen. When I got home, I tried to calibrate it again in person, and found that the laser was so far in the corner it was not even shooting out of the cube. When I picked up the cube to turn it off, I saw the laser rolling around, proving that it somehow broke (I haven't moved it since I received it and put it on the shelf). Within FOUR days, somehow the laser broke off and is not letting me pan to the left!! I have reached out to customer support - and will update this rating pending their customer service.
