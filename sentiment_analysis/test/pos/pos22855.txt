I hope the mfg of this product is LISTENING.... 1)  the box is hard to open... perhaps it was glued shut by a 1st grader?  2)  The sheets are wadded up together... meaning you have to unroll the entire mess to get one sheet off the roll.  3)  I find the size of the sheet ridiculous.  Half a sheet is useless (unless you are wrapping a leftover oz. of cheese).  PLEASE make these sheets square... to make a neater wrap, the triangle way, folding corners.  4)  the stickers are useless.  Cute, but not removable.  After all these problems, I have to vote a thumbs up on the quality of this product.  YES, keeps the cheese fresh,  and yes, the cheese will last longer.  So, what is in the lining to keep the cheesse fresh, anyone know?
