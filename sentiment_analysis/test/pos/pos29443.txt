I bought this to supervise and play with my 17/yr/old cat who spends much time in her own room where the younger pets can't bother her.  I've had intermittent problems with the picture freezing and the laser not calibrating as well as it could.  It could use a little more instruction for overall use.  It says it saves the pictures I take to my Gallery but as of yet none of those pictures are in the gallery.  I'm not sure where the pictures are?  Overall it's a great idea and just needs some tweaking I believe.  I do make use of it along with a light I put in that room that I can turn on my cell phone to see how things are going at night.  My older cat spends more time watching the laser than chasing it but she is interested in it.
