This tea is awesome.  I get tired of drinking plain water and the crystals are easy to carry and mix very well.  No Floaties!  I got the jasmine and love it.  In addition I purchased the mulit flavor pak as a christmas gift for a friend who is a tea lover and always on the go.  Can't wait to hear what she thinks of it.
