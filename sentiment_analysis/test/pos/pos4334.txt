This is an awesome piece of equipment - this Big Dog add-on connected easily to my existing Little Dog remote.  I adopted my pup less than a month ago and "come" was nailed down solid in two days regardless of location or type of distraction.  This includes leash-free walking in areas where it's legal.  "Stay" is going along great and "heel" is also going to be finished this week ("heel-and-walk" is the next two weeks).At the dog park my two dogs are the source of tremendous pride - other dogs are running amok, jumping, mounting, and fighting (biting dogs and/or humans) while mine know that as soon as it gets loud they return to me immediately - no calling necessary!  They're obedient and lovable and I've happily demonstrated how this method does NOT make a dog neurotic.  The dogs are so happy to always be in "good boy" status as they know they're boundaries and my expectations.  I've demonstrated a collar at the park for a woman with a dog she had to chase around and capture in order to leave the park.  In five minutes the dog was coming to her on command regardless if it was strolling or playing.  Some toy possessiveness was resolved as well.  I told her to order one of these units ASAP as she would need to reinforce these commands for a few days.  After that it's a matter of never allowing willful disobedience (my dogs used to play "I can't hear you" at 25 feet away).Training dogs is a matter of command tone, body language, CONSISTENCY, and work, and should be a very happy experience for both owner and pet, but I believe there really can't be 100% instant obedience to a command like "come" without a device like this to give your words power.  It takes just that one time for the dog to get too near a dangerous dog, or a street...  I've combined my verbal commands with hand signals so I can command my dogs from a long distance without using my voice.  Again, so easy with this trainer.  "Down" from 100 yards is very, very impressive to friends and strangers alike.My only caveat is the "mud plugs" that cover the recharging ports are very delicate compared to the rugged construction of the collars. It seems common that these plugs can break easily, and it can be costly to replace them as they only come in a set including both big and small dog collars and contacts and is around $10.00 plus shipping.  I hope this design flaw of a too-thin too-delicate plug is resolved quickly.As they say, when there are three dog trainers in the room the only thing two of them can agree on is the third is doing it wrong.  Upon advice of a pro trainer in my area I use the device differently than the instructions indicate.  I use the beep tone as a warning while giving a command.  If the dog does not respond to the warning I use the lowest level of correction that my dogs find uncomfortable.  The "+2" feature is fantastic for correcting willful disobedience once the dog absolutely knows a command and is ignoring the correction.  It is also unparalleled for immediately stopping destructive behaviors from a distance - this way the dog does not connect a correction to not dig, go in the trash, or any destructive behavior with your presence, but quickly learns it is utterly unpleasant to engage in this behavior at any time.
