Very cool setup for learning about circuits and electricity. Also very cool app for the Ipad that shows "electricity" flowing through your circuit. My only complaint would be that the app only has maybe 5 "lessons", then the rest is up to the imagination of the child. I think my son would use this more if there were more projects that came with the app. From start to finish, he did everything on the app in under 30 minutes.
