If you already know Quad Lock products, you know this one is a solid performer just like the others. If you are new to the Quad Lock mounting system, here are the pluses and minuses.The cases are low-profile and do not turn your phone into a hand-grenade-sized object.  Further, they are extremely durable... I've had one for my iPhone5S more than two years, and it still looks almost the same as when I bought it.  One would think that the socket that attaches to the Quad Lock mounts would eventually become loose or loose grip, but it amazingly holds on just as tightly as when I first bought it.  Coupled with the Quad Lock mount products, it is the absolute best mounting system I've ever used in my car and on my motorcycle.The Quad Lock case protrudes just above the phone's screen surface, preventing scratches when the phone is laid down on its face, but not so much that it changes the way you access icons and such on the edges of the screen.  The only negative I have to mention, is that dirt can get trapped between the case and the phone (if you do dirty work like me), which can scuff up the back of the phone over time.  Simply take the case off once in a while and rinse it under a faucet, and this won't be an issue for you.
