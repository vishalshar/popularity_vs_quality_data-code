Easy, quick set up of my new account.  Ability to easily replace old battery (for only $2-3 battery cost) is a big plus versus the competition.  I am hoping a future app upgrade allows the Pebblebee to ring/find my iPhone even when it is set on vibrate.  Still, finding my keys and other items was the goal and Pebblebee delivers.
