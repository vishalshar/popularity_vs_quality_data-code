We have had rodent problem for years as our property backs up to a "green space".  I have used all kinds of "traps" and have never had much success.  Then I googled "rat control" and found my savior!  The "raticator"....I read the reviews and decided to invest.  The reviews are absolutely correct.  It's the best!  I've had mine for three days and FOUR rats have met their demise!  My neighbor was so impressed he ordered two and I have ordered another.  This is ALL OUT WAR!  "Raticator Rules!"
