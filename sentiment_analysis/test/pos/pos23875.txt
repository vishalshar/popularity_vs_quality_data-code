I am so happy with this product!  I have been noticing these pop up at dinner parties and I love that I now have my own.  This is the best way to quickly "decant" your wine so you don't have to wait hours for it to properly open up.  This is one of those products that once you use it, you wonder how you lived without it before.  I also love that this aerator comes with a little stand -- we have it sitting right next to our wine opener so it is always ready to use as soon as we open the wine.
