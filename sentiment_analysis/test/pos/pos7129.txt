I used the original 5star Responder unit for over a year and have just upgraded to the Great Splash with 5Star Urgent Response. I still believe that the Great Call Splash is the most portable, cost effective personal safety device on the market. I'm also extremely pleased that the new unit is water resistant allowing it to be used in the shower or bath.As a lifelong allergy and asthma sufferer who's had a few close calls, I had considered purchasing a medical alert button before but I found every other service far too expensive (and just a little bit uncool... I was 29 when I bought my first 5star unit, I'm 31 now). Then I found the 5Star! 5Star is so much more than your typical medial alert button. It's really like a personal emergency concierge or an On*Star for people.5Star isn't just for medical emergencies. You can call 5Star for any urgent or potentially urgent situation. You could be afraid to walk to your car alone at night, run low on gas and need directions to the nearest station, or hear strange noises in your home. At the push of a button a friendly 5Star agent will come on the line and offer assistance. Thanks to the unit's built in GPS the agent on the line will know exactly where you are and where to send help if you need it.The Great Call Splash retails  for under $50 and the basic monthly service fee (after a one time activation charge) is just $14.99 with no contract and it works anywhere on the Verizon network. This means that unlike a traditional medical alert button that's fixed to your home, 5Star goes with you and is ready to provide assistance anywhere you happen to be. While the new, waterproof device is slightly larger, it is still small and light. I keep mine clipped to my belt and I hardly notice I'm wearing it. When traditional medical alert companies charge $30-45 dollars a month for a service you can't take with you, 5Star is definitely a bargain.The one downside for new subscribers is that Great Call now has moved its urgent care service to a "Go Plan" and charges an additional $5 dollars a month bringing the base monthly fee to $19.99 + tax if subscribers want access to the Live Nurse and Urgent Care features.  Over the year and a half or so that I've used 5Star I have not called urgent care enough to justify the extra expense. However, I continue to have those features as they were grandfathered into my plan.One of my favorite features is the 5Star smart phone app which is available for android and iOS.  Subscribers with a Great Call Splash or an original 5Star Responder unit can use the smart phone app for free. I really love this because it greatly extends the availability of the 5star service for me. Between my smart phone and my Splash device, I am never out without emergency coverage.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my service and my purchase and I would highly recommend this device to anyone who is concerned about their personal safety. Even with the added fee for a Go Plan to access urgent care, 5star service is still much cheaper than landline only competitors like Lifeline or Life Alert. I hope to continue to be a satisfied 5star customer for many years.
