I am sold on this unit.  Easy to setup and input my yard configuration. Schedules are set and when this freeze gets over I am looking forward to easy management.I did change out my wife system since installing the controller and had experienced an issue in getting the controller re-connected.  A Saturday email to tech support was answered within an hour and they rectified the problem  remotely.  Great support service.  Highly recommend.
