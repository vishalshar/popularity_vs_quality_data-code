What a dream to install and setup. All hardware is included in this kit with network bridge (required).This unit combined with Nest or Honeywell thermastat is the perfect Home Automation system. iOS setup was extremely easy and quick. Now have multiple zones and rooms configured with this system throughout home. Would buy again and add switches to the existing system.
