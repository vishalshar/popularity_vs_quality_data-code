I originally gave this a 1 star rating because it came loose on bumpy roads.  iOttie actually responded asking if I would accept a replacement to see if the original one had a defect.  I accepted and have been using the new replacement without incidence.  Seems to be holding nicely.  Glad to see some companies care about their products and customers.  I was pleasantly surprised when they contacted me and would recommend this phone holder.
