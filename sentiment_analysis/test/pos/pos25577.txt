Very comfortable, I like it. It doesn't seem to retain heat. One suggestion I would make it that there should be a cutter included in the box to help remove the plastic from the mattress as with other mattresses. One issue I had after freeing the mattress from its plastic casing was that the inner layers of the mattress seemed to jut out from one side. I have decided to ignore this for some time and see how I feel out it in a few days.
