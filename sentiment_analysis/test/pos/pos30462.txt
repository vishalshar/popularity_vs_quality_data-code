I am rather new to diffusing.  I have long, very thick curly hair, that I tended to blow straight a lot, or wore in a bun that never fully dried (because my hair is that thick).  In the interest of spicing things up (and looking more professional at work),  I invested in an Elchim and the Cocooon Diffuser.  I am so elated with my purchase.In the distant past I used the standard long-tooth diffuser.  Though I used as instructed, my hair at the roots dried in a frizzy mess or poofed out too much.  The Elchim diffuser makes my curls stay in tact.  I must add that while I have thick hair, my individual strands are semi-coarse and tend to be thin.  Thought you might like this information for added perspective).It took some time understanding how to use the cocoon part.  I learned hat this works wonderfully when pressed against the scalp  at at 90 degree angle (low setting, cold to medium heat -- depending on how dry my hair is).  For those who have a lot of natural volume and don't want that 80's look, this product is a must have!  It keeps hair near the scalp wavy or spiraled.  The curl at the ends stays healthy too.I can now sport my curls with glee.  Thank goodness for the Elchim diffuser.  (note: I use this on their legacy blow dryner, Elchim 2001 HP -- I also highly recommend this dryer for curly hair.  It's ionic and the cool setting is an actually setting, and not a cold shot, so you can relax your thumb as you cool set).  Nice!Update:  The instructions are weak on how to remove the top part.  It took me an exchange, several lost nails, and bruised knuckles to figure out that to remove the cocoon top you need to put the whole apparatus on its (on your lap, preferably).  Push down on one of the perforated sides and then gently pull off.  The instructions claim that you can push the sides in simultaneously -- that's nearly humanly impossible unless you are in competition for the world's longest fingers.
