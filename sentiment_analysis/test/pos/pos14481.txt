I have been trying out different smart bulb options lately, and these ones blow away the competition! Setup was a little more troublesome than I would've liked, but once set up, these beauties work like magic. Just say "Hey Siri, goodnight." And watch in amazement as she sets your scene. I get a tinge of joy every single time.Regarding the two negative reviews on here, the 3-star author apparently didn't open his box fully lol, because the box does indeed contain written instructions on paper and a power plug for the hub. I admit, their packaging is so aesthetical those items could be easy to miss. But come on, man, look through the box! The 1-star author must've gotten a bad hub or a janky Ethernet cable because I never have to reset mine. Try contacting support, buddy.Bottom line is: don't let those 2 bad reviews fool you. These bulbs are worth every penny!
