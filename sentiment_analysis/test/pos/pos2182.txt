Using essentially the same internal specs & tracking as the Avior 7000 that preceded it, the Castor has better ergonomics for palm grip. The shape is comfortable with other grips as well, and the thumb area is very nice. Unfortunately it loses the secondary top button beneath the scroll wheel, but that's almost an acceptable sacrifice for how well this mouse fits my hand. I ended up switching to a smaller mouse because my hands are only 18.4cm (around 7.25 inches) in length.
