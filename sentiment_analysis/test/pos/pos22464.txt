My two Jack Russell terrier cross's are wild about this salmon jerky treat ...and I am so pleased with it ...it is pure salmon, no junk added and even looks delicious to us humans.  I like the fact that it adds such good nutrition and is not just a "treat" with no real value in terms of my dog's health so yes, I'll order more, and often!
