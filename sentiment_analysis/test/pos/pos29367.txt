I would give this feeder 5 stars, however, the right speaker doesn't work and therefore isn't as loud as I'd like it to be. - (for the price I wish both speakers worked):(Second, I wish the camera quality was better but I'll make due just because overall it's a great feeder. -It does feed my cat on command when I go on the website which is great.+I'm able to feed him wet food while I'm gone as long as I refrigerate it overnight. +The little silver bowls fit in the slots which makes cleaning a whole lot easier! +The fact that it has a camera in general is a major plus!+.
