The LittleBits modules are just the coolest thing. Having been a programmer in a long-ago past life, these modules really free you from needing to understand how individual electronic components work and conceptually behave more like functions in a program. The modules are extensive, and highly functional, and the LittleBits folks keep turning them out- more and more functional modules every week.Within 20 minutes I had setup a cloudbit, successfully communicated with it by setting up an IFTTT recipe to actuate it on an SMS message, then mounted a servo to press the button of an extra garage door opener transmitter I had. Cool- now I can control my garage door from the internet, verifying its operation with my driveway camera. This sure would have come in handy the day we left on vacation and forgot to close the garage.The simple input-output signal convention, and the fact that the modules only connect to each other in the correct way really make these foolproof. Logic, sensors of all kinds, servos, motors, switches, lights, sound and more are available modules. Easy to prototype and tear back down, or mount it all on a board and use it as a permanent device. And if you are into programming, get the Arduino module and get sophisticated. Works like an Arduino Leonardo with the Arduino IDE. Just awesome!For anyone who has wanted to be able to build the hardware to do real work, but was held back by the need to learn all the electronics first, these modules are for you.
