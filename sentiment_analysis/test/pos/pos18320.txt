We've had this game for almost two years now, and it's one of our favorite party games to take with us whenever we are invited to someone else's home.  As the description says - the "appropriateness" of the humor is completely up to who you play it with, and we've never had anyone feel like any of the cards crossed the line.It's been the creator of a number of inside jokes now with terms, and definitions that we've worked into normal conversation with the friends we've played with.  Love it!
