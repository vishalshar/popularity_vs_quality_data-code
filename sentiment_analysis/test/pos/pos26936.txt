Further hand soap is a perfect cleanse with a light scent that follows you out the door. I came across this scent in the ladies room at Trencherman's in Chicago and was hooked from there - the lotion is incredible as well - nice scent that gets you noticed - an earthy  / warm unisex scent. It's now in my "ladies" room. :)
