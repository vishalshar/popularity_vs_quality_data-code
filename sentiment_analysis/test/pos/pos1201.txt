Love this lid!  I only bought one at first because I was afraid it would leak like some reviews I'd read, but very happy to say the lid I have doesn't leak at all - I just ordered another one!  I use these for baby formula.  I took the whisk balls from my blender bottles and put them in a glass 1-quart mason jar and then use these lids.  Even when shaking up the formula, nothing leaks out the sides.  Very happy with this product!
