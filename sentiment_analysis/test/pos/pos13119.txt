Just commuted from Capitol Hill across the Potomac.  A wonderful way to commute.  Think about zipping to work on a direct route that a car cannot travel, and viewing the best scenery nearby. The Urb-e works on bumpy sidewalks and manuevers through crowded sidewalks and various obstacles smoothly.  It turns a commute into an adventure! And get ready, you will turn heads and create a buzz, and hopefully, sell more URB-E's. It's just FULL ON FUN!!
