It's the same as other crystal litters.  And that is good: it's mostly silica gel, which is a desiccant, meaning it soaks up urine and moisture from feces.  There may be some anti-odor, but it doesn't have any annoying perfume scent.  I use it with an automatic cat box (which is also awesome).  One of the two packages in the box lasts for our one indoor (large Maine Coon) cat for about 2 weeks.  Scoop and stir occasionally -- you'll get just the dried feces, no clumps.  Even with the automatic cat box, stir every so often to get the un-saturated crystals towards the area where the cat pees.  Throw it all out when done and replace with the next bag.This is so superior in all regards to clumping litter that it's worth whatever extra cost there may be.  If you want your house to not smell like you have cats, this is the way.
