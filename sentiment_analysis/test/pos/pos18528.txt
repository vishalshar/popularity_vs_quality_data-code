I just love this product. Way better than any other wireless bulb that I've tried. The app is great and they constantly update it, enabling new features over time. I love being able to change the lighting of my room based on my mood or the activity I'm doing (bright white-ish for working, dim green/blue for reading in bed, etc.)I would TOTALLY recommend you to buy this light bulb! It's soooo worth the price :)
