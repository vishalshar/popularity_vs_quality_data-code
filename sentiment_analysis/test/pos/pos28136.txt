I wish there were even more stars available!  I have been using Dream Water for the last 4 years.  I hope this product never goes away.  :-(I did have some issues with some bottles not being able to open.  My husband and son both couldn't twist the cap off.  I had thrown them away in the past and was bummed to do that.  After a little while it dawned on me to email customer service about it.  They were so nice and so helpful.  They took my information and very quickly replaced the water products.  This company values their customers and is top notch in my book.  I am a very avid amazon prime user and am sorry to say I don't often write reviews.  I know that I should because I have been very satisfied in 95% of my purchases.  I really felt the need to post this about Dream Water.  Thank you for a fantastic product and for taking such good care of your customers.
