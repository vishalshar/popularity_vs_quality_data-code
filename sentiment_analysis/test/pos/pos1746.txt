I received my Petzi three days ago. I have been waiting for a product like this for 12 years, since I got my little boy. I can watch him and give him treats all day long. The joy that I feel sitting in the office and watching him hunt for the treats is indescribable.I would say this product is a combination of Instagram (as you can show off your baby to other Petzi parents), a Nest Cam (as you can watch their movements and talk back to them) plus the most important and UNIQUE FEATURE IS GIVING THEM TREATS. The treats have to be certain size, which is no problem. Yesterday I made a trip to Pet Smart and came home with three different products and brands.Their customer service is extremely responsive to questions and they go out of their way to help with problems. (They were no problems it was just  that I am computer challenged). The product is very easy to set up. It practically has no set up. Plug it in, download the app and go.
