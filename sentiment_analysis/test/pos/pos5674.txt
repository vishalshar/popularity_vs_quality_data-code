I bought this for my Shih Tzu. He loves it and it really helps to burn off some of his excess energy with the Crazy Cat App! :)Edit 01/06/2016Here I am, 2 weeks into trying to get a second replacement. At this point, all that I can think is that the company is having a hard time dealing with the cost of replacing all the Spheros that have failed.I've changed my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. This change is for two reasons and is not because we don't like ours as (while it works) it is still my Shih Tzu's all time #1 favorite toy, but rather because:(1) If you really play with it as we do every single day, you only seem to get about 5 to 6 months out of it before it begins to quickly die.(2) Customer Service seems to have taken up a tactic of "delay and obfuscate". I've gotten right to the point of getting an RMA twice now on this one (after multiple emails back and forth), only to get pushed over to another customer rep. I'll update my review again either when I've gotten a replacement or when it becomes clear that a replacement is not forthcoming...Is this possibly why Amazon doesn't carry it any more?Update (evening of 01/06/2016). Just got another response: "The RMA has been requested and you should receive a label for return by the end of next week." Seriously, a week and a half to get an RMA number issued? Has anyone ever heard of such a thing before? Looks like another layer of delay, eh? I'll update my review again if/when anything further happens...Edit 01/15/2016. I'm pretty sure I got bumped up the support ladder because of the time involved. I was sent a prepaid mailer for FedEx (which... since I didn't buy it directly from them, I consider that a big plus) to send it back. As soon as it showed tracking by FedEx, they 2nd Day aired me a replacement via UPS. It arrived today, paired right up, and my little buddy welcomed it back just like he would a member of the family that had been absent for a few days. ;)So, all is well that ends well, I guess. Anyway, I upped the stars to 4 stars (sorry, can't give it 5 since two of them lasted less than 6 months each). That said, if I were to rate it on enjoyment value alone based on how much it gets used here, it'd get a 6! :p
