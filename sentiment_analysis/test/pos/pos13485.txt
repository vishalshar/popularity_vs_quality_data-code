First, I ordered my Leaf on Amazon because I was able to receive it in under a week, where as the manufacturers website said to expect 4-6 weeks. So that was great. As for the actual item, I am fairly happy with mine. I bought this tracker to try something different after my Fitbit One finally died after three years. I tried a few other trackers before this purchase and had to return them because I can't stand the plastic bands on my wrist. So this being a clip on tracker was a huge part of my decision.As far as pros, I really love the look of this tracker. It's so much more attractive than all the plastic options available. And I know that may seem silly, but it was a big deal to me. Besides that, I've had no problems with syncing or general use of my Leaf, and that alone makes me happy with it.For cons, I just have minor complaints. I wish that the inside of the metal portion of the clip had some sort of no slip backing on it to help it grip onto clothing. With just the metal it is very slippery and it slides off of a waist band way too easily. I've had to stop wearing it on my pants because it fell off every time I went to use the bathroom. I also have not been wearing the bracelet because the ends don't have actual clips and the tracker has fallen off multiple times when I've tried it just for a few hours. My other complaint (or maybe just an observation) is that this tracker tracks way fewer steps than my Fitbit did. I'm not too concerned with this, because it's more about ratios of exercise to not and I'd rather undertrack than over track, but it was a little bit jarring when I first started wearing the Leaf to see that I was getting so few steps.And finally, if the manufacturers see this, I'd really love an integration with MyFitnessPal! Or some other way to track calories. Exercise alone is not enough to be healthy and having a food tracker could really round out your health app. Also, it'd be nice to get some sort of notification on the app when the tracker buzzes, so we know what the buzzing is for. Sometimes I'm not sure if it's a get up and move buzz or an alarm I set for something and it'd be cool if we could check our phone to see exactly what the deal is.All in all, yes, I would buy this again, but I would love some of the minor improvements I mentioned above in order to make it great.
