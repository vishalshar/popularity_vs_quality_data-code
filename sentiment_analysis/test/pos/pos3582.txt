used this last night and loved the pizza. Looking forward to many nights of creative toppings with it. I have a friend that had a $3000 wood burning oven installed and it is impressive and makes great pizzas. I asked him how much he uses it and he said, just a few days a year. I bet I will get much more use out of my Bakerstone product and it stores under my grill, so doesn't take up a ton of space.
