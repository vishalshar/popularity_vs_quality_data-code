This suitcase is great, and as a frequent traveler it is exactly what I needed.  It is pretty sleek and fits the mold of a proper 'business' suitcase and carry on, but is also quite practical to say the least.  The multi directional rolling, which is a must in all suitcases, is perfect.  To put it briefly, I could not be happier with my purchase.I use the Bluesmart on all my trips and the charger comes in handy more often than not.  I really only charge my phone with the suitcase, but it has come through for me every single time.  Beyond the 'perks' of a smart suitcase, the thing is extremely durable as well.  You can be pretty certain that anything placed in the suitcase will come out in the same condition, even if it goes into the overhead bin.  The suitcase is quite sturdy when being dragged and rolled through a busy airport and I have yet to run into any stability issues.If I had to name a 'complaint', it would be that the suitcase is on the smaller side of the spectrum.  That said, I am not even sure this is a valid complaint as given how strict airlines are getting with overhead space I am always confident my bag will not be gate checked (whic is the absolute worst).  All in all, I would have to say the Bluesmart is definitely worth the money and I am extremely pleased with the purchase.  You get what you pay for in this case!
