My father is getting older and sometimes he's by himself.  I got this for him because he can text for help on his wrist and I can guilt him into moving around with the step counter.  He's proud when he beats his score from the previous week.  The fact that it lasts a week per charge, charges in under an hour, and is water resistant so he doesn't have to take it off is all what sealed the deal.
