These just arrived today and I am very impressed with them!  I have been fighting with various types of foldable and collapsable reading glasses for many years and am generally very frustrated; even with the high dollar ones.  I like to read in bed, and the arms going to the ears invariably jam up against whatever I'm reclining on and either fly off the other side of my face or try to bore a hole in the side of my nose with the nose pads.  These Thinoptics glasses get rid of all that problem!  What a relief!And, maybe it's my big honker with quite large end, but I can put these on and vigorously shake my head while looking straight down at the floor and they won't come off.  I wouldn't try to wear them in a wind storm, but then again I probably can confine most of my reading to where the wind isn't really howling too hard.  They're very light too - you hardly notice they are on your nose.  And the lightness and light grip on your nose make them very comfortable for longer term wearing.Great product and highly recommended!
