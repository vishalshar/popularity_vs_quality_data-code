These do GREAT for sauerkraut. They expanded and let air out while not letting air in. However, sometimes the nipple top would get crusted over  with fluid and I would have to break the crusty seal by simply pinching them. But sometimes, when I would pinch them they would forcefully spray the under pressure liquid; so be careful wen you pinch. I do not however recommend these for pickles and other veggies because mine did not expand under pressure as with the sauerkraut, and I still got mold under the tops.
