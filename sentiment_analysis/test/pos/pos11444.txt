Have flown smaller RC aircraft for years...finally decided to grow up and buy a big boy drone.  TOTALLY WORTH IT!  Holy cow.  This thing virtually flies itself and the camera quality is outstanding.  I did a LOT of investigating of various quad's and landed on this one for various reasons.  I suggest doing your own research to find the right fit for you...but I can assure you this drone is worth it!
