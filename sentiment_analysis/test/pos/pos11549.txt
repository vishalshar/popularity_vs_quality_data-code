This is my first prosumer quadcopter. I have been waiting for over a year to pickup a video camera based quadcopter. As a photographer, video and image quality were more important to me than the number of features included.  What a find to discover Autel Robotics! With Autel's X-Star Premium quadcopter I didn't have to compromise on either, I get high quality video, images, ease of use, and autonomous flight modes!My first flight went very well! Autel made me feel like a kid again! I was nervous about leaving the camera on for the first flight as I was afraid I might damage it. After prepping it for flight, I hit the warmup motors button, then I anxiously hit the takeoff button and the motors spool up for flight and rises to 12 feet and hovers in position in a 12 mph wind. I was amazed at how stable it was. I then practiced some simple patterns to build up confidence and awareness of the X-Stars' capabilities. I had GPS and Beginner modes enabled and decided to test the geofence feature, first reaching top altitude of 98 feet check, then going horizontally 323 feet check. To conclude the flight I chose the return to home button.  X-Star rose up to 98 feet reoriented towards home and traveled directly towards home and hovered, descended at a smooth rate until about 2 feet off the ground and slowed descent rate until it gently rested on the ground and shut the motors down within 1 foot of the takeoff point!  Absolutely amazing! Score!I was so jazzed I popped in the spare battery that I purchased with the X- Star and decided to try out some of the autonomous features: Orbit and Waypoint.  I was not disappointed, both modes worked really well.  I also got to experience Failsafe mode unintentionally when I ignored the first low battery warning message. After receiving the second low battery warning X-Star went into Failsafe mode and landed safely at its current position.What are you waiting for? Order it now!!Pro's:- This is a very well thought out system, ideal for those who want to focus on getting amazing video and images- Build quality, quality of camera, and design of remote controller with dedicated function buttons are greatly appreciated for new pilots in this category- Dual GPS system- Direct connection between remote controller and smartphone or tablet- Autel Starlink app- It even comes with a semi hard shell case!Con's:- it's really hard to come up with anything major- per another X-Star owner, modifying the case so you can leave the propellers on would be awesome- I just wish I had purchased it sooner back on Amazon Prime dayRecommendations for potential buyers:- using an iPhone 5s as my primary FPV device is OK, but a small tablet would work better for screen navigation and selecting commands on screen-  if you are on the fence between the premium and base version as was I, I chose the premium because of the 64gb memory card (really important for high res videos), additional range capability, and the ability to download content directly to my phone, and the case- watch Autel's video tutorials, they are really helpful- choose your first flight location carefully, choose a wide open area without obstructionsAutel X-Star Premium is a great quadcopter!  Get ready for fun experiences!
