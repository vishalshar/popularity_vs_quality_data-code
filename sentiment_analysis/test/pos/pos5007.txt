I want to start by saying that this is a good quality product and not cheaply made or flimsy.  Your pet will not be able to break into it.However, for my large CAT who only eats WET FOOD, it is not very suitable.  I feel this feeder is best suited for animals with a more narrow snout and for dry food.  The problem for my cat is that the food dishes inside are not rounded at the bottom (like a bowl is), so the wet food gets stuck in all the 90 degree angles from the floor of the dish to the sides.  The back of this dish (shaped almost like a triangle) is also a problem because it is a narrow wall that is difficult for my cat's face to get to the wet food, which also gets stuck in the 90 degree angle there as well. My cat only gets one of the small cans per meal and when half of it is stuck in the corners, it is a waste and he is not fed properly.  SO, if you have a dog or cat who eats dry food, then this is an ideal feeder.
