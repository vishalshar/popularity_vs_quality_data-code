Hello everyone,Well, I have had the Robo for a few months now, and I am pretty happy with it. As many will say, 3D printing is not quite consumer ready yet. That said, it is great for people who are willing to take the time to tweak the settings to get things just right. You can come out with some pretty impressive results.Starting off, my printer didn't move right, just after getting it unpacked. It would go up, but it wouldn't move down very far. After talking to some people on the forums, I discovered that the X axis was not level due to not being level on the Z axis threaded rods. I used a digital caliper to level them, and it printed beautifully. My best advice, go to the forums, and ask for help. Even if they don't point out the exact problem, they will help figure things out.MatterControl, the default software, works well with the Robo. It is great for getting started, or if you don't want to tweak the printer very much. I don't despise it, unalike the people on the forums. That said, it does have its limitations. I don't blame the devs for these limitations, it is great free software, I have no room to complain. It works right out of the box.After reading some of the suggestions on the forums, I decided to try out Simplify 3D. It is not exactly plug and play with the Robo, unlike MC. That said, its ability to add and manipulate supports is second to none (as near as I can tell). It also gives you access to pretty much every setting you could want access to. You will have to tweak the Z axis offset, and possibly need to print with the SD card. The firmware on the printer occasionally stops communicating with the software, so that can cause problems. No one knows the exact reason why it happens, but we have found ways to work around it.As a bit of a side note, only use the starter filament (the stuff that comes with your printer) for a little while. It is kinda cheap filament, that has some issues printing some items. I would recommend Hatchbox filaments, they seem to print quite nicely. I have yet to try anything other than PLA, so I won't advise anything there.The Robo's firmware has temperature limits built in, so you may have to change them if you want to print at higher, or lower temperatures than the default limits. It is pretty easy to do, so don't worry about it. Just take a look at the forums, and ask for help if you can't find what you are looking for.Over all, the Robo is a good machine. Yes, people have had problems with it. You will have problems with virtually any of these complex machines. Remember, you are getting in at a time when hobby 3D printing is really just getting started. The Robo can provide very good prints, it can also have problems. Usually, it just takes carefully thinking through the problem, and troubleshooting it. Just like the early days of computers.Please see some of my prints below as examples of what you can get.Update 12/12/2015:I am updating this to warn people that the 6 month warrantee is pretty much worthless. The company really doesn't cover much, so don't expect much actual assistance from the company.Basically, during normal operation, the print bed chipped. There is now a chunk of glass embedded in one of my prints, and a sizeable chunk missing from the build plate. Robo's warrantee doesn't cover this at all. Buying a replacement print bed is about $100, so it isn't cheap.I am moving from 4 stars to 3 simply because I don't like how deceptive the 6 month warrantee is. It sounds like the company will help you out during that time for standard wear and tear, that isn't the case.I have not gone lower than 3 because the printer has worked great until this point. So far, this is the greatest knock against it. I may suggest thinking of one of the other printers if you are on the edge. Printrbot "might" be a better choice. I have not tried them, so I don't know for sure. I just might suggest taking a longer look at other printers.Update 12/15/2015:I need to correct my earlier statement of the replacement print bed costing $100. The person I have been talking to through Robo has offered a replacement for $40 + shipping. This minimizes the sting a bit, but I won't put my rating higher. I still think that this should be covered under the warrantee. What is the point of it being 6 months, if it only really covers damage during shipping?I am less ticked, but I still recommend not expecting much from the 6 month warrantee. The printer works great when it works, which was most of the last few months. This is the first major issue to pop up. So, get the printer for its merits, and forget the warrantee.Update 4/2/2016I was able to set up the replacement print bed pretty easily. I decided to add a quick release, which made it pretty nice for completely removing the bed, without having to open the machine. I decided to up my rating for the machine simply because it is still working. As a few people have pointed out, the company's warrantee does cover several key components.I will admit that I was being a bit petty about the print bed, they did discount it. Generally the machine has been solid. Most of my problems have been caused by my inexperience. I have had no real problems with the machine since the printed bed. I bought some blue painter's tape, and have that applied over the bed. To the best of my knowledge, I have not had the bed chip since. I miss having glassy bottomed prints, but the matte look has its own appeal. :-)
