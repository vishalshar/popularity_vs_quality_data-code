I held off writing this review for a couple of months, so I would have some basis for writing a review in the first place.  I have been a long time home brewer, though never graduated beyond extract brewing because of the amount of gear and the time investment, but I understand the processes and have always wanted to get into it.  (Moving around every few years is hard on a set up like that...)At any rate, first of all, this is not a "Kuereg" for brewing.  If you don't already know what you are doing, or have the understanding that there is going to be a steep learning as you gain knowledge on full grain brewing, then this machine will knock your socks off.  I will tell you though, that my first experience was very frustrating as I learned the hardware and the software side of things, but hey, that's part of homebrewing.  Remember that even your mistakes most likely end up very drinkable.All of the normal things that apply to traditional home brewing apply here; sanitation, temperature control during fermentation, patience as you allow your beer to ferment and once again, sanitation.  What this machine does, and does oh so well, is to simplify the mashing process of the grains and automates the boil and additions to the boil.  That's not to say that you don't need to understand what it is doing, but once you perform your setup; i.e. put your crushed, mixed grains into the step filter, put your pellet hops into the appropriate adjunct baskets, and prepared your clarifier for addition near the end of the boil; you tell machine to proceed with the selected recipe, which contains all of the parameters for the mashing process and the boil of the specific beer you are making.  At that point you can walk away for 2-4 hours depending on all of those variables.  No monitoring your strike temps, manual "mashing in", once again monitoring temps for the lengthy mashing process and then "mashing out" and the painful yet necessary step of pulling your spent grains out of your mash tun, or draining off the wort into you boil kettle.  All of that happens automatically.  Then it will bring your wort up to the boil temperature and proceed with the boil and the appropriate hopping as prescribed by your recipe.  All while you are running errands, watching TV, spending time with your kids... or what ever else you having going on in your life.Once all of that is done, you still have to chill the wort to your yeast pitching temperature.  That can either happen over night or you can use an ice bath or an immersion chiller connected to the fluid loop of the machine.  You control that.  You pitch the yeast and put the fermentation vessel someplace relatively cool and let it ferment.The fermentation vessel will typically be the Cornelius keg that you use as the water reservoir for your brewing process (unless you choose otherwise) with the addition of a great rubber keg stopper.The one downside of this system is the limitation of of batch size being 2.5 gal.  It's easy enough to run two batches in one day and ferment in your 6 gal carboy, but I have found out that 2.5 gal of beer goes pretty fast. LOLI have taken a video of the prep of one of my brew days.https://youtu.be/LECtRV0llGgCleanup is still cleanup, it's just a lot more contained and goes a lot faster.Have a home brew and smile!J.
