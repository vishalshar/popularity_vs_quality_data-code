This fits on a variety of bikes, stems, frames, etc.  It is really pretty secure, even with the rubber bands.  I'd use that.  The zip strips are good if you are on really rough terrain, or have a problem with the mount twisting.I've found this to be very secure, and I like that I can angle any direction (90 degree sectors) without having to move the mount.  Compare to Garmin which is... "oh, did I get that the wrong direction?  Hrmmm"
