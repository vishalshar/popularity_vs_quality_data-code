These are great.We had almost given up on my tween daughter's shoes, and banished them to the garage.  Nothing -- not washing them, or freezing them, or washing her feet constantly seems to make a different.  She just has stinky feet, that child!I want to avoid chemicals in my home wherever possible for all of us, but especially with children's products.  I would rather deal with the stink than with unnecessary chemical exposure.  But I am comfortable with charcoal filters.  I just didn't realize until finding these that they were available in shoe inserts.To be clear, you do NOT wear these in your shoes (they are big); you put them in after taking them off, and take them out when you put your shoes on again.These have made a big difference, and I am very glad I purchased them.  I am going to buy some for our ice and roller skates, as they clearly need the services of these inserts, as well!
