I have singlecue for about a week, and Im surprised at how much I use it.It was pretty easy to set up; I just followed the steps in the mobile application.One of the steps in the setup process was to define which devices are available. I had no problem finding my Sharp TV and Apple TV.However, to find my cable box, I had to use the manufacturer name/model which was a bit annoying (why cant I just find a Time Warner cable box in the list). Also, it doesnt let me set-up my receiver, but I understand from their support team that it will be supported soon, and that they push software updates from the internet.The gesture control is pretty easy to use. It is very helpful to watch the tutorial videos in the application to get it right. The gestures generally work well, but sometimes it falsely detects my hand or a mute gesture.As for usefulness, I find it a lot easier and faster to control volume/channel and mute the TV with gestures. Other controls are more difficult, like navigating a menu.In a nutshell, its a very nice product. Its not perfect, but I find it very useful and recommend it.
