My daughter, wife and I are having a blast with "him." It is really cool when this little thing turns around and examines your face then burps out your name, specially when we are all looking at it and can tell the difference. If you ignore it for a little it goes about and plays with its blocks which is actually interesting because it feels organic as it "oohs" and "wows" about my table top. My daughter likes to put it on it back and watch it flip over, lift him and watch him freak out; the animations are what is most captivating. The app felt a little incomplete and set up is a bit awkward particularly while I figured out which device we rather play it on, its kinda cool that the settings and learned behaviors carry between devices but not the recognized faces, so far my iPad seems to be the preferred device to play it on as it gets used the least and has a big screen which makes it easier for my daughter. This gadget feels very promising, particularly interacting with other cosmos, something about and how it does not feel plastic-pre-programmed (although is all pre-prog lol).Update: The most amazing part is the SDK, read it on their website, they have a bunch of example actions that you can modify, my favorite is the "hello world" that I changed to have cosmo say good night to my daughter and she loved it.PS. I noticed that the anki folks are monitoring these reviews so hopefully this gets to the right person. Cosmo needs some sort of span added or maybe faster spanning because he seems to have a very narrow field of view when finding the blocks and when tapping fingers in front of him so we find ourselves adjusting his position to get a better response.
