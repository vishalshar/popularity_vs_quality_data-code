My son just started playing football this year, so I got him a bottle of this to use on his gloves. I'm not very experienced with football myself, but he seems to like the product a lot. It works well to help his grip and help him play better. It only takes a little bit to go a long way, and it doesn't leave a residue at all. The product does not smell bad - it really doesn't have a smell at all. The bottle was a good price and will last him a long time, so I'm happy with the purchase. I'll probably buy another bottle or two to last him all year since he likes it so much.
