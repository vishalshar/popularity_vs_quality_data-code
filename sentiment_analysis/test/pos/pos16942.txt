Ok so I was really skeptical to have my partner buy this for us. I so wanted to have it because I saw it at my friendÂ’s house but did not think it actually works well. I am really surprised.- The VOC numbers are pretty accurate. We tested it with our Netatmo one and they were pretty close but I like the feature on this one much better- The humidity and temperature are a little off for me but I have same issue with two other products that I have. Yeah I love gadgets so I have too many of them!- The app design is brilliantly simple and informative. I just hope I could see the history on the main page rather than changing the tabs but no big deal.- I LOVE the lights on this device. It changes live on the device the moment you are changing it on the app. It is so cool. I have never seen it before like this.I wish the purifier was stronger. It takes long for it to purify my bedroom, like maybe 3 hours.
