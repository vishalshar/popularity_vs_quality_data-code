So I just got these in the mail yesterday and I love them! They were heavier than I expected, but they don't sit heavily on your head, and you can tell how well they are built (should't snap just from being on my head like my trittons and turtle beaches did).The sound is great. While it's not 7.1 surround sound, I was still able to hear footsteps and enemies reloading in Battlefield 1, and know where it came from. I've seen reviews saying that they are almost too loud, but besides when I first put them on and accidentally had the volume all the way up (jumped a little bit) I thought the volume and mix was fantastic.One thing that I was a little thrown off by, is my left ear control was changing how loud my voice was in my ear, while the right cup was changing the game noise (it's reversed on the directions). And I was a little disappointed that when I muted the game volume, my party chat was also muted. This isn't against the headset itself, I was expecting it to mute background noise and only hear the party chat.Overall, I am very excited about this headset, and would recommend it to anyone in the market for one.
