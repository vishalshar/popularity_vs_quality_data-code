Growing up I hated math. I was not good at it and it was a struggle for me. My girls take after me when it comes to math. Not wanting them to hate it like I did, we are always looking for fun ways to make math fun. Prime Climb is not ony a fun game, but it uses multiple math properties.Based off the conepts of addition, subtraction, division and multiplication, your main goal is to get both pegs from 0-101. Sounds all nice and simple, but since you have the opportunity to bump other players off the board, you may not always go for the biggest number. Using math your kids really need to think this through.What we loved about this game, is the ability the player has to customize the game. You can play with just one mathematical property or all of them. This makes it a great grow with me game.I recieved Prime Climb in exchange for an honest review.
