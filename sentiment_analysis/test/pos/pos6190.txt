This little phone is beyond what your expectations may possibly be. It completely surprised me,it works just as we as any full size Android phone on the market. It has great sound quality,great apps and using the keyboard is not as complicated as told. My biggest worry about this phone is losing it!  It is so small it can be over looked anywhere. I absolutely love it....
