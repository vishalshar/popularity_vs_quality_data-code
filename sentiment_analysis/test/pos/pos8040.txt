I literally have a stack of tape measures, every time i go to the hardware store i check them out for something new.After i had a weekend of family and friends over to help with my fence / deck they kept having trouble reading my tape measures. Granted, most of them don't use tape measure that often so i knew they were going to have a little trouble. After hearing them complain about reading the 1/16 and 1/8 marks i started looking for an easy read tape measure.I came across this digital tape measure, and it looked really cool. It is very accurate, switches easily between units of measure Inch / foot / metric.You can find the center of anything lightning fast with no brain power used.Love the inside / outside feature. Normally you use the tape measure lip as the spot to measure too. I had a bunch of areas that the angle changed so i needed a really good measure for inside to inside. You change it to inside measure and i got perfect cuts every time.Another neat feature, after you measure so far out you can reset to zero and keep measuring out. Very handy for multi run dimensions.The hold feature is very handy so you can measure blindly press the hold button and get a great measure, without straining your neck to read it in odd places.Can save the last 2 measurements for reference, that feature is great because you should always measure twice cut once. Being able to save the measurement ensures a more accurate cut, that you can go back to after getting sidetracked lolDon't think its heavy duty or ready for a construction site, but it's awesome for home use and moderate work.
