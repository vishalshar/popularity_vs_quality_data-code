Great design. I use it as blue tooth audio controller which fits in my shirt pocket. I play music and audio books through it coupled to my blue tooth head set. I do not use it as a phone and as such have  just loaded an SD card for storage have not loaded a sim card. . I up-load all apps through Wi-Fi coupling. Using the tiny keyboard is an issue. I use a stylus for needed data entry and even with this care is needed to get it right,  however once you get it set up its operation is flawless. Running apps  (Audible, Pandora, Audio Player, etc.) works with screen-finger selection.  I get about 4-5 hours of play per charge. Once i start blue tooth listening, I turn off the screen to allow extended battery life.
