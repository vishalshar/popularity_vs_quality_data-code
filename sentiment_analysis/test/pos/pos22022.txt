I was excited to finally get a production pair of the goggles in my hands. Having seen several prototypes of this product and having tried numerous other VR Goggles I was curious as to what the finished product would look like. Here are the pro and cons of the Merge Product:Pros1 - The most comfortable goggles I have tried - while seeming almost indestructible under normal wear and tear2 - Unit comes with two inputs allowing additional control - really well thought-out and designed3 - Lenses are much higher quality than almost every other set I have tried - plus they are adjustable4 - If you are a germaphobe the unit also seems much more hygienic as it is very easy to clean5 - Much more durable than almost any other unit I have played with - throw it in your backpack or let the kids play with it6 - Quality made product - just feels good in your hands and on your headCons1 - Wish the wireless controller was already available2 - Can't wait for some of the new games to launchIf you are ready to upgrade your experience or make the jump to VR these are the goggles to buy.
