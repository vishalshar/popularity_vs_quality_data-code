My cats have food allergies and sensitive stomachs. I am on my second bag and so far no issues and very little upset stomach issues. Very glad considering its about half the cost of the special diet foods. Love the plastic foil type bag instead of the typical thick paper/cardboard style. Keeps the food fresh longer.
