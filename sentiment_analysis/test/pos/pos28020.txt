I love it- follow all their directions with the seeds and I have a crop ready to use tomorrow of the wheat grass and radish sprouts. It's simple and cute in my corner of my work space at home. It's quiet, and no fish stink. My betta seems so happy, and the water is still clean after two weeks. I feel like I should dump a little out and refill with fresh water soon. My brother got the same tank, but didn't follow directions, his tank got filthy quickly because he was over feeding his betta, of course any tank would get messy if you chunk a whole bunch of flakes in it daily. lol! We cleaned it together, it's a two person job for sure, but totally worth it. Self-cleaning is true to a degree, but any living creatures or plants require our care and wisdom too. lol! Some people on  here are complaining about doing some work, but come on, it's a very fun and rewarding chore I think. It makes my morning happier to see my sweet fish and little sprouts growing. Radish sprouts and wheat grass are low light so I have them right to the side of my front window, my front window doesn't get direct rays of sun, but I think its been just enough to draw the plants towards it and give them some sun light nourishment. :DI give it 5 stars because it is what you make of it, and for me it's been a good make! Attached is a photo from just one week of starting this thing with seeds! :D
