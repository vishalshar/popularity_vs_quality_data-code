First of let me say I am a big fan of IoT's.  This is one of the biggest reasons i bought this.Being able to set and control my sprinklers from my phone is awesome.  Its great being able to be in the backyard turn on the sprinklers. Makes testing a new nozzle without having to run to the garage and then back outside a whole lot easier.  Like wise if something goes amiss and is spraying water everywhere.I am pretty imprested with Rachio's website and the KB's they have available. As an engineer we live and die by documentation. Finding answers with a search is a big plus.My biggest complaint about APP's these days is not everyone has updated for larger iOS screens.  The Rachio app is a prime example.  Thats my one negitive comment.  Other than that it works great.  The layout isn't very intuitive but if you click around you can find some pretty cool features. For instance they have a "pipes are hammering" setting.  Interestingly enough my pipes do this.  WIth this setting enabled it stopped it.  Not a well advertised feature but its there if you just look around the app.I do like the auto schedule adjustments based off weather and wind etc.  It seems to do a great job at adjusting seasonally to add or reduce watering. That being said the watering times that it automatically setup for me where way too long.  Just a quick adjustment down and i was in business.It was super easy to connect to Wifi.  Uses the sensor on the front of the unit with your screen blinking to program it.  I had to do it twice because i didn't point the screen at it fast enough. When the count down begins point it at it right away.Works with IFTTT for logging and other options.Shows you estimated water usage.  The more detailed you are with programing your nozzles in the better this estimate will be.It has a high price tag but I think it was worth it.
