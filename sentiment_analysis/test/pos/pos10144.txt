I got my first bottle of SmartyPants a month ago from a friend and found them on Amazon while doing some shopping so I definitely had to get bottle #2! I gotta tell ya. Speaking as a person with stomach issues, these gummies are my savior. After years of taking ibuprofen from college athletics (I'm 30 now) my digestive system was a wreck. Three ulcers, IBS and several other stomach issues later, I have to be very picky when it comes to any supplements and pills (prescription or none) that I take. My girlfriend with kids was talking to me about SmartyPants one day when we were out to lunch and she mentioned that they also had an adult version so she got me a bottle when she ordered some for her and her kids. Most multi-vitamins I tried to take not only lacked what I needed since I still workout and train quite a bit in the gym to maintain my girlish lean figure *wink wink* but all those other supplements were REALLY hard on my stomach :( So, of course I decided to up the intake of fruits/vegetables/healthy diet to try to compensate, but honestly my physician told me that wouldn't COMPLETELY work since you also need certain minerals to process vitamins even from regular foods properly. I was skeptical about the SmartyPants Gummies since they looked SUPER sugary which I figured would rip my digestive system in two. Although I'm not a CANDY person, I decided to give SmartyPants vitamins a try when she gave me the goods. They're sooooo easy on my stomach, my general physician said they actually contain a sufficient about of vitamins, minerals and nutrients in the adult version to support my needs and they're surprisingly not sickeningly sweet! The sugars they use are organic and all natural which my tummy <3s.I could honestly take all 4 in the morning, but I like to take two in the morning and two in the afternoon right before I go work out since in my opinion, I get a little boost of every from the B-vitamins. Overall, BEST vitamins I have ever taken. SO I guess gummy vitamins aren't only for kids and I recommend these to any adult!  THANKS SMARTYPANTS! You def have an adult fan :)Here's their website also if you want to check out the company for yourself.[...]I think they may even have discount codes floating around on their website but Amazon really does offer a great discounted price on these.
