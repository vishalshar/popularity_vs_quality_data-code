I am giving five stars to the tracker as a gorgeous piece of, really, jewelry quality.  The phone software is totally mediocre and I reviewed it poorly in my other posting, which must be on the watch band style band.  I would advise you try to find that as I go into more detail about making a decision on whether this style is right for you, and if you want to deal with the inaccuracies of the software, as well as its limitations.
