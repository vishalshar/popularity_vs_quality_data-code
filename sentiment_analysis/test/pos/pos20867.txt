I was pretty excited not to have to tie my shoes anymore -- yeah, I'm that lazy. I stand on my feet all day so my shoe fit is really important to me. With these Hickies, once I figured out the best placement in my shoes I really do like them. They are a bit more snug than your typical shoelaces, but at least your shoes stay on your feet!
