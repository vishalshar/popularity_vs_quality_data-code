I saw this on kickstarter and was hesitant due to the plastic base.  Good thing I waited for the aluminum version.  The base is SOLID and fits very securely in both of the vehicles I switch between (Audi / Honda).  Some complained about the angle of how the phone rests on the holder, but if most tasks the angle of vision is sufficient.  The pillars on the side which hold the phone in place are thin enough to not obscure the screen on the far edges (for those apps that have items along the sidebar).  I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a phone holder that is NOT a suction cup or placemat fan.
