Odd shaped bulbs for my house (maybe others have flush-to-cieling A19's), but these bulbs have a great app, decent Alexa support and work well. I can change the color of the bulbs through Alexa via a cumbersome vocabulary, but they do work. They lose a star because you can only change color to their presents via voice, and there isn't a "custom" slot you can create.Their app is kinda neat, as it allows you to use your phone or device to change the bulb's "style", such as candlelight or a fire. App only, though...
