I had been looking for vitamin gummy bears so I can have a healthy snack and curb my daily sugar intake. I came across Smarty Pants on Amazon. Altruistic, the manufacturer of this product makes the product in the U.S. and gives back to help malnourished kids. I was also very happy about the added omega-3 these vitamin gummies have. This means I do not have to eat additional fish oil gels, which are pretty costly. But even with Omega-3s, my first issue with these vitamins is the price. At about $18-20 for a month's supply (each bottle contains 180 gummies, and the adult dosage is six gummies per day), these easily cost more than regular vitamins and also more than gummy vitamin bears, even taking into account supplmenting other vitamins/gummies with fish oil gels.My other gripe is the sourness of these gummies. They're on the Sour Path Kids candy side of sour. If you've had Sour Patch Kids, you'll know what I'm talking about--these vitamin gummies have a sprinkled layer of cane sugar on top of the sour gummy. If you've never had Sour Patch Kids before, try some of the candy before you shell out $20 for a huge bottle of Smarty Pants gummies and see if you like the taste. These vitamins, however, are a BOON for those who love Sour Patch Kids. I used to like Sour Patch when I was a kid, but they're just too acidic for me now, and the taste of these Smarty Pants gummies are too sour for me. They're not pucker your cheeks sour, but they're almost there because they make my mouth water due to the acidity. This may be due to the Vitamin C in these gummies, but it's just too much to chew for me.Finally, these vitamins also lack calcium, so some, especially women, may need to supplement calcium intake. If you drink plenty of milk and eat lots of calcium rich/fortified foods, you're probably fine.Bottom line: if you need calcium, prepare to supplement these Smarty Pants gummies with calcium; if you don't like anything too acidic or sour, stay away; and if you can afford $20 a month for these then Smarty Pants gummies is probably the best way for you to get your vitamins!
