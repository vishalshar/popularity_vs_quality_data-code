We have been looking for something to monitor our chihuahua now that we have been away from home more often. We have tried a few products but mostly they just let you watch as your dog destroys the house - no bueno. I was hesitant to buy this product as it didn't look like it would show enough of the room and the mixed reviews. We are delighted that we took the chance!!With the camera's wide lens (138 degrees) we were able to see most of our living room. Not sure why there have been so many complaints about the camera quality - while it wasn't like watching IMAX, the quality was solid streaming video. I suspect earlier versions of the PetCube had a lower quality but the current version is great! The two-way sound works better than any other product we tried. Instead of looking around the room like "what is that?!?!" at the muted or garbled voice on other products, our dog actually responds to our commands like we are in the room ( I even had a conversation with my husband through the cube earlier today). The laser is a cool bonus that lets us exercise our dog throughout the day so she isn't a terror when we get home. Best part?!?!? You can share it with your family or friends. My niece loves logging into the afternoon to play with our dog. And now our dog (who is usually shy) recognizes our nieces voice and is much more willing to play with her when she visits!!I HIGHLY recommend this product. I've been raving about it to all my friends!! If you are hesitant to throw down the money for this right away, I recommend downloading the app and test it out - you can connect with other pets who are in public mode to see the quality of the camera and use the laser pointer. We had a blast playing with other pets before we made the jump. So happy we finally bought this - Love it!!
