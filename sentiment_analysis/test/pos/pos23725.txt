I don't use a RokForm case because they don't make a belt clip that I like, but I do use their magnets. I buy one of these inserts for their case and just glue it to the back of the case I do use. Make sure it's aligned on the back and doesn't look sloppy and you're ready to go. The magnet is strong and once you've had a magnet on your phone, you'll always want a magnet on your phone. Unlocks a world of mounting opportunities. Just keep it away from hotel room keys. Doesn't seem to affect credit cards though.
