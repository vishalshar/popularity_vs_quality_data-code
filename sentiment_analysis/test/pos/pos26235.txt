I love Solid Gold products.  The lack of the 4th star is for what appears to be a different mix of dog food inside the package. For some reason when I buy from Amazon the dog food kibble is DIFFERENT from when I buy from PetCo or Solid Gold. Why is it smaller and dryer?  The other I buy has larger, darker kibble, and seems to be infused with Salmon Oil, while this is like a diet version, small, light colored, and dry.  My dog eats it, but I'm not happy about it
