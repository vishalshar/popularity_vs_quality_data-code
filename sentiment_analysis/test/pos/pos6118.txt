In reality I should be giving this laptop a 5 star. It rocks anything I throw at it regarding high end graphics. However, I have one gripe that is not entirely minor. Namely the function keys don't come preprogrammed. I.E. all the secondary features such as volume up and down and just don't work. After some research I have found a patch that unfortunately did not fix it. I am sure I will eventually get it fixed, but this may be beyond the average plug and play user.
