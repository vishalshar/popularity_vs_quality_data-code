I love it! I bought it for my office because I work at a tech startup and we love 3d printing technologies so I thought people would want to play around with this. Everyone had so much fun testing it out. It is such a cool product. We made our logo and have it on display on our coffee table. I will say though - you should read the directions carefully and prepare for a learning curve. You cannot just pick this right up and expect it to work like a regular pen. You have to get used to the speed and flow of the plastic. But once you do, wow! The possibilities for creative exploration are huge. I am planning on buying a few more as christmas gifts. Appropriate for older kids and adults. Makes a great gift bc it is unique and thoughtful and fun!
