Extremely fun and tough little robot. I can confirm that it is both pet (dog) and water-proof. I had the opportunity to play with Sphero in Miami with a dog and a pool. The dog went crazy and eventually picked it up in her mouth. No damage. I also tossed Sphero in the pool and it worked fabulously (though don't expect it to move quickly). Such a fun little robot.
