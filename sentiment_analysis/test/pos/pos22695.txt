Id like to be able to give this more than five stars.  The myLIFTER is an ingenious device.  Very solidly built, easy to install.  It took me about two hours to install four units with pulleys.  The installation instruction videos are clear and concise.  The bluetooth app is very well thought out and performs just as advertised.  Pairing and setting up four devices and then grouping them to work together took maybe fifteen minutes.Performance is exactly as advertised.  I tested loads for each unit separately and for four linked and they were easily able to handle the maximum combined weight, which in this case is 400 pounds.  The app shows how much the load is taxing the devices, which is extremely useful when youre getting close to capacity.Ive been looking for months for a solution like this and I can say there is no product on the market that begins to compete with the myLIFTER.  Yes, there are hoists than will lift more weight, but they are expensive, cannot be linked, cannot be operated wirelessly, and use far more vertical space than the my LIFTER does.  In my case, I had a very tight vertical constraint and these units take up the least space I can imagine for a device of this power.There are less expensive hoist/storage systems on the market, but they are not motorized, are built flimsily, and cant lift nearly what the myLIFTER can.  The other products have no remote capability, no ability to connect more than one and have them work together effectively and safely.  The small manual hoist systems on the market seem to have a tendency for the weight to shift/drop as the cable finds its way onto the spool.  The myLIFTERs design ensures that you will have none of those problems.Customer service has been above and beyond.  Ive bought six units so far.  Ive had minor glitches with two of them.  In one case, my assistant failed to pay attention to the very explicit instruction not to free the cable until some tension has been put on it.  As a result the line got tangled and crimped.  The second glitch is something that may never have affected the operation of my units, but I wanted to replace it just in case.  I talked to the people at myLIFTER and they could not have been more helpful and cordial.  Notwithstanding that I had bought the units on Amazon  not directly from myLIFTER  they sent me two brand new replacement units (they paid for shipping the new units as well as return shipping), and they sent the replacements even before I shipped my units back to them!  They did not charge for the damage to the unit that was clearly my fault.I cant say enough good things about the folks at myLIFTER.  I dont write a lot of product reviews but Im very happy to write this one.  I hope it gives you confidence that this is a fantastic, solid product made and sold by fantastic, solid people.
