It really works.  I ordered the package with 4.  I atrached one to my keyholder, one to my car keys, one to my bag and one to my i phone charger (my daughter always takes).Just one day later we went out with friends and I was planning to show them how my tracker beeps.  However, it turned out that I forgot my keys home.  The good thing is that you can see the last location where it connected to my phone.  So I knew for sure that i did not dropped them somewhere and that they were home.  When we are bank I can not see the keys in the table I usually keep.  I started walking room by room and finally the phone gets the signal. I pressed the green button and the beeping signal comes from a closet.  It would have taken me maybe hours to find the keys without th TrackR.  Thanks
