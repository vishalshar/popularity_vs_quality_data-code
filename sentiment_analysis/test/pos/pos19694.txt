If urban armor gear keeps making cases for new phones, I will keep buying them. This company is amazing and I love their products. Never had a problem. The button feedback is amazing through these cases. Functionality of the phone is not affected at all. I also had this case for my Galaxy S4 and I had the same positive experience. I cannot find anything bad about the case. Maybe I wish it was solid black, and not dark smoke black.
