Powerful remote.  Average ergonomics and average user interface design.My first Logitech remote -- I'd been thinking of buying one for a long time.  This replaces four remotes for me (DVR, Receiver, TV, Bluray).  Very happy with the performance, after going through the setup process.You'll need to be tech savvy to navigate the setup process, and likely need to research online how to do some things you'd think would be easy or intuitive, like changing inputs on your receiver without also powering on/off devices.PROS:Will replace every remote in your arsenal.  Devices are pre-programmed, so you just need to enter the model number and the functionality will be imported.CONS:The ergonomics of the remote are average at best.  All buttons are low-profile, somewhat hard plastic, and generally non-tactile.  The remote is on the smaller side (as opposed to a typical DVR remote) and as such, the buttons are mostly similar in shape, making it very difficult to "feel" for any particular button.  For example, MUTE on my Verizon remote was directly above the volume rocker and was a distinct, high-profile, horizontal shape.  MUTE here is a standard, low-profile horizontal shape near other similarly low-profile horizontal shapes.Similarly, the DVR button (another frequent access) is below the mute button (too low on the remote) and is a nearly identical shape to all it's surrounding buttons.In essence, you'll need to constantly look at the remote to press the button you want -- which is painful if you're used to "feeling" your way around a tactile remote.Programming -- a few major failures here:First, FF/REV SKIP is not the default choice for the dual-functionality buttons, and will likely require you to research how to change the setting.  I'm an engineer who plays all video games on HARD mode and I had to research how to change this setting -- it wasn't intuitive at all from the interface.Second, "Activities", such as switching inputs on your TV or Receiver, want to also power toggle the devices involved, unless you manually set the device in question to NOT TOGGLE power.  It's completely unintuitive that you should *need* to do this, and then further unintuitive to figure out how to achieve this.  Again, this required searching on the Internet to figure out.But, worse by far, however, is the fact that you need to SYNC your changes from the PC app to the remote after each change and the fact that the SYNC option is HIDDEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SETTINGS MENU, three clicks and a scroll away.  Absolutely TERRIBLE UI design.  Here's how you get there:  Settings Icon->Settings->(scroll past Remote, Activities, Devices, Settings Lock, and General to finally get to "Sync Remote")  Absolutely ridiculous that the FIRST THING everyone needs to do is HIDDEN three clicks away and below FIVE items the average person will never need to access.  Someone in the Logitech human interface department should be fired on the spot for this implementation.
