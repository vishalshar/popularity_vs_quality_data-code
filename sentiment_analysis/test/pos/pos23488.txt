This is THE BEST LO CAL HI FIBER SNACK EVER !! Be careful when ordering...be SURE you check the "calories per cup" as the difference is HUGE from one tasty type, to other flavors !! The aqua colored bag, is only 30 calories a cup, and tastes FABULOUS !! Just the right amount of sweet and salty...Everyone from adults, teens to 5 year old grand kids...just loved it. The Carmel/Chocolate drizzle is TOO GOOD, and a WHOPPING 95 calories a cup. If you have no weight issues....go for it !! but, if you'd like a snack that you can actually "chow down on"...like eating 1/2 the bag...the sweet/salty aqua bag is the one for you !!  Did I mention it's FRESH, JUST POPPED FLAVER??? Bought the entire HUGE 12 bag box for my Husband...the popcorn king, for a Valentines Day gift...the box was SOO big, he was sure I'd gotten him a great power tool...but when he tasted the wonder flavors, he was hooked !!!
