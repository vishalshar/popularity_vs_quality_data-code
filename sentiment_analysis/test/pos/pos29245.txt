3 complaints:1. Comes with no indication that it has the ability to play 5 different internet radio stations2. Not a straightforward task to change the preset stations (I have yet to call customer service on this)3. Volume control is incremental , not fluid. I find one setting too loud and one has to take an entire"step" down whicjh I find too soft -- no in-between.
