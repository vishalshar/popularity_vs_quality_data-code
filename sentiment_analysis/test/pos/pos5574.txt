Seems to work as promised. Unit is small and light weight. Like the fact that mom-in-law can hit the button for any reason she feels compelled! The people responding have been kind and helpful so far. Although she is hard of hearing the call quality has been excellent. The charging cradle is also a great solution to weaker eyes trying to hook up a charger.  Four star rating for choice of service plans. The plan with fall detection also includes device replacement which adds to the monthly cost. The device is inexpensive enough and out of pocket replacement cost is so low I do wish they would do away with this profit padding fee.
