I bought this for my son who just turned 11.  I can't say enough good things about this product and this company.  First it's a fairly unique toy that is easy to build.  All the parts fit together well, with clear instructions.  Great intro to electronics, and the end result of the 'learning' is a really cool video game machine.  My son just loves it and can't stop talking about the 'computer' he built.  I did have issues with the battery pack, which gave me an opportunity to contact customer service.  Again, very impressed.  I got another battery pack without hassles.If you're looking for a fun toy that is educational, this is it.
