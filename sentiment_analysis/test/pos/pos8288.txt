Product works really well so far. Feels about as weighty as a regular watch. One thing that I do not like is how the strap fits. The silicone strap feels fine but I guess my wrist is an in-between size because it's either too loose or too tight. I wish withings made a sports band you could purchase that was super adjustable (like a commercial Velcro or something or a more adjustable clamp with no holes).Watch app works great with the my fitness pal app. The watch detects when I am sleeping and the duration o sleep spot on. So far I love this. It's great looking when I am in uniform (I am military) and it doesn't draw attention to itself. It looks professional and not like a bulky rubber band like most fitness trackers
