This was a cool product.  I can't really fault it for performing poorly in something it wasn't meant to do, but ultimately I had to return it.  I wanted to use it to locate areas of the body where there is inflammation, muscle/tissue adhesions, and other forms of stagnation and heat.  The idea was that this would guide my clinical thinking.  It simply is not sensitive enough to show small temperature differences in human tissue.
