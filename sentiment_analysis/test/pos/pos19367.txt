I fall asleep like nobody's business with this device, but waking up is a lot harder, once in the morning I put the energetic one on, wrapped myself in a blanket and *several hours later* was late to work.It's easy to use, strips keep stickiness for quite a while, easy to on/of, charging simple mini USB, about an hour. Doesn't last more than an hour though. But for falling asleep you don't need it.I know no one explains it, but you have to really feel the beat, go with it, pay attention to it, and be prepared to go to sleep, in order for it to work. Not reading Facebook on your phone while it plays in the background. Close your eye and feel it. You will be gone in 15 minutes. With energizing one I guess you just do the opposite.Good luck!
