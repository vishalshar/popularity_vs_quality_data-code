Fun backyard game.  The randomness of the ball bouncing from the ramp/net makes for a lot of fun play time.  The Family and I have a boat load of fun playing this game.  This adds a lot more to the game of cornhole with the team mate on the other side trying to catch a bounced shot for points if a miss occurs.  A lot of fun backyard game!
