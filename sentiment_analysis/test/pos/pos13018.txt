I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars all for one reason - the limited number of platforms available for live streaming. If Youtube were supported for live streaming I'd give it 5 for sure.The software is simple to use and pretty impressive. This little camera does a fantastic job and makes it possible to do a nice streaming event with a level of quality that used to cost a lot more money.I run the app on an ipad. I can see how it would work on an iphone - but it seems like the screen would be a bit small. On the ipad its very nice. Setup was pretty straightforward and connecting my facebook account was easy. I'm not interested in paying what Livestream wants to use their service. I use an external mic which uses the headphone jack. I'm not sure how that works on the newer iphones without a jack.So that's it in a nutshell. Awesome camera, impressive software and what feels like a push to force you to pay Livestream to actually use it live.
