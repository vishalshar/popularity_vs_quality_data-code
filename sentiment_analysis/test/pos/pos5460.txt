The Pearl Magnetic Phone mount is the best designed mount I have seen in the market.  I Do Not like VHB over my dash and the vent clip of the Pearl mount works perfect for me.  It grabs the vent and stays rigid.  The magnetic strength must have been through some serious engineering design, it holds the phone well but also effortless when detaching the phone from the mount.  I definitely will buy another one for my parents car.
