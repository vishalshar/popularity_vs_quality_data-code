Great light.Tons of options.It did take 23 minutes to update firmware in the bulb after it connected to my network.Also be sure to update the app firmware as well.After all that it works great.Has lots of modes like: candle flicker,spooky mode,relax mode,2500k warm white up to 9000k blue white.Well worth the money.Plus you do not need to buy a seperate hub.
