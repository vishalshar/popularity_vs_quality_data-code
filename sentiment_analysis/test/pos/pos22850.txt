These cheese bags are really great. I can't believe my hard cheese has not molded in the 7 weeks it has been stored in this bag. In the past I cut off an amount of cheese from the large block, and vacuum packed it, while using tightly wrapped plastic wrap for the part of the cheese I'll be eating. But no way does the wrapped piece remain mold free if so much time goes by. The cheese in the cheese bag is just loosely in there, yet is completely protected. I love these bags, wish I'd known about them before. It's nice to be able to eat a slice of cheese and then just put the remainder in the cheese bag, fold down the top, and put back in the fridge.
