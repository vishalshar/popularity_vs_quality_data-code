This is a great product! The saying "you get what you pay for" has never been more true. Yes, this feeder is more expensive than most, but here's the important thing: it WORKS!  It's built as solid as a rock. The very intelligent, 15lb cat I bought it for can't knock it over, unplug it, get inside it, or move it around the room, despite his best efforts.My mother has been taking care of a young ragdoll cat. This particular breed is known for overeating. If you try to free-feed them, they pretty much explode. This cat was waking my mother up at 3am to be fed. Closing the door to her bedroom didn't help since Ragdolls, like Siamese, have seriously whiny meows. At her age, she can ill-afford lost sleep and it was clearly wearing on her. I needed something that would work reliably, and most automatic feeders are easily pried open or knocked over. The FeedandGo worked perfectly. After about a week of using this feeder, the cat started letting her sleep though the night. Going strong for a month now.Of top of that, the customer service was GREAT! I needed rush shipping since I was only going to be at her house for a limited time. Customer support responded very quickly and the feeder arrived right on time.Minor disclaimers (really just some small quibbles) - 1. The product claims to be airtight. It isn't. Yes, all the pieces fit flush and critters will not be able to get in, but air can definitely circulate through. There aren't any pressure seals to create an actual "airtight" seal. My mother's cat definitely smells the food inside. He tries to open the device in a way that he never does with the airtight cannister in which his kibble is stored. 2. The release buttons for unlocking require quite a bit of force. My mother can barely open the top. It's built this way so that stronger pets can't get inside, which is great, but it would be nice if elderly ladies with small hands had an easier time of opening it -- what with them being so prone to cat-ownership and all.Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this product. Yes, there are cheaper feeders, but if they break or can be pried open, then you'll spend more money on replacements and alternate models. This is a well-made product that is worth the price. I would recommend it to anyone who asks.
