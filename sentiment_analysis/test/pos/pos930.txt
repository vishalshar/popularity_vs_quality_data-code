This little duck is a great educational tool for little ones ranging from 6 months to 3 years.  While our daughter is at the younger end of that spectrum, she still loves playing with the duck and it's a toy she can grow into.  I really like the fact that you can spend money on something like this and she can grow into it and continue to learn with it over such a large age range, versus only a few months.  It's a good value, for sure.
