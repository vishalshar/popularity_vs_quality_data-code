saw the big spatula in a store and noticed it has a definite beveled front to it to help it get under the food- plus it's not flimsy like so many I've looked at. The other spatulas in the set are perfect for scrambling eggs and other cooking tasks you need scraping ability as they don't melt. And the red goes well with my black and stainless kitchen :)
