Bought used, but came in great shape. I had an issue with the latest Lifx android v3.3.3 app to "claim" the bulb to the cloud account of Lifx, Wifi connection was a better experience. Color accuracy and brightness were far better than a Philip Hue bulb by a long short. To really get the deep red, green, or any other color you must keep it around 50% to 65% brightness, after that it will be wash out. Yes, it still a expensive Wifi bulb, so the used cost help me out a little, but I think it worth if you need to run a few in your house.*Helpful hint if running Android app* - Why need a cloud account to work with the LIfx bulb is so I can use the Lifx bulb with Amazon Alexa and IFTTT and here my resolution was with the help of a support staff with Lifx. I had to use and register the Lifx bulb to a Windows 10 Lifx app. Running the setup thru it and it work now (iOS or WIndows mobile 10 app may work too, but I have neither device).
