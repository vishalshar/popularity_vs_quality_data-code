This device is really nice.  It tells you all the information about your bedroom, Tempature, humidity, light and noise levels.  I love the sleep sounds, that really do help me fall asleep.  It tracks your nights sleep and monitors your movement and noise levels. The only thing I'm not happy with is the sleep pill battery is already low and needs to be replaced.  I've only had it for 41 days!
