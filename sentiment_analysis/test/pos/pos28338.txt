The best stylus I have used on my iPad Air 2.  Markedly superior to other styluses (styli ?) I have used, from el cheapos, to expensive ones by Adonit ($100).  I wish I had found the Pencil last year, and I would have saved money and hassle in getting a responsive stylus that allows me to work well in drawing apps and onenote.
