I ordered these before a trip to sunny Florida, unfortunately they arrived just after my flight.  While I was on my trip I found them in stock at Ron Johns, in some of the colors I was looking for but couldn't find here.  I snagged a pair and ended up going back for another.Here's the deal, these are super comfortable. I've owned a bunch of different brand compression shorts and these are hands down more comfortable all the way around.  The waist band rides at a normal height, so no it will not ride above your trunks (looked like they would ride high if you visit there web site) and you cant really feel it the way you can on other compression shorts.  The dry time is quick.  Best part was that I usually can't go out for dinner after a few hours at the beach because I feel salty and uncomfortable but after throwing these on and taking a swim I felt totally comfortable throwing on the t-shit and heading out without so much as a freshwater shower.Con's: Cost, and they are pretty thin so I'll have to update about durability but they seemed fine out of the wash.
