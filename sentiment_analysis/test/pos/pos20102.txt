Great phone if you're a geek. The only problem encountered is there is a fault with the headphone jack where it will pause music on its own when plugged into the headphone jack. Doesnt really effect me because i primarily use bluetooth headphones. The bright side is their tech support is really helpful and very personable and willing to help with info if you want to venture into custom roms etc
