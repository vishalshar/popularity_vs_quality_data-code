It works!! But, it seems the trick is to put the dry in ingredients in first, then the ball, then the liquid. Otherwise, you have to shake too much and your pancakes get tough. Alton Brown would think this a terrible product because its a "unitasker" (only serves one purpose). But I like it; makes pancake day quicker and easier!
