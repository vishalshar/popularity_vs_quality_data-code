I have just ordered Apple Meem cable and found out that I have over paid, everybody is cheaper than Amazon not only that you are charging $20 more than the company's retail, what's happening ? The MEEM cable is amazing and simple to use.  I love the product,  I want to know why Amazon has priced it incorrectly.  I would like to purchase some more MEEM cables when the price is corrected.  Thank you,  Bryan
