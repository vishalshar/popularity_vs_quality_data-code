Ive been looking at activity trackers ever since Nike fired everyone who worked on the FuelBand. Now Im no runner, or gym rat, I just want something understated that shows my progressand boy is that harder to find than it seems. Fitbits with progress indicators only come in bombastic, and Ups, while understated, only show your progress in their apps. Ive gone the Apple Watch route multiple times, but the tradeoffs it took to become a computing platform made it into a worse fitness tracker for me.The Withings Activité, on the other hand, is just a smarter watch. And because of that, battery life is measured in months, swims arent a problem, and I can wear it anywhere. I cant think of a better product for my needs.
