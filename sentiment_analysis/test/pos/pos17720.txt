I was a little disappointed when I bought my Apple Watch to see how small it looked on my wrist, even though I popped for the larger 42mm version.  I've always worn regular watches with larger cases (44mm, 46mm, 50mm, etc.) so I needed something to make the Apple Watch feel more at home on my wrist.Enter LUNATIK EPIK.  No idea why they feel the need to do all caps for the brand name AND the product name, but whatevs.  This thing rocks!  It looks killer, was a piece of cake to get the watch in, and works flawlessly.  Plus it comes in a few different colors, so if you're one of those, you can match your watch to your outfit (or shoes? murse?  not sure what the protocol is there).The ONLY hiccup is that the case is so large and heavy, it made the watch slide off the stand I bought for it for my nightstand.  Bought a new stand the watch can lay flat on though, problem solved.
