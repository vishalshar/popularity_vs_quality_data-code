oh my gosh, this peanut butter is heaven.  I eat this PB on a spoon every day for a snack. I hate to share it with my kids. Sometimes I will make them a PBJ sandwich and they comment, wow this PB was really good mom. Then I feel badly that I try to keep it all for myself. Yes, it is kind of expensive, but to me it is worth every penny. So good! Creamy and a touch of honey. Now I need to go get a spoon of it. Yum.
