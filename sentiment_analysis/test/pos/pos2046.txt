Great concept. My son loves it. My complaint as a mom would be it does not keep good warm until my sons lunch time. Today I finally tried wrapping the outside of the  thermos in foil. (you can't see it because you place it in the compartment. Hoping he comes home to tell me it was warm. I am heating his food up way more then normal in hopes it would stay warm but no such luck.Love the compartment sizes. No place for a drink really or silverware but we make it work.
