I bought 6 of these at Christmas after the airlines lost my son's bag for 2 days. They work great! We have been able to trace them everywhere including the Dominican Republic. Last week my son flew back to school in Virginia after finishing his spring break. When he got to Lynchburg, he knew his bag was still in Charlotte even before the luggage started coming down the belt. He was able to grab it off the next flight but it was good to at least know where it was. The only trouble I have had was that the power plug-in broke in one of them after only 2 uses which is why I ordered this one. I have to contact the vendor about this. But I would recommend these to anyone.
