I have had my Spire now for a few months.  Of all the wearables I have tried (Nike, Jawbone UP, Fitbit Flex, and Charge) I like the Spire far more than any other, and I am really happy that I don't have to wear and ugly band on my wrist.The Spire's design is beautiful and minimalist and so is the charger. The gentle vibrations are great reminders.  The app interface is easy to understand, and I'm not constantly inundated with messages or animated fireworks when I reach a goal.  It integrates well with my Apple Watch, and fastens securely to my clothes.  And even though it's water resistant, it luckily hasn't ended up in the wash like another clip on that I tried.I have an irregular breathing pattern and tend to hold my breath without realizing it.  My Spire notices and gently reminds me to take a breath, or a moment to de-stress when I am tense.  I love it!  I cant wait to see what updates they have planned for the future.Another reviewer had mentioned they found the idea of an electronic device for mindfulness to be distasteful, but I find it just the opposite. My life is so hectic and fast paced. I am thankful to have a tool that can sense when I'm tense even before I do.  It has definitely helped me make progress in my ability to be present and de-stress.
