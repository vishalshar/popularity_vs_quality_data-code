These things are awesome! My son REFUSES to learn to tie his shoes, which means I pick him up from school everyday and his shoes are untied, laces shredded. These little contraptions stay in place, make the shoe a snug slip on, and only look a little cheesy. I bought 3 more packs to replace the laces in all of his shoes. We are two weeks in and everyone is still happy with this innovation!
