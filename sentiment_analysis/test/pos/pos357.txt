This will actually be my first review for amazon.... I felt the Leesa Mattress would be the one I do first.I have to say, the mattress is decent to good! The shipping was incredibly fast. It arrived earlier than the estimated arrival date given by amazon.After watching a lot of youtube videos on the mattress I decided to give it a shot. It looked pretty good from the reviews.For my review, I would like to really start off by saying that I have been through about 3 mattresses within the last year and a half. I moved with a uhaul so all my mattresses could have come with me but I swapped them out (selling them) because I couldn't find a mattress I liked. I have had restless nights - have tried PRICEY pillow-top mattresses from the mattress store, that was too soft and had a permanent dent within 2-3 months. With the sleepless nights, I was told that FIRM beds were better for you and as I was waking up with occasional 'aches and pains' from the pillow top, i tried going to a FIRM mattress..... That was a fail too. I tried buying a memory foam top to try to get that 'therapeutic' effect that they're famously acclaimed for..... but my nights were still eh.... minimum 4 hours to the max 6 hours! I'm in good standing health, I would say i'm an athletically built 5'11" male weighing in at 220lbs that just seemed to not really be able to find a mattress that did it for me. Sleeping was NOT enjoyable, nor was it 'that' bad.... just whatever.NOW, to the product.... I will say 4/5 stars off the bat.1) because after the first night, i've been getting MINIMUM 6 hours of sleep and have slept up to about 7.5 hrs max. Instant difference and I feel 'fresh'. Don't take it too far thinking this bed is something that will just automatically have you wake up a different person, BUT I will say i'm just more well-rested.2) whether on your side, back, stomach.... you do not feel aches and pains, or the normal stress on my body that I would get on occasion from different mattresses. I actually slept somewhat on my side, leaning into part of my stomach, and just didn't have a complaint with it. Great in this department.MY ONLY reason for not giving it a full 5 star and deducting a star, is the reviews definitely said it was like a 6 firm rating out of 10 firmness rating. I want to say it's almost 7-8. You don't feel completely sunk in, but there have only been a couple times where I was thinking "well, if it was just a TAD softer, I think it would be perfect!!! it's just a fraction too firm for me... if that makes sense.Other than that.... I think it's a unique way of shipping a mattress and it boggles my mind that technology/production can do such things now with mattresses. I HOPE that this mattresses lasts for years as I do NOT plan to return it NOR try another mattress. I've been overall satisfied and getting better sleep.... so I'm going to stick with it. Down the road if there is any indentation or issues, I'll update but so far with a WEEK with it.... I'm overall satisfied!!!!!
