Love it.  We noticed that this camera gets mixed reviews and they seem to based on user expectations and desired end products.  After holding back more than a year while considering mixed reviews, we finally took the leap and got one.  We have been AMAZED at the fine detail in the macro shots we have got so far. The Lytro does have a bit of a experimental learning curve of taking photos and seeing the results, then taking more photos, to get to a place where you can visualize the shot with confidence before seeing it on a computer screen.  The 3D, refocus, and perspective features are novel and easy to use.  We have also figured out how to make some great 2D 10"x10" enlargements using the Resize tools available in Perfect Photo Suite software (found that tip on the Lytro blog site).  One of the best things about photography is using creativity to see everyday things differently and appreciating the beauty around us.  This camera is perfect for that and easy enough for my kids (9 & 11) to use too.  Also a plus is that the Lytro software keeps getting upgraded and Lytro sends us links automatically at no extra cost.  Looking forward to the "all in focus" software upgrade coming out in the next year.
