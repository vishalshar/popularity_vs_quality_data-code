the packaging targeted for dogs are cheaper than the ones for cats, even thought the contents are the same. my feline buddy has no problems and absolutely loves them! they are still a little too pricey for our budget so i keep my eyes peeled for when they go on sale. healthy options are not cheap . . . what can you say. i definitely recommend these treats for cats.
