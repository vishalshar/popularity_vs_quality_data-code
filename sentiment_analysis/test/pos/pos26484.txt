We love the omniebox!  After buying (and returning) another bento style lunch box that was so tiny, we are really happy with this one.  The size is great for my 9 yr old and I love the fact that I can send hot and cold food together!  If I send multiple containers he doesn't see half of them or doesn't have time to open them all.  With this lunch box, once he opens it everything is right there in front of him and easily accessible. Also  the thermos area is removable so if you choose to send just cold foods you have that option too.
