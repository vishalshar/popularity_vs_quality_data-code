I purchased this as a gift for my love and I was so happy to have found it. What do you get a guy that has everything? I mean, he was always up to date with the latest electronic gadgets. He lived with his iPhone Plus 6 and was constantly on it for business deals and opportunities in the form of phone calls and emails. Then I came across a site that suggested unique and uncommon gifts for men and this product came in the radar for me.In fact, the first time I ever saw this product was when it was featured in an episode of Shark Tank. I was familiar with UV lights for sanitizing toothbrushes. So, to expand this functionality into cellphone was quite marvelous. It completely made sense since our generation was constantly on our phones. It made sense that our phones undoubtedly accumulated lots of bacteria and germs as a result.I felt like I was being cool with an updated gadget that he probably did not have and I was also protecting and looking out for his health. If used constantly, my hope was that this product assisted in keeping down the yearly cold virus that he was coming down with.The only caveat was that this product didn't fit all of the bulkier cases that he used to protect his iPhone 6 Plus. It would have been easier to just pop the whole iPhone 6 Plus, case included, into PhoneSoap. The good news was that as long as the case cover wasn't hard to remove, this product was able to sanitize the phone and while you charged it at the same time. Plus, he seemed rather satisfied with his gift.
