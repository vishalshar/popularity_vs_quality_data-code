Wow. I have been through three mattresses in 4 years looking for one that allows me to wake without a severely scrunched up and painful body. My first night on the LULL I slept through the night for the first time in years and woke fresh and coherent. The second night the same. The third.....I am grateful I saw the ad the day I was going to go buy yet another $2-3K mattress and thought what the heck, I can always send it back. Which I now know I will never do.By the way, I was expecting a firmer mattress given other reviews, so I was surprised by the softer feel. But, the firm to soft ratio is perfect for this plus size sleeper!
