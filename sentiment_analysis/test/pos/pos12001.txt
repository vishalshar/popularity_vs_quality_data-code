Dream Water is an EXCELLENT product, that truly does work.  I'll have to say I've tried many brands of melatonin, and even prescription medications - outside of ambien (which I hate to use) - this has worked the best - with absolutely no side effect of grogginess in the morning.  I first got it in an airport - and used it on the plane - and it really relaxed me and put me to sleep.  So I figured I'd try it when I got home.  So I purchased a 4 pack and every time I used it - it worked.  In about 15-20 minutes you just feel tired and relaxed and ready to sleep.  I have bought more of these since then as well.  I will also mention - i used this before several large licensing exams - and high pressure interviews.... it's worked even in those stressful situationsMy ONLY negative comment about this product is the price point.  At the cheapest you end up paying about 2.00 a pop (when you buy in bulk).  Unfortunately this is a bit too high for an every night product.  Wish they would lower it ! - but you can certainly try half shots to make them last longer.
