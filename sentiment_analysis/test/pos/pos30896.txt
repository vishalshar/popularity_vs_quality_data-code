The Mountek nGroove Snap+ (3rd Gen.) is arguable the phone car holder/mount in the market. Its magnetic head is powerful enough that it can hold tablets as heavy as the original pre-2010 iPad (those are quite monstrous). Given that, it can hold all other larger phones (ie. iPhone 6 Plus or Samsung Galaxy Notes). Users would have some piece of mind or assurance that it would not fall down; barring what type of phone/tablet case is on.It's design is minimalistic, yet elegant, when mounted unto a car's CD slot (which no one uses nowadays). The plates that come with it are thin enough that it can be placed directly inside the phone's case and does not interfere with it's structure. When the mounting system is used properly, users can literally just get into one's car, place their phone unto the magnetic head, and drive off.I highly recommend this product
