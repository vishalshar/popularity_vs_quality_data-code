I purchased this for my 7yr old. She loves it and I love that it stands up to her rough ways. It is very flexible, but the handle seems nice and sturdy. The only problem we have encountered is when my daughter uses headphones. The case is pretty thick in the spot that the headphones plug into. We have to use the straight plug instead of the L shaped ones.
