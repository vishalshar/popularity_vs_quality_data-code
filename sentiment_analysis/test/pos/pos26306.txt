This is a really yummy treat, which is healthier than most treats as a bonus!  I like the chocolate one the best. It's chocolatey with a hint of saltiness. The little squares do slightly resemble bird food but nevermind that, they're delicious.  They're not cheap but this actually helps me limit my servings per day. Yum!
