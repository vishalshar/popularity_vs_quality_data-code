I'm not a cold brew connoisseur, but this is very good. Soft, mellow aftertaste with no bitterness. This isn't your average large Dunkin Donuts cold brew, so be careful... a little goes a long way(Bizzy gets you Buzzy)! Product came in a neat little box with stickers. This is a small business and it shows with the small personal touches.Paid $8 more ordering this product 6 days ago which kind of sucks, but will be a returning customer.
