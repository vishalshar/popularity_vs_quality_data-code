Just be aware of the premium coverage fee, I almost didn't keep mine and I think the Amazon ad ought to be more up front about what you get for free and what you get with each level of the premium account.  I purchased the device to enhance home security and to keep an eye on my cats and it is very good for both.  The resolution in both day and night mode is excellent.  The first night out of the gate the night vision caught some "unexplainable" activity.  I am pretty sure it isn't an artifact or device issue.  So this may be a great device for paranormal research and I give it bonus points for that!  I am very happy with my purchase despite the fee to maximize its usefulness.
