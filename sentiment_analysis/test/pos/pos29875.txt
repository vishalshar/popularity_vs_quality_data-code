I've been using a collection of WEMO switches and Philips Hue bulbs (for the non-WEMO locations) for the last year and a half and I haven't had too many complaints. However, when I needed to replace a 3-way dimmer switch in a hallway, Lutron was the only option.I was initially a bit weary of using a device made by a manufacturer that specializes in traditional switches instead of an established technology company, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I am now seriously considering replacing all of my WEMO devices with Lutron switches.First, the design of the switches is really top notch. Lutron has been making high-end switches for a long time (I never even knew that was a thing!), and that has definitely carried over into the design of the Caseta. They're by far the best looking switches I have in the house, and they have little touches that really make you appreciate the work that went into designing them, like the hidden cut-off switch that allows you to cut off power when replacing a bulb without having to go to a circuit breaker.While I was originally opposed to home automation that requires a bridge to function effectively, I'm now a believer. I was able to configure 2 switches and 2 remotes with the bridge in about a minute (not counting the time it took to physically install the switches), and any future devices I add will be just as easy.I've also been very impressed with how good the connectivity is. I have two Philips hue bulbs that are only about 20 feet from the bridge, but with a bunch of walls in the way which causes them to lose their connection on a regular basis. With the Caseta, I have a switch that is about 35 feet away through twice as many walls (including one concrete one), and it's worked flawlessly since day one.I also have to throw in a special mention of their tech support. Due to the weird 3-way setup that I had in the hallway, I ran into some problems getting the "master" switch installed, but their tech support was top notch. The representative I spoke with took the time to fully troubleshoot my problem and figure out exactly what we needed to do with the wiring to get it working.Finally, if you're looking at this specifically to replace a 3-way switch as I was, this is an awesome solution. Instead of replacing three switches with 3 "smart" switches, you'll just replace one switch with a smart switch, and the other two will just be replaced with the remote control.Note that you'll need to buy Lutron PICO-WBX-ADAPT  Pico Wallplate Bracket for the remotes separately, and possibly an extra Lutron CW-1-WH 1-Gang Claro Wall Plate, White or two. Once everything is installed, nobody but you will really be able to tell which switch is different from the others as they'll all just work perfectly.And, best of all, if you have an Amazon Echo at home, you'll never even need to physically touch the switches since you can just have Alexa do all of the work for you!Overall, I've been extremely satisfied with this purchase, and I'd strongly recommend that anyone considering home automation consider these switches as their first foray into the field. Pretty much everything else you get will either be too much of a pain to set up, or too different from what you're replacing (I'm looking at you Philips Hue) to provide a valid comparison.
