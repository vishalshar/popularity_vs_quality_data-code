This phone is awesome. I bought it because my BLU 7.0 fell and the screen broke but it continued to work just as good. I intended to by a smaller BLU but this model was a better deal for the price point. Did I say this phone is awesome! The sound is great, the back camera is great, it's super slim, it comes with the screen protector already on (I often struggle with this), and it comes with a free case, which handsomely compliments it.The processor is quite good, as I can have several programs open (including my music playing and play high graphic games with no lag. I am so happy with the purchase! The battery does get warm after prolonged use but I imagine all phones have this problem. Plus, it comes with some pretty cool ear plugs. The come with a button on the cord that can stop and start play. They fit comfortably in my ear and sound good.The battery is only okay but at least it can be replaced. Thanks for reading, good luck!
