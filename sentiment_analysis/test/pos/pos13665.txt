I love this product.  I'm a visual learner plus I homeschool my son.  I also have a toddler that has picked up on sight words and learn songs easily.  This has helped me so much!  I can leave notes, draw ideas and leave lists over and over again.  It applied easily, any air bubbles are hardly noticeable and doesn't effect the writing.
