I purchased this after that major east coast blizzard from a few weeks ago as a precaution for the next potential black out in my area.  Love it!  The concept of having one item to charge pretty much all of my portable media (via USB or AC outlet!) vs. those large back up power strips that are huge, bulky and last less than an hour in most cases.  This works great with my laptop, tablets..you name it.  Thank you ChargeTech for giving us a much simpler back up power solution for our portable media.
