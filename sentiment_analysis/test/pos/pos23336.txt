After shopping a few local stores asking $160+ for kids 16" bikes I decided to get 2 of these bikes for my 4.5 year old twins.  The bikes arrived quickly and in good condition.  I ordered them Monday and received them on Friday - both showed In Stock.  Bikes are easy to assemble and are rock solid.  They are actually a little on the heavy side but I would prefer that over flimsy/cheap.  I will recommend these to my friends with kids in the 4-6 year age range.
