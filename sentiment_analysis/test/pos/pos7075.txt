The way this mattress never seems too warm or too cool is pretty amazing.  The firmness seems just right (as their marketing material loves to say), and your bed-mate could be practicing breakdancing moves on the other side and you'd barely get a wiggle on your side.  The firmness is ideal for those of us that are heavier than average. I am personally the "dense" kind of heavy (tall, broad, and fit) and unlike my old mattress I never feel like I've sunk into it and I never wake up with a sore lower back from the mattress  losing its alignment/shape in the middleOverall my wife and I are very happy with the purchase of the Ghost Bed.  Unless you're a person with very specific needs for a bed I feel like it's unlikely you'll need to use their 101 night test/return policy (which, by the way is only 30 days if you buy via Amazon, so FYI...)
