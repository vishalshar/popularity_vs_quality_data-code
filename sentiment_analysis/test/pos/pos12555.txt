I had an EYN case for my iPhone 4, and when I upgraded, I was really disappointed that they didn't have them for iPhone 6. I went through 3 other wallet-type cases that were impossible to talk on the phone while using, fell apart quickly, or interfered with taking photos. Finally, EYN made an iPhone 6 case! I am ecstatic. This case is rugged, holds 4 cards easily, is a great stand for watching movies on my phone... is everything I need.
