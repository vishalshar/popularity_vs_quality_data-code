Got the device. I have a Sony TV, Xfinity and Apple TV. It did not connect to my home wifi network at first but the second attempt worked. There is some learning curve to get used to the sensitivity of the gestures. It would be a nice feature if I could control the level of sensitivity through the app. Integration with Apple TV is flawless. Love the shush.
