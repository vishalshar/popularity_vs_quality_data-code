I received this as a gift from my husband with a view that this could become a novel new hobby & creative outlet for me, especially in the winter months. It is curiously addictive! I got my 3Doodler up & running without any problems following the concise Quick Start guide. So far I've had great fun trying to hone my 3D drawing skills, and am really enjoying seeing more precision come into my work now. This is obviously a high temperature device and as such one I kept well away from my inquisitive daughter's hands. I love this concept though and as soon as she's a bit older I'd love to get her the new kids version of the 3Doodler. This is a 'five star' gift as far as I'm concerned!
