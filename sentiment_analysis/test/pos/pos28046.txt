i got the device about 2 weeks ago and took it with me for a trip to hong kong. i will have to say the sound is amazing with this device. compared with all the other display headsets, the way that royole-x integrates the audio is impressive. truly perfect for air travel. it does feel like an escape, let me forgot i was on a plane for a moment. managed to watch three tv shows preloaded to the device during one flight and it still got close to half of the power left. the carrier bag and small case for charger is quite stylish and handy. on the wishlist, i would say it could have been even more compact. image is definitely sharp and crisp, which is good, it is amoled after all, personally i just wish it could be larger too. also, would be nice to have app store available, so the choices could be more. overall, pleased with the device.
