UPDATE: <<<<I got this for $179.  The people asking $465 and up are taking advantage of you.>>>>Cozmo is a fantastic toy marred by the wifi interface.  5 star otherwise.  You've already heard the raves about when he works and I agree, so I'll just focus on problems we've encountered.To connect your phone to Cozmo, you need to connect to the wifi signal that Cozmo is putting out.  But each time you want to play, it's too cumbersome.  You have to lift Cozmo up and down in his dock, then you need to go into your phone's wifi settings to connect to him, then you need to open the app to finalize the connection.  The wifi connection is a major bummer and you need a nearly new device to run him, while that device is orphaned from the web. This removes internet access from your device while you use Cozmo.If your phone is too old, it can't run the Cozmo app.  We have an Asus ZenPhone that wouldn't work at all, incompatible device.  So we tried another old phone, a Galaxy S3.  It works!  But, with the Galaxy, it constantly disconnects from Cozmo and tries top connect to other wifi networks because there is no internet on Cozmo.I finally used it on my fairly new phone, a Moto X Pure and I was able to advise the wifi to ignore that Cozmo has no internet and stay connected anyways.  I suspect it's the newer android allowing it.So, if you can make Cozmo stay connected, it's a pretty cute little toy that all ages enjoy.Great toy, terrible execution between toy and control app.Side note - the packaging:  Why is there a foam lined spot for each of the 3 cubes, the charging dock ,the wire, the plug, but not for Cozmo himself?  Seems pointlessly overdone and ultimately unusable to carry him with since Cozmo is suspended by an overly complicated display system in the top of package.  Needless waste of money since you can't really use the package to carry him afterwards.  It just seems high quality but poorly thought out.So, I'd buy him again, but it's way more cumbersome than it seems like it ought to be.  Look forward to future robots.  :-D
