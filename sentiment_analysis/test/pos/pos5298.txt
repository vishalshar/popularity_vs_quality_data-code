Ok, firstly, I searched and searched the interweb for a pet feeder due to among other things, my huge cat needed to lose weight and I was advised to break up his meals into as many smaller meals as I could manage regularly. Also, fat ass was waking us up half hour earlier every morning to eat. I work at 4:30am and this requires me to miss out on most nights so coupled w an extra early morning doesnt work well for productive people such as myself. As well, waking up pissed off chasing the cat or throwing $*** at him starts the day off on the wrong darn foot to say the least. I bought the CatMate50 after reading 400 reviews and made sure I purchased the unit made in england not china or usa as they were made cheaper and broke easily. Well this unit is awesome but it didnt allow me to feed my cat numerous times a day rather over four days, this didnt work for me. Also he moved it around the room and fusked with it non stop. Finally a few days after I had set up this POS(catmate50) i got emailed from amazon w similar products and up popped the FeedAndGo! I spent the next two days reading the countless reviews regarding this amazing device. I bought it with confidence, price is no object for good things. Since it arrived during my work week I let it sit thinking it would be tough to set up. I shouldnt have waited!Once I slit the tape on the box i was twenty minutes away from watching my cat on the web cam. I hit the wps button directly on top of my router from comcast and went over to the unit, held down the button marked wps on the feedandgo, one minute later both lights were gleaming bright. I went to the portal, logged in, registered my unit and set up SLY's schedule. Boom done. I freeze the wet food and refrigerate another so he gets fresh food throughout the day with zero issues regarding freshness!Ya want and extra incentive to buy this?!The OWNER, not some robot form call or some form email, THE OWNER AND INVENTOR of the product calls me at home on his personal cell phone to thank ME for my purchase. This nailed down the five star rating with brass tacks!Alex is an amazing business man who honestly gets it. I wish this man and this conpany nothing but success. I will soend the next several years explaining to anyone who will listen how important this device is to a happy healthy pet and improved relationship between animal and human.Well Done Alex! Bravo!
