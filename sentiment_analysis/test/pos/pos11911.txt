I bought this as a gift for my sister. They have a year old puppy and feeding the dog was a problem with her 3 kids. I thought this would be perfect for them, as they feed the dog twice a day. She decided they could not use it, mainly because she felt that the kids would probably NOT be reliable enough to actually use it when feeding the dog. Thus making it unclear whether of not the dog had or had not been fed. This is NOT a fault of the product, it was just not really applicable to them. I still think it is a great idea.
