I purchased the GlocalMe G2 and used it on a two week family vacation to Europe.  My family has several smart phones, tablets and other data intensive devices.  We wanted to solution that would work in multiple countries, enable us to connect all of our devices, and be affordable.  The GlocalMe G2 met those criteria.  The device is simple to set up.  Download the GlocalMe app, set up an account, purchase data, and link your account to the G2 hotspot.  That's it.  It works just like any other wifi source.  When you run low on data, use the app to buy another 1GB or whatever you need.  Simple.  Connection speeds in the major cities were 4G and very fast.  Worked well on the EuroStar train, too.  We carried the G2 in a coat pocket or purse everyday, and our smart phones were in turn connected via wifi to the G2.  This gave us access to Uber, Facebook, email, internet, etc, etc while traveling.  It made navigating the foreign cities much easier.  For multiple devices and multiple family members, this was a much better solution than trying to find, buy and install SIM cards.
