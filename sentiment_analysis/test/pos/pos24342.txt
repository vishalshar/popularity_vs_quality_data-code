After significant research on the best Alexa and Siri-enabled wifi connected dimmers, I settled on Lutron.  Several of the other dimmer I consider had too many issues listed by reviewers including installation, configuration, and long-term reliability.  I installed two Lutron dimmers using simple 3-wire connections and they worked immediately as expected.  Then I configured the bridge Lutron device after hard-wired connection to my router via my iPhone.  Pairing the dimmers to the Lutron bridge was trivial - just hold the "off" button down for 10 secs, see the dimmer lights blink, and viola!  The dimmers show up on the iPhone app.  The package comes with 2 additional "pico" remotes which pairs just as easily as the rest.  I fiddled with the app and within a few minutes, programmed the entire basement to turn on/off on command, AND to turn off at 9pm automagically.  I am off to buy more switches.
