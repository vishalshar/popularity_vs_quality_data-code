Quality product so far.  I installed in a 2010 Ford Fusion.  I removed the arm that cantilevers the table out, so the laptop holder essentially goes straight up from the post mount.  Installation is straight forward and I didn't even look at the directions.  My 17" laptop fits on it, but it couldn't go any larger.  I slip the pole off the post and remove the entire device every few days - quick & easy process.
