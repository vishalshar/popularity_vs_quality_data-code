Wanted to provide an updated review now that we've had some time to use our Talkie.  I originally purchased our Talkie in November and set up was difficult and frustrating.  It took countless tries to get it to connect to the wireless at my home and after about 30mins of trying and re-trying I finally got it to work.  I packaged it up and wrapped it for Christmas.  Fast forward to Christmas morning and unfortunately our Talkie was no longer working as described.  It would not send any messages and constantly had to be reconnected to the internet (which is not easy to do when taking the box out of the toy and taking out batteries with a screw driver every time).  I spent the next few days sending emails back and forth to the company.  They always gave me personalized/non generic responses which was great and helped my patience.  Eventually there were no other troubleshooting tips that they could provide me.  Our last resort was to have a new one shipped out to me to see if maybe the toy itself was faulty.  Well, we received our new one (IN RECORD TIME might I add) and it is working just as it should.  The set up was still pretty painful and took numerous tries to get it to connect to the internet.  But I've been testing it every other day to make sure it's still connected and so far so good.  I agree with previous reviewers that it would be SO nice to have the Talkie be able to connect to multiple WiFi's due to this being a perfect gift for children who do spend a majority of their time at different households.  My daughter's father would not be super pumped to connect this to his WiFI everytime she's there so I can talk to her.... and her grandparents would probably have way less patience than me to try and wait for it to finally connect.  Overall, the concept of this toy is fantastic and such a wonderful idea.  It's a new product and I'm eager to see what updates they will have in the future.  The app is kind of difficult to use, especially to find people to add to my child's circle.  It also will show that I have 5 notifications when I only have 1 message from my daughter.... not really sure why that happens.  Grandma ends up sending multiple cut off messages because it's been difficult for her to figure out how exactly it works.  Please keep updating, this toy has the potential for so much more.  Thank you for all of your help and I would definitely recommend this product to everyone I know.... Even with the issues I've had it's still such a great way to communicate with the little ones.
