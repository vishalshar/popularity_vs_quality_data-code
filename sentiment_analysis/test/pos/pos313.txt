As a wine rep I use it more than most people would. One tip - when accessing the same bottle multiple times it is best to try and hit a different spot on the cork to ensure the puncture isn't too large to reseal itself. Humidity is definitely key when re-accessing the same bottle as well. If the cork dries out, you'll get large chunks chipping off from the bottom due to weaker/fragile structure.I use it 10-15 times a day and go through 6 canisters of argon a month. Just broke my first needle but only because the cork I tried accessing was unnaturally hard (not synthetic!).Wish I would have held out a few weeks before I bought it b/c the 2nd version came out shortly after my purchase but still love having it!
