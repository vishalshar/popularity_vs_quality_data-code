I've had chronic nerve pain in my foot for 21 months. I have seen more doctors than I can count on one hand and nothing has helped... until now. I haven't been able to walk without orthotics since the injury.  I've been using Quell for 2 weeks now and feel almost no pain.Per some of the other reviews, I bought some spectra 360 gel to use with it as the electrodes don't make great contact otherwise. This is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me. I wish Quell would own up to this minor defect and formally recommend an electrode gel since their goop only lasts a couple of days.With any luck, I will be able to return to my former love of yoga thanks to Quell. Words can't describe how much of a life changer this is for people with chronic pain.
