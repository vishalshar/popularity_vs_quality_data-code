I am on a smarthome kick.  I have thermostats, sensors, light bulbs, outlets and finally the quirky.  I love it.  Because it bends, it is easy to connect the bulkiest of plugs without problem.  No hub required.  Setting up with the wink app is simple.  I am using it right now in my kitchen.  I fill my electric kettle with water and turn the pot on.  Then when I want tea I use the hub to turn on the outlet to boil the water. I start it on the way home so the water is boiling as I walk in the door.  Each wifi outlet (there are two of them) can be turned on/off independently.  With the wink app, you can set up robots.  For example, if I had a table light connected to the quirky, I could set up for it to come on when the front door motion detector is triggered.  Awesome!!!
