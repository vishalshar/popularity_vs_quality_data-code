Had it for about a month now and it has been working great.  The unit is installed in my detached garage and even with a very long ethernet run to the garage, it is working smoothly.  I control the unit from an iPad.  Prior to this brand of sprinkler controller, I had another brand of web based sprinkler controller with ethernet.  But I always had ethernet connectivity problems with it.  Often I just would not connect.  It also didn't have the external manual buttons and screen that this unit has.  Which my wife likes.
