I like this thing.  Easy set-up, the Android app is great, and it does what it says it does.  Yesterday was unseasonably hot, so it automatically cranked up the watering a bit.  Nice.  My only real complaint is that my old controller let me run multiple cycles a day.  With the drought here in California, I can only water twice a week.  If I water adequately on those days with a single cycle per zone, the water runs off onto the sidewalk (there's a bit of a slope, and the soil is hard). This caused the City to give me a warning  notice threatening a $250 fine.  So, I have had do crank the smart watering way down and then water manually for a second small cycle through the app.  I contacted Blossom support and they said that this is on their list of future updates.  So, I'm going to keep it and not return it.  I'm counting on them keeping that promise.  Aside from that, this thing is pretty cool.
