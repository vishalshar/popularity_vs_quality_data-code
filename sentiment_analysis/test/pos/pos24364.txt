Just got this and I'm already pleased. Took 5 min to install. I used the zip ties, to get a secure fit. My only suggested improvement is for the manufacturer to include a small rubber square piece that can go between the mount and the stem/handle. The curvature on each bike is likely to be different and it'll lead to less slippage. That said, the mount is fairly secure and withstood a fair amount of speed and bumps quite well. Overall very pleased with the mount, quality of the case and the mechanism. The one thing I'll wait to comment on is how the case influences heating of the phone. I threw out my previous case (one with a plastic cover in a zip case) because it caused severe heating. I need my case to keep the phone secure for 2-3 hours, allow continuous Bluetooth functionality, run my fitness app and withstand California sunshine without causing the phone to overheat. I'll report back on that after a few runs. It looks great on the bike as you can see from the pics.[Update 9/28/2015]Took my iPhone 6plus mounted on the quad lock out for a 3 hr ride in the sunshine. No heating problem. Worked like a charm. I like it a lot now and have changed the rating from 4 to 5 stars.
