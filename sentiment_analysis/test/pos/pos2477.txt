This is by far the best and most accurate pedometer I have tried. I like it much better than a fitbit, because it is discreet as well as more accurate. A FitBit will give you steps just for swinging your arm, but this won't even count "steps" if you are just shaking your leg. It is nice that it fits in a pocket, or has a clip for a skirt or pants. It seems to be more accurate when in your pocket. The band is comfortable for sleeping, and even with sensitive skin I've had no issues of getting rash from it. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! The only reason I had to buy it again was because I lost my last one.
