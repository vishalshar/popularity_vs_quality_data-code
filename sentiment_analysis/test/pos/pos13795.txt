I got this for my daughter's 10 birthday and she loves it. As this model is designed for kids, the plastic coming out is cool and will not cause any burns. My understanding is that as a side effect of this, the plastic takes a bit longer to dry than some other models, but it's definitely workable. The only minor issue I have with it (other than the cost of the refills), is that when you stop extruding the plastic, there is an internal mechanism that is supposed to cut it which doesn't work so swell.
