I put mine on top of a Mason pint jar with a handle and it looks adorable in my kitchen. I put another on top a Mason pint jar with no handle in the bathroom. Love it!! It does collect water and some soap residue on the lid but it is easy to rinse off. It really looks nice and has worked wonderful so far. I use the thicker aloe hand soap and it works great.
