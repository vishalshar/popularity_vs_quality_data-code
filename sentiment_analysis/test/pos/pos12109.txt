Very cool little thermometer.  I purchased after I realized I could get a full FSA reimbursement this year.  I was a bit annoyed at the seemingly mandatory Withings account registration and app downloading.  Just press and hold the single function button until you see "Setup" appear on the unit then once configured you can delete the app for user households like mine.  Reading seems quite accurate and I love the fact that there's no cleanup required after reading has been taken.  Slick device!
