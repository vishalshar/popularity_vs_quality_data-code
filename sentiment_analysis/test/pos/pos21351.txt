Update - Successfully printed Mold for Ceramics (50+ hour flexible filament print)I modified my Robo3d R1 Plus printer to support flexible filaments. (I installed 1/8" diameter stainless steel tube between the feeder and the print head, no mod to the printer aside from putting the tube in place) I originally purchased the Robo3D printer to form molds for plaster that I can then use to make complex ceramics shapes. Works!UpdateFor the most part factory setting are good, I noticed the printed layers seemed a little flimsy and realized the diameter of the PLA filament is at the low end of spec and is actually 1.7mm rather than 1.75 mm. This led to a number of problems as the printer was not printing with the correct amount of filament. I went in the software and set the filament to 1.7mm diameter and the 3D prints improved drastically. I added a photo of a complicated 3D Print to show what can be produced. I downloaded FreeCad to create the object based on a FreeCad tutorial available on Youtube.Original reviewI have been watching 3D printers for ages waiting for a printer with a good build volume and a reasonable price to hit the market, Robo3D R1 Plus hit the spot! The printer arrived ready to go, I turned the printer on and after about 2 minutes the printer shut off, down for the count. I talked to Robo3D 24/7 tech support on Saturday evening and Robo3D sent out a new power supply the next business day. Since then the Robo 3D has been a breezeÂ… I saw a lot of videos online of prior versions of Robo3D R1 needing minor mods, the R1 Plus version is pretty much ready to go. The only obligatory project is to download and print a new filament spool holder from Thingverse as the factory spool holder is a poor design.Overall I am very impressed with Robo3D R1 Plus printer, especially the build volume. I have a background in manufacturing and in coding the Robo 3D design is clean and simple. Remember a 3D printer is a tool and will require occasional maintenance. All the software for the Robo3D is open source and in C# which can be built in Mono Development or Visual Studio. Life is good :)
