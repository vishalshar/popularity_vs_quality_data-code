I really love this headset, Its comfortable, good sound, and awesome.First, I was using steelseries h wireless its cost me $300, and Its not worth it bc Its too much. so I thought I have to buy new one bc the steelseries h wireless don't give me great sound on gaming, the step foots it's low to hear.In the beginning I was worried that the LucidSound LS30 will not gonna be awesome, bc Its $149.99, when I opened the box I was happy about the look, it's a good design. I set it up to ps4 and the sound, It's blow me up, I wasn't expected that, I hear now everything...JUST WOW!And the mic was clear to hear and my friends are saying your voice is so clear.I am very much satisfied with the headset.The only thing I did not like it's not flexible.
