Ive experimented with many different solutions  Most of them do SOMETHING really well.  However, until now, Id never been able to find ONE solution that fulfilled ALL my needs.Pros: Easy setup of hardware  worked with all my devices Easy setup of software  Love the customization.  Put any button anywhere. Streams directly from my phone!  I dont have to worry about any third party devices.  This was a big one for me.  Both my Roku AND Onkyo receiver has streaming built in but the interfaces were hard to use.  With Blumoo I was able to stream directly from my phone with my phones interface at great distances. Incorporates a TV guide  click the show to change channelsCons: None really Just make sure and plan for any IR extenders if you have components hidden.
