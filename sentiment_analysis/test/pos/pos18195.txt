Set up the Blossom just 2 months ago, and it has been running ever since.By the way, I live in the desert, so pretty much no room for error here.Short version is that it has been working really well.Longer version:Its a product on its infancy, hence the innovative features such Smart Watering (adjusting watering based on weather forecast). So, what do you get that offsets that?  What is the compromise?The software side of it could do with some development, to make it a bit easier to use and more informative. Nothing major at all, plus its software / firmware, so updatable anytime. Therefore, the compromise can be only temporary.Starting from the beginningInstallation was a no-brainer, even if mine was from scratch and not just a replacement of an old controller.The set up of watering times and zones was straightforward as well. I found it great that it automatically offsets your zones in time so that does not water all zones at once. This is really great; easier setup and makes the most of your water pressure.Then, it doesn't seem to need you anymore!It does its job (well) and thats it. Doesn't communicate with you, neither it requests for input.If, like myself, you used to have to be on top of things, you might feel that you would like to interact with it more. Have some feedback, logs, etc.Regarding the app. Here is the software bit I believe needs development.I had a bit of trouble understanding how to use the app to really have it do what I want when I want it. Im not talking about scheduling, but to water on demand (function Run Sprinklers, on the app).I figured out that the app works better if I turn it on just before using it. So, by default, I leave the app off. The watering schedule is stored on the unit anyway.When I want to change the schedule, or Run Sprinklers for example, I turn the app on, and immediately give instructions. If I changed the schedule I can turn it off immediately; but if Im running sprinklers, I just leave it on. Ill turn it off later, or before I use it again. This is because I realized that turning it off immediately after you gave order to run sprinklers might overrule the order and turn the sprinklers off. This is why the four stars, rather than five. Oftentimes the Run Sprinklers function just doesn't work, or very often unfortunately, it does start the sprinklers, but it turns off much sooner than expected. The really odd thing though, what makes one really doubt the product, is that app (when you press Run Sprinklers) always seem to activate them, which is not always the case. And it still says running sprinklers even if these had stopped. And no, this has nothing to do with water pressure, I checked many times.To really understand how this works by having feedback without having to check each zone, I set the unit up in the study so that I can hear when it is irrigating or not (when it is on it makes a low  "buzzing" noise, not all too pleasant I must say).Regarding the internet connection. (Im using the very useful powerline adaptor to connect to the internet) (more on this below).When your internet connection is not live, the light in the unit gets reddish to let you know. But the unit will come online again on its own once the internet connection is back up running.Connections are bound to break at times, so it is great that the unit just connects back automatically.However, when I voluntarily run sprinklers (so outside of the watering schedule), if the internet connection is lost, the sprinklers stop. (This is undesirable, but aligns perfectly with the fact that they also stop if I turn off the app right after starting the sprinklers, or even is the ipad screens locks, sometimes). The only really odd thing regarding this is that the app still says: Running Sprinklers ! So it seems that there isnt a two way communication between the app and the unit. I believe this to be one of the main downsides of the system, and at the root of other criticism such as lack of feedback. Again, this must be fixable via firmware / software upgrade.Another issue I faced was change of address (read for reference to product support)Yes, I installed at one address and then changed to another address. Why is this an issue? Well, when you first register you associate the unit with the physical address of the unit (say your home) so that the unit knows where it is geographically and therefore uses this information to adjust your watering needs based on the weather forecast for that area. The problem I found was that there is no way on the app to change your address. Again a change of address is not very likely to happen when you just installed a system like this, is it? (I did it by way of testing it earlier).Anyway, I just emailed support for a solution and their reply suggested that they could delete my account for me, so that I could create a new one. I was able to set up again after a day or two. They also explained a couple questions I had at the moment, promptly.Another (momentary?) downside is that it would be great to have access to a watering log per zone. I hope this comes up in the future, if not on the app, on a web application.Regarding the powerline adaptor. This is a great part of the package as it extends your internet right to the unit through a cable that is already installed (a powerline), since the unit needs power anyway.Im using this in parallel with a previous powerline installation of a TP-Link AV 500 (model TL-PA411), which was leaving me uneasy, but I decided to try it anyway and it works great.One feature that I would like to see would be the ability to schedule several times per day, say twice rather than only once.To summarize, very happy with the Blossom, hoping that a polished app makes it a bit more informative and more straightforward to use. Lowest point is function Run Sprinklers. Very flaky, and app seems to only pass orders to unit, without receiving any feedback.
