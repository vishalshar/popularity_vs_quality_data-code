This is an excellent no nonsense smartwatch. I know they are making a push towards fitness, but if you want a smartwatch that tells time and reliably receives/sends notifications then look no further.Pros:*Excellent battery life that should easily last 5-7 days between charges*Easy to read screen*Instant phone notifications*Actionable notifications on Android(some actionable notifications on iOS)*Water Proof*Heart Rate Monitor - at this price, that's rare to find in a fitness wearable*Compatible with most 22MM aftermarket bands*Exercise tracking*Mature App/watch face store with many options that should satisfy any customization needsCons:*Looks like a fitness device - they do have a more professional looking variant coming out in late 2016 with a color screen and better battery life, but you're not wearing this version with a suit and tie.
