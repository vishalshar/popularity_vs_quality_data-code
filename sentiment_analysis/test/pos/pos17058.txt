This Quad Lock system is absolutely FANTASTIC....the adhesive on the mount is super duper strong. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with a Seidio case on it and the universal adapter on the back and it does not budge when cycling. I will admit that the way i mounted the universal adapter on the back of my phones case was a negative and positive take away. I love the case but if ever wanted to replace the phone or swap out a battery or even change the case it splits apart in the middle so i could not mount the universal adapter smack in the middle where its recommended. I had to mount the adapter right under camera so a bit higher on the phone. I was cycling once and went through a very rough patch of road i mean ROUGH lots of bumps and it caused my phone to slide off the top of the case ( the top part of the case STAYED ON THE QUAD LOCK ) but my phone fell and got scratched up pretty bad around the edges this was completely my fault due to the way the universal adapter was mounted NO fault to quad lock at all. The scratches weren't bad enough to replace the phone so after sliding it back into the top of the case you cannot see any of the scratches on it so its not bad at all. I cant have this phone on a vertical position on my mount because i don't want it to slide off again however i might look for another case=clip combo for now it has to be on a horizontal position. I have been using my iTouch on the mount after buying an extra universal mount and applying it to the back of my iTouch and keep my phone in my pouch. I'll show you a few photos so you guys can see the way its mounted.
