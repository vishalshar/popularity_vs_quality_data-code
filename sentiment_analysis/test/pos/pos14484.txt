Well, now I'm doomed. :) I'm gonna have to buy a bunch more smart bulbs! These are the first I've tried and I really like them. The look of these particular bulbs is great and they are working fine through the Nanoleaf app as well as with Siri on both my iPhone and Apple TV. There was some weirdness at first  during setup -- where one would respond and the other would not, but once they got properly connected they have worked consistently and perfectly. I just wish they would over some bulbs with color, now.
