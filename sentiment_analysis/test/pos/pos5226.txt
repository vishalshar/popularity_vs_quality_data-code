I was tired of not having a convenient place to place my iPhone 6 while at the gym or walking. Nothing was really working for me. I could never get used to the arm band which was my most recent attempt so I would end up just holding it in my hand. I finally did a little research and found the Bandi. I ordered the black paisley print and it has worked out perfectly. I am completely hands-free and the Bandi holds my phone securely around my hips. This is one of those things where you go "Why didn't I think of that?!"
