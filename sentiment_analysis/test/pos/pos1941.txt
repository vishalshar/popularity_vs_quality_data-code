This feeder is a life changer, the absolute best one out there! We really needed a dependable feeder for when we travel, and this one is amazing for the piece of mind. The feeder cam (aka our "cat cam") took away all the fear and uncertainty if my cat was fed. I just turn on the feeder cam from anywhere I'm at, and there it is- happiness knowing kitty is fed as she munches away.Now, for the amazing- the Feed and Go has the best customer service ever! After just a month of having it, I accidentally left a window open by the feeder and rain got into it. I emailed customer service, and the inventor got back within 5 minutes and instantly helped with all my questions! Did I say instantly? And the feeder still works perfect attesting to how well it is built.Thank you Alex for all your help and the best feeder!
