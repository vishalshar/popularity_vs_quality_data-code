Absolutely awesome! I didn't have high hopes for this product because of the size, but I'm so glad I purchased it anyway!  I bought it for our 5-month-old son because he loves white noise and we travel somewhat often.  I never thought I would use it as a speaker, but I must admit, I sync it with my phone pretty often when I want to listen to music while doing housework. A lot of sound can come out of this little thing, and it's clear. The different sounds are really good.  There are only 2 that I really don't care to use. For some reason, I love the feel of it.  It does not feel cheap, and the design is pretty cool.Let's put it this way... If this sound machine was an actual person, I would want to be best friends, even though I would be secretly envious of how talented and attractive they are.  Some people just have it all, and you want to hate them but you can't because they're just so darn friendly and likeable!In conclusion, yes, I would highly recommend this product.
