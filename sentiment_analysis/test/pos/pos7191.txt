Good watch band for rugged use.  Combination/cross between G-Shock and an Otterbox case for your Apple Watch.  Fits well, easy to adjust.  Only gripe I had was that when I flexed my wrist back (think pushing a cart), I kept pushing the crown button.  Solved it by flipping the band around and changing the orientation of the watch screen in the watch settings (had to get used to the buttons on the left hand side, and the crown on the bottom instead of the top).Bit of advice.  Don't pay regular price.  $40 for a band -- while useful -- is ridiculous.  Check the used ones from Warehouse Deals and other sellers that are fulfilled by Amazon.  I paid right around $12 for my band that was "like new".  You save $, and if there is an issue, since it's fulfilled by Amazon, the return guarantee/policy is great.
