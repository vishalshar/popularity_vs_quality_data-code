Do not listen to the negative reviewers! This is a great bike. It's very easy to assemble and sturdy. I bought the white color bike with 14" wheels. The water bottle is small and cheap, but if you are grading the review on a water bottle..lol..go buy the 300+ dollars bike from the specialize bike shop. They will throw in a sturdy water bottle for you. Also if you can break the bike petal in one day. The bike shop petal will not last as long either! I got lazy and cheap on my son first bike. I usually buy the bike frame only and build the bike up. I love biking and its a great family activity. My son is 3 years old and 42" tall. The 14" is great on him. This bike will last him for a couple of years or more.The tires are big and wide..with great tracks on the threads.The training wheel are great..strong and sturdy. There is no way the training wheels will fall off if you install it right. The end attachment has a prong that slides into the back frame wheel slot. Once that is in the slot and the screw attached...its not going to off the bike.The front brake was very easy for my son to pull back and apply the brake.The seat post require an allen wrench to tighten for a tight press to the seat post. I didn't had any issue just hand tighten the seat. It hasn't slipped or twisted on him at all.The bike is sturdy and I don't think its heavy at all. Its a kid bike..not a racing or a road bike! If you want a light bike go to the bike shop and they will build one for you...light aluminum/carbon or all carbon frame bike with great bike components.My two cents,Enjoy the bike and ride safely!
