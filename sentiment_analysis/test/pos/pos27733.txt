These bags work better with medium to hard cheeses. I've had Parmigiana stored for almost 2 months and it is still fresh! Other cheeses also stayed fresh for up to a few weeks. This is definitely a money saver.  The only down side is that it keeps soft cheeses like brie fresh for up to about 2 weeks if you are careful as there seemed to be some moisture build up in the bag with softer cheese. I would buy them again once my bags are used up, noting that a bag can be used more than once.
