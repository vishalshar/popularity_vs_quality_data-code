This is great for home use.  We watch movies on ceiling or wall.  I use when jamming to put the chords/lyrics on the wall.  I coonect to iphone, or use san disk 32g card which fits lots of home movies, photos, or dvds.  Can se with vga to hdmi adaptor to use with standard computer output.  The tripod is great.  It is very quiet.  Really nice design, aluminum, and super small.  Of course not as bright as larger projector, but those aren't going to fit in your pocket or clamp on your bed.  my first one had minor issues and the customer service was excellent n replacing.
