I discovered there was a Thync through a lecture I heard on the future of consciousness by IONS chief scientist Dean Radin. Most of my life I have struggled with anxiety and difficulty sleeping and racing thoughts. I don't like taking meds and up until I tried the Thync...meditation was the only practice without side effects that alleviated my symptoms. I exclusively have using the calm vibes. What a relief I have found when using them......subdues my racing thoughts, feel more relaxed and sleep better. Awesomely sweet! Look forward to the vibes improving with research and time. Only reason I give this 4 stars is becuase the Thync strips are expensive which makes its prohibitive to use as much as I would like. My gratitude to the inventors of the Thync. Kudos to all those involved in progressing with the research of this product.
