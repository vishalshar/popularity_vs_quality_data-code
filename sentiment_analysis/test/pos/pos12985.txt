I bought this for my iPhone 6plus. It's great. I love it. It hold my phone very well. Even when I driving around it hold very steady. No shaking. And would not drop off from the magnet holder. I don't have any screen blur issue.The custom service is great. Great seller. When I had a little problem with it the seller sent me another one. 5 stars. AAAAA Service.
