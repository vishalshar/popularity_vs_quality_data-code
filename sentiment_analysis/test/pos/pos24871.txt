The wallet itself is quite a bit larger than my old, standard issue, wallet.  So it will be a bit of an adjustment.  The card slots are also very tight, but I imagine they will stretch out over time?  I wasn't always the type of guy who removed my wallet whenever I sat down, and I can tolerate sitting on this thing for a while, but not for too long.  When I consider this solution to my iPhone having a low battery, versus other external chargers or charging cases, this may be the best solution.  Just be prepared for it to be larger than most, standard men's wallets (in my opinion).
