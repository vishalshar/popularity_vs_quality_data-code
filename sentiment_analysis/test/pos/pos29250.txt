They both work fine. My husband had one of these and it lasted years. I had bought a different brand because my mouse was not a gaming mouse and I wanted one that felt better in my hand than my standard generic mouse. I got it and had problems with it right away. While this was all in process the mouse my husband had had for a long time started to fail. So I returned the one the I had gotten (that did not work) and ordered two of these. I was hesitant to buy this one for myself because my mouse area is small but decided to and see what happened. So I ordered two. I also downloaded from their website the driver to tweak the options.Great mouse. We are both happy and they fit in your hand so much better than a standard (straight wall) mouse. My pinky finger was getting sore from gaming with flat edge against it. My husband is a palm player and I am a fingertip and claw player. The mouse works great for both of us. If I could have afforded it I would have gotten their new castor one...that one looks slimmer in design but this one is not bad at all and way worth the money. If you read about DPI/CPI you will learn that you don't need a crazy number. We play FP and MMO and don't even have the setting on the highest setting. I spent about half a day researching the specs on mice and customer reviews and youtube videos. It is my husband's second one. My first one and when mine dies on me...I am hoping the castor will cost less. I will keep my eye on it...but I am very happy with this one as well.
