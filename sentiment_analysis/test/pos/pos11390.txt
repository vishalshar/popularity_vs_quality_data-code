I first bought the single dock version for my iphone 6 plus. It worked fine, but charging was slow through my computer's USB. I found myself frequently plugging my phone into an USB wall outlet for faster charging. So, I decided to buy the dual dock. Plugged one cable into my computer USB for phone syncing and stuff, the other into a USB charger plugged into my UPS power supply for faster charging. My phone as a non-bulky case on it and I had to not use either of the rubber mats for ease of placing the phone in the dock. I had to use genuine iPhone lightning cables as the Anker and Evocel cables that I had recently purchased were too bulky on the lightning port body to fit into the dock's plastic adapter. The front dock port fits the cable just fine, but for some reason, the back dock cable is a bit loose.
