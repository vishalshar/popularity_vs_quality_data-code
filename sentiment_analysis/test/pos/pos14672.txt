I'm a runner who got tired of having to shove my Apple earpods back in my ear again and again while I was running. I thought that using wireless earphones would be my solution, but after trying the Plantronics Backbeat I decided it wasn't going to work for me because I didn't want to sacrifice sound quality. I also didn't want to add having to make sure the thing was charged. Most of all, I couldn't take the thumping sound every time my foot landed on the ground. Then I tried the wired Yurbuds. While the earbuds themselves stayed in my ear, the wires were so grippy that they kept catching on my shirt and pulling the earbuds--annoying! Then I tried the Earhoox on my Apple earpods, and HOORAY! They helped the earpods stay in my ear. I've run over 8.5 miles with them, and they did not even attempt to fall out of my ears. I can't wait to use them in my upcoming half marathon!
