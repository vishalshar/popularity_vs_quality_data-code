We have had a Jitterbug phone for many years and love it...especially my husband who is high tech phobic! Recently we decided to get rid of our landline and so bought another updated Jitterbug for me. I love it! It is easy to use , is very attractive in its red case and serves our low tech needs. Thnak you for making it available. I highly recommend the Jitterbug!
