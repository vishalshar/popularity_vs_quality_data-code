This scoop is a dream to use.  The ergonomic design is spot-on, the shape makes an attractive ball of ice cream, the quality of the materials appears to be superior, and workmanship was flawless.  Gone are the hand and wrist strains of scooping rock-hard ice cream.  This scoop, whether it's left-hand specific or not, is superb!
