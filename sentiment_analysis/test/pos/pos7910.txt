Reviews seem to be mixed on this product, but personally I think it is great!  Reasons I like it:Weight is consistent, especially if you use the scale at the same time each day.The android app works very well, and integrates into google fit.Over time the pulse wave velocity readings are consistent.I think some people are disappointed that when you use the scale the pulse wave reading is not always given.  It is obviously difficult to capture your pulse through the scale.  Further, I could see it being difficult for some people with scaly feet (lots of dead skin) causing less conductivity.  Then I'm guessing it does some computation on the withings servers to determine pulse wave velocity, this is the value is not displayed on the scale screen. Rather than guessing they must throw out low quality data at the server... I'd prefer this over a low quality measurement.Keep it up withings!
