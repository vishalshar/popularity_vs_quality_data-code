I started wearing these in early June of 2016. I wore then nearly every day. I have NEVER been more satisfied with an insole product. The Honey Soles have outlasted the shoes. The soles have a little wear to them but IÂ’m still able to put them in a new pair of shoes and get more use out of them. I have three kids at home and this summer I was able to work from home. We took dozens of trips to the zoo, to the waterpark and so on. I put some miles on these things and they held up wonderfully.I will be purchasing a pair of Honey Soles for my other shoes as well. Great Job and thanks again for doing such a great job
