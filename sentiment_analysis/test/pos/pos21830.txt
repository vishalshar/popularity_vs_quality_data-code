Works Great! Awesome innovation and very 'New Age'. Lost a star for pricing. No wifi connection included (offered at a separate extravagant price). As per pricing, it's unaffordable to the average household but it IS in accordance with all other keyless lock pricing that don't even have Bluetooth. Still, $200 is a bitch much for something you're not sure actually locked.
