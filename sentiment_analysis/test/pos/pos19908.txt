My Xyitol arrived very quickly and is delicious. As a matter of fact,  I have already ordered my second package.  I use it every morning in my coffee. It tastes almost like sugar and has no bitter aftertaste.A word of warning about Xyitol, however, too much has a laxative effect. My mother-in-law slathered it all over her strawberries, thinking it was sugar.  I almost let her eat them, but compassion got the better of me!
