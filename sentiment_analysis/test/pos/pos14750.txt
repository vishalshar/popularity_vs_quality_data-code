I received the Drone in its case.  I also purchased the extra battery and blade protection.  The unit did have a minor blemish - on one arm of the drone where the top and bottom parts meet it doesn't appear seamless. But at any rate i flew it and it flew well and stable. The camera and gimbal are great and the app is also great. The problem is reception.  At around .4 miles the video feed drops constantly. Also video will drop at even closer distances unexpectedly of some reason (but it stopped happening after the next flight.  At .5 miles the radio also drops and the automatic return to home initiates.  If these two items worked as advertised, i would give this a 5 star even with the blemish on the arm. Unfortunately for me the reception is a big issue. Maybe its a problem with my unit. I'm not sure. I Also got some weird messages here and there, like "battery not compatible" or something to that effect. Photos from the are not too great either.  video was very good. Sometimes when i was shooting video and the reception would go the video would not save to the card and the footage would be lost.**Update: I Just spoke to Autel Support (which is great by the way, no wait time and very responsive and they are looking to send me a replacement controller.  I will repost once i receive and test, In which case i will adjust my review accordingly.**Update: Autel sent me an entire brand new replacement package via express shipping, rather than just the controller.  Outstanding customer support.  Im going to fly this weekend and will update my rating if this works better.**Update June 10: I had a chance to fly the drone in a suburban neighborhood with trees and then by the beach. In the surburbs, i received a drop out range after .4 miles.  There were many trees.  At the beach however, i achieved .9 miles and only stopped because the wind was 22MPH with strong gusts. But i did not get any drops in both video reception and controller reception, so that was great.  I also noticed that this drone did exceptional in wind.  I was really concerned with the wind, but this drone handled it with no problem. I have updated my rating to reflect my new experience.
