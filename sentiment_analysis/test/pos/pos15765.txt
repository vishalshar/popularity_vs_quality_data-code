I can't say enough good things about this gift set!  I purchased it as a birthday present for my best friend's daughter.  It met every criteria I have for children's presents - it promotes creativity, it's something to do, it doesn't require the parents to buy anything else, and it appealed to the child.  The materials are outstanding - plenty enough markers and glue, the wings themselves are tough enough to stand up to a lot of creative play or wear, and the design is easy for a child to put on or off themselves.  I also really appreciate including the glitter glue - everyone loves glitter and every parent fears the mess.  Glitter glue makes it possible to have the best of both worlds, although you may wish to have a popsicle stick or butter knife available to spread it out so it will dry faster.  I also would suggest putting down some paper before coloring the wings - this is cloth you are coloring which means the dye can bleed through.  We let it dry overnight before using to avoid smearing any of the glue or dye.The little girl I got this for is butterfly OBSESSED so I chose this over the similar bird design, although I would imagine the product would be just as nice.
