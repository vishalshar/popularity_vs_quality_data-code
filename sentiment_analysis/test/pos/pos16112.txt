My oldest who is not a fan of Math and struggles with it actually LOVES this game. We've had a few younger kids play it and with guidance they can do okay. It's a fun twist on math and they're doing it without even realizing it. I can't say enough good things about this game we just love it. With the price I was a bit skeptical to buy considering if they didn't like it then I'd be out that money for a game nobody likes but it was worth every single penny!
