This product is great and has some great functionality and sound.  I didn't rate it 5 stars because the cord that comes with it is not that great.  The cord could not get a good connection with my phone for some reason, so any time i moved the audio would mess up.  But there are a ton of great alternative cords on the market so the product as a whole is still well worth the money.
