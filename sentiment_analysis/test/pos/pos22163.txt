I loved the kit, my glass ball ended up breaking sadly and the water bottle is perfect for keeping them alive.  This is the only air plant that has survived and I purchased a 5 back from another place. I watered all of them at the same time and tried to position the dying plants in different amounts of sunlight. I'm excited that the plant from MakersKit survived is producing pups!
