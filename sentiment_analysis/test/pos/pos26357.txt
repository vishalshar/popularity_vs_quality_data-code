It's the perfect addition to my cord cutting tools.  I found that there is more content than I could ever watch on Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix so I could cut the cord for about 25.00 per month but I did miss having access to live sports and live local news on a big news day.  This is the perfect solution.  For the price of 2.5 months of cable, I get a very good antenna(I get over 40 channels in my area and I don't live that close to the transmitters) AND a DVR.  It's like getting a TIVO and HD Antenna in one that you can simultaneously "plug" into every TV and mobile device.The only drawback I see, but that is not a deal breaker for us, is the single tuner.  You can only record or watch one live stream at a time.  You can watch recordings while viewing or recording a live stream though.  It would get a 5 star if it had 2 tuners but still a product I highly recommend.
