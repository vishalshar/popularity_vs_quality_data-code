Really Like these. Wanted something that I could control with voice command via Amazon Echo Alexa when I came into my house and something that didn't need an expensive startup. Got 2 bulbs for 74 dollars on site special. They are very responsive and very bright colors. My living room is so much cooler haha. App works great for basic changes. Still working on finding out how to save favorites for just using the 2 lights for white, movie theater mode, or custom colors.  You can do this separately but I want shortcuts. Need to learn the If this than that part so that it'll turn on automatically when it senses my phone close to my house. I named the room to "the" to make speech commands easier and less wordy through Alexa. You have to say "Alexa ask Lifx to set lights green" etc. For just turning on or off though I simply say "Alexa lights on."  Looking forward to playing more with these. Please add light strips LIFX for under my couch so I don't have to buy Phillips!  But seriously though for the money, performance and functionality you can't beat this. And I looked at every one on the market. Cheers.**Adendum** Found out how to do favorites another way.  Once you have bulb color and brightness the way you want it, go back to home screen, click the + sign top right and name it.  It shows up under Scenes.  So much easier now!
