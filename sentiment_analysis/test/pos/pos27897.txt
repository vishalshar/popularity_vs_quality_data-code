Updated to review the plug December 19, 2016,Converting over to smart home devices is a fun as well as an efficient endeavor for me. I have several TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works with Amazon Alexa (HS100) plugs and decided to give this WeMo plug a try too to see how it compares.Since I have the  WeMo wall switch that I originally reviewed below, I already had the app set up and paired with Echos Alexa.  I found it just as easy to add the WeMo plug to the WeMo and Alexa apps as I did with the TP-link plugs.  Both plugs can be grouped together in the Alexa app as well.There are small differences.  The TP-link shows the Wifi light at all times.  When my WeMo plug is turned off, there is no LED light indicator showing Wifi connectivity although it remains connected.  I found this disconcerting at first since the WeMo wall switch has a small LED that stays on when the switch is off.  However, the plug works just fine with both the app and the Echo.As with the TP-Link plug, the size of the plug may be an issue if one is plugging it directly into an outlet and wants to plug anything larger than a small lamp type plug into an adjoining outlet.They both have unusual shapes but the TP-link plug is about 2.5  wide, 4 long and 2 deep.The WeMo plug is about 3.25 wide, 4.5 long and 1.75  deep.  Because of their sizes, I find it more convenient to plug both of the units into a power strip and find that they both work quite well that way too.At this point, I am equally happy with each of them.  If any problems with longevity or functionality develop, I will update my review.Original Review of WeMo wall switch:I really wanted the ability to control my bedroom ceiling fan with my voice but I chose my fans more for form than function.The builder installed double switches for my fans, one switch controlled the fan motor and the other the attached lights.  When I got my new fans with remote controls, I found that I only needed one switch to control the power for both while the other switch became a dummy.Fortunately, I usually keep my fans at the same preferred setting, so I decided to get a Wemo light switch to use with Alexa.  It programmed so quickly with immediate app and Echo recognition.If I want to change the speed or light setting, I need to use the remote but since the Wemo switch turns it on at the previous settings, I rarely use the remote. I am quite happy with this product and the Alexa integration.
