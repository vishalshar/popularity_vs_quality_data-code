Great tool for learning Guitar. Yes granted this is not the real thing, and there will be a learning curve when switching to the real thing. But there is a market for self paced instrument learning, and this definitely helped to get started. Also cool for MIDI playing of virtual instrument, much more convincing results than playing using a Midi keyboard.
