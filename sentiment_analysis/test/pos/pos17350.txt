These cheese bags are porous and allow the proper amount of ventilation so the culture in cheeses stays alive longer and thus keeps your cheese tasting the way you want it to.  The same company makes this paper in roll form, but these bags take the guess out of how to wrap cheese correctly.  Much better than wrapping in regular paper or plastic wrap.  These bags can be reused about five times per bag.  Not recommended for very soft cheeses.
