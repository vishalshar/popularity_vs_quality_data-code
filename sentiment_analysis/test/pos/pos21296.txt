This is great. Most of the issues I had with measuring things were around accuracy, fractions and metric/imperial. This thing can cover all those cases, I carry it with me all the time.If anything I think they should make a more rugged version. For my use case, I'm almost never in a dusty environment and I don't mash it into stuff. If you are a construction worker it might be too flimsy.
