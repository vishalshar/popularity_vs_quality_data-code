Stocking stuffer for husband.  He loves it!  We had the previous model where the cord disconnects and it was stolen by a valet guy.  Husband was pretty upset as this little device comes in handy everyday.  This new model is great because nothing disconnects and the body is flexible so it doesn't poke or feel too bulky in your pocket.
