I like the quad lock system a lot. I use it on my bike and in my car so far. These setup has worked very well on my bike for the last few months. The only thing I worry about are the plastic/rubber bands that you use to wrap around your stem and connect the quad lock part. I feel they may eventually stretch too much and not hold it well or wear down and snap. It's an unfounded fear thus far. I leave it permanently attached to my cross/commuter bike and it's been on there for a few months now with no sign of fatigue. The lock itself is sold and I don't have any fear of my phone coming unlocked unless I push down the mechanism which can't be done by accident (I least I don't think so, not easily). Overall I'm happy with this setup and would definitely recommend it.
