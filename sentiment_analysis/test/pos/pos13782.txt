Works as claimed, packaged nicely on arrival, the gas capsules might be a bit pricey but plenty of hacks to fix that if you wish. The instructions that come with the device are okay. Pictures are a bit Ikea like if you enjoy that, but it turns out there are plenty of explanations and demos on You Tube. Once you use it once, it could not be easier to use from then on.We have lots of good wine and seldom finish a bottle anymore. With this gizmo you can take a glass or two or ten out of an expensive bottle of wine over the course of weeks, and the argon gas ensures the wine stays fresh. The needle goes through the cork (fake corks might not work) and the gas pressurizes the bottle and protects the remaining wine.So are we are extremely happy with the Coravin 2 system. If you have some expensive bottles of wine and wish to enjoy them by the glass, it isn't going to take but a few bottles to pay for this tool.  And pouring different wines for different people at the same time is no problem. Take out a glass or two and put the bottle back in the rack with the contents protected by argon.  Look the product is a bit pricey, but it is not some cheap piece of junk, this thing is well made and it works well.
