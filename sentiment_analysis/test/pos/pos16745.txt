Our family of four (my daughter and son are college students), plus my son's 23 y/o girlfriend, played Daytrader several times over the Spring Break weekend.  My daughter, who abhors strategy or money games (or any game that requires Math), did not hate playing the game.  I wouldn't go as far as to say she loved it, but I think she liked it more than she'll admit (she did play it several times).  It is different than Monopoly.  If you like Monopoly, or if you don't like Monopoly, you should try this game.  It is fun and easy to understand.  While with some games, it is easy to predict that certain people will succeed and naturally be better at a particular game than others - this game is not so.  My husband is a financial executive and my son is a 4.0 GPA Accounting major, but they are not the ones that won!  The only 'negative' thing I can say about the game is: we came across a situation while playing the game that was not addressed in the instruction manual, so we just made up our own rule.
