These are awesome for makeup brush fanatics!  I bought these to help with the drying process after washing my makeup brushes.  I would wash the brushes, remove excess water, put these on, then stand them in a glass (brush facing down) to dry.  When they were done drying, I'd remove the brush guard and my makeup brushes would be nice and dry and shaped in the proper form.  I will probably order more of these soon.
