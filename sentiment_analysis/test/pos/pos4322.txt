I received this phone a couple of weeks ago and I totally love it. I was specifically looking for a good camera and lots of space (since I have been struggling before with my previous Iphone and was obligated to delete pictures and lots of apps that I loved) and the Nextbit Robin offers a great quality on both aspects and I have been loving it since I got it.I was afraid it would not work properly since I am from MÃ©xico but I have had no problems with anything.I have gotten lots of good comments on how pretty it is and I am excited to show it off to everybody. It most be noted that I am a normal customer and that I don't know lots about camera specs or phone space itself, but for my experience everything seems to be working perfectly and with132 gb of space (cloud and phone itself) I cannot complain.I would 100% recommend it! Specially with the discount that Amazon offers for it. Great phone for a great deal.Pd. I would add the quick charger and some headphones for a complete user experience, but any one of those that you have should work perfectly.Pd2. So happy about the two speakers on the front! Perfect for watching Netflix or youtube videos with great sound.
