I've been using this for over a month now, and I can say it's the best remote I've ever used. I've made it my personal research project to find a good remote, read all the Cnet, Engadget, Amazon etc.. reviews before I made a decision and ended up with Anymote, and I'm happy with my decisionMostly because it's so much more than a remote. It also controls all my wifi devices, and it makes use of my true SMARTphone features: muting my TV when the phone rings, turning lights on at sunset or turning music on when I get home. Things that I couldn't have achieved with anything else.Amazon Echo integration is icing on the cake, and it made it a great focus piece over Christmas: "Alexa, tell AnyMote to turn on my tv". Kids and guests alike were able to interact with it with zero learning curve.The only two minor things I didn't like:1. Requires line of sight for IR equipment like non-smart TVs. I guess this isn't the Anymote's fault, but the dated technology.2. The initial configuration took some work, but it see it's gotten better over the last app update.Either way, there were many more things that I did like:1. Once set up, it's actually easier to use than a plastic remotes. All my commands are in the notification shade of my phone, so I don't even have to unlock it to start zapping. On my Android there's even a Facebook-style chathead remote that I can use while I'm browsing or casting YouTube videos to my TV.2. I have several tens of sequences of commands (they call them "macros"), so that I can turn on all my equipment with a single press, or switch to a specific channel with a single tap. I've neatly placed them on a custom remote screen, with my own colors, shapes, and icons. For me, the customization options were the ones that tipped the balance - they're virtually limitless.3. Fully configurable gesture mode. Just swipe up/down for volume, left/right for channel, without even having to look at it. One finger gestures, 2 fingers, all on a dark, non-intrusive screen. Grandma used it too.4. Widgets, chatheads, mute on call - all things that I could only get on the mini-computer in my pocket (also called a smartphone), and AnyMote uses those beautifully.5. Integrates directly with my smart devices. WeMo, my Smart TV, Apple TV, etc. Beats any other product's direct integrations I've seen. Even better, it makes all of them accessible through my Echo.Overall, it's a great remote that I would definitely recommend. There are configuration quirks that you quickly get used to, but I've only seen it get better. When you're done with the initial setup, you're left with a remote that looks just the way you want to, requires less clicks than anything else to get you to your favorite channel / app / mood, and gets your toes into the new home automation scene.
