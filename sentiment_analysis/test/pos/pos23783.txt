I have a Roku, Smart TV, Intel NUC (with XBMC), HDMI switch, Directv DVR and remote controlled ceiling fan/lights. It became a pain to manage all of these remotes so I decided to give Anymote Home a try. Installation was easy, it just requires two AA batteries. However, configuring all of my devices took some time but that was expected. I had some problems getting my Intel NUC to power on/off using the learning feature. I emailed support and within ten minutes I had a clear and concise response and my issue was fixed. Essentially, the power button on MCE remotes actually contains two seperate IR codes and Anymote will only detect one -- this explained why the recorded code would power on the NUC but fail to turn it off. Anyhow, customer support suggested I try prebuilt MCE remotes and I actually ended up finding a remote that turned off the NUC and one that turned it on. As a result, I was able to create a custom remote and assign a macro to a button to get the NUC to power on and off using one button.The only other issue I had configuring Anymote Home ended up being my fault. I couldn't get Anymote to recognize my remote for my lights/ceiling fan and then it suddenly hit me... its a RF remote (oops!). Regardless, it would be really cool if a new revision of Anymote could support both RF and IR in the future.After configuring Anymote I'm extremely happy with the results and I highly recommend it. While you may need to spend significant time configuring it and getting it to work with all your devices, the end result is well worth it. Honestly, I don't really see this as being unique to Anymote, either. It seems like home automation is still very new and requires significant troubleshooting. Regardless, if you require help don't hesitate to contact customer support. The support I received was outstanding and many other reviews here seem to say the same thing.
