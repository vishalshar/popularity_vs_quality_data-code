My son has autism and is now receiving ABA therapy. This was on the list of things that was recommended to buy for the therapists to use with him. I initially thought it was pretty expensive. They got it out and started using as soon as it came and the cards are wonderful! There are so many helpful cards in this kit! They use it for almost every skill they work on with him. Bottom line is yes it was pricey but the progress he is making with this kit well worth it! Would definitely recommend!!!
