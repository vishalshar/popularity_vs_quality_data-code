used to use the Spork by Light My Fire on backpacking trips, but I got so sick of them breaking all the time. I mean, theyre only three bucks, but cmon  they should last longer than a trip or two!  I recently got a humangear Duo and so far its fantastic. Ive taken it on a few trips in the Trinity Alps and its so much better than the Spork. First, it feels way stronger  I can easily bend the Spork but the Duo tools are much, much stiffer. They feel like theyre going to really last (time will tell). The fork and spoon click together in two ways  the storage/"nested" mode and an extended mode where you click the two handles together end-to-end to make one long tool. The packaging indicates the tools can be used separately but Ive found I mostly use them in the extended mode.  When extended, its a great tool to cook with (reaches deep down into my Jet Boil pot), and you can eat from meal bags without getting any food mush on your hands. Best of all, these come with a lifetime warranty. I had a humangear GoToob that had a cap break after I accidentally dropped it and humangear sent me a free replacement cap right away, so I've got reason to believe theyre going to stand behind this product, too. Im planning to get another Duo to use at the office. My only gripe is I wish it came in some other colors. Otherwise, awesome.
