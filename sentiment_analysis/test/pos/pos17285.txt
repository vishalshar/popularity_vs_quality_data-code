I have had this for almost a month and love it! Very stylish and cool, I wear with the tan leather strap and it is very bohemian chic. I have gotten tons of compliments on it and the app is perfection, storing exactly what I need. I thought I would need a bigger strap, but it does stretch nicely for those of us with "strong" bones. Customer service has been great, and even the box the leaf comes in as well as the accessories, is cute and stylish. The fitbit was just not for me, this is perfect for the modern gal.
