I rarely write reviews on products but confess I use them to guide my purchases.  The Quad Lock is top notch! The base fits perfectly on my bicycle with easy to use straps.  The phone case fits my Iphone 6 Plus and is great looking.  The phone locks snuggly to the base with no movement.  I rode over several terrains and the phone didn't move or jiggle.  That's what sold me considering the cost to replace a phone should it fall off.  The Quad Lock took less than 5 minutes to put on my bike.  It's simple to take your phone off the base and carry with you. Definitely worth the cost, I highly recommend it.  I hope this helps some of you make a decision.
