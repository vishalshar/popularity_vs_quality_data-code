My first impressions for this mouse were very impressed. I noticed the very professional like packaging and packing. Moving onto the mouse itself it's a very reliable mouse, I personally play first person shooters like CS:GO,Battlefield,and Arma 3 and the sensor is superb. The cable is a threaded type cable and probably my only complaint is that the thread starts to become Velcro like if you don't have a mouse anchor. Finally, the software and lighting. The software can take a while to get used to and not that many lighting options as for example corsair cue. The lights on the mouse itself are GREAT they shine bright and are lively. My final word, BUY IT it's an excellent piece of craftsmanship for any gamer!
