This phone was delivered to me in less of 24 hours, so I'm impress. By the way, POSH pro was not just a good deal, it was a better deal than  the POSH titan 6.0" I bought a few ago for one of my cousin in South American. Gee! for the price you cannot let go this one. So far so good, I got no trouble with this phablet  since I turned on two days ago and load a couple apps. It is not just a good deal but damn good deal I tell you what.
