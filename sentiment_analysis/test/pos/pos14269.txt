My sons iPad has not only had a good screen cover on but this case.  Its not been dropped, but I notice tonight that there's a crack on the screen!  This iPad is brand new.  Not happy.5/13/16 upon further inspection of the iPad I have discovered its the screen protector that's cracked nite the iPad.  So I have changed my rating.  The seller was very prompt at addressing my concern and assisting me to figure out a solution.
