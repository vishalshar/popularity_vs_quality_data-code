Best time ever with my dog!  We have an 8 month old puppy and we hate to leave her alone.  We have been spending the day trainer her to use the Petzi.  She learned in in just under an hour. My BF and I were able to download the program and learn it in about 5 mins.  the Petzi community is great.  You can share pictures of your pet with the community.  Our puppy quickly made it to The Amos Popular Page (ok I have to brag a little).  I highly recommend this product for anyone who has a pet they love!!! Quick note: the mini Milkbones included in the box get stuck sometimes.  We are switching to round treats.
