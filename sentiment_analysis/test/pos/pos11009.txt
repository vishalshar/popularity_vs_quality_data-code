They worked well once I oiled them (with Houdini, the locksmith's oil, not WD-40 or anything that would leave a reside and mess up the shirt's collar).  Before that 3 out of 4 stuck so that I could not change their size.I used them 1 time in a shirt with a notoriously difficult collar for most stays, and they were better than plastic, but a bit thick so the points of the collar folded up for about 1/8".I also took them on my last business trip and it was nice just having 1 pair rather than the little plastic bag of several different sized pairs that I normally take with me.
