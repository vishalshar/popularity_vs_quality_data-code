I needed a charger that I would be sure I had on me at all times with my external charger. This little product fits the bill perfectly! I don't usually leave feedback, but this charger is so convenient. At first I wasn't sure how well it would hold up since I have to bend it slightly so that I can hold my charger and my phone while I'm using it, but it is built very durable and the quality of the plastic and rubber is very good. I would highly recommend it if you charge your iPhone from a laptop or external charger.One recommendation I would have is to make a clip that makes it detachable when it is on my keyring so that I can use it while I'm in the car and don't have to take it off the key ring every time. Other than that, it's great.
