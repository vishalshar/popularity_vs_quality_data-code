This thing sure looked used when it arrived, which if you think about what it's designed to do, is pretty disgusting. The unit itself had some dust on it, and it was upside down in an unclosed package. Although this was disconcerting, I really wanted to try it out. 4 AA batteries, some sunflower seeds and about ten minutes later the first chipmunk was a goner. I hate to do it, but they are devastating my yard and concrete driveway. Critter ridder and vinegar didn't seem to get the message across, so clearly this now must escalate to genocide.
