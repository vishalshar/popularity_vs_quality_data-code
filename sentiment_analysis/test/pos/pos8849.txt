I'm so glad to have found Anchor Bars! My daughter had terrible "morning" sickness that lasted all day. For a while she was unable to eat much of anything except Anchor Bars. Not only do the ingredients help with nausea, but the bars taste great too!  They were worth every penny! I highly recommend trying them! They were a huge help!
