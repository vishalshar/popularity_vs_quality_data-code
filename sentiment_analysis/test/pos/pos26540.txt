This is great. It took just 5 minutes to install, including remove old controller, take a picture of the wiring/zoning drill 2 new (4 is an overkill). The instructions are quite simple similar to Nest. Powerline connection for internet access was quick to set up but after installation since the WiFi signal in the garage is good, I decided to switch to Wifi. This required to reset the unit from inside with a paper clip (to find out this, I had to look for instructions on Blossom website, just a minor annoyance) . After resetting WiFi worked great, unless WiFi signal is weak there is no need for the powerline connection (this was not clear to me from instructions, as first step of printed instruction is to set up the the powerline).Mobile app is well done and easy toset up, however lacks some advanced functionalities as other reviewers already mentioned. My guess is that for most of the people is just fine but hopefully Blossom in future will add some more controls.
