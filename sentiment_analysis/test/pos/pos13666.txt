2:00 AM: Alexa, trigger warm bed2:15 AM: Climb into bed, stretch out my legs, snuggle against the warm sheets - ahhh.Theres nothing quite like crawling into a warm bed after a chilly Seattle day. Especially when you know its got your back in the morning to wake you up, and tell you all about how you slept.Unlike other sleep trackers (personally owned two Fitbits), Eight gets the smart sleep experience right. Its not only clever data and analytics, but feels good. Its like the mom that makes you a hot chocolate instead of telling you to stop drinking coffee.Set up:- Set up was very easy. The 6 step physical setup and 10 step app setup took at most a few minutes. App and boxing are both beautiful.- Fit for queen is perfect. The satiny texture feels good enough to sleep on.Pros:- Designed for single and double occupancy. Heating works individually on either side, as does tracking. App makes it super easy to invite your sleep partner to track their sleep as well.- Lots of data collected - breathing rate, sleep cycles, temperature, sleep score, etc.- Integration with IFTTT - hello Alexa and future smart device hook upsCons:- Plug into connected hub needs to be pushed fairly firmly all the way in, it got disconnected for a couple hours during first-time setup- Can use wider selection of alarms to wake up to, especially the one thats already in use on the phone
