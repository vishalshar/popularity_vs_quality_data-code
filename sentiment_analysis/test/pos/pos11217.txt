My kids don't have food allergies, but the school they go to is very strict about their nut-free policy.  I have sent snacks before that I know don't contain nuts, but they wouldn't even let them open the package, because they didn't specifically say "Nut free" on it.  I was happy to see these say NUT FREE in big letters on the package, so my kids can eat them at school.  They're really tasty too, and the squirrels are cute.  They're also a much better choice than something like fruit snacks, that are also nut free, but stick to the teeth.  My kids are happy with these, their school is happy with these, and I will definitely buy them again.
