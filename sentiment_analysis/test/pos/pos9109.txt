ONLY UP 1 DAY. It was very easy to set up.  Took 10 -15 min to figure out its operation, but it seems to work really well.I played with it for a while and am happy.The camera rotation response is a bit slow but not terrible.  I am now not is the house and just saw the family having breakfast and was able to communicate with them.Pretty Cool. My wife didn't know I set up a camera and I think she got a bit freaked.
