Our 8 year old Boxer Lab mix has had some perisistent skin issues for a few years now. In addition to developing a bacterial skin infection all around his undercarriage, he's been fighting a non-cancerous abcess that fills with fluid on his neck, eventually swells and bursts, then is a pain to heal. He's been put through the ringer with antibiotics for over 3 years and has had 3 surgeries because of it; we still don't know what's going on with his neck. It seems like he just has persistent problems from the trauma of it all and can't quite get over the hump to stay better.Fast forward to a few months ago, when we started looking into immune support to help his skin from the inside out. His belly and inside legs are healing, and his neck hasn't filled with fluid at all for nearly 3 months. He is definitely showing signs of being a senior pup, and his body is probably taxed from long-term antibiotics, but he's so much happier, healthier, more energetic... his health problems are just so minimal compared to what we know they can be. And! Our vet approved it, too - for the selenium and Vitamins C and E in particular.As for it coming in powder form... he's a picky guy with his food, treats, and supplements. I started mixing it with one tablespoon of wet food, as was suggested in other reviews, and now he will eat his powder-sprinkled dry food no problem. Another suggestion is to put the powder in cooled-down chicken broth, and pour that over the dry food. Either way, when they're hungry, they'll have to eat it. :)
