My 4y/o son had a scooter bike for the longest time, which he outgrew.  He's been growing like a weed so we skipped the 16" wheel and went straight to 18".  Had to cut off part of the seat post to lower it enough for him but he is able to ride it.  We ditched the pedals and the training wheels so he could just scoot on it like the old bike.This is a great little kid's bike. It is of very good quality.  Thick and very substantial tubing, purpose-built tires, even a bell.  My estimation having built and owned bikes for the last 50 years is that my son will hand this down to his kids.  He'll outgrow it before it would ever break.  They don't build bikes like this anymore.  They used to, back in the 60's when I was a kid but no more.  I'm wondering if these are a batch that was made in the 60's and discovered in a warehouse.  They look brand new anyway.
