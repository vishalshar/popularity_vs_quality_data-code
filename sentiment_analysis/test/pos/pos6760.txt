Some of the questions above are inappropriate - they're a lacing system, not shoes!That said, they work well for me. I have no idea how or why some people say they're breaking them? Maybe the kids are using them for purposes other than holding their shoes on? I've been wearing a set in my New Balance cross-trainers over 3 months now and like them a lot. And so far, haven't broken any.  If they don't fit, look over the options of how to set them up on the Hickies website before giving up. There's more than one way! Really!  I tried these because I was sick and tired of the shoelaces in those shoes untying themselves like every five minutes when running, even when double-knotted!  That is so over now. I use them as slip-ons and they're comfortably snug, whatever I'm doing.  For the lower two sets of eyelets, I placed them in an X configuration to tighten. The rest were straight across, and the top ones I initially left unhooked. Now they've stretched and I can hook the top ones without discomfort. The lower ones stretched too, so until I replace them I'm using a skip-one X there and just above, like bottom eyelet on one side to third eyelet up on the other, and second on one side to fourth on the other.  I'm a happy customer.
