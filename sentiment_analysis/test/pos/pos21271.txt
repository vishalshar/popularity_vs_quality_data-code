I have had this newest version for a week now. It's really cool. The instructions are useless. They advise you to look at the YouTube tutorials which I did. The unit is good looking and is kept on my nightstand. I just ordered the tether cable to secure the GunBox to my bed frame. Highly recommended. The only issue I have is the biometric reader isn't the best. I've re-set(deleted) the saved fingerprints a few times now and I actually save multiple fingerprints of the same finger just in case and it still opens up on average every third time. I don't know if this biometric technology is top notch on these units. It even has a difficult time every second or third swipe of the provided RFID tags and cards.I just hope that should an intruder ever be inside my home, this unit will open when I need it.
