Mountek nGroove Universal CD Slot Mount (Black)Let me begin by saying that of all the product reviews I've submitted to Amazon not very many receive 5 stars.I could have been throwing my money away on another relatively expensive "gimmicky" gadget.  Fortunately I took a chance and ordered this from Amazon, and I'm glad I did.  This product is perfect for my 5" Garmin GPS.On the day I received it, I put my GPS unit into the bracket and installed the CD slot mount in my 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe.  I then drove over some roads that were more pot hole than road with absolutely no problem.  It held my GPS securely with nary a movement.  In my vehicle, the device does obscure the clock, and some radio controls.  However this is not a problem, as these controls are duplicated on the steering wheel.  Although this product comes with absolutely no written instructions, the installation into the CD slot, as well as other adjustments I've described below, should be fairly self explanatory once you see it.A couple of words of advice.  If this is being used for a GPS, you will likely need to remove the little plastic "foot" which is at the bottom of the bracket as shown in the picture, (it comes off quite easily if you're careful), and then rotate the arms so they are positioned at the top and bottom.  Then just squeeze the arms together until your GPS is held securely in place.  Once you have the GPS turned for the best viewing angle, take a penny and tighten the screw at the back of the holding bracket.
