I've been using this for the "text w/ETA" feature so I can safely communicate my arrival time with the one click on the road or otherwise busy with the kids or running errands.  I'm excited to try more of the other features as I get better acquainted with this device.  I love the little pouch it comes in.  Great size, perfect for a stocking stuffer!
