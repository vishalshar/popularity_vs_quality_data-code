It was bigger and more solid than I thought it would be. Front controls are a little chintzy feeling, as is the cd door. But other than that build quality is about what I expected. Everything works well. Decent sound. Really good midrange sound, base is lacking and muddy, but connecting it to my home receiver and subwoofers fixes that.
