I have a senentary job, and like to munch on things. After steadily gaining weight, I decided that what I was munching on wasn't doing me any favors. Enter dried and bake dried fruit. There is no guilt if I polish off an entire bag in one sitting, although, I do try to refrain from doing so.  The Bare Fruit brand is great. Because these are baked dried, they are crunchy, like chips. And the only ingredients are apples and cinnamon. Because of the shrinkage, you can eat more than you mean to, but it is far better than eating anything artificial. Amazon's price is very competitive. I originally bought these from Marshall's and TJ Maxx for two dollars, twenty nine cents.
