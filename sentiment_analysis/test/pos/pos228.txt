I can only give 5 stars? Let's start off with my deodorant journey. Everyone raves about the crystal, Toms, homemade, etc etc. I tried it all. Nothing really worked and I started to think either these girls have evolved from producing pit sweat or something. Half of these products tried eating through my arm pit like I was skinning myself or applying slow burning acid.So back to cancer cream for my pits. Who cares. But I kind of like my mammary glands, so deep down I shed a tear with every application.When I saw all the reviews on this product I rolled my eyes. There's no way it's that good. Everyone raves about the worst stuff. But I was feeling kind of morbid and felt like spending $9 to burn through my arm pits again.Well today it arrived. The first thing I saw was it was made right here in my home state of Texas! Awesome! The second thing I noticed was the HEAVENLY smell. (My gods the smell!!!!) I had to use no more than a pea sized amount and it was more than enough. A slight sting from the baking soda for a split second. Now within a few hours I'm calling my husband, mom, grandmother, doula, and weird neighbor because this stuff is amazing!!!! Still no smell! Just did some jumping jacks just to check. Nothing.I mean seriously, only 5 stars? Did I mention it's all natural? It's made in Texas (that's a deal breaker to us Texans)? THE SMELL!!!!!
