I got this feeder because we were going away for the holidays and my diabetic kitty needs to be fed wet food every 6 hours, yikes! It is very difficult to find a sitter in my town willing to do more than twice per day visits so this feeder saved my vacation!  I got the feeder in 2 days and the set up was a piece of cake. My other kitty was messing around with it while I was setting it up and some how it got misaligned. I emailed customer service at 3 o'clock in the morning so worried that I would not get a response in time to fix it before we left but, I had a response in 2 minutes, literally. He told me how to fix it and it worked perfectly from then on. Alex responded so quickly that I never once had to worry that it wouldn't get fixed in time for my trip. I also wanted an extra tray for the feeder to make it easier on my cat sitters and he sent one to me free of charge and very quickly. I am very impressed with this company, there aren't very many like it out there! He has really come up with a fantastic product. I love being able to control when Snuggs gets fed from my cell phone and using the pre-recorded message to call him over to the feeder was super helpful. But above all my favorite function of the feeder is the video camera. Snuggs, my kitty, has easily visible signs of being under/over medicated so it gave me great peace of mind to be able to see him and keep an eye out for the changes. As a matter of fact there was a time when we were away that I was able to tell he needed an increase in his meds. I was able to pass that along to my cat sitters and my little guy didn't have to suffer long, all thanks to this feeder! I felt in control of his disease and was able to enjoy my trip with confidence. It was so nice to be able to see my baby and make sure he was eating, and not being shoved out by his brother. Last but not least it is so great that it is virtually impossible for my kitty to "feed himself" as he is prone to do with other feeders. He almost figured out how to do it by stepping on the buttons on the top, but because of the 2 second wait time and having to press two buttons at once to unlock the feeder it was just out of his skill set.All in all this is probably the best feeder on the market, at least of the ones I found. And with customer service that will blow your mind I feel I can whole heartedly recommend this product to anyone who wants peace of mind while they are away from home. Another added benefit I had not foreseen was that I could use it to get more sleep at night! So thanks so much, Alex, for your wonderful invention and I look forward to more from you in the future.
