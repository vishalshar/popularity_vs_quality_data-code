Had this for exactly a week and I'm quite impressed. I know basil grows fast, but these look incredibly healthy and they're coming in rapidly. I've also bought the experimental capsules which I'm trying out with my own seeds, so those will take longer to sprout than the basil. I'll update with pics when they do, but for now have some before and afters!A few days after set up vs. Today (1 week)
