Good little suitcase. Made of strong plastic. I expected it to be made of something stronger or at least something that looks stronger than hard plastic. The connectivity is great - no issues there. Good for overnight or maybe a 2-night trip for ladies. I would not use it for more clothes than that for a woman. For men - it would be great for a 3-night trip if they know how to pack well. It is small but effective.
