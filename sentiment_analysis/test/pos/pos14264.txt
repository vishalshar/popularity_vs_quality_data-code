Pretty good. Easy to press all of the buttons still. Access to lightning and headphone jack no problem. Carrying handle is great. Easy for my daughter to carry. And of course, it does a great job protecting the iPad. First thing I did was purposely drop the iPad on its front, back, and sides to see how it'd do. Started at about a foot from the ground and then up to a few feet. No problem. It's a very good design and an attractive case for your little ones whom you let use your iPad.
