Bought this case in October 29, 2015. Amazing case and I still have it on, but I am now having issues with the volume button. The silicon seem to ripped apart from the case. When I bought it, it had a warranty label on the description, but I do not see it anymore. Also bought it for $24, so prices increased. Overall, would much be appreciated if I could return it to get it fixed or replaced.
