I've been looking for a while for a device to help find missing keys. So glad I got the TrackR Bravo. It is small, affordable, and so easy to set up. It also comes with a key loop so you can attach it to your key chain, etc. and a double-sided sticker. Will definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a device to help find lost items.
