I purchased this item from Amazon after careful review of the other compatible systems in the market. I made my decision above all considering the extra fast and courteous customer service of Tado. They were very prompt in replying to all my questions. Secondly the guarantee of German Technology/ product is a comfort to me that unlike the cheap Chinese products this will be a product that will last many years. Some Manufacturers like Sensibo did not even take a minute to acknowledge the questions, leave alone respond to the queries.I use the product in Sri Lanka. It was a breeze setting up the unit to my Panasonic inverter AC. It took about 30 minutes for the full set-up to be completed. I saw some reviews saying that some knowledge of tech is needed to set this unit. But I don't see that need as all steps are menu driven and guided step by step.The unit performs extremely well both inside the network/ house and from outside (remote) operation.I have reviewed less one star because i see room for improvement. The TADO unit display does not show when the TADO is used to trigger the AC. The display is blank. At present the display lights up ONLY when the AC is operated by tapping the TADO unit. This is misleading and less a important feature. Seeing the settings, tempreture to which the AC is triggered using the App, on the TADO display I believe is essential, especially in cases where the AC does not have a display. At the minimum, an option must be provided on the app to enable or disable the TADO display.Secondly, the iFTTT has only limited options. The most important options are missing. Getting a "IF" alert when the AC is switched 'ON' and 'OFF' is something that everyone will like to have especially when the AC is triggered ON or OFF remotely. This IFTTT option missing is a major set back just like the display issue.I tried the Geo switching option. It works fine. In Countries like Sri Lanka, using an AC is a luxury due to the high cost of Energy. As such, the option of auto switching every time i enter the house was not practical as we use this particular AC in the bedroom and require it to work only in the late evenings thru the night till morning. As such, the timing option was more useful to me than the Geo option. Having said this, the GEO option is a very cool and novel option that will be useful to many customers.TADO customer service has responded to me that they are working on TADO display activation & IFTTT concerns to get activated soon. This positive response is very much to be admired and we will see how soon these are activated.I will update my review as usage of this system increases and no sooner that the concerns mentioned above have been corrected by TADO as confirmed by them.OVERALL, A VERY DEPENDABLE AND SOLID SYSTEM THAT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IS PROMISED. I recommend the Tado.
