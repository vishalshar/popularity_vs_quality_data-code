I've had my herb garden growing for a few weeks now. All the seeds sprouted with no problem (except the clover, I didn't even plant it as I have no use for it). The jars are cute and attractive, and the kit they came in was also very well done. However, it is difficult to see the rocks at the bottom and decipher whether there's water down there or not. I find myself sprinkling some water over them about twice a week as the dirt seems to dry up quite quickly. I'm afraid of overdoing it and drowning the roots.
