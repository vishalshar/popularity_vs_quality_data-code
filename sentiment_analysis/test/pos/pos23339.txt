This Christmas was a total cliche - my son's first bike! The bike comes mostly put together...I had to add the pedals, training wheels, seat, handlebars. It comes with exactly the tools you need and easy-to-follow directions. I'm handy, but anyone could easily put this together. It took me all of 20 minutes. No big deal at all. It also comes with a kickstand in case you don't want the training wheels or want to remove them later. I'm so very pleased with how user-friendly this was. And the bike is great quality as well. If you're looking for a great bike, this is it.
