I love this! Battery lasts longer if you don't have it on the adventure setting all day long. Your pet could be in another country, and this will find them! EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE FOR THEIR PET! But keep the battery charged at all times, very important. They give you two of them, so that helps a lot. Was kind of big for my cats, but didn't bother them, they got used to it. I took it off them when they were inside at night.
