The solution this device provides is fantastic and works great.  Just a couple of frustrations:1) the charger and cable are cheap.  Housing almost broke on both sides of the USB cable.  Don't know how long these will last.2) if something stops and reverses the door for example a toy is in the way and the door reverses, the app just says "stopped" and you have to use your actually door button to close after moving the toy.3) documentation is very nonexistent. Trying to find what all options in the app does is nowhere to be found.  Also hooking the two wires to the door opener is a little challenging.  The color wires are blue and black and the colors on my screws are red and white.  So had to play "see if this works".4) the app will alert you if the door is open as you drive away.  I wish it also had an option to open the garage door as you came within the geofence.Now that's a lot of criticism but I really do love this product and makes me a lot lazier ;)
