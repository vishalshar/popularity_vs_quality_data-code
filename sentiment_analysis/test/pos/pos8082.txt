I have an iPhone, after pairing the watch with it, I went through the setup with ease. The syncing process was super easy with the instructions on the phone and watch. The UI is very similar to Android notification screen which makes thing very easy to navigate. The main UI menus are simple and easy to use. There is a lot of customization for the watch face (main screen with the clock). The watch is very light and comfortable to wear. The voice assistant is very useful and recognizes my voice very accurately. Screen touch and the tickle strip on the side (scroll function) are sensitive and work very well. So far so good.
