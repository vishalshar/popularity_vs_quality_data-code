Love this product!!!  After receiving and charging the unit (24000mah), I immediately begun running test.  I was able to power a Bose Acoustic Wave II system at full volume (actual) for 6.2 hrs.  For reference, the Bose unit is rated at 120V~ 50/60Hz, 60W.  Only negative note I have has nothing to do with the product itself and is actually due to the fact that I ordered the 27000mah and received the 24000mah version (get on those guys down in shipping..  lol).  This is no big deal being that Chargetech was very responsive and will be sending me out the correct version soon.  ChargeTech, not sure if you actually read these post but I would recommend that the next version of these units come with a 12V outlet and if you really want to be fancy, add a jumper cable accessory (IJS).  Anyway, I think this power pack is an excellent product and I will recommend it to anyone needing a portable AC/usb power supply alternative.  Before purchasing, do your due diligence and make sure the power pack can handle the power requirements of whatever widget you're using.
