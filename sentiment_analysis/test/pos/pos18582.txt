it doesn't have a programmable feature. We fixed that easily enough. We went to the hardware store and purchased a digital timer. The only other thing we noticed was whoever makes the carafes didn't mold the spout on one of them correctly so it has a tendency to drip. Otherwise it is a great space saver and works great.
