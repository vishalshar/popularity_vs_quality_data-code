I needed a grip enhancer for my shooting gloves.  I live in the Pacific Nortwest and I often wear gloves when shooting in the Fall and Winter.  Due to the cool temperatures and moist/wet conditions during those seasons, I went searching for a product that would provide a moderate amount of tackiness without leaving a sticky gooey residue on my guns or my gloves.  Found it ... Grip Boost.  I squeeze a blob on to the palm of one glove, rub both gloves together briefly, let them sit for about 30 seconds or so ... then I am good to go.  During the course of a 2 hour shooting session, I will reapply Grip Boost 2 or 3 times depending on conditions.  Great product.  Great company with good people eager to hear from the customers.  5 Stars from me.
