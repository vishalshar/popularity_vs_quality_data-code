I get a such a kick out of this little robot!It does seem to really eat away at battery power.However, man that doesn't bother me really because I have fun just with its out of box functions. I still have yet to teach it tricks,and you can teach it up to 50 which is cool.I suggest getting the free app for it also so can have it dance to whatever music you like as well and do more stuff with it.
