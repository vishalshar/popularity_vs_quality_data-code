Works great after a couple days of use. Bought it to use in our son's car...he's a new driver and we would like to be contacted if there were any significant accident. Also helps to be able to view driving style and see where/when travels are taking him.I'd like there to be a way to share the account with another user if his mother would also like the ability to view the same details without having to share my account info (that also has my car on it).GPS is very accurate. It seems to capture the exact street address that the car is parked at. GPS seems to update every minute or so.Nice job automatic! Peace of mind given to the parents of some young drivers.
