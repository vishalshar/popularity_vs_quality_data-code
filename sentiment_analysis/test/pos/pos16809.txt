I bought this product the week before my playoff game and received it soon enough to try it at practice. I shared it with everyone and they loved it too. The Grip Boost puts the grip right back on your gloves and doesn't leave any residue on the ball! Before using Grip Boost I would go through gloves like mad. I found my money saving solution!  Also the company really stands by their product.
