it's very promising! purchased one on amazon (which btw, is about $30 cheaper than the kuna website itself) installed it last night.the installation is easy. kuna supplies you with a mounting bracket and the appropriate wire caps. the installation from unboxing to finish took about 30 minutes.once you have everything physically mounted, you download the kuna app, and the app helps you connect the device with your home wifi.the operations of the light and app are well documented on the kuna website however here's a brief summary:- you can toggle the light on and off with the app. the response time is very quick.- you can press a button to talk through the light (walky talky like function)- you can sound a siren and it is quite loud- you can sound a few pre-recorded messages like "i'm busy right now/ can i help you? / sorry not interested"the camera settings:- you have the options of having your light turn on never, or turn on at dusk and turn off at dawn.- you can toggle if you want the light to turn on with motion sensing never, at night, or all day.- there are slider settings from 1-100 for motion sensitivity and another similar setting for the speaker volume.the actual operations:i had a big concern about the lag of the device - meaning - how long after it detected motion would i receive a notification on my phone. the lag is minimal (about 1-2 seconds normally). this isn't necessarily the light's fault - it could depend on various factors: my wifi, how far the light is from my router, how strong the signal is, how busy my phone is... etc. the bottom line is that it's a reasonable lag.another concern i had was about the sound quality. the speaker is loud and the voice quality is clear. the microphone is also always on and i can hear bird chirping when i have the video engaged. i'd imagine you can hear someone speaking at your door very clearly, possibly, even when they are mumbling.other concerns:i noticed the camera doesn't alert you right away upon motion detection. when testing, if i quickly enter the frame, then out, nothing happens. the light doesn't turn on, and i don't receive a notification on my phone. i think this may be by design - as to simulate a real visitor at your door. it seems motion has to be detected and sort of "stick around" for a few seconds for the motion to trigger.  this can be both good and bad for false positives.i wish the camera had a broader angle. don't get me wrong, it suffices currently, however for example i am unable to view my doormat with my camera pointed at the most downward angle.
