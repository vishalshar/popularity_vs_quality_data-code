As a runner, I totally love these! I used them during Ragnar and felt like I had just taken a shower. I'll also throw them in my bag if I'm going to go for a run or go to yoga and then to dinner or something after... I don't feel gross anymore and feel so clean. The clothes feel just like a towel... not a wimpy baby wipe!
