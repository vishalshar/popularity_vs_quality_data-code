I've played 9 rounds and I'm glad I made the purchase.  However, I have had some issues.  The amount of time it takes to sync the device with my phone at the course can take an inordinate amount of time and in some instances it's not able to sync where I then have to turn it off and back on.  My recommendation is to turn it on immediately at the golf course and preferably where Wi-Fi is available.  Then sometimes it freezes during the round, where you can't see real time stats but once you finish the round it then syncs all of the information as long as you continue to bump the device before every shot.  I'm not sure if it's the device itself or the speed of the connection that causes the issue.I've found for putting to go back after I finish the round and move the flag to the spot it was on the green to get more accurate data.  I'm interested to see how my stats continue to get more defined after around 20 rounds.
