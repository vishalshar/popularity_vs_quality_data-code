Looking for the surveillance camera was overwhelming and many cameras have similar features, functions and services. From my plenty of research to find the right fit for my needs, the Remocam is my choice.First, this camera not only allow to watch video feed in real-time or playback previous footage with audio-recording capability (audio-recording arenÂ’t always included all surveillance camera) but also has IoT control feature for home automation as a hub. I am the one who hesitate to purchase IoT hub spending few hundred dollars to make my home automation. This is the right product for me to monitor my home/kids and experience an IoT control as first time user.Second, two-way communication feature which I used most. As for the working mom, even if kids are at home with in-law parents or nanny, always miss all the moments and communication with in right timing when kids grow. This camera makes me much easier to talk with kids and parents rather than picking a phone to communicate with.Third, the simple and easy control UI for managing the device remotely. The wide tilt and pan monitoring angle by pressing arrows, and finger pinch interaction to zoom in and out for watching at the view point are great feature. The movement is pretty smooth for checking peripherals and the quality of view is affordable. But 720 resolutions is not really fan for it.Overall, Remocam is simple QR code scanning setup for configuring (my first time set up was fail but the problem was defined as Wi-Fi connection) and easy to use interface which can help me fully protect my family and valuables. I definitely buy more to expand security of my home.
