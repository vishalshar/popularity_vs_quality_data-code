This was easy to set up.  Just plug in and you are ready.  It was confusing to figure out what each buttons purpose was as there wasn't any directions.  I couldn't figure out how to personalize it, but it worked great.  Its sensitive to the touch so the harder you touch it the louder the instruments play.  Really great buy!
