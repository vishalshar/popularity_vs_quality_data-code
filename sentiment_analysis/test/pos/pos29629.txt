Fantastic flight characteristics!  Outstanding gimble and 4K camera! Superior materials and build quality. Replacement parts available at the Autel web site, (tax free) outside Washington state. Support by email or telephone is responsive and of superior quality. I purchased two X-Star Premuim's about two weeks ago. My only mistake was not purchasing thru Autel's online store. Same $699 price as Amazon, but no sales tax thru Autel. If your going QuadCopter, go Autel!  You won't be sorry.Bottom line, this is an outstanding value from what so far has proven to Stan behind their product. My guess is that it's easy for them to stand behind thei product because it's "quality" is simply outstanding.
