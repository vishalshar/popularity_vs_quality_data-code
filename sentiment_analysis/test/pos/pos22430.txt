Fantastic sound, especially for the price.  Bass is strong and tight, though the highs aren't quite as crisp as my M40x's, but overall I prefer these for the type of music I most frequent (EDM).  Regarding comfort, these are good, but not nearly as comfortable as the M40x whose pads are wider and softer and therefore better for long listening stints as they do not touch your ears at all; the MK801 sits slightly on the ear and gets uncomfortable after a few hours.Overall, a great headset and I'd clearly recommend as long as you're not expecting endurance listening.
