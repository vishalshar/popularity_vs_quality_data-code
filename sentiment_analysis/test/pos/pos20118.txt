I originally purchased this for my boyfriends cystic acne that he gets and its really improved his skin! I tried it on my dry skin and some spots where I had eczema and it's worked wonderfully. The bars don't last very long with everyday use if you leave it in the shower, so I would recommend placing it in a container when not using it.
