Worked great for the first time user and daughter! Got about a half pound harvest. Did not work on the second side, however, but I think that was because I did not have it in a very warm spot.Very easy, just soak for 8-10 hours and spray 1/2 of the included sprayer bottle over 2-3 sprayings per day and it will turn out just fine.I WILL be doing this again. Its easy and really does taste great!
