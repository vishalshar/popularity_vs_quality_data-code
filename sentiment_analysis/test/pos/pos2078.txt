This is the first iPhone 6 screen I've replaced but I have used iCracked kits on other versions and they have been great. This was no different. The 6 is a bit more difficult and requires heating the old front at times to release adhesive. On the reassembly page 30 has an error. The order in which reattach the cables is correct but the referenced images are incorrect. Swap photos 1 & 2. The video on YouTube is correct. ICracked please correct the manual in this otherwise perfect kit.
