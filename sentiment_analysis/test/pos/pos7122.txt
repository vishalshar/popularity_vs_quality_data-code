We bought this a few weeks ago. I do not normally write reviews but had to let everyone know what a great product this is! We had 'trouble' with nursing, baby nursed 'too quickly' according to our pediatrician to be getting enough milk, but because we had a scale, I could see he was getting plenty and gaining weight and so could the pediatrician (without multiple weight check visits like a friend of mine had to do!).  App makes it so easy to use. Worth every penny to know that all is well, I highly recommend that every new mom include this on your nursery list!
