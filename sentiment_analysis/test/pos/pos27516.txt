Our hound had a knee ligament surgery and we had to slowly build up his strength.  The Whistle monitor was absolutely perfect for our needs as it allowed us to see the amount of exercise he was getting on a daily basis.  We were able to tweak his daily morning and evening walks based on the information available.  Once the hound is fully back to normal, I am looking forward to tracking his daily fitness and sleeping activities.The Whistle needs to be charged once a week and it takes about 2-3 hours for it to charge fully.  The Whistle app is very well designed.  The ability to set reminders for medications and/or other events is also very helpful.
