I compared many of the options available for home video monitoring including Piper and Dropcam; in the end Canary came out on top and I'm very happy with my purchase.Upon receiving the unit,  I saw this was made and packaged with premium feel in mind.  Setup was incredibly easy and took no more than 5 minutes. I think selecting a location took longer than the whole setup process by Canary.Everything for the Canary is done through the app on either android or ios. Not to spend too much time reviewing the app,  but it has to be mentioned due to the nature of the device. The app is well designed and easy to use. Profiles are available for members in the home and several options and features are available. Members can post messages for activities and members can also tag activities that have been detected.The Canary can automatically arm itself if the members are not home and you can set what mode you'd like it to go into if they are home.There are three modes available:Armed -  The device has motion sensors on and will alert and record any activity in the home.Disarmed -  Motion sensors on and will record activity but will Not send you and alert.Privacy -  Video monitoring is off and will not record or alert you to anything.As mentioned,  the Canary will auto-arm itself if you've set up this feature. It works well most of the time but sometimes I've noticed a delay in arming. In addition,  when the device is armed it is very sensitive to any movement. A small cat will trigger an alert. So will a change in lighting and night vision turning on or off.According to Canary,  the device will learn when you tag activities but after a while of using it, but it still alerts me when night vision kicks on or off.Overall I feel the device is a great feature for the home,  but the alerts can get annoying if there is movement from pets. This makes one not check the alerts as often and one can miss if there truly is an intrusion.  I'm hoping the Canary will learn my tags soon enough.Overall very pleased and looking forward to see what any future updates bring.
