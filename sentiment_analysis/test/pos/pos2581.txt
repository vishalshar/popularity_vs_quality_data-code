LOVE this device.  we have a one year old daughter and wanted to make sure her room stayed within a certain temperature range, especially overnight.  prior to this device, we were just going by feeling--did it feel "too warm" or "too cold" when one of us walked in?  now i just open the app if i want to check--and there's an alarm feature that will notify you if the temperature goes outside of a range you set.  this thing works perfectly--and exactly as advertised.
