Just as the title states I found many defects on my Midnight Robin. There was a red blotch on the LCD when full blacks where shown and upon arrival the phone was "bent" or dwarfed all around. I did however enjoy the rest of the phone experience when I had it. If you buy it, make sure you check the "little things" to make sure you're getting your money's worth.
