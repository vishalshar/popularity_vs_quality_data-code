Great product. Much better than the Arlo camera system I was using. Gonna replace the rest of the Arlos with these...Pros:1. 1080P image quality is great.2. Nighttime recording is great.3. Night lighting is very bright.4. Application is very good.5. Facial recognition.6. Includes a microphone and picks up audio very well.Cons:1. Requires 120V connection.2. Plastic base trim is a little cheap.Overall, recommended..How that I have used the cameras for a while....In addition to my earlier comments:1. I have had zero issues with the camera being slow and picking up people/animals/cars late. This looked to be a buffering issue which some have seen. I never had this issue so it might have been fixed by the time I set up my cameras.2, You need a good wifi system. I have excellent wifi at home. When I launch the apps, I see my cameras instantly. So any delay in viewing would be in effect a limitation of your wifi network.3. The FTP feature works very well. I have successfully used both Dropbox and my own FTP server.4. We recently had a terrible storm and the cameras, (one of which is very exposed) had zero issues.IN total I have had zero issues with the cameras.
