These, along with plastic screw on caps, really expand the usefulness of mason jars. I used this to cap soda in a pint jar, and it held the carbonated drink with no fizzing or hissing like i experienced on other screw top bottles. The rubber seal inside is easy to remove for thorough cleaning. The flip top is hinged, and will stay flipped open so you don't have to hold it in place while pouring. i keep jars for canning, so i will get more of these caps and get rid of a cabinet full of plastic sports bottles.
