I have been waiting for a product that I can install on my motorcycle, have confidence that it will not fall off and can be easily viewed while riding.It's easy to install and use. I use this with an iPhone 6+ as a GPS, this is much cheaper than buying a standalone GPS unit, which I have purchased and has been collecting dust.. The case is slim and locks on securely to the mount and I have been using it full time even when I'm not riding.The only negative is that you do not want to ride in the rain with it, so stop, remove and hopefully you memorized the route. ;)I still give it 5 stars, since that is not what is built for and this kit has allowed me to think about one less thing when I am on the road.Great Product!
