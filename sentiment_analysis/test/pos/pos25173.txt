These bottles are excellent. I bought my first after seeing it on Shark Tank and now own three. They do not leak IF they are properly closed. I would have ruined more than one handbag and briefcase if that wasn't true. Primarily I  love them for the cleaning capabilities; also I don't purchase as much bottled water.
