What a sweet speaker! As soon as this handsome devil arrived I unpacked it, downloaded the app, put the speaker in pairing mode (long press the top button), connected it to my boyfriend's iPhone, launched Spotify, and we were in business! Seriously, five minutes.The sound is great. We have pretty varied taste in music, from loud and rocking to acoustic sweet stuff, not to mention leaving NPR on for hours on end. All genres sound great! I was afraid a bluetooth speaker would sound tinny, but it really doesn't. In fact we were rocking out and I became concerned that our neighbors would start banging on the wall. Ah, apartment life.And I just discovered the Voicing feature in Settings (in soundspaces), where you can set it to different kinds of sound profiles. I chose "Jazz Club," which emphasizes voices, but I also like the "Rock The House" setting. I definitely recommend playing with those to get smoother or deeper sound. Check out Room Settings, too. It seems to make a difference.The sound was cutting out when my boyfriend would take his phone into the other room, so I thought I would try to connect it to my iMac. I was totally overthinking it. I thought I would have to buy an Airport Express (I have an older Airport Extreme). But I went to the iTunes application on my Mac, and there's an Airplay icon on the top of the window. I just clicked it, and the Libratone Zipp showed up. Cool. Then I went to Spotify on my Mac, and down at the bottom on the right it says Devices; I clicked that and the Zipp was there, too. Really couldn't have been easier.You do have to redo the sound settings for each input device, but once you get each input set up, they stick. Also, if you like to toggle between Spotify and iTunes on your computer, you have to click on the Airplay button again in iTunes. But really, one click. That's it.I like the radio option within the Libratone app, too. You can choose 5 station presets. I spent a little time trying to figure out how to access those favorited stations through the app, but it doesn't quite work that way. Once you select your favorite stations, you actually press the heart button on the top of the speaker itself to toggle between stations, which is good too!Oh, and it is good-looking. And if you get more than one (we're working up to that), you can link them together so your music is playing in every room. And after a full charge (which was fast!), I haven't yet exhausted it.All in all, I highly recommend this speaker. I actually just recommended the smaller Too speaker to my sister who wanted something more portable, and she loves that one, too. The Zipp is just a perfect living room speaker. I love it.
