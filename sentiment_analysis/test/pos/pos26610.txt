I had this big, hulking stereo with famous-name speakers. a separate pre-amp, amp, receiver, and other signs that I'm someone who will put sound quality over convenience. And yes, it did sound good. But eventually enough is enough--I felt it was time to just listen to what I wanted when I wanted without a spaghetti soup of stereo wires.Basically, I needed something with room-filling that sound that wouldn't fill the room. The Libratone sits there discreetly, stylishly making me think I'm listening to my old stereo, or something close to it. I can touch my phone and fill the room with whatever music I want. Or I can skip the phone and just tap the speaker to play my favorite Spotify station.Next step is to buy another speaker, and listen to more contemporary music to match my fresh, new hardware. I can do it, I know I can . . .
