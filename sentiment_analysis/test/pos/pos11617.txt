I play acoustic guitar and when I started guitar one thing became clear very quickly: if I wanted to be even halfway decent I would need to practice every day.  I bought my jamstik to keep up with the guitar while traveling and it has been perfect for that and useful at home too.  It fits into a carry on bag easily and connects to your iPhone, iPad, or computer for use with or without headphones.The apps are easy to use and fun, with guitar-hero style arcade challenges and basic drills that can help you put in some of the regular stints of necessary grunt work.  App performance is a little spotty at times but all in all I'm very satisfied with the apps and I'm sure they will continue to improve over time.It's super easy to break this out for 15 minutes in a hotel room and even easier to use it while sitting around at home.  I use it with my laptop and set it to play in the background and play along with songs or instructional videos when I don't feel like getting up and grabbing my guitar.I thought about this purchase for a long time due to the high price tag, but I'm glad I made it.  A week on the road could easily derail a solid practice routine and turn into a month without playing.  With the jamstick it's a lot easier to play a little every day, no matter what.
