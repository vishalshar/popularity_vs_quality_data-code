I bought both the Seaweed Citrus shampoo and conditioner. I have to say I really love this set. I'm 52 and I color my hair. I have not noticed that my color is negatively affected by using this product. I do notice that my hair feels alive and well! I really didn't notice that my hair wasn't quite right until I started using the combo set. When I run my fingers through my hair it feels healthy. Yes. Healthy would be the right word to explain how nice my hair feels and looks. This is the first time in quite a while that I have actually felt really good about my hair. I have been buying very expensive products that don't hold a candle to this brand. I'm having a bladderwack attack of absolute feel good! I will most definitely continue to buy this dynamic duo!
