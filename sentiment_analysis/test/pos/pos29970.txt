I bought a couple of these robots because they can be externally controlled via Bluetooth. The intention is the make a robot swarm. An additional plus is the Sparkfun Pro-Mini backpack that allows for expanded programming by adding an Arduino based pro-mini board to the robot. I have built a few two wheeled balancing robots and the MiP provides a good value for the money and it looks a lot better than my home builds.
