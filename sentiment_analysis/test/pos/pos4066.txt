Premium feel case with some flaws. (More like 3.5/5)The worst is how low the iPad sat - such that the lower 15% of the screen was virtually impossible to touch. That made it very frustrating - or plain impossible - to navigate the App Store (and others) where some options sat at the bottom.My solution was to place some stickers on the grip to "bump up" the iPad so it sat slightly higher.Also some of the keys were placed awkwardly or too small (like the "1" key), but given the necessary size of the KB, it's a common and understandable problem.
