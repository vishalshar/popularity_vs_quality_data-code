Started off the setup process a bit skeptical  already have a Chromecast, a TiVo and a tangle of soundsystem cables and didnt know if we wanted to add another device to the mix. But all it took to get up and running was a power cord and an iPhone app. Even with a non-major-brand TV the Singlecue flawlessly connected.Had a little trouble with a waiting for update message on the Singlecue screen, but that was easily fixed with an update to the phone app.Have only had the Singlecue for a few days, but were already using it for normal use. Perfect for those moments when youd have to sigh, and exhale, and sit up to grab the remote and  while thats not hard to do  then youre glad you live in the 21st century. Hold up a finger and change the volume, switch the channel, mute the sound.Great, great addition to the TV setup. It wont replace a cable remote for complex things like setting up recording preferences on a TiVo, but perfect for causal, everyday use. Will only get more powerful as the ecosystem continues to evolve.
