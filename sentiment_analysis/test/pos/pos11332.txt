This had been a great case for my 6 year old so far! The handle is a must. It's helped her iPad mini survive a couple of bumps against tables and it's already weathered a couple of drops (although in the interest of full disclosure, these were on carpet). Unless you need a really rugged case, this is a good one for mainly inside use by a kid who's exercises the average range of caution with his or her devices.
