If you own a Mac (MacBook or iMac), you can use a cloning app (Carbon Copy Cloner) to clone your ENTIRE OS X to an external drive. Plug the external drive to ANY MacBook, boot up from it and you'll have your entire machine running without interfering with the internal drive. Great for backup and in case your Mac machine is toast. For security reason, you can even use FileVault to encrypt the cloned external drive.The problem with OS X Yosemite, encryption cause significant slow down (up to half the speed of the drive). This SSD drive is small enough for cloning AND fast enough to boot using FileVault encryption. I can clone my work machine and when traveling, I essentially have a backup "machine". Great drive!
