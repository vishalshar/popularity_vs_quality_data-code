i bought two of these to put in my 93 yo mothers home, 900 miles away. I didn't want to put cameras in. At first these were hard to set up, but the App has been updated and now it's easy. I can tell (on my iPhone, iPad, and Android) if there is movement in the living room or if the garage door has been opened.
