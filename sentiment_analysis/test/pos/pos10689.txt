FitBark is an awesome activity tracker that shows me just how active my border collie is. We have had this for about 9 months and it's interesting to be able to track my dogs activity level. The charging is fast and simple, the device simply attaches to your dogs collar via a rubber o-ring, and the syncing process is simple. It has held up in the winter (snow, wind, rain) so I don't think there will be any issues with its durability. Will look to see what future updates they make to the software via the app, as improvements have been apparent since I purchased this device back in March.
