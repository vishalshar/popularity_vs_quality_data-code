Lovin the reusable snack bags. They can be difficult to open at times, say when your fingers are wet or cold and you can't get a good grip. I thought the washing would be a pain but they wash up nice and I hang them on a skewer so the H2O can drain out and if it still looks a little damp after a few days I just change the angle, they dry up and then go into the drawer for safe keeping :)
