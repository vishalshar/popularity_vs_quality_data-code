I ordered this on October 25th and received it two days later. I like how it doesn't have a taste at all and i mix it with my water, smoothie, or tea. I was diagnosed with Insulin Resistance in August and I've been having girly issues since March. Hopefully this will help me conceive our second baby. I will update here in about a month or so. Im praying it helps.
