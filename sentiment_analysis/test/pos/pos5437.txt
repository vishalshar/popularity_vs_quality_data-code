Amazing piece of audio equipment!  I've had a couple of portable Amp/Dac's to use with my iphone 6s Plus. NONE of them sounded as good as the Peachtree Audio Shift!  The sound is very inviting and just plain fun to listen to.  It was a choice between this and the Oppo HA2, I chose the Shift, and I'm glad I did, no turning back.The following headphone were used with this DAC and all sound amazing: Grado PS500e, Sennheiser HD 650, and Bowers & Wilkins P7.If your looking for a nice portable DAC, this is the one to get!
