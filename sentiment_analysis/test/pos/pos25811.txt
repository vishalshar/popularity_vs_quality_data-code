It took me a while to get it all setup, but it was well worth it. Gave it to my 2 1/2 year old niece as a Christmas gift. I live in CA. She's in TX. It's fun to know (via the internal accelerometer) when she's playing with the toy. I can send her a quick voice text. With her mom's help, she can use it to send voice messages to me or her distant grandparents, or other pre-approved family members (up to 10).
