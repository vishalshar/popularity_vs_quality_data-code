I love the Pickle Pipes! I had been wanting to try fermenting for a while, but it just seemed a little intimidating. A friend told me about Masontops, and I was intrigued. I placed my order and hoped it was as easy as it seemed.  Now I can say pickled peppers and pickled pepper relish are a breeze! I am mid process on my home made Apple Cider Vinegar! The ease of a one piece fermenting lid is awesome!  I even ordered more!
