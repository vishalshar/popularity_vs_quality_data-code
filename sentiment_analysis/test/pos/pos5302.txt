We have two cats and recently had to begin to feed them wet food every 12 hours. Previously, we fed them dry food that they could eat at will. This has been quite a change, for us and for the cats. We purchased these feeders as tools to help to make this possible without it dramatically changing our lifestyle. So far, I'd give the feeder design an A- grade, and the functioning an A+! Why not an A+ all around? Well, there are a couple of little things that would enhance these even more. Read on!These feeders reliably function as advertised. I won't list all of the features and functions here - the Feed and Go web site and other reviews here have done a great job of that! What I will describe is how we are using these, and how that seems to be working.One of our cats has diabetes and needs to be fed every 12 hours. She is allowed two hours to finish each meal, then the food has to be removed from her access. Consequently, our other cat is on this same schedule.We load up the Feed and Go for each cat's next meal and put it in the compartment to the left of the accessible compartment in the front of the feeder. We have programmed each feeder to feed twice per day - 5am and 5pm. Since any uneaten food after a feeding cannot be accessible to the cats any longer than two hours maximum, we programmed the feeders to "feed" again at 7am and 7pm; this results in the feeder rotating to an empty compartment.At each "feeding" time, the feeder rotates counter-clockwise, and either makes food accessible (at 5am and 5pm) or removes access (at 7am and 7pm). The user has flexibility to program a "feeding" at any time of the day in five minute increments. This is the first issue for us. We feed the cats simultaneously now, and it may be better to offset the feeding by one minute so that each cat can distinguish the sound of my voice calling to the feeder. Unless we fool one feeder into thinking that it's a minute earlier or later than it is, this isn't an option. As of now, both feeders call both cats simultaneously. This may be ok for some. We'll experiment to see if we can offset the clocks a bit; we haven't done that yet, but it looks like this is possible on the Web portal for the Feed and Go. Or, we could manually call the cats a few seconds apart. That's probably a better option.The strategy outlined above works without a hitch for one meal for which we've loaded up the food a few hours before. For example, we load up the feeders at about 10pm, so the food is in the feeder for seven hours before opening for the 5am feeding. Again, we have to feed wet food, but this amount of time in the feeder seems to be just fine. The feeders really are close to being airtight. The cats know that there's food in there because they've seen me put it there, but they don't obsessively hang around the feeders once the food is closed in. This makes me think that there must be minimal smell coming from the feeders (I certainly can't smell the food). And, the food looks just fine at 5 the next morning - no dry crust has formed, and the color still looks normal.Beyond about seven hours or so, I worry that having the wet food sitting in the feeders isn't optimal. Would it be ok for up to 24 hours (assuming that we're away and have a pet sitter come in once per day, and the odd time she might have to load up three meals to cover the cats until her next visit)? Maybe. Some people say that this would be fine for 24 to 48 hours given the almost airtight seal, but I tend to be cautious. Here's the solution that I've found.We purchased some of these: Porcelain Creme Brulee Dish - Assorted Colors Set of 4 - By SWEESE. They fit PERFECTLY in the food compartments. They are porcelain, so they hold cold for quite a long time. I put them in the freezer for several hours before loading up the food into the feeders. I also store the food in the refrigerator so that it starts out cold. AND, I put a couple of squares of ice cut out from these: Cryopak Flexible Ice Mats, Set of 2 alongside each frozen porcelain dish. I figure that a couple of hours of coldness can only help to preserve the freshness.So this is the second issue that I have here for using these feeders for wet food - lack of refrigeration. The owner, Alex, has indicated that they are experimenting with some prototypes - one type that includes room for an ice pack under the food, and another that actually refrigerates the food compartment. These are not available now, but I am staying tuned just in case. Until then, my approach above gives a little bit more peace of mind. I'll post a follow up to this review after we have some more experience with this.The last little improvement that would be great would be to have a mode whereby the Webcam on each feeder could turn on in response to motion. As I mentioned, our cats have two hours during which to eat their food. One of them zips over to a feeder right when it opens. The other is more leisurely about it, and we never know when he'll show up. If we wanted to monitor eating, it would be great if the camera could turn on and record the Webcam stream due to the motion of a cat eating at the feeder, noting the start time, and then turn off when the cat leaves/when the motion stops, noting the end time. I am no expert in this area, so I'm not sure if this is practical, but I have heard of motion-sensitive security cameras, so it may be worth exploring.The last note for now is that the cats have been quickly trained to recognize that the grinding sound of the motor turning the food tray means that their food will become accessible. And therein lies the rub...because the grinding sound means food at 5am and 5pm, but it means no more food at 7am and 7pm. Thus, it may be necessary for us to turn off the voice calling feature on each feeder and manually call the cats over only when the grinding sound means food. As of now, they are a little bit confused at 7am and 7pm when the trays turn and the food is gone. This said, cats are pretty darn smart and they'll probably figure this out. As of now, the food-motivated cat runs over to the feeder again at 7am and 7pm just in case.All in all, these feeders are great as helpful tools. They would be A+ all around if they had some type of refrigeration or cooling option, and if the cameras could be set to motion sensitive mode. Shoot, if the feeder could send a text message when the camera turns on due to motion for a given feeder, that would be very fantastic.Even so, these are well made and reliable and loaded with terrific features as they stand. I purchased both of these products, no relationship with the company, so these are just my unbiased comments.
