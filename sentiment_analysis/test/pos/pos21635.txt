This is one of the most unique hydration packs out there. I have tried many over the past several months. Note that I bought this as a minimal pack for distance running. It is not so much advertised for that so I can't knock them for it not being a good fit for that. It simply was too minimal for me. It is really tiny and the straps just too compact - think compression shirt. I can't fault them as it appears like it would work great for water sports like the advertise - but a no go for me. I give it four stars as it is exactly as advertised.
