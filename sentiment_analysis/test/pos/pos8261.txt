I don't even know where to begin. These vitamins have been our saving grace. My daughter fought and fought against going to the bathroom and pooping. She had a bad day of constipation where she had a painful BM and sine then it's been EIGHT months with screaming anytime she has to use the bathroom. Our nurse even suggested Miralax, but that did nothing but make her BMs runny and fall out of her. She was terrified to push. We tried everything. Came across these vitamins. in ONE WEEK, my daughter was able to use the bathroom and not be afraid. We only give her one a day, and it has made our lives so much better. Ingredients are great and I feel like this is a step above regular store bought vitamins. We now take the adult versions ourselves!
