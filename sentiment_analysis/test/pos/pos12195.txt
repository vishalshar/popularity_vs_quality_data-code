I was shopping around for a multi-color capable LED bulb and came close to getting the Phillips Hue kit. Then once I found out the hub required to use the bulbs had to be hardwired into your router, that was the deal breaker. I have an OnHub and the only LAN port is currently used by my desktop PC and I didn't want to get another router and set up a bridge just to use some fancy light bulbs. So then I ran across the LIFX bulbs which connect directly to your WiFi without the need for any adapters. Just screw it in, set it up, and off you go. I bought one to make sure it was what I was looking for and once I had it all setup and working, I immediately ordered a second for my bedroom. I like the app although it wasn't as user friendly to set up as it could have been. Getting it set up in the Alexa app to work with my Echo had me even more perplexed. I eventually got it all figured out and once I started using IFTTT recipes I was sold. I did have a problem with the bulbs losing connection with my Echo after a day or two and sometimes even getting lost to the LIFX app itself. Cycling the power on the bulb always brought it back online. I believe this has to do with the bulbs acquiring an IP address through DHCP and once I set my OnHub to reserve the IP addresses assigned to my bulbs, I haven't had any more problems. The bulbs are a lot brighter than I was expecting, even brighter than the CFLs they replaced. And the color depth and range is spectacular. While they aren't exactly cheap, the ability to just buy one bulb to try it out was a huge plus. Not to mention they will be obsolete long before the 22.8 year lifespan is reached. They come with a 2 year warranty out of the box.
