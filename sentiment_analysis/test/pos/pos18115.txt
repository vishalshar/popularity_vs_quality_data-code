I don't think there is a perfect bed, but it is a really great bed. I had a traditional spring mattress that hurt my back and hips, so I decided to give memory foam a try. We reasearched many brands and settled on Ghostbed. After 2 months I can say it is very comfortable and provides a restful sleep. I am 6 feet tall and 230 pounds. This bed supports me just fine. My only problem with the bed is that it seems to be firmer in the center, so initially it seems like the mattress pushes you off to the sides. I have gotten used to it and I no longer notice this. The bed came UPS well packaged. It is very heavy, it is a good idea to get help unpacking hit. Overall I feel this bed is good quality as advertised and I've gotten a really nice bed for the price, and I am very satisfied with this purchase.
