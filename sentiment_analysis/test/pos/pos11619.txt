Was super excited to try the Jamstik+ out as it got great reviews. When I received it there were a series of frustrating missteps in configuring the software, with various bugs and obscure settings that I had to go back and forth with tech support about. Luckily they were very helpful in getting everything sorted out.So far really enjoying it. Hopefully they'll work the kinks out of the setup process with time.
