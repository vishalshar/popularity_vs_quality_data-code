Like one reviewer said, try to be realistic. They will not replace full size readers but they have become my go to glasses when I need to read for a short time. Computers, tablets, Kindle, real books etc. are not what I use them for; I use my full size readers. Phone, labels, menus, persons who try to show me something on their phone etc. are reasons I like having them around (The universal case is attached to my phone). My arms aren't long enough anymore to do quick reading when I'm out and about and these are so much more convenient than digging out my full size readers.I've already had my original pair replaced and it was easy (There's a learning curve to care for these correctly).  Become an ambassador by downloading a ThinOPTICS app from the Google Play Store which ensures lifetime replacement. Lifetime replacement advertisement is on their website too, so they are letting everyone know it's available. Contact them and see how nice they will be about replacing your glasses. Now that I'm sure they mean lifetime replacement, I am purchasing another pair to keep in the kitchen. That's where my husband and I seem to need them a lot. I'm thinking the bathroom drawer or mirror will be next.I would like to echo what one reviewer said. Have something on the case to secure the glasses inside of it better. I've learned to be careful because they do slip out.Overall, they are a good product and I think ThinOPTICS has found a niche.
