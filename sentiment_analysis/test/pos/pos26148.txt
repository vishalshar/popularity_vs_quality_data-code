I am surprised about how much peace of mind it provides. I have zero issues with the application or device. The activity tracking feature is unexpectedly immersive.After weighing most trackers on the market, I found some use an outdated 2g network which is going away at the end of this year (att), and I have poor coverage for the alternatives (T-Mobile).The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because the little rubber strip that affixes the tracker to the collar busted, and I was not supplied a back up. The map/application updates are also slow, but it's not too bad.
