4.5 stars. Don't feel like writing a lot, so I'll just mention a few things. Love the fingerprint reader, responsiveness, useful cloud storage, and slim dimension. Don't like the less than ideal battery life and slightly longer delay when taking pictures. This case is a great add-on purchase. https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01HLSGGME/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1
