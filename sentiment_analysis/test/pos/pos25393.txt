For the last few years I have used my phone alongside my golf game, mainly as a GPS distance aid and also to track my rounds.  The app I was using (Swing by Swing) did a good job at both, but it was really inconvenient to track each shot.  The app had the feature, but required many manual steps.  Whenever I did track a shot, I always found the info helpful, and after 2 years of playing (at about 40 rounds a year) I was finally able to build a decent database of my actual club distances.  It wasn't easy, but it worked.When Game Golf was released, I had thought about getting that product.  Two factors stopped me, (1) price and (2) it's a stand-alone system and doesn't have real-time aid while on the course.  While searching for other GPS apps, I came across Golf Pad (and subsequently Golf Tags).  What I really liked was how the tags worked alongside their app, to provide real-time tracking, as well as on-course GPS ranges and scoring.  All this for a price well below other comparable systems.I ordered the tags on a Monday, and they arrived on Wednesday, just in time for me to try them out at my weekly league.Installation of the tags on the clubs was a breeze, as was pairing each tag with the app.  The tags screw into the small hole in the club's grip.  They are very lightweight and do not distract at all during the swing.  Use on the course is very simple, just tap the tag to the back of your phone (with the app running of course), and it starts tracking for that club.  When you get to your ball, tap your next club to end your previous shot (and capture all relevant stats) and start your next shot.  Continue for each club hit (including putting).  When you are all done, move to the next tee, tag your next club, and the app automatically completes your score for the hole and moves to the next hole.  Errors are easy to fix, as there is an undo button within the app to fix mistaken shots, and you can even edit your shots if needed.It took me a couple of holes to get used to the routine, mainly putting since those shots can be in quick succession.  If you forget to tag a shot, you can simply add a +1 shot or +1 putt to your score.  Penalty strokes need you to open the app to add the +1 to your score.  By the end of my round it was second nature to tag the shot, and it added no extra time to my overall swing routine.My only complaint about the tags is the material used to make them.  It's a very rigid plastic, which on the surface seems good.  But as a mechanical engineer in the plastics field, I'm truly worried about long-term durability.  The tags are multi-piece.  One piece is the screw stem and thin/flat plate (think of a screw with a large flat head).  The other is a shallow cup-like piece that the flat head of the screw rests in.  The NFC chip is sandwiched between these 2, most likely held together with some sort of epoxy.First off, even though the material seems very tough I'm worried that the base of the screw is prone to stress and will eventually crack over time.  I also found myself dropping my clubs into my bag as normal at first, until I realized that they were hitting directly onto the tag when they hit the bottom of the bag.  I was also careful when removing my clubs from the bag, since if the tag snagged on something, it would torque it and put extra stress on the base of the screw.  In addition, the cup seemed a bit too deep for what was actually needed to cover and protect the NFC chip, an easy 1/8' or more could have been removed from the overall height of the tag, making it even less of a profile once installed.  A better material would have been a rigid elastomer, almost like the rubber cleats on the bottom off golf shoes.  That material would allow for twisting and bending without being prone to cracking/crazing, and is also a proven material in the golf industry.  Only time will tell how durable the tags are.I'll also touch on the Golf Pad app, since it is required to use the tags.  As I mentioned I have used the Swing by Swing app for the past few years, and really like it.  I've tried most every app out there, but didn't find anything I liked better until now.  The Golf Pad app is easier to use and provide more functionality than other apps I've tried.  A caveat is I'm using the app in the premium mode, as the tags came with 1 year of premium service for free (a $10 value).  The premium features are well worth the $10 in my book, as it opens up a wealth of statistical data tracking, and I'm all about the numbers.  The other thing I like is when you close your screen while the app is running, it goes into a second mode that only shows the hole you are on, as well as the distance to the front, middle, and back of the green.  This is great since it's easy to pull the phone out of my pocket, check distance, then put it back in ready to tag my next shot.In all I am very happy with this purchases, as the tags and app work seamlessly together and exactly as promised.  I'm looking forward to getting more rounds in and building up my stats for each club in my bag and each course I play.  The $99 price point may be a bit steep at first glance, but the wealth of info you get about your golf game is priceless, as long as you take the time to analyze it and work on improving your weaknesses.  And the 2 years it took to accumulate all my club stats, the manual way with the other app, I can accomplish in half a season with Golf Tags!Thanks,Don
