Our lab-pit mix, who was barely 4 months old at the time was diagnosed with demodectic mange on June 12th of this year and was put on Ivermectin that same day. I knew nothing about demodex prior to and once I've done a little more research, learned that it was also due to his undeveloped/immature immune system. I bought this after reading nothing but POSITIVE reviews on it. I started using this on June 22nd once a day, 2 scoops and I'm not sure if it's actually the reason our li'l guy's coat/fur, especially, on his left upper eye, and R side of his face has started to grow back or the combination of multi-vitamin, organic coconut oil (orally/topically) and this stuff, but whatever the case is, I don't think it's hurting him any. I've used it since without missing a day and I still have a decent amount left.
