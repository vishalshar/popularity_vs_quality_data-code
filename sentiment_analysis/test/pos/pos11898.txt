Really impressive - fits several different types of phones - I used iPhone 5, 6 & 6+, all good.  After experimenting a bit to understand how various apps/media work best - impressive results.  Goggles have adjustable eyepieces that permit quick adjustment to get clarity.  My kids were home for holiday and all loved it.  Great for VR music videos and movies, I'm still working up to mastering games.  Very comfortable.
