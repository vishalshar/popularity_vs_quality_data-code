We've had our fence about 5 months now.  When it first arrived and I read the instruction manual I was like-----what??!!!  I didn't receive the impression from the description of the product that I had to "train my cat" for three to four weeks in order to use this product--hence four stars rather than five.  I didn't bother with their recommended training--this is how the story goes......Cat was not quite six months old--as product recommends, but close enough.  We live in the country surrounded by woods and have a fenced in front yard with a cat door to allow the cat to come and go as she pleases.  However, we wanted her to stay in the fenced in yard as foxes are frequently spotted in the trees surrounding us.  Originally she began escaping the yard by squeezing through gaps, rather than climbing the fence.  Therefore, we strung the boundary wire about six inches below the TOP of the fence everywhere except the spots she had been squeezing through.On the spots where the cat had been squeezing through we strung the boundary wire along the fence just six inches above the ground.  Doing that allowed the cat to go right up to the fence everywhere except the spots she had been escaping.  Those spots where the wire was close to the ground she could not walk up to anymore without the warning sound going off followed by the mild shock.  This worked well for a few weeks but then she figured out a way around it.She got out three times before I saw how she was doing it.  I then did two things--first I adjusted the boundary wire to stop her from getting out that way--then I "took away the warning" that allowed her to "test the boundaries."  Cats are smart--and that warning beep allows stubborn cats to figure out how to get out.  I made it so that the warning and the beep were so close together the cat didn't have a chance to back off before getting zapped.  Once she stopped receiving a "warning" she decided it wasn't worth the zap and stopped trying to get out.Oh, regarding the batteries that Petsafe wants ten bucks for:  When the battery got low and needed replacing I disconnected the battery from the permanent casing holding it and simply bought a regular CR1/3 battery for three bucks.  And just in case doing this made the collar less waterproof I simply take the collar off the cat when rain is forecasted.  (for instructions on how to disconnect the battery just do an amazon product search for petsafe batteries.)
