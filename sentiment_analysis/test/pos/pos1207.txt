These reflective stickers are genius!  What a great idea, and easy to use.  I applied these to my bike helmet and bike frame - mostly in the back so that cars coming up behind me will see me more easily even if I don't see them.  I recommend these for anyone who will be out in low light at any time, EVEN IF you already have reflectors and lights on your bike or gear.  These add another aspect for visibility, which is always a good idea.  And they are VERY reflective...very visible...very helpful.  In addition, I love the ability to apply them in small areas where other larger options won't fit.On another note, the product descriptions aren't very clear about the different package size options.  I bought the Small package and wish I had more, so I ended up buying more.  Small came with 5 long strips, one shorter/wide strip, and 15 "X" style spots...enough for a small area, but not enough for my helmet and bike.  Get creative, have fun with them, and stay safe!
