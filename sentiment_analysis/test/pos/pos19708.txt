I bought an XY2 last time I was off on a trip and it worked very well for me. So this time a new trip and a new XY3! So far in the limited testing I've done around the house it has been even better than the XY2. It's much louder when you beep it, which helps you track it down easier. Will update this review after my trip with my findings
