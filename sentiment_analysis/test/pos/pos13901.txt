honestly the product is very well designed but I didn't want to give it 5 stars because it isn't absolutely perfect. my only slight concern is that the plastic seems a little flimsy, especially at the joints, and I'm not sure how long it will last with the AC or heat blasting at it for hours. otherwise, this product is terrific. I really like that it has an extra lower arm for stability and that it doesn't block the AC vents like the cheaper units. would definitely buy again.
