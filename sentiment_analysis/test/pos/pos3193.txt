by far the best option if you prefer to mount your iPhone anywhere, especially on a bicycle or motorcycle, for use as a GPS. their mounting kits are the most cost effective solution in both stability, security and price. their cases are sturdy and simple. my only issue with the latest design is the new swappable inserts: they always pop out during install and removal, making installation especially difficult. they should have created a more secure way for these inserts to stay in their place. for iPhone 6 plus owners, it seems they've focused their efforts on the 6 and their more expensive, aluminum designs, so the base model case won't be available until at least December for the iPhone 6 plus. I recommend their universal mounting kit for use with any other flat-backed case until then.
