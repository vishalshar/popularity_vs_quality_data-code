These are delicious, convenient to pack for a snack, and are much healthier than other beef stick options.  Yes they cost more but higher quality items do cost more.  A package of roughly 24 1oz costs about 20 cents or so more than the greasy competition.  To me that is worth it.  There are lots of flavors but BBQ and Chipotle are my favorite.
