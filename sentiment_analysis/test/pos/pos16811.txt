I originally had planned on purchasing the Corsair M45, however, after doing hours of research trying to find the best mouse suited for my needs, I eventually decided to purchase the Mionix Naos. Although, they are both around the same price,I chose this mouse mostly because it looked very comfortable(it is). This mouse looks much better in person and so far it seems like I will enjoy using it for a long time. If you are looking for a simple(doesn't include a ridiculous amount of extra buttons) mouse that is of high-quality, comfortable and affordable definitely consider going with this product. I have relatively small hands and it suits me just fine, I am sure that regardless of the size of your hand, this mouse will at least be somewhat comfortable for you. I have included a picture so that you can get a better idea of what the product looks like. Also, in my opinion, the texture is very nice (;
