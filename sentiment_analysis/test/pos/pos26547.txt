Quality power strip with two internet controllable outlets and two dumb outlets. This is a very good quality strip, well made and thick, sturdy plastic. That could be a negative because it is big and bulky but it is designed well and looks nice. The first two outlets are controllable from the Wink app with the Wink hub, allowing you to control many different devices.  Perhaps the best use for something like this is to give Internet control to dumb led strips that can be purchased cheaply here on Amazon then plug them into an outlet like this and then you can power the led strip on and off from the Internet without paying $100 for hue lighting...
