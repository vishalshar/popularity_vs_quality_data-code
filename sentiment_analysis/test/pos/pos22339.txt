I've been a longtime user of the original Arccos product and have really liked it.When they announced the second generation, I was super excited because it seemed to have addressed my two main points of contention. I didn't like how high the profile was on the sensors. The weight never bothered me, but having them so bulky caused some issues. Additionally, I wasn't a fan of how much the system drained your phone's battery. I would go and play a round, starting with 100 percent battery life and be somewhere around 30 percent after 18 holes.The Arccos 360 sensors are a great advancement as they're about 50 percent smaller and lighter and don't require so much Bluetooth while on course. That saves me ton of battery.As for the other enhancements, I think they're great. I never really had any issues with the original app missing shots or false positives, but the new app has yet to miss a shot.For any golfers interested in getting better and knowing more about their golf games, this is a great product to own.Amazon shipped it quickly. I bought it on a Tuesday and it was here by the time I got home on Thursday.
