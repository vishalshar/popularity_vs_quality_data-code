I thought my 6 year old who is always humming and creative would like it. Well he loves it. To my surprise so did his very literal and logical 8 year old brother. Somehow it bridges the gap for both the creative and for the brainy kid. Wish I had bought two of them but didn't because of the price. It has only been one day so far but it was the fought over and highly coveted gift. The kids loved changing the sound effects and just moved a whole lot to make all the sound effects trigger. I would buy again.
