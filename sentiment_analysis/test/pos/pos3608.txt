It was really hard to find a sippy cup that was not stainless steel or plastic. When I found this cup I was so excited! The suction works great and my 11 mo. old son had no problems using it. No leaks or spills either when he shook it all around. Surprisingly durable, withstood quite a few throws from the highchair onto our hard tile flooring. However, this cup did eventually crack/break last week but I think that if you have a slightly older child who understands how to hold this cup you will have absolutely no problems with it at all. Even though it eventually broke, I am still ordering a second one for my son; I am just going to keep a closer watch when he is using it until he gets the hang of it. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!
