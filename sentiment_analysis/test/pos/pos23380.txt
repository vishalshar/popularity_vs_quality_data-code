This is really only worth about 25 dollars but I wound up paying 45 USD for it because I wanted an Olaf waffle maker and they were scarce when I was wanting to purchase one.  So, I splurged and got it.  It came packaged well and worked straight out of the box.  Now, this waffle maker doesn't have a timer on it, which for me was odd, so I had to just pay attention to the time.  Since each of the pieces are smaller than a reg waffle it doesn't take as long to cook.  I'd say anywhere between 3 and 4 minutes.  I do love it.  Now I can build Olaf all year around.
