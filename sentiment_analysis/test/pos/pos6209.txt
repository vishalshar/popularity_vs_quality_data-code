These are so tasty!  Crunchy delicious apples.  We go through several bags of these each week because they don't contain any added sugar and help keep us away from cookies and chips.The price on these seems to go up and down a lot so we keep our eye on that and buy a bunch when the price is on the lower end.  Really great purchase.
