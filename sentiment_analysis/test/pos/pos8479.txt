Purists hate them but I find it sounds as good as any tube amp I've used, and I'm not able to push it without getting arrested for violating a noise ordinance, I can see that.  The only thing I'd like to see is an extra output plug for headphones.  It's kind of complex for me, but if you are a tecchy, (I am just getting old and have too many interests), and have lots of time, you'll probably love it, but I think it will take a lot of study to learn how to get the most out of it.  I expected to be able to listen with bluetooth headset, but it doesn't work that way.  Not that I've been able to figure out anyway.  I didn't get the guitar to amp wireless setup, I use a chord, but think I might in the future.  I have so much bluetooth stuff I get confused, and so do they.  Sounds awesome with my Baja Tele very throaty, precise and mellow clean.  Will be good with Jazz.  I know I'm going to be really surprised when I really find time to mess with it.  It's lighter than I expected
