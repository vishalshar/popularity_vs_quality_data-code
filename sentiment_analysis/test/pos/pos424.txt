I love my Spire tracker. It tracks the breath and also steps, but I use it mostly for the breath.EDIT 12/28/16: The updated app is wonderful! There is this screen with little green dots that move as you breathe and go from grey to green as you breathe slower. :) Plus lots of other great updates. I find the Spire very helpful in dealing with anxiety and helping me breathe mindfully during the day.One thing it does which my Fitbit doesn't do: every so often (time chosen by me), it lets me know if I've been sedentary, say every 30 minutes. This is really nice because I tend to get absorbed in work and forget to get up and move a bit.I love that it tracks my breathing, and then tells me when I seem tense, calm or focused.Also, if you tap on one of the notifications that say you were calm or focused, you can see your average breaths per minute. That's really nice, and helpful.Sometimes just knowing I'm wearing it makes me take a few calm breaths, so it definitely helps with being mindful. :)You have to wear it against your skin for it to track your breathing. I wear mine in my bra, but you can also wear it on your pants, they say.The "stone" is comfortable, and after wearing it a bit, I hardly notice it.The app is fine, pretty straightforward and intuitive.The app tells you it needs to be open for Spire to track your breathing, but it can happily run in the background.There are also Boosts, which are little guided meditations. I believe they are only a couple minutes long, so they are a great way to clear your mind and get your breathing calm and steady. :)If you're interested in mindfulness, breathing, managing a bit of anxiety, and also if you want something that reminds you to move every so often (this can be turned off though, you don't have to use it), then I'd really recommend this tracker. I really love mine. :)EDIT: Just a couple other notes I forgot:One of the best features of the Spire is that you can watch your breath as this little line. Just watching it can help you regulate and calm your breathing. It just sort of happens naturally. It's great Biofeedback.In the Boosts tab, if you scroll down there is a Tutorial boost pack. I just did the first day and it was interesting and I found that I learned a bit more. You can learn different breathing techniques and can learn how to use the Spire. While it's quite intuitive and I already think I know how to breathe, I found it useful. :)
