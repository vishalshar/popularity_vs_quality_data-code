Just bought this case for my 2 year old son for christmas and so far i'm loving it! Its lightweight  which is good because no child wants to be hauling around something big and bulky all the time. Fits his ipad mini like a glove.. highly recommend for younger kids that are prone to dropping things, the handle is very handy!
