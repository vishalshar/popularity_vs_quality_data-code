I'M ECSTATIC. An organic multi-vitamin with Omega 3 Oil? I've tried about 20 brands.They're all weird 'popping' pills that burst oil in your mouth, or are just plain disgusting tasting. This tastes fabulous, is organic, and has everything you need. I give to my 5 year old as he gets on the school bus as a reinforcing treat! HINT: I SERVE THEM COLD, IT MAKES THEM JUST A LITTLE MORE FIRMER AS MY SON PREFERS THEM. Reading some of the reviews, I can't believe anyone would complain about how few in the jar there are, or that there's sugar. This has super low organic sugar, and yes the kids have to eat four, THERE'S FISH OIL IN THEM, FISH OIL IS DISGUSTING, THEY HAVE TO MASK THE TASTE. Which they do successfully!! This is by far the least expensive organic chewable out there. If you have any complaints about this, you don't know what else is out there. After years of searching, we've found this! Thank you smartypants
