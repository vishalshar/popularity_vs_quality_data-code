Purchased this for a work truck to be used with a laptop. Great quality and construction, seems really heavy duty and well made. The reason I only gave it four stars is because the directions to install it are not very clear and the mounting plates did not work with our truck, so we had to fabricate an adapter to make it work, not a big deal though.
