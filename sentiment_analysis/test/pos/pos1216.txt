the sealed case doesn't allow for better LiPo replacement. the internal balancer doesn't allow to top off the battery to 100% if it's slightly below full charge. Internal balancer charges it at 4.17~4.18v per cell. it would be nice to be able to charge at maximum 4.20v per cell. waiting for price to drop. The LiPo itself for a high quality brand is around $60 (high end). The internal balancer/circuits shouldn't be more than $20 at the most.
