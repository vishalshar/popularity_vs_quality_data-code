I think the instructions aren't quite correct...  I followed the instructions faithfully but there were no mushrooms.  So, I took the seed block out of the box and sort of crumbled it up in a bowl about 1 foot around and added about 2 inches of water and set it in our basement and then waited a couple of weeks and BOOM! I harvested 2 nice size crops!  Then I added more water and waited a couple more weeks.  BOOM!  More mushrooms!  This time I let a couple of the mushrooms die in the bowl to hopefully produce more spores in the medium.  BOOM!  I CURRENTLY HAVE HARVESTED MANY MANY MUSHROOMS!  I ALSO HAVE ABOUT 20 groups coming up! Gotta spray them morning and night though...  Watch out for the gnats!
