Great towel!There are many designed grips to keep the towel stay as well I put, which it's better than Youphoria. Definitely necessary for hot yoga. It also comes with a supersoft hand towel. Both are perfectly absorbing sweat during the yoga session.works well with my Manduka yoga mat.Excellent quality and reasonable price?
