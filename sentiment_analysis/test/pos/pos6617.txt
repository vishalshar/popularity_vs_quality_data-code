Because I'm 5'3" its a little high off the ground but I got over that real quick. Its great as a kick off. The riding however is a challenge all on its own. The buttons tend to be stuck and hard to push. When going up the hill there would be a straining sound on the metal rail. I would giv it 4 because of its difficulty with the buttons
