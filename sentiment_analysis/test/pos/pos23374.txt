Great for backpacking. Thick and good, light scent. I took one for every few days on a longer backpacking trip and worked well. Also used them on clothing reeking of smoke (etc) after a trip when I had no other clothes and wanted to go to a restaurant to feast...it took all the bad smells away on the spot.
