This is a piece of crap.  Five times out of six you can't get a heart rate reading. The graphs don't tell you much and you must reconnect with bluetooth every time you want to check your graphs. The band is either too tight or too loose and you have to hold it against your skin to get a reading.  I didn't expect much out of this wearable and I got it.  This was a waste of money and if I didn't tear the box I would have sent it back. Never again.  Next time go with the popular brand names because there is a reason they are popular.
