I really wanted to LOVE this pillow. I loved the box and packaging. I liked the branding and from reading the info about the pillow it sounded like a really good piece of technology and comfort. Searching for the right pillow is never easy and now there are so many choices.I am a side and back sleeper and my neck will get really sore if it is not aligned properly. Reading about the phase change technology and the special gel memory foam I was ready for comfort.I will say the pillow case is very nice and the pillow does seem cooling compared to regular memory foam pillows. It is a good size and seems nice and soft at first.For me the low density memory foam they used in this pillow is the problem. It is more like a latex pillow than a memory foam pillow. It springs back almost immediately and does not seems to let your head sink in but rather the foam pushes back on your head creating uncomfortable pressure points. It also did not compress enough to align my spine and neck properly. I got a neck ache within a couple hours of using the pillow.I gave it one more night and again I couldn't even go through an hour before giving up. For me this pillow was a big disappointment. The $85 price tag is not cheap and the quality of the pillow did not really reflect the cost. I am returning this product.I hope Ghost bed reads this review and improves the design, quality and foam material of their pillow. The name and packaging or marketing are great but the product just doesn't deliver.
