Not really as useful as I had hoped. I have heard a lot about how great this was to tie into a home automation system. Unfortunately the presence sensing is spotty sometimes it knows when I'm home sometimes it doesn't. What I thought was mostly marketed towards home automation is actually a device to increase your driving efficiency and logging miles. Thing is it's not really great for highway users out in the western US. It scores you based off of braking, throttle use, and speed above 70MPH. The problem is out here in the flat lands we have highways with a speed limit of 75MPH meaning even if you are driving efficiently and are going the speed limit it still gives you a negative mark on your score. And it seems the point is to get a better score and improve your fuel economy. Which isn't fun to do if you can't ever get a "perfect score" for going the speed limit.*ALSO BEWARE* If you have OnStar diagnostics and you receive emails from OnStar giving you detailed information about your vehicles maintenance. The Automatic adapter seems to break this functionality while it's plugged in. Nothing reports in the emails and OnStar can't read this info at least it did for my 2014 Silverado.
