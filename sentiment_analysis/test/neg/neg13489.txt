I wanted to like this product so badly! I have used the up24 tracker for a year now and was so thrilled to try this tracker because it's way more attractive.  It DOES look nice... but it doesn't really work.  The step counting was all over the place. It's accuracy was not good. It's sleep tracker was extremely accurate- so I am not sure  by the activity tracker was so terrible. As far as the other things it offers,  It tracks things like your period- but all that means is you plug in when you get your period and it then counts 28 day cycles after that. We are all not that clear! It also offers meditations which I didn't find useful or practical.I know some folks have liked this product, but as someone who has been trying to like it for 2 months- I can't bring myself to like it because it just doesn't do it's job:(
