Two out of the 4 TrackRs arrived with dead batteries. Of the two with a working battery, ringing them from my phone only works about 10% of the time. The remainder of the time, the app shows that the TrackR is being triggered, but even if it's sitting 6 inches away, it doesn't make a sound! I'm very disappointed with the quality and reliability of this product and will very likely return them.
