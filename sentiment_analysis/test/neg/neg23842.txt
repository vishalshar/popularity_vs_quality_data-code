Perfect.  No bells or whistles.  Locks onto my bike mount with nary a jiggle.  I wish everything worked the way this thing does...By the way, the bright orange makes it a lot less easier to misplace the phone!Update:  Within nine months, the black bezel ring that surrounds the case started to come off - first the left side, now the right side.  This ring holds the phone within the case.  It's a shame because my previous Rokform case for an iPhone5 could've survived a nuclear blast.  I can no longer recommend this product.  Though it is still covered by the warranty, I simply will not pay for the return shipping - not worth the money nor the hassle.
