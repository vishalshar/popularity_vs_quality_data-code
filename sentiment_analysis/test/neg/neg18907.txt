I have tried four other reishi products on the market to figure out the differences on my own. Here is what I found.Red reishi is very different from other kinds of reishi. The extraction process and mg content always differs according to manufacturer. Out of the four I have tried, the ground organic reishi was the one that I could feel a noticeable difference. However, there are two studies that suggest daily dosages of GROUND reishi for more than a month can cause liver failure. Other studies show that red reishi majorly benefits liver issues. So I chose this tea thinking, hey, its a tea bag, right? So maybe this product is exempt.Wrong. It comes beautifully packaged in these tiny powdered tea packets, so what I got was basically a quarter of the amount of reishi I actually got when I ordered the organic ground version from another company. Plus, it is still GROUND, posing a possible health risk if used in larger amounts (which I feel I need for the allergies I'm using it for). So if you're looking mainly for the health benefits, you are basically paying for the other added ingredients in the packet to make the bitter reishi powder palatable, such as licorice and stevia. The taste is good, but if I wanted good taste, I'd head to the grocery store. 1000 mg of reishi in these tiny packs is just not going to cut it.I will be going back to my organic ground reishi, albeit with a tea strainer of some kind. If you're going for taste, this tea is nice. Other than that, you are just buying the pretty packaging in my honest opinion.
