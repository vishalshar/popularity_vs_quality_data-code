I was shipped the wrong camera.  This was supposed to be the LT-AAA model, but what I recieved from Amazon is the LW-AAA model.  Worse, when I plug it in, there's an painfully obvious anomaly on the screen.  It looks like a big finger, no matter where you look at, there's the anomoly.  You can see it in the photo.  There's nothing physically on the lens, I checked with a modeling magnifying glass.  I never touched the lens. This isn't the first defective Seek thermal camera I have received.  I bought the android version for the Galaxy S3...it simply didn't work at all!  So I'm shipping number two back because I received the wrong model, let alone that it's also defective. If the third shipment has any issues at all, it's game over for me.  Make sure you're getting the version of the camera that you paying for! Check their website to find out which is which.
