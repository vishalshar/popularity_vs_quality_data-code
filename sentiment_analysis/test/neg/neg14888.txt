Seem like a great idea, but just, no.  I have smaller feet, but wide.  I was only able to put a couple of these on my shoe, leaving it loose.  I could not place them all of the way up without it being FAR too tight.  Not only that, but getting them latched together proves very difficult when tight.  Sometimes, they just pop apart while wearing them.I decided to try them out a while anyway, and I regret it.  I should have just returned them and gotten my money back.  As of today, the elastic actually snapped apart (20 days after the return window closed).These should be good, but there needs to be multiple sizes that give a range of foot sizes they can accommodate, and they need to be stronger (it should not just *break* that easily.)  Otherwise, it's a great idea.  Just... Not good.
