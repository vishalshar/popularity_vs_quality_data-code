We have been drinking Fred Ater for over 2 years, usually buying direct through Fred Water.  We received our shipment yesterday.  The water in the first bottle tasted like pond water, tried a second bottle, same.  Froze a bottle to see if the taste resolved when thawing, nope!  Very disappointed in the product offered by Amazon.  The dates on the bottles you can barely read.
