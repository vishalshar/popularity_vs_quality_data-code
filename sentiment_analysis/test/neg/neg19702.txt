I lost track of my wallet yesterday, and it says my phone haven't been within Bluetooth range since a week ago. I have my Bluetooth on all the time, and I know the Bluetooth and wallet were within range of each other yesterday. In other words, although I had my phone with me and my blue tooth on, I don't know where I was when the wallet and phone stopped being in range of each other. I might as well not spent the money on a tracker.
