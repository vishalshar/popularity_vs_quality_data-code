So disappointed. I wore it one day as a necklace because I couldn't get the bracelet attached properly. The clasp on one side kept separating while I was adjusting the bracelet size. It was totally inaccurate in tracking my steps. I wore my FitBit on my wrist and the difference in step counting was more than 2000 steps. It was annoying to have to go onto the app and sync it to see my steps.The next day I figured out how to get the bracelet on, but found it rather bulky worn on the wrist. As a nurse, I wash my hands often throughout the day and thought it would be difficult to manage.I decided to return it and stay with my FitBit. I originally was drawn to the Leaf urban for its attractive design and appearance, but they need to do some work on the bracelet design, app and tracking accuracy. Also it doesn't sync with WeightWatcher's, which is important to me.I see FitBit has some new bracelet styles that are more fashionable looking. I would rather spend the same money for a more functional product.
