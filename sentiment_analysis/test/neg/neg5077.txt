Originally I was planning on giving this a 3 star review, however the egregious software design and ridiculous setup process made me retract even those 2 extra stars I was going to give it.First things first, this unit functions as an IR remote. It connects to Wifi and relays commands via IR to AC units to control them. That's about all it has going for it, that it can blast IR signals to my AC. The touch interface on it isn't very intuitive nor responsive, but most of us probably aren't getting this to have an alternate remote we have to poke at to control our portable AC units.Let's talk about setup.I unboxed the unit and followed the setup instructions, which involve downloading an app available on Google Play and the App Store. I started on my Android Nexus 6P. Followed the instructions to connect to the wifi network that the Tado had created--connected just fine--but no dice, the app could not communicate with the Tado to set up wifi for the unit itself. Rinse and repeat miscellaneous troubleshooting for about 30 minutes before I just give up. I try the iOS app, and that one is able to successfully configure the wifi network for the Tado.Next, I'm asked to configure my AC unit. I have an LG LP1415SHR. This unit isn't in the database, so I'm asked to teach Tado how to operate it. No problem.This AC unit supports the following modes: Heating, Cooling, Dry, and Fan.It also has 3 fan speeds: Low, Medium, HighIt also has adjustable vanes: On and Off.It also has adjustable temperature from 60F to 86FYou might be wondering why I'm listing out all the specs of my AC unit. To teach Tado, I needed to teach it 156 separate "commands" just for the heating mode, and another 156 commands for the cooling mode. Luckily in Dry and Fan mode, there are no temperature options.This in itself is a bit of a set back, but ultimately not the reason why I consider the software crippled. Each one of these are configured in a run.For cooling, I had 6 runs:Vane On, Fan LowVane On, Fan MediumVane On, Fan HighVane Off, Fan LowVane Off, Fan MediumVane Off, Fan High.Each one of these runs consists of 26 individual temperature commands, from 60 to 86 degrees. In doing one of these runs, the unit inevitable fails to pick up at least 2-3 commands (repeating the command does nothing, I just have to wait about 15 seconds or so for the unit to timeout and give me an option to retry the last command. After finishing a run, I'm given the option to test all of the commands that I just saved. As of now, I've had about 2 out 3 runs have at least one failed command. You're not given an option to edit one command out of a run, if one of them fails you have to redo the entire run. Suddenly, of the 156 commands I need to do to teach it one mode, I now need to do 468 commands, since inevitably I have to repeat each run multiple times, and this is just for the cooling mode. If I tack on the heating mode, now I need to do well over 900 commands.Which brings me to another design failure. You're unable to edit command sets. Meaning that you have to complete this all at once. If you leave out one of the modes now, you'll have to completely restart this procedure in the future to add that additional mode.As of the writing of this review, I'm well into 6 hours spent just trying to set this unit up. After finally getting through all of the programming, it finally attempts to download the command set to the Tado unit. For me, this had a spinning circle for about 30 minutes before I finally unplugged the device and power cycled it. This left the unit and my mobile app in a perpetual limbo state where the mobile app thought the unit was downloading a command set, and the unit was in a configuration mode waiting for instructions from the mobile app. I finally find my way onto the tado.com website, where I find a reset button in the settings, which successfully resets the device, but leaves back at square 1. Great.Going beyond the setup, I'm feeling a bit misled by this. The marketing material makes claims about how its smart and etc, however the only thing I can see is the ability to configure schedules. I can't set any temperature based controls. For example, if my AC unit is set to 70 degrees, the compressor kicks in until the temperature falls below 70 degrees. After that point, the fan stays on until the temperature rises above 70, where it triggers the compressor again. I had wanted to have Tado turn off the unit entirely after it hit my set temperature so I don't waste power on running a fan when it's not needed. No way of doing this in the app.For such an expensive control unit, I expected far more. Extremely disappointed by how low quality the user experience is in the software and how limited the functionality set is.
