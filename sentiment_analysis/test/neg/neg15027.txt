I too loved this. Picture was awesome and you can talk through it. Worked great and my cat loved it. Now suddenly it stopped working and my poor muffin is sitting in front of it crying. Customer support is responsive but hasn't fixed it yet. Looks like we are going all weekend with it broken which is sad because it's a nice way to keep my cat happy when I go out.
