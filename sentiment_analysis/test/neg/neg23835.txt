Purchased an Airtame (v 2.0.0) Aug 31, 2016 for business use in my office to connect my PC to large screen TV on wall.  Unfortunately very disappointed since the device only intermittently connects to our office WiFi  (access point only 20 ft away, Tried several things -- changed access points, moved closer to direct line of site, several tech support phone calls, different times of day in case office bandwidth issues).  When it does achieve connection, it only lasts for a couple of minutes before becoming very slow and disconnecting again.  I am unable to make PPT or other presentations because of this.  If I connect directly to the Airtame wireless signal instead of through the office network, it works more repeatedly, but you loose the advantage of being connected to the office Wifii with access to network files, internet etc.I am hoping tech support will eventually be able to help or perhaps newer software version or device to fix the problem.
