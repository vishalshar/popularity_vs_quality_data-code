-- Updated 2016 Feb 01 -- added more lights, issue about one unreliable light-- Updated 2016 Feb 23 -- more issues with unreliable lights. Downgraded to 2*s (was 3)-- Updated 2016 Mar 2 -- Gave up. Customer support mechanism is customer hostile. 3 of 4 lights are unreliable. Downgraded to 1*-- Updated 2016 Mar 3 -- Massive Wifi configuration hacking may have helped. (See below)-- Updated 2016 Apr 12 -- Sigh. Lights come on in the middle of the night even after wifi hackingSUMMARY:I gave this FOUR month of my life - A miserably failing four months at that. There are many problems with the apps (both iOS and Android), and reliability of the lights in my home. I find the Apps(s) are perhaps 1.5 out of 5 star efforts.  I understand the frustrated reviewers here who are stymied by app issues and connectivity problems. If you want to live on the bleeding edge and don't mind wasting time and money giving it a shot... more power to you. Definitely test the heck out of it before your return window is up or you'll be out both time AND money.DETAILSThe light, though expensive, is interesting, especially when paired with all the very clever automations you can do... e.g. using IFTTT you can have the bulb turn blue when you have a voicemail on your OOMA VOiP phone. (NOTE: I *DO NOT* recommend OOMA, just using it as an example).You have to START by pairing your smart phone with the bulb. A little complicated on iOS, but pretty straight forward on Android (I have both). And you have to give them an email address to even get to square one. See below for the trouble I had pairing with my iPad.The Android and iOS apps are maddeningly unintuitive.  They could fix this without you having to buy a new light. Sure, they show you the "color selector" on the example screens but never explain how to get to that selector. I tried touching the big button showing the bulb. The big button only turns the light on (or off if it's on), holding the button gives you a choice to turn the light off over some period of time. Next I tried using SCENES...On the Android the choices for Scenes are "Geofence" or "Alarm" and lights - no colors here. On iOS you pick lights, and a name... that's it.No colors on Scenes. So now I'm wondering what "Scene" means. Seems to only mean "Collection of Lights". I only had one bulb at the moment, so perhaps SCENES are a red herring.  If you try to delete a Scene you get a little clue: "Scenes are controllable by Schedules or Favourites" (yes, British spelling). Favourites? What's that... seems to be no control for it on the iPad, but on the Android if you manage to find the intensity/color controls there is a clickable Star for favorites.  Another curiosity. On iOS if you create a scene with one bulb in it... guess what happens?  Answer? NOTHING... unless the light is on in which case the light is turned off when you touch the scene. If the light is OFF touching the scene should do what... turn on the bulb, right? No, apparently not. It does nothing on either app.  Also, a Scene created on the Android is not visible on the iPad or v.v. [NOTE: A month after sending my confusion about scenes, they sent a reply. Scenes do not work like I expect... you must set everything THEN put the lights in a scene. Therefore the bizarre "scene" behavior I described is because I put an off bulb in a scene, so the only thing that scene could ever do is turn that one light off.]Where DO you change the color or intensity? You must click NOT on the nice big easy to hit button, but on the little text below it.  Didn't notice that little ">"?  Me neither.  I was quite sure that my bulb was broken and all it was ever going to give me was full intensity bright white - a rather bluish light at that.On my iOS iPad2, pretty much every time I started the app it asked me if I wanted to "Update the Firmware" of the light bulbs. If I make the mistake of saying "yes", it spins for a while, then the bulb goes "offline" and seems to remain "offline" (grayed out on the app) indefinitely.  Turning the bulb physically off then back on and force-quitting and restarting the app was the only cure. The Android app seems much more stable.I started the whole process with iOS iPad2 and gave up trying to make progress on it. I then switched to LIFX on my android.  Right after entering my email, the Android app asks me for a PASSWORD... but wait... the iOS setup never asked for a password!  NOW you have to go through a "forgot password" cycle to recover a password that was never set in the first place.CUSTOMER Support:Got the bulb on Sunday. Got frustrated on Sunday and sent both feedback and a support request. It's now the end of the business day on the following Tuesday and so far I have received nothing... not even the standard "we will get to you when we can" email. And I sent two requests: one from the iOS app, one from the Android app.  I have sent subsequent requests, too. However they have changed the support in such a way that the first thing you'll get is a ton of questions about the lights - questions that are more easily answered had they not moved "Support" to be web based. Only "Feedback" will send diagnostic information. What?UPDATE 1/27/2016:Right after I wrote the review I got one of two replies, shortly thereafter another reply. One reply was thorough and helpful. The other was terse and much less helpful.UPDATE: 2/23/2016:Remember that short unhelpful answer? Well surprise, even though I replied immediately asking for clarification nearly a month later details were actually provided. And they acknowledged that the Android and iOS apps were inconsistent in behavior.OTHER ISSUESHEAT: The bulb does seem to get hot.  It's winter here, so it's a free mini space-heater.  Heat seems to be in proportion to brightness of the bulb. It's not noticeably warm when the light has been left off for a while, and not nearly has hot as an incandescent light.SIZE: Yes, the bulb is big. It does not fit in a table lamp with a harp. The body of the bulb is too wide for the harp that holds the shade. So I cannot use the bulb in the only lamp in my office unless I leave the shade off.In an upright lamp, the pattern of light up and out is fine, but there is less downward light than you may expect.In the pendant light in my kitchen, the lights are very unreliable. Making them useless as security (schedule) controlled lights.UPDATE: Now the other LIFX lights in my house have started coming on in the middle of the night for no reason.CONTROL/CONVENIENCE:  This morning I had to hunt around for my devices to turn off my light. Why? Because if I turn off the light at the switch the bulb is dead to the world. If there is no power there is also no means to control it. And there is no way to look at the bulb and know if has power so you might have to jiggle switches and apps to get somewhere!  We had a brief power interruption yesterday (on the order of a second). All the bulbs came on.  I also set up a schedule to turn the lights on at dusk and off in the evening... but the iOS app apparently must be running (and the bulb must be reliable) for this to happen.The android app integrates with Google. Pretty cool to say "Ok Google, turn on my life X light"... pretty cool until you realize that sometimes you get strange websearch results, and about 5 out of 10 times Google turned my light OFF (yeah, it was already on, even though google clearly repeated ON).  The good ol' "Clapper" was less clumsy and required two hands and no devices.Because the light is unreliable I have run into frustration. I thought it would be handy to use the LIFx to turn off a light in a room adjoining our bedroom. You know, go to bed, hit the app button and have the light go off... would also be convenient if I hear noises or need to get up in the night to turn it on from bedside. But unfortunately, it's unreliable. Nothing like getting in a cozy bed, going to the app and finding the bulb is offline (or doesn't respond to turning it off). Get back out of bed, go to the room where the bulb is and turn it off - which means, of course I can't turn it ON with the app, either.If you use iOS and Android, you'll notice significant discrepancies between the two apps which makes it that much harder to use.RELIABILITY: I bought two more lights. One of the newer lights *AND* its replacement do not work reliably in a section of our smallish house. The light frequently goes offline.  Swapping light locations reduced the problem, but it's still unreliable.UPDATE: 2/11/2016: I returned an unreliable light for replacement via Amazon. Unfortunately, the replacement is ALSO unreliable. The issue and inconvenience has resulted in downgrading the rating to 2 (now a 1).  Now my wife is wondering why I bother... And I am wondering the same.RELIABILITY - WIFI CONFIGURATION HACKING:I have an NETGEAR Nighthawk X4 AC2350 Smart Wi-Fi Router (R7500) with which the LIFX lights have had connectivity problems. I purchased this router in December 2014. There was a firmware update on 07/06/2015 to change the "wireless driver settings to fix the wireless connection unstable issue and low performance with some wireless clients".  Apparently the LIFx light is one of those wireless clients.  Since applying the firmware upgrade AND massively changing my wifi settings, the light seems to be more reliable now.  You might argue that this means the problem is with my network. I would argue that it means the LIFX software (firmware) is not as stable as it should be - after all, my iPad, android, iPhone and other wireless devices all work fine in the same environment without the fix. I also believe it is unreasonable to expect every purchaser to overhaul their wifi/network settings to make the LIFX light reliable.I will continue to monitor this over the next several days, and if it remains stable, I will change this review back to 2 stars.UPDATE 4/12/2016: I was briefly hopeful that all the network hacking would help, but it has not. Now my option appears to be to give up or to continue to be a "beta tester" for LIFX.  Conclusion:  Money and time lost.
