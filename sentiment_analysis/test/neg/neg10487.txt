I purchased this pillow for 12 hour flights with the hope it would support my neck, as shown in the video. The pillow only provided minimal help for my neck, once I fell asleep. I ended up only using it as a back cushion! I tried to return it, but found that I had to pay the expensive return postage to China. I would not recommend this product.
