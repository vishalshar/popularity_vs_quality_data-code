Purchased sugru 8 pack from Amazon in Oct 2014.  Per recommendations on Sugru's site and on the label of the 8 pack that the shelf life of the product can be tripled by refrigeration, I put the entire pack in the refrigerator.  Fast forward to Sept 19, 2015.  The plastic on my car's wireless remote door lock opener fob broke so that I could no longer keep it on my keychain.  I pulled the sugru pack out of the refrigerator where it had been continuously for less than a year.I discovered that the foil package for each sugru color piece was labeled "Use by 02 Aug 2015".  Amazon had sent me a pack that was not too fresh, as it was expiring in  9 months. Ok, so it is a month past expiration, but if refrigeraton triples the shelf life, surely it is still good.  NOT!  I opened the foil pack and the sugru was very brittle and dry.  I rolled and worked it first with my fingers into a ball, then tried to spread it over the end of the end of the remote door opener fob which I first cleaned with acetone.The sugru was so dry that I had trouble molding it and bits of the compound would break off when pinching it.  Because it was so dry I could not smooth the surface of my repair as all the indentations from finger molding would not smooth out.So moral of the story is that for me, the claim that you can refrigerate the stuff and use it with "triple the shelf life" is totally not true.  I didn't even get 1/12th extra shelf life.
