not user friendly and is a super slow process. I was unable to make any successful prints that required height and ABS was impossible to get to stick. Customer service is great although trouble shooting takes time. When I received the product the lid  was not installed correctly. I'm returning printer but am stuck with opened packages of ABS material. 3d printing is amazing but this product seems like it was rushed out. Simple things like the recessed SD card slot makes it impossible to use. Every print had excess stringy parts which I read would be fixed with an e3d hot end but I feel with the price of the printer, it should work out of the box.
