Lock gets jammed about 70% of the time. Not a seamless sync up to Apple home kit either. May end up returning this.Update one week later...The only reason I haven't returned this thing yet is because it took an hour to switch out my Medeco lock for a compatible one. Would not recommend this product as it jams constantly. Maybe it would work better on a new build house.I also haven't been able to get it to sync with the Apple TV so I have to wait 30sec to 3 min for it to register that I'm standing in the rain waiting to unlock my door.
