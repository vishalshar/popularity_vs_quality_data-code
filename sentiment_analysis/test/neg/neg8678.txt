The item came in a timely manner. However My cat got out and when we went to go track him it took us to 33 m radius area in our neighborhood. We could not find him at all. Later her came home on his own without the tracker.  The clip that attached to the collar was in place so the tracker fell off of it somehow.  When I contacted customer service they said that something was disrupting the signal. Like a leaf or a bush.(are you kidding me? What if my cat was in the bush or tree? Under a leaf give me a break) There was nothing they could do to boost the signal. That they were sorry I could not find the tracker. So the tracker is about to die and we are out a trackerless then a two months after purchasing it. If I could give this negative stars I would.  They have no paging mechanism that makes it beep or whistle when you lose it. It's not secure. You have to take the tracker off the collar to charge it ever 2-3 days. Why not just make a tracker that Is attached to the collar securely?
