So far so good after 1 week.Pros- Camera has good picture and was fairly easy to install. I like the feature to shut off the light or put it on dusk to dawn setting remotely. Also that it uses your existing home exterior light wiring for power. No batteries or cords.Cons- Kuna needs to provide more detailed specs about the light, like more detailed dimension,..etc. Before I bought it I asked the question of the amazon community about if the mounting bracket was centered in the mounting base, (the part of the light that attaches to the house) because its not covered in any of the info the company provides. All the answers said yes its centered. Unfortunately these answers were all wrong. As you can see from the pictures, the mounting screw holes the bracket attaches to are at the top of the mounting base of the light. This makes a huge difference, because the light will actually hang a couple inches lower than it would if the mounting bracket was centered. In my case I had a 10" mounting surface and the mounting base of the light is 9.5", it would have fit perfect if the bracket was centered in the mounting base. As you can see it now hangs lower than the mounting surface. I even had to chip away at some of my stone veneer so it could attach flush against the mounting surface. I am actually surprised no one else had posted before that they ran into this problem.Overall a great product that just needs more detailed information put out for it.Update- Now on second week and things are going downhill on this product. The light stays on all the time now even though I have the setting set for it to never come on. Ended up having to unscrew the light bulb to turn the light off. Also when I go to live mode I get a black picture for anywhere between 2 to 30 seconds, sometimes longer. I have tried turning off the power and then back on to see if this would help correct the issues but it didn't help at all. And going back to my previous comments about lack of information about this product, in the parts bag that came with it there is a small half circle shaped piece of plastic, that I now know is a sun shade or something, but my point is, it isn't shown on the parts list at all. Also there are 2 small clear plastic buttons on the bottom of the light. I know one is the LED light that shows power and function, but what is the other one for on the other side of the bottom of the light? Again, why isn't this shown somewhere in the product info? I'm a very patient and logical person but I'm getting pretty frustrated with this product. Down from 3 stars to 2 stars now.
