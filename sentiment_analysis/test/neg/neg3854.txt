So excited for this but I think they released it too early without working out the major bugs/issues.  Mine printed one picture and then would not print.  I was online trying to figure out what the issue was and there isn't that much help from their "help" function.Finally I just got a paperclip and hit the reset button.  It worked and I was able to print ONE picture and then it said low battery.  You cannot print when it says low battery even if it is plugged in and charging.  It also takes FOREVER to charge.  So now I am waiting for it to charge so I can print out the rest of the pictures for my son's school project.  We bought this for school projects.I think they should have used the time they used to make the pictures "scan" to become alive on making the basic print function work properly.  That's why people buy this case for the print function no one cares about the alive picture function.
