I purchased this product based on the outstanding reviews here. It worked well for 2 weeks until the following:Area where the screw makes the contact with the plastic panel became warped.The button which expands the side flaps broke after 2 weeks of use.There is no customer service #. It is only done through email which took 2 days to respond.I had to pay for shipping to ship back the product even though it was due to product malfunction.
