This thing is nothing but an expensive remote control dog.  It does not interact with child as advertised.  Out of the box it required 3 firmware updates just to turn on.  The 4th update keeps crashing it so i didnt bother with it.  Its supposed to fetch the ball and go into the recharging station on its own but does none of that.  Had to charge it manually.  The only feature that actually works is the remote control with the smartwatch.  Complete disappointment for my son.  Save the money and get a drone.
