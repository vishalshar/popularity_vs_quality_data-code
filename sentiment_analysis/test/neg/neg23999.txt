I am an avid runner who experienced a rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath during a marathon.  All my tests at my cardiologist were negative. We decided it would be worthwhile to purchase the Kardia so I could take it on my runs and see if I had paroxysmal A-fib.  The device is quite small and looked like a perfect device for my needs.  Its website claims "Kardia offers instant EKG analysis (using FDA-cleared machine learning algorithms), and consultations with board-certified cardiologists, so it's easy to know whether heart rhythm is normal or in atrial fibrillation." Unfortunately the device does not work as advertised.The device gives you three readings: normal, atrial fibrillation, and unclassified. Sadly the device gives me a reading of "unclassified" 90% of the time.  Only twice have I ever got a reading of "normal" and twice a reading of Afib. Imagine if you bought a glucose meter to check your levels and the meter kept saying "dont know levels".  That's how i feel.Unclassified means my data doesn't fall within their parameters.  However, my heart rate falls within their guidelines of 50-100 bpm.  Maybe I have a defective device.  So I called customer support and was told to send the EKG report into their service for a professional reading.  I paid the fee and sent in my reading only to get a report back that says normal.  I called customer service again and asked why would a professional technician say it is normal but the device say unclassified.  Initially all I got was double talk and the customer service rep even hung the phone up on me.  I called back and was eventually told me to send the report  for their software/data/algorithm person to look at.  I was pleased and finally felt that customer service was trying to help. That is until I got a response: "If your recording are coming up Unclassified, the Kardia Mobile cannot analyze your heart rhythm. Therefore, if you have any questions on the recording taken, you should forward on to your physician for follow-up."  My response: "I sent it to your technician who said normal.  Why do 90% of my readings say unclassified if they are normal."  Alivecor final response: "As I made mention in my previous email, the Kardia Mobile (product) cannot analyze your heart rhythm but a human can. That is why you forward recordings on for review."  . . . Well isn't their technician who read my EKG a human.What is the purpose of the device if it cannot detect "Afib" or tell me if normal.  My readings are normal based upon the medical professional at Alivecor.  Well why doesnt the device tell me that.  I am open to the fact I have a defective device but why wouldn't customer service explore that option. I think they know this is common and just want to sell the device before it is truly ready and useful.If you want a device that tells you if your rhythm is normal or if you have Afib then the Kardia is NOT for you.  I think the device has promise. However, as it stands now, it is not ready for market use and did not suit my needs.  Buy another device or wait until the fix the glitches.
