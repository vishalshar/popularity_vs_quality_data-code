I recently had a very high blood pressure reading when being looked at for a completely unrelated issue at a clinic. My doctor told me to read my bp a few times a day and give him an average over a week or 2. I already had a pressure cuff, but decided to look for one that would record and store my readings so I didn't have to save this info myself. There are many options for bluetooth paired with smartphone, but sadly these all require an iPhone or an Android and I have a Windows Phone. This was the only option that used Home WiFi and an online app (did not require a smart phone). Here are the problems-biggest issue, it sometimes completes, but has an incorrect number for Diastolic, low by 20-30. How do I know? Well I've been measuring my bp from time to time since high school, and I know my Diastolic will pretty much always be beween 78 and 98. Suddenly this one reads 68 the first night I got it. I happen to have my other cuff there and immediately measured with it. The Systolic were close, but my other cuff measure the Diastolic in the 90s when this one said 68. I think this is dangerous as this device could be fooling people into thinking their BP is normal when it's not. So far about 30% of my readings have been like this. It also makes me suspect other readings. maybe they are off as well but not as much?-It's squeezes your arm like a python. My fingers often turn purple is squeezes so hard. It is painful. This is not a problem with my other BP cuff I've used (and the ones at the doctors or the pharmacy)-When it's reading, which take like 30 seconds, its lets out a loud beep for every pulse of your heart. I did this at work and was a little embarrassed when the coworker in the office next to me asked what the beeping was coming from-After the pain of squeezing, the embarrassing beeping, it often still results in a error code and fails to give you a reading at all. This rarely if ever happens with my existing (non-wifi) cuff.
