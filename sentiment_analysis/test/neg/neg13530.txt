I have tried several times to get the device activated to no avail. I keep getting nonsense like: "We are upgrading our systems", "we are having system problems","we will call you back" etc. (of course no call back). The automated website is completely useless, not recognizing the device's serial number or allowing me to setup an online account. One star because tech support is in real English and not in India. Tech Support was unable to help. It is not that their device didn't work; their computer systems were down and the device could not be activated. Three calls and all day later, I lost confidence. Down computers are not a good thing in this kind of operation.The only system that has worked so far is their billing system, which miraculously worked immediately and without a hitch. Ironically, getting a refund takes 21 days.Tech Support was not able to activate the device, so I am forced to send it back.Frankly, I would have rather had a device/system that works and not all this headache.BTW: No way could an elderly person set up service by themselves.
