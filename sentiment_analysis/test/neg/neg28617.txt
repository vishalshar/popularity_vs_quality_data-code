My expectation in buying this lock is that would provide at least equivalent security and greater convenience with features such as auto lock and unlock.  However, most of its features are unreliable, often resulting in an unsecured home.  This lock works like a development prototype, and is not suitable or convenient for safeguarding a home or business.  Among the major defects:* Sometimes the lock unlocks itself without any command from the user.  We ended up locking the door knob lock as a backup, but this negates the convenience of having this lock.* The lock sometimes powers off and will not appear in the August app on any device, requiring a key for entry.  Removing and reinserting the batteries restores power, but again this negates the convenience of a smart lock.* Auto-lock takes too long to engage (30 seconds minimum).  Given the lock's lack of reliability in other areas, I never felt secure enough to simply walk away and let the lock do its job.  Another problem with auto-lock is that this lock is not smart enough to know when the door is actually closed, resulting in the deadbolt slamming against the door frame several times a day.* It takes too long for the app to find and connect with the lock (minimum 10 seconds, but sometimes as long as 20-30 seconds).  Again this makes the lock less convenient that a traditional lock because one has to be proactive in firing up the app to get ready to leave.* The auto-unlock worked only 90% of the time, which is actually much better than other reviewers' experiences, which are as low as 25%.  However, auto-unlock uses position services in your phone and consumes a lot of battery.  My battery consumption was twice as high as without the August lock running in the background.* This is more of a manufacturer privacy issue, but August requires you to take pictures of your front door and yourself to use the app.
