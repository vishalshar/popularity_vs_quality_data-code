I use this for homemade toner that must be refrigerated. The plastic must not withstand cold well. I had it on a very small pint-size ball jar, and when it tipped over in the fridge one day the plastic lid (bizarrely enough) shattered EVERYWHERE. Liquid spilled everywhere. I would not have bought this product if I knew it was too brittle for cold storage and would shatter (despite being plastic) from a bump.
