I have had it about 2 weeks now.  Every 2 days, I have to reboot and reset up the unit.  It is completely unacceptable.  I use it as a range extender.  I have 2 computers that rely on its connection and spending 15 minutes every 2 days to reboot and set up the connection is NOT okay.I am going to be sending it back.EDIT: Securifi convince me that there was nothing wrong with the unit.  For the next several weeks, I went back and forth with my ISP on the phone and with several techs coming out because I determined that it was my primary router that kept going out.  My ISP replaced my router 3 times and the problem would not go away.I turned my attention back to the Almond and unplugged it.  No problems for 2 weeks.  I called Securifi and they insisted that the Almond could not cause my router to do what it was doing.  So, I plugged it in today and less than two hours later, my primary router has defaulted to factory status and I was down for 20 minutes again.  What changed?  The Almond was plugged in and connected again.I have demanded a refund from Securifi. The one star will only be deserved if they actually give me a refund.
