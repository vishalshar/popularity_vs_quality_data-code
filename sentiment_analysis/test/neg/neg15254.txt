Great idea, but is not all it is said to be. In order to view the photos on the TV, you have to manually scroll through them on your phone. While there is a screensaver, it is not controllable (no way to choose the way, or the length of time,  you want to display). Because we have a network inside our house (more than one router) before we connect to the internet, the remote access to photos does not work either.  Right now, it is just an expensive back up hard drive that connects to your phone.
