Having bought the camera which is more beautiful than the pictures it takes, I shouldn't have been at all surprised by this adapter.  This adapter serves no other purpose than to be a pressure plate with thin, rubbery protectors; the screw of your quick release plate will hopefully be long enough to secure the camera in this adapter.  Pray you don't dent or scratch the surface of your beautifully anodized camera.  Rubber bands, various Velcro loops or patches, or rubber cable ties could do everything this adapter does.  Be creative and save your money, you'll be more artistic than the pictures the camera takes - tripod adapter or not.
