This item seemed ok at first, but the location of the volume buttons was not in the correct spot. My son has to take the case off to control those buttons on the side. We are past the return time. We have to buy a new case. Update:  I bought the wrong case.. I don't have the iPad mini 4 that may be why the buttons don't fit in the case.. not sure how to delete a review!
