Let me start off by saying I almost never write reviews but I felt with a new product with so much hype it was important for those interested in Luma.  I bought this to replace a single router that I using. It was a very good router but sometimes didn't cover my entire house.I was super excited when the Luma finally arrived. The packaging was really nice and set-up couldn't have been easier. That's essentially when everything went poorly. I placed the boxes exactly where I was told to and everything appeared to be working. I had a strong signal all over the house. The only issue was that the wifi wasn't working. I could be standing 2 feet from a box and it would take forever to open websites and work on the internet. It got to a point that my entire family turned off wifi in the house.I tried to troubleshoot and determined for a 3000 sq foot house I would need another set of 3 and decided that $800 for wifi when my original single router covered the house better was sufficient. The only super positive was the ease to return the item to Amazon. I was so disappointed that this didn't work out as described.
