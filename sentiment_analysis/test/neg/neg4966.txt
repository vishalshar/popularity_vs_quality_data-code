Complete waste of money here.  I used it twice.  Once for "calm" within days of buying it, once for "energy" today.  The "calm" did nothing, but I'm a generally calm person, so I figured it was fine.  Guess I was looking for groovy, happy, a pick me up?  Today I remembered it existed and thought I'd give it a go.  It died three times (thync pad poor connection or something).  Talk about ruining a vibe.  Heh.  Get your groove the old fashion way - exercise, sex, food, fun.  This is a gimmic that I wished had worked but nada.  Meditation to Enigma is more energizing.
