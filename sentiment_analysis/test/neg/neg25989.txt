My son purchased this scooter through Amazon.  The first one was extremely hard to start and constantly stalled out. Upon removing the engine cover I discovered that the oil hose was disconnected. I reconnected it but it still ran poorly. I am very mechanically inclined and have worked on both my automobiles and my motorcycles for almost 40 years. I finally gave up and sent the scooter back for exchange. The replacement that I received was not a new unit. They are supposed to be shipped with an empty crankcase but the replacement had oil in the crankcase. In addition, this one had  a leak in the fuel supply that I could hear and smell. The construction of this unit is mediocre at best and I don't recommend it. This scooter might have the potential to be a viable product but at the present time it is half baked!
