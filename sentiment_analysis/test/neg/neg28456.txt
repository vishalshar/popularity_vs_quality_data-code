I bought in hopes of using this for diving but it really didn't work well. When you are horizontal in water you would pretty much record just the bottom of the ocean and not whats in front of you. For that you would have to be vertical and you can't be vertical for too long unless you are just resting or coming to the top. Im using this instead on my backpack when hiking but depending on your backpack its also uncomfortable and hard to find a good spot for it to work well with Go PRO.
