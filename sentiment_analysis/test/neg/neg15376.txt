This was a birthday present for my 12 year old son and he could never get it to work.  My husband and dad both spent two hours trying to get it to fly and it always just fell.  He kept trying it for one week and it never worked after reading all of the instructions and video's.  When we got around to return within the 30 day window I ended up missing it by one day so I'm out the $50.
