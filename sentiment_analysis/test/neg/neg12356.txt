Please, please don't waste your money on this. I exercise a lot in the water so I was excited when I saw the Shine. I decided to wait for the Shine 2 to get the new features like the vibration alert. Misfit touts the durable material, but I was sitting at my desk when it popped out of the band. It fell a short distance onto a tile floor and the face had significant scratches. This was on day 1.I thought I was not careful enough when I put it into the band so I was very careful after that.  It next fell off when I was walking around the house a couple of hours later. Luckily, a friend spotted it, but I still did not learn my lesson. Today it again fell off when I was in the garage.  Since I have the black one it is not easy to spot. I tried syncing it, thinking the flashing lights might help me find it. Evidently, you have to be very close for the device to sync.  I heard the device hit the ground so fortunately I knew where to look.  I still spent a frustrating amount of time searching for it. I will return this before it falls off again. It is more attractive than my Polar tracker, but that one has never fallen off and I have worn it for over a year.I was also unimpressed with instructions for the Shine 2. Perhaps people who have previously owned a Shine were fine, but the quick start guide is woefully inadequate for new users.  I wasted a couple of hours figuring out which apps to load.Another reviewer mentioned that Misfit has not released other band options for the Shine 2 and frankly the black version is not any more attractive than other trackers. I can't believe that a company would release a fitness tracker with such a cheap and flimsy band.
