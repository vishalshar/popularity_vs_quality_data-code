The product worked great but once the seal between the top and bottom half stopped "sealing" tight it would no longer charge my phone.  Tried contacting Chargetech and was put in a loop of TOTAL NON CUSTOMER SERVICE with phone recordings that kept directing me to their site to order replacement parts.  The product is under warranty and I'm finding it very difficult to get Chargetech to honor the warranty.  I would not recommend purchasing a product from this company due to the VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
