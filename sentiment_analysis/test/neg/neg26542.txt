After a couple of months testing I have drop my rating from five to one stars. This controller has become unreliable and a pain in the butt. It never seems to stay online so i have to restart the unit very often. It does not account for rain fall in my area and comes on even after we receive two or more inches of rain. Blossom you need to roll out updates and fixes every week to get this thing up to par. Considering other options. Pure junk!!!!!!
