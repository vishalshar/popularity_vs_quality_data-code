I bought the Misfit Shine 2 in early November; it had the right features that I wanted and looked good.  I discounted previous reports about the Misfit Shine popping out of the wrist band and expected that Misfit would improve on any known defects.  This is not the case.  I wore my Shine 2 without the added action clip and it popped out three times on the first day.  Every day after that, I only wore the wrist band with the action clip which offered a small measure of additional security from popping out.  But, it still popped out three times over the first two week period.  The first two times I noticed it and simply reattached it.  I told myself after the second popping of my Shine 2 that if it pops one more time I would return it.  The third time I wasn't so lucky.  I got home from the grocery store and, while unpacking groceries, I noticed, in horror, that it was out of the band.  I looked for hours, retracing my steps.  I went back to the grocery, scoured the car, and looked all over the driveway and front yard -- all to no avail.  I should have listened to previous users and passed on the Shine 2.  To be clear, I loved how it worked, but Misfit's method of securing the Shine 2 is just abysmal engineering and should be avoided at all costs -- don't be like me and waste your money on something that you will lose in less than a month.
