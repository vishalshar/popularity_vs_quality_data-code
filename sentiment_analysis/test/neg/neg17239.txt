Expect bits and pieces of apple chips.  Coming from Bare Fruit, my 12 bags were all crunched.  I've bought this product in a grocery store several times and the chips are intact.  They're still edible, of course, but maybe a discount should apply for damaged goods.  I'm so disappointed because it was my favorite snack and wanted to buy a case every month but now I won't.5 stars for the product1 star for the smashed product
