I really liked the idea, but the quality didn't match expectations.The lunch box is really heavy to start with. So for smaller kids that is way to heavy to carry along with all others tuff they need to cary to school.After few uses with hot soup, the bottom of the box under the thermos warped and became hard to close. After that the food wouldn't even stay warm through lunch. Since the thermos is metal, you can't reheat the food either. So the box is in the trash now :(
