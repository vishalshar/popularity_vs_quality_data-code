I wanted to like this smart charger. With my phone plugged into the ZUS charger, and my car turned on, the phone battery DIScharged about twice as fast as normal usage. For example, in a 15 minute trip using Waze for navigation, bluetooth on (required by the ZUS charger) and nothing else running, the battery went from 60% to 54%. This baby gets returned.
