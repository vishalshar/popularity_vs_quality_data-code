I was SO excited to finally get a Ray, wore it for 2 months and it worked flawlessly until 4 days ago when it stopped syncing. Did all the troubleshooting tips/suggestions on the MISFIT site, still didn't work. Contacted customer service via email because that is the only option available. Received an automated reply that included a case number later that day. 2 days later, I finally received an email from customer support containing some of the troubleshooting steps I had already took and replied accordingly and also askied what steps need to be taken to replace my device. Next day another email from customer support that was tantamount to regurgitating the previous email. Again, I stated that my device didn't work properly and needed a replacement. It's now day 4 since my device stopped working and still no resolution in sight. VERY disappointed!!
