This case looks fine, and it works fine to protect the Apple Watch, but it breaks the watch's normal functionality.  The case's watch crown only sort of works (requires you to press lightly on it to engage the apple's crown with friction... but not too hard, or you'll just press the button!), and while the sensors on the back of the watch appear to be able to register through the waterproof sleeve provided (it struggles to read a consistent heart rate, but it does eventually read it), it doesn't register well enough to see the watch as being worn -- this translates to having to unlock the watch every time you raise it to use it.It is not worth the effort involved in dismantling the case, putting the watch in, reassembling it for whatever specific purposes you need to protect it, then dismantling the case again and taking the watch back out to be able to use it regularly once more.  I was hoping to be able to keep the watch in the case permanently and continue to use the watch as I normally would.This is definitely not worth the asking price either... it's all rubber and plastic other than the case's watch crown as far as I can tell (which, again, doesn't actually work very well).  Very disappointed,
