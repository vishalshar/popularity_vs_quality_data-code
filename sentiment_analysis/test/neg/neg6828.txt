Positives:The watch looks great, the rubber band is comfortable, the combo of analog and digital time works well. Also, for the first three days, the watch actually showed notifications as was advertised, including: phone calls with caller id, appointments with text for the title, and then numbers denoting other notifications like texts, emails, social media, etc.Negatives:First disappointment was the fact that the watch displays text for caller id and appointments, but for some reasons cannot show who is texting or emailing or anything else.Second and much bigger disappointment is the phone app does not work at all, you cannot create an account or sign in. Despite this, the watch maintains connection with your phone and I was able to receive notifications for about three days. Since then, and for no apparent reason, all notifications have ceased. I've tried both soft resets and hard resets to no avail. Customer service is unresponsive. The only way I know the watch is still connected to my phone is the icon shows when I walk out of range of the bluetooth.Overall, the product was likely released way too early, but I still think it has potential and I plan to hold onto it because it functions as a watch and I happened to need one. If that wasn't the case I would return it in a second. In the meantime, I will wait for some updates or responses from customer service, but not getting my hopes up here.
