Verry disappointed with this product, especially after waiting almost 1/2 year to get it:Don't believe the features listed on the getluma.com website - most are vaporware. Example:- Internet curfew doesn't work for kids accounts - instead it turns off the internet for the WHOLE household.- Guest WiFi is OPENED with no password, for all your neighbors to enjoy. This is despite what the security listed for the WiFi states!!!- Internet connectivity becomes sluggish unless the unit is rebooted (by hand) every 24 hours.- No firmware upgrades since I got it. It almost seems like an abandoned product. Seems like the management is more interested in selling vaporware more than supporting the product.I did my best to like this product, but after almost 30 days of trying, I'm sending it back.
