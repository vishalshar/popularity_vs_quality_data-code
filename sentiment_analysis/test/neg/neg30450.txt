I got this last July because I had been eyeing it since it was on Kickstarter. I'm obsessed with my 8-year-old cat Fifi and already had a webcam for her. However, the idea of being able to communicate with her and give her treats while I was at work was too awesome to pass up. The idea is definitely solid. Unfortunately, my kitty is a little skittish and didn't respond too well to the noisy nature of this product. It makes a noise when it comes on, when the camera moves, and when it's going to launch treats. This might be awesome for a dog but didn't seem to impress my kitty. She did come and eat the treats a little while after they were launched though. I included some pictures that I took with the Petzi camera so you can check out the quality of the images (also not so great, but well enough if your pet interacts with the camera). All in all, I think this is a solid concept that needs some work in the quality department, especially for the price tag, even though some competitors cost as much as twice this much (something that initially urged my purchase in the first place... thought I was getting a great deal).
