I am NOT happy with the false picture advertisement.  Twice my daughters soup spilled and she HAD nothing to eat at school.  yet your pic shows a soup in the product marketing.  Also, what is the point of a hot section if it does NOT keep the food hot? Very disappointed.  These things need to be specified in the product description!
