Out of the box, some keys when pressed produced multiple letters on screen. This is usually a short. Talked to support and they asked many questions but stopped replying after I asked for a replacement. This was my second keyboard from them, since I liked it so much. I wanted one for both my computer's. I think Mionix makes great products but poor customer service after this experience.
