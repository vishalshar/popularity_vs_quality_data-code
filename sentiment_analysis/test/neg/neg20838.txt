So much for the lifetime guarantee. I bought these in November of 2015 and love them until they fell apart the first of May. Their "lifetime guarantee " is only if you register on there website within 90 days of purchase. About a month ago the small strips that cushion nose fell off. Today the bridge between the two eye pieces came apart. It's back to the $10 drug store models for me
