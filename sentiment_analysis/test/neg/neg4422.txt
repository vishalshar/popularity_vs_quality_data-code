(UPDATE 2/24/2016):I got a reply from LIFX customer service on 2/16. It wasn't helpful because they were telling me the boiler plate instruction that I already have done: power cycle, hard reset etc. I replied asking instructions for the specific problem I'm facing. I never heard from them again until today. So the other reviewers were right. The customer service doesn't really exist.(UPDATED 2/15/2016 from 5-star to 1-star):I originally wrote a 5-star review of this product, but after using it for about two months, serious problems appeared. Now they completely stopped working, but I'm out of my return period. I found no support phone number on LIFX's website, and the email to support got an automatic reply saying: "We are managing more inquiries than our small team can adequately respond to in a timely fashion..." So I'm updating this review to a 1-star until they resolve my issues.One common problem with these bulbs are, they sometimes disconnect (or called it "software crash") for no reason and you have to restart the bulbs. This happens about once per week. This means, these bulbs are not reliable enough for general use.More seriously, I recently changed the bulbs' names in the app (because the old names are too long), and then they completely stopped working. I tried all kind of ways to get them working again but failed. Finally I decided to "reinstall" the bulbs from scratch. I deleted all three of my bulbs from the app, did a "hard reset" of the bulbs according to LIFX's support page. And then I tried to add the bulbs again. But unfortunately, the bulbs can no longer be initialized, and I got the message "Wi-Fi connection Problem: LIFX failed to onboard your bulb. Try turning the bulb off and on again before retrying". I did turn the bulb off and on again, but no luck. They all failed to connect! This is the same error message as seen by one of the 1-star critical reviewers.As a software engineer myself, I'm pretty sure LIFX has software quality issues. They certainly haven't thoroughly tested the functionality of their software. If you let the users to rename their bulbs in the app's interface, you'd better test that they still work after renaming.Original 5-star review:These bulbs are really nice. As compared to Philips Hue bulbs (which I bought and then returned), they have several advantages:1. They have better colors than Philips Hue bulbs. Both cold and warm colors can be seen through the lamp shade, which is not the case for the Philips Hue bulbs. The cold colors of the Hue bulbs are hard to see through the lamp shade.2. They are bright enough, so you can use them for reading. The Hue bulbs are not bright enough.3. They remember their colors and brightness even when they lose power, so essentially you can use them as normal bulbs if you prefer. Not the case for Hue bulbs.4. They don't need a hub to work. Each bulb connects directly to the wifi. This avoids annoying hub cables setup and increases the over all reliability of the lighting system.One easy improvement I observe (otherwise I'll give five stars): You can't change the color saturation of these bulbs. They are very vibrant saturated when the brightness is below 50%. When the brightness goes above 50%, the color gets automatically desaturated. It would be nice if I can set the saturation of the color directly in the app. Sometimes I don't want very saturated colors when the brightness is low.
