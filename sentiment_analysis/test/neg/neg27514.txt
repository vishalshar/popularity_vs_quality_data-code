Update: Moved down to one star.I wanted to love it so much and I did love it for a good month. Randomly after a month, the battery life went from 10 days after a full charge to 2 days after a full charge. I went through about a month and a half of troubleshooting with Whistle and they could not figure out what the issue was. They thought it was something with my wifi(?) and I tried to have the Whistle paired with only the wifi and then only the bluetooth. Neither fixed the issue. So now I'm stuck with a device that only lasts for two days. It's a major pain when I am traveling with my dog or have the dog with a sitter.Ontop of this, my app only seems to sync when I have the app open and I press the button on the whistle. Otherwise, there is no sync. Disappointing...Previous:Great wearable for dogs! I got the Whistle to keep track of my pups activity to make sure she stays happy and healthy. I bought my first one and was having a ton of trouble pairing it. It just wouldn't work. So I contacted their customer support. After a month of troubleshooting, they finally just replaced the Whistle with a new one. Once I got my new one, it was smooth sailing from there.One thing I'd like to point out, that it is very bulky on my 11.6lb klee kai. However, that doesn't deter me from using it. I'd also love to be able to see my friends dogs with the Whistle through the app. You know, like check in to see how they're doing with their goals and leave words of encouragement.In the long run, I'm able to make sure my dog is hitting her goals and is a happy pup. You know what they say; a tired pup is a happy pup.
