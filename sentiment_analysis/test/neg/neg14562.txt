DO NOT BUY ANY THINOPTICS PRODUCTS. If Amazon had the option, I'd give this 0 stars. I purchased a couple of these reading glasses and at first they seemed to work well. So I got another one. However, the case for the last one does not work properlyÂ—very difficult to replace or remove the glasses from the case. I contacted ThinOptics about this, inquiring about a replacement. Despite their so-called "lifetime guarantee," they never even responded (I wrote to them three times). ThinOptics customer service is atrocious. And the quality of their products is inconsistent. DO NOT BUY ANY THINOPTICS PRODUCTS. If you have a problem, they will just ignore it. Better to buy from their competitors.
