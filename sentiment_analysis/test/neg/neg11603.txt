This product has promise but it hasn't been delivered.  Feels over-promised and under delivered.  I bought the Luma to replace my Apple airport which worked well.  Comparing to the Apple, the coverage is not as good or as fast. The speed would be fine but suddenly hiccups as if it was buffering.  This is likely a software issue.  The other thing is the software app doesn't offer controls like time limits, app control or website controls.  I want to love it but there's a lot of work to be done still.  I may have to switch back to my Apple setup - fast and reliable.  Maybe I should leave the Luma for the kids to know the consequences of not obeying house rules...  I'm happy to update my review when it gets better.
