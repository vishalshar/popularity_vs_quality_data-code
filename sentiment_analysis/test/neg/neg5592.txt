Interesting idea, but poor design. I am not sure what the purpose of this device is. It's an expensive clock. That it does well. Also, once you set up your email in the email app it does display the subject headers of your email as you get new messages and that is useful ( but you can display, read and edit them directly on your smartphone, which is always in your hands)The radio app is awful. All the stations are from Europe. The audio is thin and disappointing. The bluetooth works fine and you can send your audio from your smartphone to it. I attached a speaker to it since the built in audio sound of the device is not pleasing to listen too.The rest of the apps are lame. The stock app only allows for one stock to be displayed, more useful would be a list of 10 stock symbols. How difficult would that of been to implement?Weather, stocks, time, etc. ( in other words, all the things that the apps display) can be displayed easier on your smartphone which brings me back to my original question... what is the purpose of this device?
