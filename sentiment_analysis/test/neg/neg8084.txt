Just got my watch after waiting half a month (not the reason why I'm giving it a bad review, it actually arrived earlier than expected), I was very excited to receive my watch. I start unboxing the watch and find the watch and take everything out of the box only to realize everything was just smashed into the box poorly packaged. I brush it off since its just a user manual and a cord that was un damaged. I read the user manual on how to turn the watch on and basic functions. I tried to power the watch on only to come to realize the screen does not power on. The watch its self does power on because it vibrates after holding down the power button then makes a sound (not sure what this sound is since I cant see the display). So I initially think it just happened to come dead. So I throw it on the charger (I'm assuming its charging, still nothing to display its actually doing something) leave it there for a few hours and come back to it only to have it do the exact same thing as before.I wrote a ticket to Mobvoi on the TicWatch website, and am currently waiting for a response.Edit 1: 24 hours later still no response from their customer service.
