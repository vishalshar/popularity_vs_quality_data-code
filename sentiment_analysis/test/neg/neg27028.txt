I am so bummed to be writing this.  I purchased my illumibowl in mid-December and was thrilled by the vast array of colorful possibilities that greeted me in the middle of the night when I stumbled into the water closet.  So thrilled, in fact, that I purchased illumibowls for my boyfriend (spends a lot of time on the throne, as boyfriends tend to do) and my grandmom (spends a lot of time on the throne, as old ladies tend to do) as Christmas presents.  It was a hit at the family Christmas parties.  I had won the holiday.Fast forward to mid-February.  I'm a girl- the only time the seat gets raised is when the aforementioned boyfriend is over, or when I'm cleaning the pot.  I am not morbidly obese.  There are no signs of cat sabotage.  The wiring that connects the sensor to the light that sits inside the bowl did not get damaged or smooshed, but it's completely shot.  First, the batteries were replaced in hopes of an easy fix, but alas- it's definitely the connective wire.  At first notice of the problem, When twisted, there were intermittent flickers of color (and hope), but even those have faded.  Illumibowl, I barely knew thee!  I fear the day I have to answer to my dear sweet incontinent Grammy about the shoddy Christmas gift I got her :(
