Do not buy. This has not worked once.  I've tried it over and over for days, and it simply does not work.  And the LugLoc company won't refund the subscription you have to buy to go with this device.I bought a year's worth of "traces", and my phone app always shows my LucLoc to be off, even though it is fully charged and on.  This thing is utterly useless.The customer service is very prompt when you email them, but that doesn't mean a hill of beans when the product does not work.  It also turns out there are a lot of things you need to know to get your LugLoc to work that are not in the "manual" provided with the LugLoc.  I hate the crappy documentation consumer electronics companies have been providing in recent  years.  A slip of paper is not a proper instruction manual, dummies!  If it has to be explained over the phone or in an email, IT SHOULD BE IN THE MANUAL!!!Nevertheless, despite everything, the LugLog never worked.  And the company is refusing to refund the money I paid for their "traces".  So now I am going to have to contact my credit card company to revoke the charges.DO NOT BUY!!!
