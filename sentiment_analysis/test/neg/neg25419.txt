**Updated after using for a few months**Although great in concept, execution lacks accuracy and dependability. The readings are off by almost 2 degrees! That's a big problem when I'm trying to decide if my infant needs to be taken to the hospital when I get a reading of 101*F and then a second reading of 99*F within a second!! How is that even possible?! I took 20 readings throughout the night to monitor progress and this morning the app only shows 12 of the most recent. I bought this thermometer so that I can keep a history of logs but it defeats the purpose if not everything is going to be maintained. I'm highly disappointed as when I bought this earlier this year and gave a great rating, there were only 5 reviews on the item. Now there are over a hundred reviews and a lot of people seem to be having the same problems! I would advise against purchasing this thermometer until they can figure how to make it accurate.Withings, this isn't a toy that can have a missing/broken piece. A thermometer can involve a life and death situation. Being associated with Boston Children's hospital should mean you will take these complaints seriously and immediately take action.**Original review**For some reason it was really hard to find a touch-free blue tooth thermometer with a user friendly app for logging. Enter, Withings.Although this is extremely pricey, it's worth it for us. You can create a profile for each family member and log all history through blue tooth. Just quickly scan the forehead from temple to mid forehead, and get a reading instantly. Select family member, and then it syncs directly to your phone. I love the sleek, touch-free (no germs, no covers to buy), automation design. There is also an indicator to let you know if the temperature is within normal limits or too high.We also have the Withings weight scale and wish that they could combine the apps to create a master profile, but it's not a big deal having two apps for the two instruments.Great thermometer!
