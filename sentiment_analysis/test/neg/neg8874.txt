Overall pretty disappointed with this product's reliability.I had the same general experience as Jason H and will be returning the product. Initially, video connection was very unreliable. Watching on demand often required multiple retries to get it to work once.To make it work ok, I followed Jason H's feedback, temporarily added a dedicated Netgear router for the skybell, made sure the WIFI connection had excellent signal and low noise, added a special QoS rule on the router to ensure the Skybell got the Highest network priority relative to all other devices. All that trouble helped improve connectivity quite a bit, but still far from good enough. It still fails about half the time, and when it succeeds it is often after the first or second auto retry (i.e. after quite a few seconds staring at the black screen).Once I got it to work "ok", I noticed a second issue: tthe motion detection feature never seemed to record the actual event that triggered it. It did a good job detecting the motion, sending me a timely notification, and somehow even showed a tiny picture/thumbnail of the person who walked by, but failed pretty badly in recording a timely video of the event. A few times, upon being notified of the motion, I checked the recorded video and the recording had nothing interesting on it. I tested walking in front of the skybell a couple of times, got notified immediately as expected, but upon checking what it had recorded, again, I was not on the video. Somehow the thumbnail of the video did show me on it. To make this worse, the iPhone app doesn't show in seconds the timing of the video so I can't tell for sure when that recording was actually taken, but I presume actual recording started at least 20 seconds too late.Finally, the device's integration with Nest is really not what I had hoped. Was expecting to see the Skybell video show up on my Nest app (so all my cameras would be in one place/app), but instead, the feature is about the skybell initiating recording of the video from my nest cams in the skybell cloud and app. Not very useful for me given my Nest cams are always cloud recording. I haven't spent any time testing this advanced feature given I was too busy trying to get the basics to work reliably.As a reference, my internet speed reliably clocks at 191 Mbps download and 11Mbps upload, which is quite high. I also have a couple of Nest cams which work really well without any special router tuning or special setup. Obviously I tried disabling the Nest cams to minimize network contention and see if that would make the Skybell work more reliably, but that didn't seem to make any measurable difference.I'll either give Ring a try or just put a Nest cam on my porch along with an old style door chime button. Yes, I'd lose the phone notification upon button press, but at least the video would work well.
