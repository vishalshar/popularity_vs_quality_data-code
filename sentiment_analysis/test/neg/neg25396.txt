I had very high hopes for this product. On the very first hole I had a dropped stroke and had to edit. By the third hole, I got so tired of fumbling with trying to get the club to register a stroke I gave up and turned off Golf Tags. I love the GolfPadGPS app and I thought this would be a great enhancement. I have a Galaxy 6 and thought it would work better than some of the other reviews I had read. I was wrong! I have already started the return...
