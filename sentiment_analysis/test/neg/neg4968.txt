As of this review, the app that is available on the app store is not compatible with the iPhone 4S.  There are bugs that prevent the normal operation of the Thync and which Thync support says:  "Unfortunately, we are not planning on continuing to optimize our app for the 4S"Their work-around is to download a copy of their older version from Dropbox and install it using iTunes.  For those unfamiliar with this process, this is not a method that is either quick nor easy and has the implication that you have to disable automatic updates for your apps else it will just get overwritten again with the new broken version.  I believe that this would also affect being able to access all of the vibes, so I decided to just return the device.  When using it with my iPad, it worked, but the effect didn't impress me anyway.  I would get a better result splashing cold water on my face to wake up, or taking a warm bath if I want to relax.  I also wasn't very fond of the idea that I have to log in just to use the Thync device.  Having a plan where using the device is dependent on using a smart phone as the remote control is something that should be executed carefully and responsibly, neither of which I am witnessing as happening here.
