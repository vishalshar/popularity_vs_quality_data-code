IMPORTANT: READ BEFORE PURCHASINGI was excited by the idea of a home mesh wifi network and and the positive reviews.  I missed one very important point however, officially the Eero devices do not support VPN connections.I connect from my home office to my business network by way of a simple VPN connection.  After calling technical support I learned that this is a known issue.These devices I think would still be appropriate for individuals looking for a simple extended home wifi network.
