These were way too sweet for my taste. I always put off pills I need to swallow, so I prefer to buy my vitamins as gummies, but these are sugar coated and just too much for first thing in the morning. Also, you have to take 6 a day so it feels like you're eating a small bag of dummies for breakfast. Under the sugar, the taste was bright and not at all chemical or vitaminy. Just didn't feel "healthy" though, adding that much sugar daily. I'd prefer to save those sugar grams for an actual daily treat.
