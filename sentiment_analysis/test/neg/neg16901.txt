Tracker looks nice but does have a lot of syncing issues.  Most days it is fine but sometimes it is a battle to get it to work.  Overall, the app could use some work.  They have had some useful updates recently but it would be nice to have some more detail with the sleep tracker and possibly a place to record food and exercise.Update: Has gone from being ok to awful.  Sometimes does not track steps at all, used it alongside my husbands tracker and it is off by several THOUSAND steps.  I have submitted several requests to Bellabeat for support and have heard nothing.  I've given up wearing it and apparently the return policy on it has now changed from 90 days to 30 days overnight....
