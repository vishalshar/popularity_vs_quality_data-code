I ordered these bulbs because of the "Works with Alexa" tagline in the product description, while Alexa is able to discover the devices they frequently show as "offline" and fail to respond to Alexa commands.The initial setup of 4 bulbs was tedious and time consuming. Each bulb starts with its own WiFi network. You have to associate your phone with each bulb and push your home WiFi settings to each separately. I was prompted to update firmware on each bulb during the setup. The Android application does a poor job informing the user about the status of the update, and I had to re-initiate it multiple times on a couple of bulbs.The android application has other serious UX issues. At one point I had two locations called "My Home," one with 3 bulbs and another with 1. I had to reset the lone bulb and re-provision it.The initial Alexa discovery found only two of the four bulbs. Restarting the bulbs and re-running the discovery eventually got them all working.Alexa was able to turn them all off that night, and turn them on the next morning. That night Alexa could only find two of the bulbs, the other two showed as "offline." Power-cycling the bulbs didn't restore them, but they worked after having Alexa forget them and re-discover.The next night, Alexa was able to turn on 3 of the 4 bulbs. I was able to get the 4th on via the phone app.Overall, the Alexa integration is very unstable and inconsistent. Do not get these bulbs if you intend to rely on controlling them via your Echo.
