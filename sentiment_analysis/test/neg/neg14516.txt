Seemed like a good idea - but doesn't work with any of the 3 android devices in the household.  All devices have new enough firmware 4.4.4 or higher (4.4.3 required) - app starts, connects, then immediately crashes.Cars are useless. Should have tested before giving as an xmas present to a now very disappointed kid.
