I love technology and it's advancement, so I really want technology to work. I so wanted Thync to work too. I often need a kick in the but to get going and it takes me a long while to wind down. I thought Thync might be benificial in both areas.It arrived in a beautiful box, the product itself feels good, the strips (the electrodes and leading lines) are packaged neatly and the main module itself comes with a nice pouch. Thync has certainly good all those things right. Well after paying this kind of cash one would assume everything about the product radiates quality, and yes it does!The introduction video and instructions are very clear, there is a guided exercise that is meant to help you get accustomed to the sensations and help you with the placement of the main module. This last part is essential to the proper working of the device.I've tried many different placements, often just a nudge to the left or a bit lower or higher.I surely felt the tingling and vibrating sensations the instructions described, but only when the few times I managed to place the main module exactly right (or close enough, or indeed completely incorrectly but resulting in the same kind of sensations).The times I did feel what I was supposed to feel, I noticed that my skin right under the module had turned reddish, like it was lightly burned. I assume I put the module to a setting that was too high. But any lower setting and I wouldn't feel the tingling or vibrations mentioned in the introduction AT ALL. The instructions CLEARLY state that using the device should never cause any pain or discomfort. So I'm not blaming the device or their makers. I'm just saying that turning it any lower, I would have felt absolutely nothing.When using a 'vibe' to energize me, the device did not put my brain in an energized mood. In the introduction session the voiceover says that 'during this phase many people feel like they want to move around" (or something along those lines. Never during any of the the energizing vibes I felt the need to move around, no fog was lifted from my brain, in fact I felt exactly the same as before starting the session, plus a slight reddish area on my right temple (the reddishness never caused me concern, it always disappeared after a short while).The relaxing vibes, had the same effect as the energizing vibes, that is to say: no effect at all.I really believe transcraneal electro stimulation can be benificial in many areas, but this device does not deliver what it promises even though I REALLY wanted it to work as advertised.Who knows I'm not susceptible enough, or indeed I never managed to place the main module correctly. Whichever it is, this, for me was a complete waste of money. Perhaps it will work for you.To be completely fair, the company offers skype sessions to help with placement of the module but I never felt comfortable enough to do one.
