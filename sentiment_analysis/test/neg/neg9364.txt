ive been using this product since august 13, and at times i would apply it 3 or 4 times a day to help with the itchiness.  however for my skin clearing up, it has not been helpful at all.  it does help with remove some flakiness of the psoriasis. ive only put 2 star because because it helps with itchiness, and im being very generous with the stars.
