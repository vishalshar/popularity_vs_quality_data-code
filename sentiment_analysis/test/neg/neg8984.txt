His cousins have them and they seem to work fine. Ours never worked--does not respond to hand commands or the iPhone app. I put it on the shelf for a few months as he was occupied with other gifts. We decided to try it again and it still didn't work.I contacted WowWee support and after some back-and-forth, they agreed to replace the unit even though it was slightly out of warranty. They had me break off an arm and send them a photo, then sent me out a replacement.Unfortunately the replacement had the same problem, as you can see in the attached video. I contacted WowWee support again and explained the problem, this time sending the video. They suggested I return it to Amazon, but unfortunately it was beyond the return period when I first contacted them. Lesson learned, return early and often.I'm particularly frustrated to get 2 duds in a row given all the positive reviews on Amazon.
