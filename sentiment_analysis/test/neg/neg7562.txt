Withings does weight management well. The Health Mate app does a good job of gathering all the necessary tools one would need to maintain their fitness goals. Unfortunately, the Activite is far from a flagship performance and reflects poorly on the company. We accept certain levels of uncertainty from accelerometers; this is why your Fitbit and iPhone won't agree on step counts. Sometimes, it's 1000-2000 steps, largely influenced by how you wore it and the types of activities you did. The Activite, on the other hand, seems to pick and choose when it wants to measure steps. On some days, step measurements underestimate by over 15000 (yes, I have a treadmill I walk on at home; it counted me at 20,000 steps along with my iPhone and Fitbit; this thing showed 4,000).It's a shame really, this is a sleek device, but the inconsistent activity measurement and display are not worth the bother. If you want to stick with the Withings environment, check out the Go, as it can be pocketed and in theory, should measure activity much better.
