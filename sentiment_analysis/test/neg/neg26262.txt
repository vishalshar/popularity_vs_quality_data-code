I wanted this device to work however it couldn't discern any type of temperature differential regularly. Looking at all the windows in my house either they are all equally perfectly insulated or the Seek isn't very good. None of the window showed non-linear temperature changes. This means you can't figure out where to insulate. I'm not sure what useful application this $200 devices serves for a homeowner. I tried it for window seals, wall insulation, attic insulation, and looking to see where the air in my house any circulating creating cold spots.  I was unsuccessful as going through the settings either the color gradient was too similar or the device was inconsistent.
