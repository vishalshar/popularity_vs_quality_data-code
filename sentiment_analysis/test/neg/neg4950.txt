My apartment has what I'd call standard carpets - they are not deep pile, shag, or anything fancy.  The Shru wiggled, squirmed and tried its best, but without any traction it just couldn't get anywhere.  So I moved Shru around to new locations keep things interesting since it couldn't roll on its own.  Tucked it in a cat tunnel, under a box, and other places of good hunting.At first my cat appreciated some freshly trapped prey; he pounced it twice on the first day.  But very quickly, he became bored.  The Shru would obediently do its best to entice my kitty into yet another round of play time, only to get scornful glares.  Those two pounces were the start and end of what I had hoped would be a great companionship.I did try this on some linoleum flooring as well; we have two small sections (approx 4' x 6' each) in my apartment.  It was very, very loud!  So loud, you could not hear the chirps it was trying to make.  A clattering of hard plastic mixed with the loud buzz of the motor.  Cat did not approve, not at all!  Ears flat, he immediately walked away upon seeing/hearing Shru on linoleum.  Did not even care that it was now a nice rolling target.It is entirely possible that the Shru just isn't good for us apartment dwellers, so I don't want to judge it too harshly.  The app did work, and the AI did act out in the expected manner based on the various settings.  The sounds are extremely cute and made my cat's ears perk up.  But if the toy is not played with (or at least stared at with some interest), then it's just not worth the luxury price tag.The idea is pretty awesome, and I think can be improved upon.  For example, a silicone coating on the hard plastic shell could potentially be helpful.  It would reduce the clattering noise on harder floors while providing friction for improved rolling on carpets.  Covering the Shru's body with real fur or leather could similarly improve grip and manage noise, while also adding a scent element to attract kitties.  Or perhaps giving it a lumpy-bumpy surface so that when it rolls the ridges can help move it forward (kinda like how dirt bike tires are lumpy).Though far less important, I was personally frustrated by how difficult it was to tell if Shru was on or off.  This was especially hard when I used the app to disable the chirping sounds to see if my cat would like that setup better.  Turning off the general sounds means you get no chime telling you when it has been turned on.  So you have to move the Shru and see if it responds after trying to turn it off or on... which can take longer than expected while set to Scaredy.I returned mine after 4 days of trying the different settings and getting nowhere, literally... and with its feathers still fully intact.  That is how little attention my kitty gave this toy.  I swear, based on the baneful look in his eyes, if he could have given 'the bird' to the Shru, he would have!
