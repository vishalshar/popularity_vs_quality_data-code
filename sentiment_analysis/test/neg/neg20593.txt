The MiP robot is very hard to get used to with the hand motions.  After the first 30 minutes of frustration it stopped auto balancing and was very hard to control.  It is gaged more to the ipad. If you have an Android you need a specific software rev to down load the app.  It is not compatible with the kindle fire which is what I have.  This was a Christmas present for my son from his grandparents and he has not touched it in 2 weeks due to the difficulty of use.  Do your research before you purchase.
