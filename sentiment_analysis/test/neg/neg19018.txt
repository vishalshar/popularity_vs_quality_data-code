Not impressed with the claimed fit of the Phantom 4. The motors stick well above the top where the drone sites so when you close the bag there is pressure on these motors. It includes little covers to put over them, but if one falls off you are risking damage to your quick connects etc. No way would I trust this fit. Too bad since the bag looks to be pretty nice
