I'd give this product 6 stars if I could. .great 20$ I've ever spent. .sounds crazy to be so excited over a product for a toilet but it is soooooo nice not having to put on a light in the middle of the night to use the bathroom plus it's just really cool looking..only complaint is the auction cups don't really hold well I have to keep putting it back on. .but love the product so much otherwise that I'm not letting that affect my rating.UPDATE. .I had to lower to 3 stars..while I love this product and the lights work well.the section cups are weak and it falls off every day multiple time..I used a hot glue gun to keep it on and hopefully this will work.manufacturer should make this a clip on type of device and would be a 5 star product!UPDATE. .hot glue gun worked temporarily. .keeps falling off..this product needs a clip on feature. .could be such a great product but the suction cups are running the whole thing. .2 stars now..what good are the lights when the thing falls on the floor every few hours
