We are very disappointed with this product.  I almost never leave reviews, but am moved to leave a negative review for this device to compensate for the months of frustration and the hours of time we wasted on trying to make it work.I was originally very enthusiastic about the Whistle.  We have a 45-pound, active 2-year-old mutt, and we wanted to make sure that she gets at least 2 hours of exercise per day.  We also rely on a couple of dog walkers and wanted to make sure they did their job.  Initially, the Whistle worked well and we were pleased.  However, after a couple of months, it began having issues synching with my phone, finding our home wifi, and seemed to undercount the amount of time my dog was active (i.e. I would take the dog out for an hour-long, 3-mile walk and the Whistle would register about 10 minutes of activities, or it would miss entire walks).  The performance of the Whistle gradually deteriorated until we no longer trusted its reports and it became virtually useless.We called customer service to complain.  They were unable to resolve the issue and sent us a new device.  We set it up again, and within days it had similar issues.  Within a month the transmitter on the new Whistle seemed to fail and it did not update at all.  We tried charging it, did the soft reset and the factory reset, restarted our app and our phones.  Nothing helped.Whistle sent us yet another device.  And this one conked out in 4 weeks with exactly the same issue as the second Whistle.  Although the device seems to be charging correctly, it does not send any updates to my phone.  No amount of soft or factory reset would resolve the issue.  The device is now a purely decorative piece of jewelry on my dog's collar.  I'm frustrated and mystified.  My dog is under near constant supervision and does not roll on the ground or play rough or get into water, or do anything that might damage the Whistle.  She pretty much runs and walks and sleeps.  There is simply no reason for the Whistle to fail so frequently other than bad design and poor quality.The whole experience has been very frustrating and time-consuming.  Although sympathetic, the Whistle customer representatives are not knowledgeable and do not generally offer useful information.  This device has a great concept, but I agree with other reviews that it is very clunky, poorly manufactured, and obviously not ready for primetime.
