This is not a shoe, it is  pair of shoe laces. At first, I thought this was the answer as the shoes went on easily using a shoe horn. However, the Hickies (although the name did raise some eyebrows and smiles) do not expand and contract well. After they expand, as you put the shoe on, they don't retract quickly enough and the shoe is loose for a while. Even while driving, my foot tended to stretch the Hickies as I pushed the accelerator and when I get out the shoe was loose until it "worked" itself tighter. Also, they break after a short while and I found myself carrying an extra one in my wallet. I had purchased a pair of regular elastic shoe laces with a lock and find them to be much better than the Hickies.
