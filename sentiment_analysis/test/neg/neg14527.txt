seriously it's a nice try, it doesn't make your back straight. what really bothers me is that they are charge you a big money ( the cost of making is only 5usd)  to take advantage of those office worker who has back problem. The real solution to solve your back problem is correct excise and massage. There massager you can get out in the market for less than 100 that will help your back mussle from stress and pain.
