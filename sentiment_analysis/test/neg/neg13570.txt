The ThinOptic glasses didn't stay on my nose.  Not even 10 seconds no matter how you positioned.They pull up and fall off and if lean forward slightly gravity will do most of the work for it even faster.  I let others try it and results were all the same.  Plus I opened the brand new packaging and there was a quarter inch scratch on the lens - seems quality check missed this one.Sorry if product seems interesting to you but save your money for normal readers.
