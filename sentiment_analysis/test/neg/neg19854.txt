As someone who has recommended this product to three people I can no longer do so because of the lack of communication and dishonesty with the speakers supported features. Early last year we were promised an update that would allow us to pair more then one speaker together (two total) that would allow us a stereo function or a dual function. After several delays bringing the XL product line to the market, we were then told that the update would be pushed to late 2015. After Nov/Dec had come and gone with no update, I later check the website and they are now excluding the "old" model in favor of the XL unit to get the update. Also, it appears that the community forum has been taken offline at the time of this review.

It makes you seem incompetent.I was happy with this product until I found out about the lack of support for the non XL model. I will not be purchasing a product from Fugoo again unless it has all the features I want at launch. Very disappointing.
