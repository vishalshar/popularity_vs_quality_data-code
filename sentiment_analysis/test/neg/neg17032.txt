I bought LightUp Tesla Kit (Bluetooth Edition) for my daughter as a Christmas gift for $96.  What a waste of money!  No instructions of any kind and no support from the company whatsoever!  I have 3 different Android devices (Galaxy S6, Galaxy Tab E and Galaxy Tab 4 7-inch), but the app (which is still in beta version) installs only on the first 2 devices and still doesn't work on either of them.  Just a black screen after opening the app.  I wish I could give it 0 stars. Such a rip-off... Don't buy it.
