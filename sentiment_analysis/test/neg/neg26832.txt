I just bought a new bigger iPhone 6 plus. I loved my previous Rokform case for the 5s. I bike, I drive for Uber and I have the clip for when I go to the gym. I have all the Rockford attachments so it only made sense to go for the 6 plus Rokform case. I took a risk after reading the questionable reviews about this case.Unfortunately, all the bad reviews are true :( The rubber edge started peeling apart about a week after I bought it! I bought the clear because for some reason it looked more sturdy than the colors. I also noticed that the suction mount for my car doesn't work as well. It is very loose when attached, so much that it jiggles and rattles over bumps. I won't even try it on my bike because Id be scared of loosing my cell phone.Its such a shame since this case is NOT cheap and the previous Rokform cases are so awesome. Im considering going back to my 5s only because of how much better it worked for all my uses. ALSO, my new 6 Plus case will completely fall apart in about a week I'm guessing. Ill try for a refund since i have never dropped it or wrecked it in anyway. The other reviewers are telling the truth about this...I won't buy anymore rokform cases.
