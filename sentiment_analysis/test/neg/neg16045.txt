I bought this with high expectations because it does say on their website that this battery will fully charge an iPhone 4 times. However, off a full charge I found that it will only charge my iPhone one time. On the other hand, it is rugged and seems to be water resistant as advertised, but if you prefer a longer battery life, buy something else.
