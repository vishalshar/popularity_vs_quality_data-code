But I have to disconnect power to the clock every day when I come home from work to reconnect the the clock.  The three buttons randomly stop working usually after about a day.  They need help with the app, more ambient sounds, and better built in alarms.  But I do love the HomeKit integration when it works.  Seems as though they are just trying to add every feature possible to sell the product and not getting the bugs flushed out..  disappointed
