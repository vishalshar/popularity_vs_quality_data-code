First off, I was able to get it onto my network with no issue. When I placed my iPad and Android devices near it, it did connect,but my wifi showed two connections, one open and one that looked secured with a similar name. However, when I tried to connect to the secured one, it would not let me, kept saying it could not authenticate my password and I was not given a default password in the documentation. When I connected to the open signal, I launched a browser thinking I can manually enter my info, as per the instructions, but it did not let me enter anything, it never connected to any login page that the instructions said it would. So after an hour of knocking my head around, I called the tech support number in the manual for customer service. The person on the other end of line answered the phone as if it was a freind that was calling with a simple "Hello" and I had to ask a few times if this was a wrong number of if it was the actual company. At that point, when I asked if this is indeed Keewifi company and that I had some questions, the person on the other line said nothing other then, "Yeah, go ahead".Sorry, once I heard that I said forget it. Seems unprofessional people run this company, extremely unprofessional! I did not feel comfortable giving information to them about my issue or if they asked me any questions.
