The bottle is HUGE so I thought it should last me a long time, but no. Since the dosage is 6 gummies per day, my fiance will blast through this bottle in 15 days. My other gummy multivitamins' dosage is 2 per day at the same total cost, which will supply us for 37 days. So at the end of the day SmartyPants is more than DOUBLE the price of my One a day vitamins.
