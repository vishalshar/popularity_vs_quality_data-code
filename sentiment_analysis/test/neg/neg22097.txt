I thought that these bags would be a great idea.  I bought to use with the wedges of Parmesan cheese that I buy and later cut off to eat.  The wedges are large and I have had the problem with the cheese developing a black mold in my refrigerator.  I though that these bags would be the solution to my problem.  Unfortunately they were not.  My cheese (a new wedge) has just as much mold as the previous cheese that I had wrapped in saran wrap.  The bags are high quality, they are of sufficient size, but unfortunately for me they did not solve my problem.
