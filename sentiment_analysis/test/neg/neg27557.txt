I've had these readers for several months and have been happy with them UNTIL I NOTICED MAJOR LENS SCRATCHING. This scratching is apparently caused from sliding the readers in and out of the case, since I have been very careful with them otherwise.The case is one of the features that makes the readers such a great product. So they are going to have to fix the scratching by lining the case or hardening the lenses.Would love to recommend this product, but not until they fix this problem.
