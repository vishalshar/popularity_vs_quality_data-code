I bought this for my sister who loves fresh grown herbs but does not have a green thumb.  We though this would be perfect for her.  I helped her set it up.  The plants started to grow but within a few days they seemed moldy.  After about 1 month, they stopped growing.  We tried the basil and it has no flavor at all.  They dont have any smell of what they are suppose to be and still have what appears to be mold.  I bought extra cartridges as well but wont be using them.  This product doesnt work at all.
