Was excited about this.  A lot of strong features that made it stand out in a quickly crowding field.  However, I was concerned as the energy pack does not come with the Pod, and it seems like a lot of the specific features it advertises (being able to turn off a specific device, receiving alerts if someone turns on a tv (or some other device), "Presence Simulator", robbery prevention) depend upon having one of those.  Okay if I have to buy an add on I guess (although that adds to the cost obviously), but even though the system has been out for a few years, there is no POD for the US, and you can't even order a European one anywhere (the only store that carries them according to the Wattio website is in Spain and does not ship US).  I did receive because I went ahead and ordered while waiting for a response from Wattio customer care about getting a Pod (had thought they could direct me to where I could get one, but instead informed me that they hoped to have a Universal one out sometime in early 2016). So debating on whether I want to keep it for the other features or return it and pick up a 2nd gen Nest.  This looks like it'd be a great device if I was in Europe, but for being in the states unless I am mistaken about the PODs role in the special features, it feels very crippled. And with no US presence at all, I'm a little concerned as well about support.UPDATE:  Cannot even set up an account online necessary to use the device.  First of all, the literature directs you to a website to download the manual, but that page is a 404 (no longer there).  But I was able to find Manuals on the Wattio website. But after going through the whole registration I had to log back on and it says "Incorrect Username or Password." After trying again, I reset the password. Tried that 5 times. Then I saw that they sent an email and I had to click a link on that to complete the registration (not mentioned during the initial process).  THEN the page would not work until I install Silverlight on my Mac. there is a link right on the page, but it doesn't work. So I went to google and got the Silverlight plugin manually. But even after installing, reload my browser (chrome) and Wattio site still says i don't have Silverlight. So as of now, I've spent at least 30 minutes just trying to get online (the time it says it takes most people to install everything) and nowhere.  Not for US I guess.
