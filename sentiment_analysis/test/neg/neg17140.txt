Not bad for the price, but not great either. This is my first android phone, and, coming from a Windows Phone, I absolutely love the OS and app selection. However, the phone seems to lag quite often just bouncing between common apps like Instagram, snapchat, and messaging. I don't do any gaming really or graphics processing, so I can't say anything about how it would handle that.Camera takes great pictures if it's on a tripod, but it's almost impossible to get a good, perfectly focused picture while holding it in your hand. Same applies to the front facing camera.The fingerprint reader location was initially odd, but I got used to it very quickly, and it actually works pretty well, but rarely on the first try (at least with the case on, I haven't tried it without the case on).The case that comes with the phone isn't bad at all - it's a very low profile silicone case with minimal protection, but it adds some grip to the phone. I don't believe there are any other cases available for this phone.BOTTOM LINE:I've had the phone for a few months now, and I'm itching to upgrade to something that runs smoother and faster. If this is your max budget, buy this phone for sure, but I would recommend spending more for a faster phone with a nicer camera if that's important to you.
