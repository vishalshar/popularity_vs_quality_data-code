Not adjustable at all. I have a 05 Toyota Sienna and the CD player is at the top near a 45 degree angle. When the mount is inserted, I cannot use my phone for navigation at all because I can't see the screen. This product needs to go back to the drawing board and be re-designed and re-released. Simplicity is sometimes not the best way.
