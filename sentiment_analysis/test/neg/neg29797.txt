I just opened this bottle last night and when I sniffed the oil it had a rancid smell. This bottle was purchased in July and stored in a kitchen cupboard with my other oils, this is disappointing I had hoped to find a grapeseed oil that would have a longer shelf life than oil bought at a grocery store.
