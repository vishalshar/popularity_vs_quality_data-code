I had been SO excited about this and thoroughly enjoyed it for about 3 weeks when it suddenly stopped functioning. I had read about this issue happening to others, but like most, assumed it wouldn't happen to me. For the past three weeks I have been contacting their customer support via the app and their website and have heard nothing. I checked their Facebook page and the last posting was from November 2015. I am extremely disappointed in this product and their service.
