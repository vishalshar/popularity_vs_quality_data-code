This is my 2nd robo 3d r1.  The first one the wiring burnt up within a week.  They don't tell you about the cost of returning these to them.  $130.  This one won't load the filament no matter what I do.  It appears as though the nozzle is jammed up and I haven't used it yet.  It is supposed to be a brand new printer but appears to be a refurbished one.  I am thoroughly disappointed with Robo 3d printers.  Don't believe I will ever buy another in the future and surely won't recommend one.
