I've been using dermaflage for the past 3 years  The product was not like in the past.  The first time I used dermaflage it lasted for more than 3 days.  The syringes with the green lable were the best. I don't know what they did differently but it doesn't last 3 days anymore and doesn't dry after 2-3 mins.  I have to end up applying new one everyday now.  I'm lucky I don't have alot to cover but a small area, otherwise I wouldn't bother to use it.  Hopefully the product can be better in the future, because many ppl can use it to help boost their confident.
