Nice phablet but problems.1. When plugging in the L640 into a Windows 10 OS computer the driver did not install correctly.  The driver(s) (or any type of software) for the L640 is not available on the Posh site.  From the Posh Mobile site: "Visit this page to download the latest versions of product software".  The page states "Updated May 2016", "Coming Soon".  A net search indicates that the driver(s) are not available anywhere on-line.2. No support phone number.3. The Posh Mobile site states that the manual for the L640 is available for download on the L640 page. It's not there.Overall, a very nice phablet, as long as you don't  need support or downloads from the Posh Mobile site or would like to call a support line.  They are non-existent.
