I was very excited about the potential of this machine - aluminum lid and top palm area - i7 CPU, dedicated GPU and a 1080P screen - what could go wrong?  As it turns out - this machine compromises too much in the interest of cost savings.While this machine is handsome and seemingly capable with a great back-lit keyboard and very nice fit and finish, the performance of the 960M leaves something to be desired and now is really overshadowed by the current 10 series. It isn't bad - but it's not as much performance as I was hoping for or really needed to run current titles.The screen is the biggest issue with this machine - it has a terrible vertical viewing angle and the color accuracy is not great. It lacks shadow detail and is truly just awful overall.  It has no redeeming qualities at all, the viewing angle is so bad you cannot get in a position that maintains proper contract across the entire panel - the top or bottom of the screen is always blown our or too dark too see. Totally unacceptable.The speakers are disappointing as well - not very loud or very clear.With a proper screen/speaker combo - this laptop would have impressed much more especially for gaming.The track pad is another weak spot - it's typical integrated buttons mayhem with a mind of its own.The dual core processor also struggles with demanding games/tasks.This machine strives to be a sleeper gaming machine but really is a jack of all trades - master of none. It does not accomplish any of the things it sets out to do.  There are many better options in this segment.
