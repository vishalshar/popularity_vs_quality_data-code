I have had a fitbit for the past few years, it is falling apart and the fitbit UI is clumsy - so i thought i would try this.I am currently wearing both the Fitbit and the Ray for the past month.  Each day my Fitbit has between 1700-4000 more steps than the Ray.  My employer has bonuses for hitting daily step goals, so i am losing money with this device.  When i contacted Customer Service I was told Misfit is "more accurate" but they wanted me to send them screen shots as proof.  I did.  They have not responded.I do not recommend this.  The phone app is stupid - it doesn't focus on steps but on their "points" you set it for Low, Medium or High and then they tell you if you have reached that goal.  I just want to get my steps and go about my day with a device i dont have to recharge every 2 days.i will probably wear this until the batteries die and then recycle it.  Save your money.
