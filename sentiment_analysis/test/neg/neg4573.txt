I was very excited about these, and I was very pleased when they first came. Everyone agreed, they looked great.The first one snapped after about two weeks. Okay, a fluke, right? I replaced it. Then the next one snapped. Then another, and another. The entire package had been gone through within a month and a half. For nearly fifteen dollars, which is the price of a cheap pair of shoes in the first place, they should last at least as long as a pair of sneakers.Save your money. If you don't want to tie your laces, get some curly laces or something. Don't get these.
