This is a very poor product. What you are buying is a cardboard box that holds the disposable litter tray cartridge that you must buy for the "Automated System" to work.  Urine will soak through the bottom of the cardboard tray within 2 days and I have 1 cat! The company wants you to stir the litter around every day so the cat urine will soak up in the crystals. I bought this "Automated System" so I didnt have to tend to a litter box every day. I tried stiring the litter every day and urine still soaked through the bottom of the cardboard litter tray.  How pathetic! Maybe the system might be a little better if the trays were made out of plastic rather than cardboard??  Avoid this system all together.
