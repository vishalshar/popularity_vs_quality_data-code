Hard to know how to review this because I could not get it to work.  Kindle users be advised, you cannot get the necessary app to make this thing work from Amazon App Store.  You have to go through some process with your Kindle to enable it to download from Google App Store.  I understand doing this will void your Kindle warranty and possibly screw up your device.  I'd love to see the developers make the controlling application available on Amazon because I'd really like this thing to work.  As an aside, I'd give customer service 5 Stars.  They were very quick in responding to my emails and trying to show me how to make it work thru Google Apsps.
