My 10 yr old put the hardware together fine no problem.  That was a great experience.  The real problem is the system is very buggy.Piper will not launch.  I go online to trouble shoot and see 1000's of issues people are having.  Please be aware as a parent if youpurchase this computer you'll spend a lot of time troubleshooting software bugs.
