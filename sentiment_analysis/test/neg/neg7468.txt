This is a great but it suffers from a major flaw. It has the typical ball joint you see on similar products to adjust the viewing angle but there is no type of tensioner on the ball.  I've had it for less than a week and everytime I hit a speed bump or large pot hole the tablet points downward.  I only have a nexus 7, it doesn't weigh enough for this to happen.  I do drive a jeep though with a relatively tough suspension. But, this should not happen either way.
