I was excited to check out the Pencil stylus after it was recommended to me by a friend, and placed an order through Amazon (one of the many resellers selling the Pencil, and shipped directly by Amazon).The device arrived DOA, due to the battery not holding a charge.  When plugging it into a charger, the LED would occasionally hit green for a few seconds, then go back to orange (indicating that power was low).  When attempting to pair it with the Paper app, it would connect for a second or so and then lose the connection.No problem, I thought, the device comes with a 1-year warranty; I'll contact FiftyThree about service or a replacement.  However, I was told by FiftyThree that they WILL NOT honor their warranty if the product is purchased from anyone other than them directly, even if the product was purchased new.I would have expected a young company to do a better job of standing behind their products and supporting their early customers.  My experience has also made me question the overall quality of the product.  As other reviewers here have noted, there seems to be common issues with reliability, DOA devices, and so forth.Fortunately Amazon had no qualms about issuing a refund for the dead device, but I will not be getting another Pencil.  I've switched to the Adonit Jot Script Evernote edition, which works well, has a more pen-like tip, and a better feel overall IMO.So, if you decide you want to try the Pencil, by all means go for it.  But be aware that you should purchase directly from FiftyThree and that they will not stand by their products if you purchase them elsewhere.
