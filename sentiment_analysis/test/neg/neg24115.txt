Returning. the watch doesn't work as intended.  It sends updates to my iPhone occasionally; sometimes it's quick, other times it'll take hours.  Sometimes I don't get an email at all.  That all defeats the purpose of tracking my child's safety.  The watch form factor is great, the app GUI seems easy enough.  Couple of things I didn't like:-watch received was scratched on the face-no warranty card-battery life either lasted a full day or just a couple hoursThankful for amazom's returm policy And appreciate this company who definitely has something here, just hasn't matured.  I understand a new version is being released in October.  Hopefully, it gets those much needed improvements.
