Brilliant idea, poor execution, poor QC.  The parts work, but they will not attach to the board that you build on (the mounting board). The parts will pop right out of the board as soon as they are pushed in. Would rate this 4-5 stars if the pieces actually fit together. I'll give the company a couple of days to resolve, but no more. Nothing worse than Santa delivering a faulty gift. Really mad.
