The product developed a troublesome problem. My Samsung G5 just fits the width, with the top clamp offering more room. However, the upper portion loosens on the ride. You can almost hear it ratchet loose, a click or two at a time, requiring a tap to re-seat the phone. Mine dropped out 2x. I secured it with a rubber band at first, but one of those pony-tail ties would probably work long term. I'd suggest not riding without the added securement.
