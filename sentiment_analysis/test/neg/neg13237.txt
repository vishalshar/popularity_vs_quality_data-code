I bought this after it was recommended in Real Simple magazine and had high hopes...I read some reviews that said it didn't work but decided to take a shot. The app simply doesn't work. I couldn't even set up the clock to play my alarm because it all goes through your phone, and the app just crashes over and over again. I tried downloading and redownloading, upgrading my iOS, everything -- no luck. After a week of basically having a glorified lamp plugged next to my bed and still using my phone as an alarm, I am returning. Don't waste your time/money.
