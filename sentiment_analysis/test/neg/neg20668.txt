Now that Reebok is the Official apparel for for UFC, you guys need to try Reebok Performance Boxers.  Reeboks are less than half the prize and come in more colors.  Bottomline... Sheath Underwear 2 thumbs down. Bought a pair of Sheath's and sent them back.  If I had 3 thumbs I'd give Sheath more.  Rebook out performs and hands down a better value.  If you are looking at pricing, check out Champion Tech Briefs!!!  They even out perform Sheath, with about a 6 dollar price tag.  4 X Less!!!  Conclusion, do not buy Sheath Underwear.
