Of all the years I've ordered things on Amazon, I've actually never returned an item... Until I tried these Oco Wireless cameras. Granted, it was very easy to set up, and the image wasn't too bad, here are the reasons why I gave such a poor review:1. They're not wireless-- each unit has a 10ft USB charger that has to be used... so for me, mounting these was useless2. Night vision was terrible in my opinion3. The smart motion sensor isn't very smart... a small gust of wind would trigger the unit to record4. Often times the 10 second recordings would be too late, and I wouldn't get a glimpse of the motion5. Often, the app would shut down immediately after opening for some reason... I'd have to tap the icon another one or two times before the app would loadI'm sure it's a great product for other uses, it just didn't work for my needs. I opted for these because they had fairly good reviews and the price was reasonable. I opted for a better rated camera set, hopefully that will work!
