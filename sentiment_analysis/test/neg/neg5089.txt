This product does not come even close to the advertising for it.  It does a very poor job of counting steps and estimating distance walked.  My wife walks the same route every day and the Ray estimates the distance to be different by 1.5 to 2.5 miles different every time, and the average distance is generally 40-50% understated per our GPS.  When I called Misfit tech support I was informed that steps and distance may not be accurate so we should monitor the Misfit "points" instead.  Really??  The sleep monitor isn't accurate either as her "sleep time" per the Ray often includes her being up and in the shower in the morning.  The Misfit app is also a big disappointment, the "food monitor" doesn't allow you to enter in foods and track calories, you can only take pictures of the food.We had the device replaced once, and the same problems occurred.  The device is a nice piece of jewelry so my wife continues to use it, but we are very disappointed in the product.
