Maybe I got a lemon.  I really wanted this to work correctly for me but even though I tried several different configurations and speakers I could never get this to function correctly.First, the presentation, size, and overall look of this tiny projector are superb.  Unboxing you would think you are opening something from Apple or the like due to the high quality packaging and finish of the gadget.  The device was easy to configure and I was projecting on the wall in no time flat.Now the bad, try as I may I could not get any sound to come out of this device nor could I get it to properly connect to a speaker.  I see no options for it to bluetooth to a speaker (even though sold alongside a RIF6 bluetooth speaker which I bought as a package) but even connecting with the included cable I was unable to get any sound from multiple movie files and presentations.  I hooked it straight to my laptop and still nothing through the HDMI or the headphone style cable.I really want to hope that I just got a lemon but I'm not trying again.  There are a lot of options for small projectors and I'm going to try my luck with a different brand.
