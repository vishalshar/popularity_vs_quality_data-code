I was so excited to try this product which makes this hard to write.  I got it, read the instruction book, and let it charge while I slept.  I hated the app it asked me to use, so I used just tye flash with my normal picture taking app. Within about 15 minutes, it died.  I had to stop and charge it.  It happened every single time I needed to use it. I could use it makes 15 minutes and it just kept dying.  I am returning this and purchasing an umbrella light set.
