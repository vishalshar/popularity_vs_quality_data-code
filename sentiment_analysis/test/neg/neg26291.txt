I loved this camera when I first received it. It was great for watching my cat while I was away and since I travel quite a bit, I could keep an eye on him. I especially loved being able to play and talk to him to make sure he was happy and healthy.However, I've had this product for not even two months and the power cord on it is already broken. I can't charge it because it's the actual attachment in the camera backing. SO disappointing and there is no way to contact the seller to receive a new one. So I'm out $200 because of shoddy workmanship.
