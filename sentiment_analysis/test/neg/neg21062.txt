My dog LOVES Barkworthies antlers that I have purchased from a local store.  I ordered two more from Amazon hoping to get a better price on the same product.  The antlers I received are labeled "Large" but are SIGNIFICANTLY smaller than the ones from my local store, no more than 1/3 the size of what I'm used to.  They are so small that I do not feel safe giving them to my 55 lb dog.  I will upload a picture so you can see a comparison of the two antlers side by side.  Both are supposedly Barkworthies Large Elk Antlers.  I have purchased at least 6 similar antlers locally so I'm sure their size is not fluke.I recommend going up at least one to two sizes from what you would expect to need when ordering.
