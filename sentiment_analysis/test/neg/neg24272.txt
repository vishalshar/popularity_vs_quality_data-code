Packaging difficult to open but the kicker was when we could not remove the micro usb cable from the control unit after the initial charge.  I've plugged in and unplugged micro usb cables hundreds if not thousands of times and have never seen anything like this.  When we finally were able to get the cable out, the inner connector from the control unit came out as well which means it will no longer charge. Manufacturer may want to get in touch with some mobile phone companies to see how to properly design a male/female micro-usb connector.
