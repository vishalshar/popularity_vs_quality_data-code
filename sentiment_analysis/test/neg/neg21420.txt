If you are looking for the most basic projector available then this is for you. Way over priced for what you don't get. Especially if you're a Iphone user. You need additional adapters. You need additional sound because the built in speaker is horrible. Nothing is wireless on it so you have to deal with keeping everything close together with wires all over the place and on top of that if you get more than 3 foot way from the wall the picture quality degrades excessively so plan on having extension cords available. Overall horrible. I would not recommend and would not buy again.
