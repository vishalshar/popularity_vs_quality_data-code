Im giving this 2-stars because the screen "works", however the glass was separating from the frame on day one.  The only thing holding it together is my phone case honestly.This is my second purchase from this company, I hadn't realized my last replacement screen was from them as well until I looked at my history (same problem).For 100+ dollars have apple replace the screen with an authentic screen.  Or save money and buy a shameless Chinese copy.
