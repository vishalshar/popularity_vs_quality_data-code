Great Product........if it worked. Seriously 0 product testing. I thought I had a defective unit it works so inconsistently. Ive replaced 3 units and just accepted the fact that this is bad product. Then the batteries in the lock died without warning. Good thing I knew this product was horrible and keep a spare key hidden. August, do a recall, then product test in a household. I am sure if you do a recall, August will go bankrupt, but who cleared this product to the go the field? This system is not reliable and could really be a dangerous product if you don't have the old school key handy.
