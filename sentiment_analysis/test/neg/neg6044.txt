Unfortunately, these did not work as I had hoped for them to work for my son.  He does not appreciate the habit of tying his shoes at the age of 11 and I thought these would be an excellent answer to my frustration with that.  However, the HICKIES disappeared one by one, slowly but surely.  While I would think my son could have been the culprit, I was witness to them suddenly being gone, without notice...and to them being found, on the school sidewalk (maybe not his), in the car floorboard, in the house, where they had popped off here and there.  While he wasn't a fan of them because he felt they fit too snug across his feet, he didn't mind them and they all disappeared off the same shoe, which was interesting.  Yet he still wore it...until it was down to only 1.  The other shoe still had the full set.  So, he wasn't the one popping them off. My high hopes for this product were a little too high.  Back to shoelaces.
