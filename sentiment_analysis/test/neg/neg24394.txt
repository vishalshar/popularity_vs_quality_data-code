Complete knock off. We have the original Adult version and this is NOT authentic.1. Though the box is the same size, the authentic box has a nicer smooth matte finish and the fake is a corrugated box with shiny cheap print.2. The authentic cards are made in the USA, the fake is from China {this is found on the back of the box}.3. There are some serious raunchy cards in the authentic and super lame, child appropriate in the fake. Majority of the fake cards could be played in my daughters 3rd grade classroom.4.  The cards are a different size with the authentic being larger and perfect print, the fake is smaller with print that is not bold/rubbed off.Though I realize this is just first-world problems, it's a disappointment  that we can't feel confident purchasing on Amazon.
