*** update, wifi connectivity completely stopped working. ***Completely unreliable.IOS App - The app has a difficult time connecting to the device.  It inaccurately reports device status (on/off) and won't allow me to toggle the switch remotely.  I have to manually unplug/plug the device when this happens.Timer - The timer beats to its own drum.  I setup a timer to run from 9 am to 5 pm, but the device turned itself on at midnight.Setup - Better than the other D-Link "home" devices, but it requires it's own app.D-Link has a different app for each "home" device.  None of them work.  It's a complete mess.  Switching to Belkin.
