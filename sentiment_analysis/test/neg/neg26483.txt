Disappointed:( really wanted this product to work... Tempted to buy again to see if it was a one time flaw but after reading other reviews maybe there is a bigger issue. What specifically is the issue? The thermos lid doesn't attach! Typically I fill with hot water first and then fill with the hot food. I tried to do this but I ended up with boiling water all over my feet, pants and floor! Thank goodness my tot wasn't running around at my feet like normal!! First I assumed I didn't seal the lid tight enough or didn't line up the threads. Which led to hot pasta all over the floor...I must be a slow learner because I tried getting it to work numerous more times with no success ( this time with cold water). In the end I couldn't take the safety risk of potential having hot food all over my child... Bummed I couldn't get it to work and that I delayed too long to return. Ug.
