Bought this bag for travel. It's somewhat difficult to use as the top flap serves no purpose and is difficult to work the clip with one hand. It doesn't serve a purpose because there is also a zipper that closes the main compartment. Inside, there is one large compartment, no separations, with 3 small pockets for smaller items, one with a zipper. The shoulder strap is comfortable, but the cell phone pocket is too small. I travel with an iphone 6 with a mophie and the pocket is too small. Overall, I think there are better options.
