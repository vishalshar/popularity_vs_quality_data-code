I'm having this issue on any print I've done, to include some test ones from the new matter store, I can provide pictures or video upon request, even though it probably won't be needed. Any straight line around the edge of my prints come out extremely bumpy. It's only on the first 3 layers or so and it creates skipping, which in turn makes the bumps worse. After the first 3 layers it's created enough heat to level the printout and in turn, the skipping/bumps stop. But the bottom 3 layers remain bumpy around all the edges.This is getting beyond frustrating! It seems every time I turn around there's a new issue with this printer. I won't be recommending it to anyone and now I will be in the market for a new one. I'm tired of getting the "firmware" excuse. At some point in time, you need to go ahead and realize you've made a sub-par product.If it's not one thing it's another with you guys. My prints stopping mid print, prints "skipping", the extruder nozzle digging into the build plate, which I still haven't received the replacement I was told you were mailing to me 3 weeks ago, and now, the new found issue of, "bumpy" edges at the base, which no matter what I do I can't get rid of without the use of a Dremmel...Buyer beware, read through the forums before you purchase this, and if you already have it I'm sorry you're going through the frustrations all MOD-t owners are going through, and have been for as far back as you can read.The replies to this same post in the MOD-t forum I made are attached as well as pictures to show the number of failed prints. The failed print on the build plate actually has the extruded nozzle stuck to it and dug in.
