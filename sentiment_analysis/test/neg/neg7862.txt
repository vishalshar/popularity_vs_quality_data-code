When my mother began having problems with her cell phone and wanted something simpler, she began noticing all of the GreatCall advertisements.  She thought that it would be very simple to use and make her life easier.  After signing up for the service which cost much more than it was advertised she found that the phone, while simple, was not intuitive as it originally seemed.  There was no way to set alarms, so you had to opt in for a medication management service that would call and bug you to take your medicine.  The support was atrocious and they were not friendly.  On top of it, the phone stopped working in the first week.  Their technical support didn't even try to help, but instead tried to sell another phone.
