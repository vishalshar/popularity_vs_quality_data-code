Originally I really liked these.  Probably 5 stars.  But after a few weeks of use, I noticed that one of the nose pads/sping/flap things was gone, so wearing, and especially adjusting them was uncomfortable.  I planned to return, but had not yet got around to it, then I used them today, and the wire bridge broke under normal use conditions.I've reached out to the company, per their 90 warranty, and "Free lifetime guarantee", not sure of the difference between these two.The fit and finish of these was nice, an having a pair of reading handy most of the time was very nice (fits nicely in any pocket in the case credit card sized case.)  It would be nice if they came in a few more reading strengths.  I'd like a 1.0 or 1.25, but am using the 1.5, a tad stronger than I like.I'll update my review once I see how they handle the quality issue.  But I'd sure rather have a pair that just didn't fail, vs. one that fails but has a guarantee.  I value my time and returning products generally annoys me.
