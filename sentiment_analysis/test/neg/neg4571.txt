I recently got hickies when I broke my wrist and could not tie my shoes.  When I got them they were way too tight for a foot that wasn't narrow.. I read in the guides they would loosen up. However by the time they loosen up I wouldn't have any blood circulating in my feet.  Unless you have a narrow foot, I would not recommend this product.
