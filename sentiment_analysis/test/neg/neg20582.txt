Very high quality filament. Some of the best on the market. I used 2 roles to print out a working RC P-38 model for a friend. Prints very clear with little to no stringing or warping on blue painters tape at 230c. So why only 2 stars? Price! Very expensive filament. $70 per kilo when you can get just as good of quality at just $30 - $42 per kilo.....I wont mention those manufactures since they dont sell here on Amazon, but do some research. This kind of quality is out there from US based companies at nearly half the price or better. I screwed up by not noticing these roles are only 500g.
