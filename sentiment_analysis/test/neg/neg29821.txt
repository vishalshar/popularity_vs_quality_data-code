Being very careful in taking care of my brushes, I was very disappointed to discover that these brush guards are making more harm than good to my expensive Shu Uemuras. I carefully push the bottom in, store them in my travel pouch, only to find them ruining the outer bristles of all my brushes! =( I have thrown these in the trash.
