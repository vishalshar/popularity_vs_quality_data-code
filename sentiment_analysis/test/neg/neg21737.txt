Waste of money; Not at all satisfied.I bought this item based on the reviews and this is one of the few times reviewers got it wrong. It's does not have a very firm grip inside the CD slot. It slides across the slot, making my phone flop around. I'm always having to adjust it.I thought the bracket would provide a snugger fit but that made it much worse. The instructions don't mention whether or not you should use the bracket for a looser or tighter fit. The bracket is impossible to remove.The snapping action of this thing is a joke. I usually have to remove the whole item from the slot to place my phone in it properly. It doesn't snap around my whole phone and it'll be lopsided unless I'm really careful.Keep looking, this isn't it.Phone: iPhone 6s PlusCar: Toyota Camry
