This device was not close to what I was hoping for. It arrives and the packaging was beautiful. Was really excited for this product.After getting it installed, which was easy, find out it doesn't work unless it was pretty bright in my house. Had to turn on more lights than I normally do. Secondly, I'm in a wheelchair and wear fingerless gloves all the time. Doesn't work with my gloves on.Then it's suppose to have similar functionality for the surround system that I have. Couldn't get past a certain muni unless I used the controller. Defeated that purpose.As I'm rambling...sorry just want you to know the troubles that I encountered.As advertised it's suppose to work with the lights I have and the nest thermostat....which it currently doesn't. According to their website they will be doing that in an update in the distant future.Lastly the devise is extremely sensitive. I even turned down the sensitivity. It still was "crazy" to control.Again this would have been a cool product if it would have worked to my liking. Epic failure.
