Butterer toast, man wearing skirt, make me a headache, no fork cup noodie, firework play, have a sreaw loose, the toiler of bursting, air leakage baskerball, mixed with mustard white bread and bear to drink milk are just some of the phrases you will be trying to guess if you buy this game.  Like others have said, this must be a cheap knock-off.  Sadly, I ordered this game before all the reviews were listed. The description says thier business focuses on quality.  I can't imagine on what they are focusing thier quality efforts. There are many, many duplicates of nonsensical phrases (at least 50%) The only enjoyment my family got from this game is trying to figure out what on earth the few phrases are supposed to be.  Well, I guess we should be happy that we got one night of laughs from it.  Also, no directions were included and gift was 2 months late-not worth the wait.
