No good. I had to return it by the third day of receiving it. I kept getting false alarms: I got an alarm during a night while my phone at bedside and the finder was downstairs, after 30 minutes of leaving the house and the phone and the finder were with me in the car.It alerted correctly onetime but after 10 minutes away of driving from the finder. I also tested with my daughter, let her ran far away but did not get the alarm at all. Very disappointed. I couldn't stand it so I disable the app by mid day of the second day and filed a return by the third day.
