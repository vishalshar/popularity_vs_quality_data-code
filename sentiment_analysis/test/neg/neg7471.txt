I purchased the Mountek Snap+ because I've grown tired of the suction cup and adhesives that come with car docks. After reviewing other similar products and reading many reviews I took a chance on the Snap+ with its many promising features. The Mountek is well built, didn't feel cheaply made to me. It also installed easily in my '15 Ford Focus ST cd slot.The biggest seller for me was that it could hold a phablet. I've been using this mount with a Nexus 6 w/Seidio Dilex case for about 9 months. I initially sandwiched the metal inside the Dilex layers to see if it would hold, but although it did attach to the magnets my phone would slip very slowly as I drove. So after trying it like this a few times it seemed to work better in a portrait position but I prefer my phone be in landscape. Portrait view held out a lot better but eventually would slip. Afterwards, I opted to attach the metal insert to the outside of the Dilex case which did resolve a lot of the slippage issues I was having but introduced another problem or at least one I didn't notice before. So what started happening as I drove or hit small bumps is the ball joint/mount section would move down. The ball joint attachment does not have any way of tightening it in order to lock its position. In my book that is a major flaw because other mounts have this very simple function and how this mount can hold a small tablet is beyond me if it can't hold my Nexus 6. I'm still using it in my car because it does work for the most part and I was able to get it from dropping down by putting a small microfiber tower in between the ball joint. But I am looking for an alternative product which I'm hoping wont have this flaws or if Mountek fixes these issues I would buy that version.So before I finish this review I also think Mountek should of included the additional 3 magnets as an option for users to add to their mount if they wanted to further secure their device. Having to purchase them separately feel like nickel and diming.
