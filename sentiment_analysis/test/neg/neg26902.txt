The guitar has a great look and feel, and the pickup sound is amazing. The main issue I have is that is that the neck is not adjusted and I can never make it sound in tune. There is no trustroad you can adjust to octave better and the bridge has the 3 strings at the same high and lenght so again no chance to correct intonation there.
