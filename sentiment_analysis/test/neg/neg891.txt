Purchased this item along with company water sensor. The unit was extremely difficult to get up and running and ;the sound ;eaves a lot to be desired. I have th;e siren along with the sensor in my basement and find it very hard to hear from a different level even though it is set at its highest volume. During the set up period contacted support and was lucky to get agent AR004620 who spent the good part of 2 hrs with me via telephone. He was knowledgeable and patient. While both the water sensor and so call siren leave a lot to be desired the support was very good.
