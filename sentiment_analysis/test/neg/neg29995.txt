To start I have two other Withings products and they are great. (The scales and blood pressure monitor) The readings go straight to your phone.  I have had a Fitbit and enjoyed it so I was very excited when Withings had the Go. The swimming feature and the price helped also. The swim feature worked well. The sleep feature did not. It kept saying I took a nap when I did not. I went to a movie and it thought I was taking a nap. The step feature was always much less than my phone showed. With all of that said I believe Withings will figure out the bugs and make the changes necessary.
