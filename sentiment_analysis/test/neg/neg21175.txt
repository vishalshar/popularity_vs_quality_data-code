Marilyn will jump anywhere but here. If she wants to go she'll just go without jumping.  My advice is to keep the area and lower the height.  The. Height is the same regardless of area.  You need to keep the choice of area but lower the height on all of them.  My chihuahua mix is currently doing a lot better on the Piddle Place versus the Pet Loo.  My only criticism of Piddle Place is to increase the area.
