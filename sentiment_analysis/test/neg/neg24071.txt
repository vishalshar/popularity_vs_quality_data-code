After 6 months of service, the outdoor unit's batteries are being drained in 10-14 days. Netatmo's customer support is abysmal at best. E-mail responses are never returned. Or, if a response is received it's another question to me, which incurs further delays. How simple can it be to instruct a customer to return a defective unit for a replacement product? This is customer service 101, yet this company has failed miserably. I cannot recommend Netatmo at this time due to a defect in design with their outdoor unit and extremely poor customer service.Attached is a picture of what the outdoor unit starts doing after it chews through the batteries. Nothing will help this situation including new batteries, contact cleaner or a reset. This is a design defect and they know it.
