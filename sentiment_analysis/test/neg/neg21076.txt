I purchased a 3 pack of these.The tape holding them all together essentially destroyed the box I pulled out to use. It covers the pull tabs to release the cardboard, so when removed it just tore apart the cardboard sides.These ones don't come with a cover either. Just a trash bag to slide the used box into.Not worth the very minor savings when compared to the boxes with blue gel.
