Horrible horrible horrible! Bought this stupid thing to monito our pets as we will be leaving for the new year. It worked for 1 hour. It stopped connecting to the wifi. I disconnected to re-pair and it is now stuck at the solid yellow color! When I press for 3 secs it just turns off, it doesn't go to blinking and color change mode. There is absolutely no support to be found online and I called the number on their site and it just keeps sending me to voicemail. Worst product ever! Don't buy this product -- it will just let you down when you most need it! I am returning this as soon as we get back from our trip. Now we have to worry about our pets the entire time -- fantastic job pet cube!
