The socks don't match in length.  I tried matching short to short but every sock appears to be a different length.  I'm sure the seller would allow returns, but is it really worth buying packaging, labels, tape etc and then driving to a post office and then paying to ship 3 pairs of socks back?  Not for me.  I would recommend that you don't waste your time or money purchasing these socks
