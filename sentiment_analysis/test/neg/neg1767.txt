The Circuitscribe kind of works, some of the time anyways. The ink doesn't come out very smoothly, and it doesn't conduct most of the time. I did several experiments using printer paper, LEDs, and coin cell 3V batteries (1 - 3 at a time). Out of the 10 experiments, it only worked once. I don't know if I got a defective pen, if it's a bad product, or if I'm just not doing it right. Whatever the reason, I'm disappointed and out $20.
