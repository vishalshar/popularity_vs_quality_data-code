I am disappointed, frustrated, and upset!  I watched the getting started videos repeatedly and had no trouble syncing the Myo.  However, it has not responded to any of the gestures. I am hugely disappointed because I ordered it to wow the audience for a major presentation. It is totally useless! I contacted tech support via email as there is no phone number and they were super slow to respond and still have not offered to troubleshoot or information on returning it!!!!! The Myo and tech support in my experience was an epic failure! Until they get the kinks out and provide better tech support, buy a traditional presentation remote and save your money.
