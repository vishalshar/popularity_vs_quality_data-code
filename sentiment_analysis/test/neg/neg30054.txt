This device has promise, but it's not there as yet.  First, setup was very easy.  However, after connecting to my WiFi network, the network status of the device fluctuates among unreachable, remote, and stable.  My wifi router is this one: http://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-AC2350-Smart-Router/dp/B00MRVJY5C/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1449347590&sr=8-13&keywords=netgear.  So, it's no slouch when it comes to speed and stability. I have at least 3 Chromecasts and an Amazon Fire stick that working, and are very stable, using this router. I can stream anything without stutter, yet, this device cannot keep a strong connection.Next, I plugged in a USB hard drive and clicked on a video. The video size is about 220 MB.  It takes about 2 - 3 minutes to load.  After loading, I expected the video to play.  Instead, the software presented me with the share screen on my iPhone.  This is the screen that asks the user if they want to send something by email, Airdrop, etc.  If I tapped on a JPEG, then the image showed up on the phone screen.  So, if the software can show an still image, why doesn't it play a video instead of presenting me with options to share the video ? Also, if the scenario is really to share the video, why do you need to spend the time to load the video into memory just to send it by other means ? If I can't view a video, this device is not very useful to me.This device comes in two parts: The NextDrive itself and the AC plug.  It's a good design, but once you put the AC plug onto the NextDrive, it's very difficult, if not impossible to get off.  Thus, if you can;t get the AC off, then traveling with it is a bit difficult since the AC plug is not fold-able. Also, there is no Chromecast support.  You can't cast anything to your TV screen or a Chromecast Audio. In this day and age with large screen TVs, with some that are 4K capable, there is little excuse not to have the ability to cast media to a TV.  Lastly, customer support seems to be non-existent.  They don't seem to respond to emails.The idea for this product is good, but the execution is flawed.
