I just got my laptop yesterday but I believe there are some defects on it. First, I cannot fully charge my laptop to 100% and when the battery percentage reaches 95% it shows "not charging" and cannot be charged anymore. Second, there is a high pitched electric noise coming from this computer which is very annoying and irritating. The noise is not constant and do some random on/off pattern. Third, the number keyboard on right side is not working.  Last, the fan turns on and off at random moments even though I just stayed on the same page where no intensive processes are running. This also can be very annoying.So I was wondering if I can replace it for a new one and I felt very disappointed that I need to replace it because I'm in need of a laptop right now.
