Messy, drippy and hard to use. It spurts out of the tube and spills all over the place. Since it was too thin to adhere to a single finger, I had to  scoop it up from the sink and insert two or three fingers inside myself to "apply" internally. Even then, I don't feel it offered full coverage of the internal vaginal area.  I tried this several times to be fair, but gave up, finally, because jamming three fingers inside myself seems like a really effective way to cause a urinary tract infection. I guess it works well enough as an external lubricant, but hardly useful for the intended purpose. Appears odorless and nonstaining, but without disposable applicators, i won't try it again. While I appreciate the idea of a "green" product, I feel that  individual applicators are the only hygienic way to use an internal lubricant.
