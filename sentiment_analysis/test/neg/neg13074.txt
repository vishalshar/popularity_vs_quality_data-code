Unfortunately, 3 out of the 4 cars we have can't successfully make the jump better than 1 out of 5 times. Guardian is the only one that consistently makes it. The other 3 did at first but we have had multiple issues particularly with the starter cars (Skull and Ground Shock) that basically make them unplayable. Big Bang tries... but after the first several games with the jump it just can't muster the speed anymore to get over it (despite multiple cleanings). It's too bad because it is a super fun element of the game... I wouldn't mind if it is was 1 out of 2 or 3 fails per jumps but the current ratio is too much hassle. We will either need new cars or a fix or we'll be returning the jump section (along with the stater set unless customer service comes thru).
