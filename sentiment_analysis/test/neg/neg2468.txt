I was waiting weeks for this game and was so excited when it finally arrived...the box was completely smashed like a pancake, there are zero rules (like you have one minute to have your partner get as many cards and the first one to twenty wins...), no timer like advertised, so many of the cards are the same, AND soooo many cards are misspelled (sinight instead of sight, understangding, baskerball, etc)!!! There are so many other games like this that you shouldn't waste your money on this one!
