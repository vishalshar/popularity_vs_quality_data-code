UPDATE 12/26/16: After wearing this deodorant for several months, I noticed white residue in the armpits of many, many items of clothing. On some of the darker items, the residue won't come out, even after multiple washings. I discontinued wearing this about 4 months ago and still keep finding clothes with it on there. So frustrating! I really wanted to like this deodorant, but I can't wear something that's ruining my clothes.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I've been learning more and more about the dangers of toxic chemicals in my home and deodorant was one that always kept popping up at the top of the list.  I had tried another natural deodorant and hated it because it caused me to sweat too much and had little odor control.  I tried this one based on all the positive reviews and I've been very happy.  The odor control is almost as good as my synthetic deodorant and I do find it controls my sweating as well as the synthetic products.  Most days I can get by with only a morning application and that's even with walking on a treadmill desk at work and doing an evening exercise DVD.  I've only used it during the springtime so we'll see how it holds up in the Georgia summer heat, but I'm willing to do two applications a day if necessary for the health trade-off.  I thought I'd be a little weirded out by applying it with a stick and my fingers, but it's been fine.  I haven't had any reaction to it - no itching, rashes, etc.  I will definitely purchase this again when my first tub empties.
