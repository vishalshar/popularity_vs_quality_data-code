Don't believe the other reviews for this microwave.  The 700-Watt white compact is one of the least effective, least functional microwaves I've owned.To begin, it's LOUD.  Every time you hit that start button the oven lets out a mechanical groan/humming until it settles into a noise that somewhat resembles a normal microwave.  It really seems like this thing is straining hard to get going when you turn it on.For 700-watts, this thing is pretty weak.  Heating beverages, or reheating dishes takes nearly twice as long compared to similarly priced ovens.Lastly, the functionality...You cannot use the timer function and cook with the oven at the same time...Really?  I've never owned a microwave that couldn't do double duty, but this one can't and it's frustrating.  Also note that this oven does not stop beeping when you open the door.  To top it off, the buttons on the panel are mushy, hard to push and already displaying wear/damage after a week of use.The only thing decent about this thing is that it doesn't take up much space on the counter and looks ok.  For that it gets a star. Outside of that I would definitely not recommend buying this microwave.
