This is a terrible product. As many others have noted both here and in the Nextbit community forum, there are major issues with the sound and Wi-Fi. Want to stream video from Hulu or Netflix on high quality with no graininess? Not going to happen. Want to listen to Spotify or Pandora without having the audio get choppy and dependent on how you position the audio jack? Nope to that too. Think that the lowest audio setting isn't going to be loud enough to get you a stare on the subway or in a coffee shop? Not that either. Beside that, the Wi-Fi can be so slow that you can expect to wait up to 10 minutes to download a 25 MB app like Audible from the Google Play Store. This review doesn't even get into the other issues people have complained about regarding the slow camera that under-performs in low lighting and the random app crashes that overheats the back of the device.Hold on to your money and buy something without the shoddy craftsmanship, like an unlocked Nexus 5X or OnePlus 2 (both about $350). You'll save about $50 and get a charger with your phone too!P.S. I contacted Nextbit Help about the issues and their response was literally "Cool, well that stuff is beyond my paygrade :)". They simply don't care about you or any other consumer.
