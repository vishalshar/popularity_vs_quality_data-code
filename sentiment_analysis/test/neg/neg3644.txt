I was disappointed by how small these were.  I was expecting a sample size like what they sell at walmart, but these are much smaller.  It seems to be enough for one bowl of popcorn. So if you are shopping for these I recommend going to walmart where they sell lots of different flavors in an appropriately sized sample size (for $1.98) and in the full size.
