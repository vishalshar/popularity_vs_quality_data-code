While the shine 2 seems to be a viable piece of technology, The makers, decided to make it a different size than the original, which negates all of the accessories from that original. The clip that was delivered with the shine 2 is a terrible match for the product. the device falls out of the clip continually. I gave one top my wife, who gave up trying to use it in jazzercise, because she had to keep chasing it across the floor. Finally it fell out and was lost, while she was bowling. and that is barely more rigorous that walking. A very poor design, and a very poor thoughtless product integration! We wont be buying another. BTW/ no response at all from Misfit.
