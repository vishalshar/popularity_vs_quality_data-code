I've got a 3Doodler 2.0 first, purchased locally, which was complete junk (see customer reviews for 2.0 here on Amazon). Was able to return it and purchase a 3Doodler Create. All I can say is that this is probably the most frustrating technical/creative present I've ever purchased for my kids.I also own a 3D printer, so I have some idea about basic physics of plastic filament deposition modeling and thermal properties of various plastics. This pen doesn't take into account even basic physics of the extrusion process. Cold section of the nozzle feeding tube is too short, which puts the cold thermal break way too close to the feeding gear. Feeding is based on a worm gear, which is hardly adequate when used with hard plastics (e.g. PLA). Very little has been done to properly calibrate retraction (the part when the plastic is "sucked" back into the nozzle to prevent oozing). The results are rather underwhelming -- excessive oozing with Flex filament, large gaps in extrusion when stopping and starting again, almost guaranteed clogging when changing plastics and so on.The last straw that prompted me to return the pen was when on a plastic change the smaller segment of the plastic noodle that was already in the nozzle got melted at the tail end when being pushed by the new plastic noodle I fed from the back of the pen. The result was an unrecoverable clog, as the melted portion ended up being thicker than the nozzle would allow to feed forward and thicker than the opening of the feeding mechanism so it won't feed backwards either. As the extruder in this pen is not customer serviceable (the "service" opening is a joke), the result was a solid plug of plastic which is impossible to remove.You can say that my expectations were too high, but at the times when you can purchase a decent 3D printer for $300, I expected a little bit more from a $100 3D pen.
