The install was simple and everything worked from the smart phone however the positives end there. This unit is anything but smart. . With updates few and far between to the app lacks many features and does not respond to local weather as it is advertised. When the unit first arrived I noticed it missed a day of watering of my lawn; I was skeptical but thought maybe this was the smart watering. Then we had 2+ inches of rain that was in the forecast and the rain did fall. Thinking the unit would turn off and conserve water I was disheartened when the unit still ran the night of the ran and the following day after. The last straw was the past week the local weather has been over 90 degrees and the unit has turned on for 15 minutes per zone daily; my lawn is now brown and burnt. This is a great concept but with the lack of programming this is just another sprinkler control unit with smart phone access (the last update to the software occurred 2 months prior from the day this review is written). Save the money and buy a traditional unit with a rain sensor until major improvements are made.
