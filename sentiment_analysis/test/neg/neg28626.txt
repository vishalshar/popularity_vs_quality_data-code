We have had this lock for 7 months now. It is utter rubbish - do not waste your money.Installation was a breeze. If you have ever installed a deadbolt lock then you'll have no issues with this. As we were only replacing the back-end of the existing deadbolt, installation took all of 6 minutes.Initial setup of the app was also easy and flawless. Within 30 minutes total I had the lock working and behaving properly. The August Connect add-on made it so that we could check the status of the lock while away from the house.The problem started when we attempted to set up my wife's phone. My phone was still connected to the lock so it wouldn't allow her to set it up. So after temporarily disabling the Bluetooth on my phone, we got hers going.The issue now is that we like to have the lock engaged even while we're home. So my wife arrives home before I do and the door is locked after she enters. I get home but my phone cannot do a thing because her phone is still controlling the lock, thus I have to use my key or ring the bell for her to open it.This is a serious design flaw in my opinion.4/28/2016 Update------------------------Despite numerous software updates to the firmware as well as our phones, this lock is one expensive piece of garbage. It will not pair with my new Nexus 5X and there is no way to hard reset the lock.The Android software settings will not stick no matter what. By that I mean that when I set the lock to "Auto Unlock" when I arrive home, this setting will be in the "Off" position the next time I need to access the App or unlock the door.Garbage through and through.
