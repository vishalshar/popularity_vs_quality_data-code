Product worked for first couple of times I used it but after that the tackiness would only last for a couple of catches. I thought it was the gloves so I tried product on a different pair of gloves and it actually made them worse. For some reason it does not dry no matter how long I let it dry. Makes the gloves slippery because it does not dry and leaves residue on gloves and ball.
