The white and black ones arrive in a factory corrugated cardboard brown box, while the transparent one arrives packed in a larger fancy illustrated box that states "Coder MiP". The white one does not say "coder". Both are the same price and they are all listed as the same item but in a variation of colors. These are clearly not the same items, the transparent one has a ramp and rechargeable batteries while the white one does not. I find this extremely misleading advertising from Amazon, and i do not understand why these were not listed as different items. I am now in a position where the two children for whom I ordered the white ones will not have a "coder" function and ramps, while the other one will. Worst is that there is no link at all to contact the supplier to find out what the differences are. BE VERY CAREFUL when ordering them in the different colors as they are not the same thing. The packaging is not the same either. If you are giving this is a gift, you may want to avoid the white one with black trims.
