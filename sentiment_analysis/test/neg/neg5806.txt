5/5/16 Update: Moving down to 1-star from 2 starExtremely flaky and completely unreliable. I upgraded to the latest software (2.3.2) and it works at best 50% of the time. The rest of time it can't detect the transmitter even when it is immediately next to the USB dongle. Often it fails to lock and today someone accessed my computer when I was away. For such a device, it needs to be 100% reliable all time - Lock when I am not around and unlock when I am.==========================Flaky at best. It works great until it doesn't:1) It does not handle putting the computer to sleep at well at all. It can't detect the dongle after sleep and I reinserting the dongle multiple times does not help. Usually, only a restart does the trick. THe receiver on my wireless keyboard/mouse has no issues with putting the computer to sleep so I can't see why not this.2) Undocking my computer from the docking station also causes issues.If they fix these issues, I think it can be a great device but it's too inconsistent for something that needs to be consistent.
