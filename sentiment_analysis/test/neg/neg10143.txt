The one star is for the customer service. The product seems fine (looking at it -- not able to use because of the 1-star customer service). I just ordered two watches for Christmas travel. In order to activate these watches, you need to email customer service. They activate. I emailed yesterday and received no response. I also left a message on Facebook. No response. There is no phone number to reach anyone. My expectation is that if customer service must activate the phone, then they should be prepared to do so within 1-2 hours of purchase. I am boxing both watches up and sending them back to Amazon tomorrow.
