Bought this as a Christmas present - when it arrived, it looked like it had been previously returned as it was covered in scotch tape/wrapping paper remains on one side.  However, the reason for my one star is that it broke after about 40 minutes of use.  No where in the description does it say that this toy is basically good for 5 uses (as there are only 5 pages of map paper included) Nor does it mention that the app will try to photograph your maze and never in a million years come close to what you've made unless your maze could be completed by a toddler.  This should be valued at $12 - not $50.  If you're looking for a good one, check the Lego maze.
