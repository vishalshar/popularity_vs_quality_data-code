I like the idea of the Leaf but I am returning as it did not live up to the claims.  The bracelet is small and feels/looks cheap.  It does not securely clip on to clothes.  It constantly falls off. The affects how it measures sleep as it is laying on the bed every morning, not still attached to my clothes.  I was hoping for better cycle tracking (like temperature taking) but it only bases the info off of what you enter...there are free apps that do a better job with this feature.
