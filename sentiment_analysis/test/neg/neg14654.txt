I have been using thinoptics for two years, and used to tell everyone about them.  They do a great job, until they break.  I Have at least four broken pairs of Thinoptics.  Three of them have had one of the side nose pieces come off; while the will still work in a pinch, they are painful to the nose.  One of them had the glasses break in half.  I also had one fall out of the case and get lost somewhere.  On the plus side, they do work for quick reading (e.g. reading my phone or a menu), they are thin, and they usually stay on my nose (although they don't work too well when I am sweaty).  Since I love the concept, I will be trying other similar glasses.
