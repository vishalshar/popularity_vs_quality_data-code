I was excited when l got this in the mail, l had great expectations for it. But when l opened the  box the mug was broken, the orange base with the sucktion part had come loose and weren't attached to the mug itself. I instantly mailed the Mighty Mug company after arrival, but weeks have gone by without any reply.
