I have 3 different brands of wifi Switches and Wemo is the worst, the app takes 20 seconds to load and scan for single switch (I only have one switch for testing). I'd rather turn it on and off manually. It's way over priced and doesn't speed up anything or provide any convenience.The only reason I am keeping it, is because I want to test it with Amazon Echo.Other brands are much faster:- TP-Link smart plug (works with Echo but they don't make wall switch) - "Ankuoo NEO Wi-Fi Light Switch" (fastest and cheapest but they don't make wall switch)
