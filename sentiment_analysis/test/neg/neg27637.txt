Do NOT buy this product if you value your time. I have now been attempting to install it for three hours on my only day off of the week, and have been on the phone with Belkin's customer service for an hour, with someone who barely speaks English.Background: I am an electronics engineer with over 20 years of experience...I know a thing or two about hooking up electronic gadgets.I have gone through numerous restarts, resets, deleting the app, reinstalling the app, and now I am on the phone with Belkin and they are asking me dozens of questions on my home network and iPhone.What I did, and for the love of all that is holy, do NOT do this (even the "person" - I don't know if it was a he or a she based on the name - said the same thing), was update the firmware as soon as the device came to life. DO NOT DO THIS! IT WILL BREAK YOUR UNIT AND REQUIRE A FACTORY RESET.Even AFTER a factory reset, some of the time I can intermittently see the WeMo Light Switch in my iPhone app, but the light is blinking amber on the switch indicating a network issue, and I cannot reliably issue on/off commands from the app or from my Amazon Echo. It worked a couple times, then stopped.When the device is visible on the network, sometimes the lights connected to it go on when commanded, and many of the time they don't.  Sometimes they go on, then stay on, despite me issuing commands to turn them off. Sometimes when issuing a command in the app it takes 30 seconds for the lights to turn on. Sometimes I tell my Echo to turn on the lights, and says she can't reach the device, then 20 seconds later the lights just turn on, then turn off all by themselves...they apparently have a mind of their own. REALLY NOT GOOD.You get the picture? This product is WAY not ready for prime time. Probably the single worst consumer electronics product I have purchased in years.Belkin customer service has just given up on me and "escalated" my case, and "someone will call you back within 8 hours"...so I suppose I'll just have to blow the REST of my day off by hanging around the house until they call? SERIOUSLY?I haven't even gone into the fact that this expensive device is just an on/off switch, and that it requires you to rename your network and change your password (if your network name has any spaces or capital letters in the name, and if your password has any special characters). REALLY?Oh, and another thing: the WeMo can only connect to 2.4Ghz networks, so if you have a dual band router, you lose! You have to use 2.4Ghz, which is a lot more crowded, especially in an apartment building like ours.I will update this review when and if they call me back. Right now, my wife is ticked off at me for installing this stupid thing and wants it ripped out of the wall, and I'm leaning towards doing this and sending it right back to Amazon, as I agree with her. This is ridiculous.Update: Yep, my wife has had it with this thing, and it's coming out of the wall, going back in the box and being returned to Amazon.Let me summarize:* It doesn't work much of the time.* When it does work, it frequently stops, so if you've turned the lights on, they cannot be turned off (without going to the switch and turning them off).* It made me change my network password to something less secure (without special characters) and then I had to change all the devices connected to the network (laptops, desktops, DVR's, printers, Amazon Echo, Cell Phones, etc.).* It made me rename my WiFi network and then I had to change all the devices connected to the network (laptops, desktops, DVR's, printers, Amazon Echo, Cell Phones, etc.).* It can only use 2.4Ghz WiFi* In addition, this $44 piece of ___ replaced a $10 dimmer on the wall and since this switch controls our kitchen lights, we would miss the dimming function, and even if all the aforementioned negatives weren't true, we still would have paid almost 5 times as much for something that is less functional. Why?Let me say it again: unless you enjoy frustration and wasting your time being a Beta tester for somebody else's product, DO NOT BOTHER BUYING AND TRYING TO INSTALL THIS THING. I have been reviewing products on Amazon for 20 years, and this is only the second time I wish I could give something ZERO stars if Amazon would let me, and the last time was a product that burst into flames and almost burned our house down.Update: 4/13/15 - Belkin customer service called me today to discuss my problems. Paradoxically, this guy said the issue WAS my firmware and that I needed to use the more recent firmware. I explained to him that I couldn't keep the WeMo Light Switch connected to the internet long enough to update the firmware, and suggested they add a micro-USB port on the thing so the firmware could be updated from a desktop or laptop without messing with WiFi. He thought this was a good idea, and tried to convince me to try another copy of the WeMo switch, but I told him "Thanks, but no thanks".
