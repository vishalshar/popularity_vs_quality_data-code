It is not a great solution for most scenarios. It is Bluetooth based, so everything requires your phone to be in the range and running the app. Even for IFTTT. I gave it away. You are better off with something like a Broadlink device which is half the price, if all you are going to get is a glorified IR blaster. At least that one is a wifi based, properly internet-connected device - so you can turn on your TV from the other side of the planet!
