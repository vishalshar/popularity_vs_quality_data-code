I have actually decided to stop using this.  It is light weight and comfortable to the point that I forget I am wearing it, but it doesn't accurately measure me.  First, the steps indicator is off by over 10% and most of the time close to 20%.  I counted my steps on a long walk to be certain. I also found that it didn't always measure calm or focused states accurately for me and the very few times it registered me as stressed I wasn't and the times I caught myself slightly stressed and started breathing, it hadn't noticed.  It makes me sad, because I really had high hopes for this and was so excited to get it and use it.  What finally made me decide enough was enough was when the app kept telling me not to swipe to close the app almost every time I clicked it.  I never once swiped up to close this app - I never closed it, but it kept closing and inevitably lost data.  It is really too bad, because I love the idea of this :-(
