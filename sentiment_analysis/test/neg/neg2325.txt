Doesn't work with lens cover.  Lens cover gets stuck at the bottom.  If you put the camera in the other way, the lanyard connection is too far down into the sleeve.  Don't leave the lanyard off in either case, because you need it to pull the camera out if the snug fitting sleeve (and you want it to be snug).
