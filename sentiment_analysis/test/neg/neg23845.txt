I bought this case based on the reviews and adding that it over. Also, considering the price, I was under the assumption that the quality would be top notch. When I received the case it felt good in my hands. Hard see-through plastic with rubber side grips and a strong magnet.... good right? Yes, for about 3 months, and that's when the rubber started separating from the plastic under normal use. In another week or so this case will be worthless. Not worth the $50 I spent on it. I DO NOT recommend this case.
