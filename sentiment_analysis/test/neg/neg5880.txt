I had a terrible reaction to the product. The first week went well. But then my skin reacted negatively to the product and I developed a nasty rash under both armpits.The scarring in the image is the Raw Apple Cider Vinegar I apply to the rash to help it heal. The urge to scratch at the rash is intense and the Raw Apple Cider Vinegar helps reduce that intensity. I apply it at night before bed and in the morning. After a week, the rash is practically gone, however the skin remains considerably darker from the rash.
