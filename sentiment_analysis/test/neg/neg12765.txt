UPDATE Oct-06-2016:It was good while it lasted.... :( my case stopped working all together abt 2 weeks ago while on a trip overseas.... When I try to charge the phone the charger isn't recognized (as if nothing was plugged in)... The led on the case lights up when I plug it in but it doesn't work.... Too bad. Apart from loosing the charging cover and a few tips (which they kindly sent me some spares) I was actually liking this.... I guess I'll wait for aircase to see if it's better....plus, I'm now on the iPhone 7 so gotta get a new one anyways...UPDATE B Oct-06-2016: as I said above I had upgraded to an ipohne 7, so I only really re-inspected the case very carefully today...What happened was the connector BROKE OFF the case...which explains why it wont work lol....  It wouldnt have been "user error" IMO as there is only one way to slide in/out... I didnt notie the moment it broke, but probably when I got my iphone 7 and switched simcards between the iphone 6 and the 7...that makes sense in terms of timing of when i noticed it "stopped connecting"... (corrected to 2 stars instead of 1 as I did find it good for the time it lasted)...UPDATE Aug-03-2015:Chargetech reached out to me to offer some explanation and I think its fair that I update my review and views of the product & company.The case itself has some problems (not really minor if you ask me, but I discussed them all below).  The way it "attaches" on the top and the charging port cover esp are a bit of a nuisance and prone to breaking/opening, etc... I have had to glue mine back together.  Nonetheless, apparently they have a second version which address some or all these issues.Performance has been actually better than initially...dont know if the battery needed a couple of cycles or what, but it seems to get to 100% or very close on a charge.  I`m quite happy now in terms of how much juice it gives.In terms of the company, their attitude in reaching out and etc has shown that they are indeed eager to fix at least some problems, so I commend them on that.  I will however still point out that I felt cheated initially when amazon was selling and deliverying the cases before backers got theirs (I understand a crowdfunding campaign has its issues...but once you are selling and shipping with amazon prime, its really no excuse to not have fulfilled the backers' orders (ppl who "bet on you" from the beginning).  They did comment on that however, and seem to have understood that wasnt a "nice" move.  Hopefully they will take a different approach in the future. I was also quite ticked that they dropped the price 50% around 1 week after my purchase.  I was out of the country (so couldnt return), and their price protection is 7 days...so I basically ripped 60$...  On their defense - and for the sake of transparency - I have been offered a $20 amazon gift card for my troubles.  A nice gesture but a price match or early delivery would have been prefered initially.I'm not sure if I will end up buying other products from them.  I probably will because despite the build issues on the 1st gen of the case (havent seen the second one to comment), the product itself does work.  I also purchased a usb wall charger from them which I really like.  Despite looking exactly like a bunch of other chinese ones available I think it works better - it could be placebo... it also works better (charges quicker) than other larger ones I bought that promised even higher wattages.I'll split this review into 2 parts.1 - the product:The product is quite flimsy, especially the upper charging port.  It is prone to breakage (mine has come apart).The top part of the case (locking mechanism) is also quite badly made imho.  It pops up often even in my pocket, and any falls (even on carpet from just about 1.5ft will cause the case to open up and have the top fly away...Charging capacity barely reaches 80% (quite a stretch from 100% claimed)... abd tgat is with the phone basically not used at all during charging...The "ui" is quirky too...  Why not just have a dedicated button like oter cases?  The "push vol+" to control strategy isnt the best... and I have been noticing that it is becoming less sensitive after merely a week of use...2 - the company:I got this case as a gift after being a back on indigogo for over a year...  I was robbed by thincharge and they have just "vanished"... no email responses, nothing... so I was supposed to have received 2 "perks", and got one as a gift... In the end I paid for 3 and received 1...  To make matters worse, they have just dropped 50% in price 1wk after I got mine from amazon...  Basically, they are all over the place as a company.  I wouldnt recomend it in all honesty...
