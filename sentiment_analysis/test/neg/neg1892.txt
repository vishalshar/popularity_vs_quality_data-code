Have to start with saying you get what you paid for. I just bought this phone Saturday and just 2 days later I have to send it back. I read where some had heating issues with the Robin and I certainly did but most complained of the phone reaching 116 degrees which really isnt that bad depending on what you are doing. Mine however reached 156 degrees. Once playing Pokemon Go for only 20 minutes. Once watching a live video feed. The next day the phone refused to charge at all and stayed at 8% battery life then eventually dropped to zero. I dont know if I just had a buggy phone or if Nextbit dropping the price to 150 bucks is from them changing some things on the build to make the phone cheaper to manufacture but I cant recommend this phone despite the great audio, awesome look and design and decent camera. The phones heating issues outweigh the pros too much otherwise I would have given this phone a 4 out of 5.
