Everything seemed fine but after 18 days there was no growth, so we decided to dunk it again and still got nothing. Ended up taking half if it and seeding some fresh substrate that finally produced. The mycelium may have just been too old I suppose?Ordered a second one as a gift for a family member but when it arrived the plastic had already been torn and they "cake" didn't look healthy at all; hardly any white mycelium at all. They decided to dunk it anyway but within 8 days it was growing mold.May have just gotten unlucky twice seeing as how others have had success but we opted for a different company for a third and final attempt.
