Maybe because I'm a lefty, this stylus was not comfortable for me to use. The lines it made were no different than the $1 stylus with a more rounded tip. The tip had to be held a certain way to make contact with the iPad to recognize what I was drawing, and the metal construction caused my hand to sweat if working in a cold room or some reason. This stylus is entirely the reason why I bought a new iPad and the Apple Pencil.
