I saw this in its first iteration on Kickstarter and wanted it, but waited. I recently bought a new bike and thought now would be a good time to get it.The outside said it was a T2 and included instructions about how to use a special technique to overcome a design flaw involving the battery. (Really can't believe they're shipping helmets with a printed workaround, knowing there is an issue. I can't imagine any other company doing this.) The inside with the helmet and description talked about it being a T1. (Very confusing. Wasn't even sure they sent the right helmet.)Anyhow, the workaround (there's even a video for this massive flaw) that was supposed to circumvent the issue with the helmet not charging didn't work and it wouldn't charge. I unfortunately can't even say if the lights are bright. Returned it. So sad. I really wanted this to work. I looked forward to this purchase for two years!
