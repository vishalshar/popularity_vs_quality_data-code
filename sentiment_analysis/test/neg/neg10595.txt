After reading all the glowing reviews I bought this unit. I wasn't expecting miracles but the sound was terrible. It sounded like the speakers were damaged which they weren't. The records I played were not the problem either. What I experienced when listening to this unit wasn't worth $20. Don't waste your money.  I'm returning it for a refund
