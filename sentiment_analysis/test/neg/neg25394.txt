had these most of the season. 3 of the sensors have already broken off. they give you 2 extra but now I'm short one. I have been very careful with them. Cheap plastic that seems glued together. I will say when they are on they work great. Can be annoying to register shot having to tap the phone several times, most of the time just one clickwould give four stars if they were made better.
