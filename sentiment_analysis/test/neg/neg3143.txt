It's essentially a scraper with a mini vacuum.You scrape your skin with the diamond abrasive and it sucks up the loose cells. It's expensive for what it really is.You really don't have to use a toothpick to clean the diamond abrasive ....if you have access to a mini compressor simply blow the dead cells away.
