I bought this to catch prowlers and snoopers and thieves. On the first day as I was setting up cam, my son came in not knowing he was on CLOUD,  gave me a half moon of his butt. I LOL he's a nut. I quickly reviewed it on my PC. I'm still laughing. Then that clip part disappeared, not to be seen again.  It literally showed my son pass the camera and down the hall as if it never happened. I seen this with my own eyes as well as on the camera and playback and now its gone. Well that's not all. Did the same when I was watching a lighted drone fly around the neighborhood, I watched playback 4 times then its gone.. And again tonight when I was using the camera to pick up noised from my attic. A man went into the attic, coughing and messing around, recording now Gone. What's the point if it's gonna trash what you're trying to catch. I live in government housing. An I had been hearing this and just wanted to have proof. But like the others only the critical parts disappeared. I want my money back, but it says that it's too late for return. There has to human monitors doing this.
