I did a session with my Lobster machine and also just serves.  The serves were all recorded as forhands, which is consistent with what I get in matches. The machine session read mostly flat forehands. They were forehands but most had slice or topspin.After this test, I stopped using the device. Maybe they will fix it to be somewhat accurate.
