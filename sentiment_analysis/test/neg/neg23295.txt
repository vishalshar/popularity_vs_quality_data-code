I'm very unhappy with the lack of durability of this item. I have had it for less than six months and it is already falling apart. The black rubber framing has come apart from the plastic molded case. I love the purpose of the magnet and being able to fix my phone in the car. Have to get a new case now and this one wasn't cheap. Disappointed!!
