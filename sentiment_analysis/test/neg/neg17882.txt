The first one was a steaming pile of garbage that sucked over 2 hours of my night - over an hour on my own and then another 45 minutes with D-Link support only for them to tell me it must be defective and to return the item. I'm not impressed.  If the replacement isn't any better, I'll be returning it for sure!
