I wanted to continue using this because I feel that it works, and I like how convenient it is. Also, the unflavored powder is a plus. However, it was previously $14.49 for 28 packets. Now I went back on amazon to reorder, and it's no longer on Amazon Prime! So now it's $20 for 28 packets. I just have to search for other alternatives.
