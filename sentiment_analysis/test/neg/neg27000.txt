I have to start by saying I still use Rokform products on my older devices.  The old products that were made in the USA were great products.Now.....not so much.  The plastic feels cheap, the rubber is pulling off the hard plastic case.  This case is only 1.5 months old.  If this wasn't Rokform I wouldn't say anything,  if they can improve quality I will gladly come back.  Even though it's tough to find made in USA cases, I expect better quality even if it comes from China.Rokform - please improve quality and bring back the old Rokform we know and love.
