I really like the size and design but was no happy with the quality of the optics. Compared to an inexpensive pair of $2.00 pair of cheaters, the magnification on these little glasses provides a somewhat distorted output so much so that the text you are looking appears somewhat distorted and is no where near the quality and clarity it should be for the price. I was looking forward to using these but just wasn't pleased with the clarity of the magnification but the quality of the material used I like.
