Unless you are a child or wear size 5 (women's) or smaller these laces will NOT fit right. If you want your circulation cut off from shoes being to tight or shoes falling off from being too loose, then these are for you. They are all one size so the higher up you go on the shoe it just keeps getting tighter. If you try to put 2 laces together to get a looser fit then you end up with shoes that fall right off your feet.
