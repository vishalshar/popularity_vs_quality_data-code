I'm so confused...this came in an over sized box, there are 6 bags, but they are all different sizes and duplicate flavors. There is no "branding" or packaging to make me have any trust as to where these came from and it is WAY too expensive! I wouldn't be surprised if some low life went to Costco and threw a few in a box for some extra cash.
