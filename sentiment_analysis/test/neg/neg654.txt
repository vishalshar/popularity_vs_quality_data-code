Great idea, but needs some work!!! The only thing the instructions tell you is to place the batteries in and turn it on. I bought this in hopes to use the voice control feature with my echo but it takes two commands to turn on my TV and in that time I could have just pushed the button on my remote control. Also i have to keep my phone near me with Bluetooth on for it to work. I have 1 TV downstairs and 3 upstairs but you have to keep the anymote next to the TV you're using, so basically I paid $60 to control one TV...and don't get me started on the macros!!! I still cant figure that out.
