I wasted my money.  My son has special needs and cannot tie his own shoes.  I bought these thinking they looked nice and kids wouldn't really take notice at school.  They didn't work for him.  We followed the directions on the Hickies website for a loose fit - seemed easy enough to  put in his shoes (size 9 mens Nike).  They lasted 2 hours before they started popping off.  We put them back in - same thing over and over.  He is not hard on his shoes and wasn't doing anything other than walking down the hallway.  If you are looking for a great no-tie alternative, try Lock Laces.  We've never had any issues with them and have been using them for years.
