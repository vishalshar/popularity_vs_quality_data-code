I bought the 2 pack of cilantro with the highest of hopes. The first can looked good, second can...full of mold. I took the top layer of dirt out in the moldy one and then did seeds and water as directed for both cans. The can without mold is growing (no usable cilantro yet though), the one with the moldy soil, one sprout sprouted, lasted a few days, and then keeled over and dissipated. So if it was a water/light issue, I would think that neither would grow (since they are right next to each other), so I am assuming it was a soil issue. So want to give this more stars, but seeing as I only have 1 out of 2 left, it is hard to rate higher. I am enclosing pictures to see the difference in the plants...sorry they uploaded sideways, but you get the gist.
