I have tried multiple "scents" and the lavender is the one that sent me to the dermatologist with a terrible rash, which she called a burn.  Essential oils sound great but can actually be very harsh.  I initially chalked it up to pit detox or having recently shaved before application--but my daughter used it and had the exact same awful rash.  I've used the lemongrass scent without a problem.
