My daughter is handicapped and cannot tie her shoes.  The first set we purchased from Brookstone a few years ago and they were amazing!  The set we recently purchased through Amazon was TERRIBLE!!  They began breaking apart after the 1st week and continued until most all were useless.  We had to replace with the old ones (which are dirty and worn), but we have no other choice.  So, I'm not sure if the company has changed the product used in manufacturing HICKIES, or what happened.  We won't purchase again.
