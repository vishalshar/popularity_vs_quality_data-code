The product claims to last at least a year, including having a use by date on the back.  Total lie.  Mine say they will last until July/August 2015 however I just tried to use the product and it is already too dry to mold or use.  As I try to mold it it just snaps into pieces.  I have opened four packs and all the same.  I bought Sugru back in August so my return window with Amazon is gone.I cannot stress enough, TOTAL GARBAGE! DO NOT BUY!
