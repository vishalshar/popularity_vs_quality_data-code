I really wanted to like this simple kneeling meditation device.  My first impression was excellent, it put me in a very good posture easily.  However, it put all of my weight directly on my sit bones, and the foam itself, once compressed, it quite hard.My first 30 minute sit on it resulted in a tremendous amount of mindfulness of my butt pain, and very little else.I sent it back.
