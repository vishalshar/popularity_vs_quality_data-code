The seat itself is only about 14 inches wide and is framed by metal bars.  I'm hardly a big guy, especially in the legs and bottom, and the chair is painful to sit in, due to the metal bars digging into the outsides of my legs.  It's definitely beneficial to have an assistant for assembly, just to hold the seat back in place while you put in the screws, and to help you lift it (could probably be lifted by 1 person, but much easier with 2).  If the screws were about 1/2 an inch longer for the chair back, it would really help the assembly.  The instructions could use a little more detail, also.  I'm going to give another couple of days and see if I can figure out a way to sit in it without pain, because it really is a nice looking chair that makes me happy to look at (until I sit in it).
