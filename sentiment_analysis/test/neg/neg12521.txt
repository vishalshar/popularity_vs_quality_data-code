I am very disappointed with this product.  Although the sound quality is really good ( at least for jazz and blues), the Bluetooth cuts out frequently if the iPad or iPhone is more than 12 inches away from the speaker.  So much for reading a book and listening to music at the same time.  If rating this speaker on sound quality and ease of set up alone I would give it 4 stars, but with the connectivity issue I can't do any better than one.
