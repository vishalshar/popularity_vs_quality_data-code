Extremely disappointed with this mug.I loved it at first, and it DID work at first.  However, a couple of uses in and it no longer worked (this morning I placed it on my flat, clean desk and pushed it over, and it fell).Not sure what happened there.  I tested it several more times afterwards and it tilted over every single time.Waste of money, would recommend you get a better mug for less money.  This one is a temporary gimmick.
