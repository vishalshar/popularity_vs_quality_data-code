What ever you do, do not order this product! The ScoopFree Trays are great, but the fulfillment process could not get the order straight even after two attempts.I have used the trays for over 5 years now and like the convenience and way the system works. I ordered the ScoopFree Litter Tray Refills with Premium Blue Crystals, Pack of 6 and the order came with only one tray. I thought this was a simple mistake, so I went through the inconvenient process of returning the original order and submitted a second order. The second order came again with only one of the pack of six trays that I ordered. To compound the frustration, there is no efficient way to return an order that was messed up, no chat or phone number or other way to communicate the problem to a human. A single tray costs only $15, not $89.
