Too expensive for this iteration of the bulb. Connectivity with smartphone is unreliable. This may be repairable with a firmware and smartphone update. One of my refurbished bulbs did not work upon delivery, after attempts to reset the bulb as I had to for the other to get started. I will wait for later editions to try again.
