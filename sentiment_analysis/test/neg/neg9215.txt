My dogs love this, but I'm going to c contact Amazon out the product they sell/ship.  If I buy this at a pet outlet, the contents are firm and look like any other dog food.  Two two cases I've gotten through Amazon have a major problem with separation of the solids and liquids, and I suspect that the manufacturer is sending 'seconds' to Amazon distribution sites because this has never happened with the same item bought at pet stores.  If Amazon can't correct this, then I'll use a brick&mortar store.  For you who don't know why 'green ccw tripe' is, it;s the lining of the stomach replete with some digested stomach contents and stomach enzymes -- that mean: refrigerate immediately because it smells very foul and seems to deteriorate if left out even for a couple of hours.  Still: 1) my dogs love it, 2) it's very good for dogs who have had an upset stomach/diarrhea.  Also remember that it's high in sodium - not as much as cleaned tripe (which is boiled in salt water) but still it's  high, so if your dog has a heart problem and needs a special diet low in Na, stay away.
