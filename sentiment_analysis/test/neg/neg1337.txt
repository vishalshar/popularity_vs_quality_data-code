So far I'm not impressed. It looks real pretty but what good is that If it does not work? So the main reason I wanted this is to tether my phone so I don't forget it at work. It is connected in the trackr app and I have the separation alert enabled but if i walk away from my phone hold the trackr up to my ear nothing happens. The alarm is puny and has been going off in my pocket when my phone is in my other pocket. Who knows I might have a defective unit and have written to tech support, so I will keep this updated.UPDATE. Four days later and no response from my Technical support inquiry on theTrackr.com website although it seems that they left a comment on my review to get in touch with them? When I buy a new product I do like to test out the support departments. Anyway, The good news is that the tether did start working, yes for a whole day when I walked away from my phone I would get the puny alarm telling me to go back to it. I could live with that I thought. The following day Its not working and has not worked since, it does show as being connected. I hold my Trackr up to my ear and walk away and nothing ever happens...The App is less than useless. If using the signal strength bar as a guide to locate my keys it is not in any way accurate and not helpful in locating which BTW I know is on my desk. Using the locator button on the Trackr does not work either. If I leave my office and pretend I have lost my phone walk around holding down the button the phone does not ring. The only way it will ring is if I let go of the button while I am by the phone and press it again then the phone will ring?Note to trackr on the Gen 2 make the hole a little bigger to accommodate a real key chain so you dont have to use the little wire thing, make the alarm louder. So disappointed but hey they do look pretty! I don't want to dis a startup company or be one of "those" reviewers and who cares what I think anyway I'm just sharing my experience!
