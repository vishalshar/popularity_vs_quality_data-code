I got this for the Galaxy Note 2. I really wanted to like it, but no matter how hard i tried it just would not work for the Note 2. The tabs have to come out so far that they have to flex backward just to secure the phone in the holder. But  with the case or the phone without a case, after a few bumps the phone would just pop out of the holder due to the flexing of the brackets. The feature of the blade securing to the cd slot is a good idea. It held very  well for one of our cars which has a narrow cd slot on the radio, but will not stay in the slot where there is a beveled edge along the front, as in a stock honda pilot cd player as I have. For the Pilot, I pressed it firmly in the cd slot and secured it with the thumb screw, which seemed secure until i put the phone in the holder. Because of the wide flange, the blade has very little grip and the blade falls out of the slot with the weight of the phone. This thing would probably work great for an iphone with the right cd slot, but definitely not for the Note2 under any circumstances.
