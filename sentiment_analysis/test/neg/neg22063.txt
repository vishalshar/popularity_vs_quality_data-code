We were so excited to get this for my father-in-law for his birthday. We spent the 11.99 for the card plus $7 to ship it in a small box so it didn't get played. When he pushed it, it turned off and when he pushed it again, it turned off.....we followed the directions, the card just didn't work...so upset
