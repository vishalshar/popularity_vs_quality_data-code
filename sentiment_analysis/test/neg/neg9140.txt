Just got it. Although it is supposed to be new, it is not. Wear marks on wristband. Package was open before. And when I try to connect to my misfit account the misfit app lets me know that the device is already connected to other account and I should tell former owner to disconnect from his account.I tried to place a complaint on amazon.com complaint form. Due to technical problems I was not able to get the message out. Unfortunately device is not valuable enough to return from Switzerland to USA. So there stays just a disappointed customer. No stars.
