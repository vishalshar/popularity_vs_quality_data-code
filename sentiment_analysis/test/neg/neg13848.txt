I was really excited for this to come as it is so cool and fun to play with. But after I charge it and the light turns green, it only goes on for like 10 minutes and it shows it needs charging again. Save your money and buy something else. If you want something fun I suggest the self balance scooter. That's what I'm saving up for currently.
