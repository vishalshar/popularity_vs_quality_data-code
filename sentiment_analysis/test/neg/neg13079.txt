I loved the original Anki Drive and have been enjoying Overdrive even more.  This expansion kit is a dud though I'd afraid.  As many other reviewers have said, the cars are rarely able to complete a track scan when the launch kit is present (Big Bang especially) and when they do, they are almost never able to all complete jumps.  I would love for this to work, but sadly it does not.
