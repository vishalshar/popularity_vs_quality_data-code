No better than a regular dry erase board. It says online it's better because the markers don't bleed into the surface and stain it. Not true and we've only been using it 1 day. The markers are described as vibrant and some of them really don't even show up very well and as for the blue eraser it's pretty much useless on its own. We are having to use water every time we need to erase. And as for the things it unlocks in the other creative apps im pretty sure my child won't notice or care. It should unlock more things or even a whole a app. To me it's a rip off. The only good I have to day about it is it fits nice and neat against the base and it's cool that the markers go inside the eraser and the eraser pouch is magnetic to the board. I'm going to attempt to add a photo of our board. This is after our first day of use and after I've cleaned it with a MAGIC ERASER.
