I'll never buy another one. Very disappointed. The first one was broken so I sent it back the second one was also defective. One lid won't stay closed on one side so it tends to make a mess. And large pieces of plastic in the water resovoir. Unfortunately my husband threw the box away before I could send that one back too. Quite frankly it's cheap junk. No issues at all with Amazon the box getting thrown away was my fault.
