This speaker was not loud at all. I tried to connect with both bluetooth and cord. I also used my phone, computer, and mp3 player. All 3 had same result. If you are expecting to be able to hear this speaker over other noises, move on now. Just not enough sound at all. The description lead me to believe that this speaker would be fairly loud. Compared to others I have owned it failed miserably. When mounted on turtle claw it seemed unstable like the claw would break and speaker hit the ground.
