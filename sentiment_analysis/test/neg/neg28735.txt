Order did not arrive with promised VR googles so review solely based upon the fact that the boy who specifically asked for it as a gift can't use it. What a disappointing Christmas morning. He's still excited about it and asked us not to return it but instead purchase viewer separately with no idea if it works. . I am an unhappy customer.
