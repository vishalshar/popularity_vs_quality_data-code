This didn't fit my dog at all. Even though I ordered the correct size for her measurements. I suspect it's because she's an unusual shape--she's some kind of Chihuahua/terrier mix with a short muzzle but fairly long body. She was easily able to slip out of this harness just be jerking her head back.
