All show and no go. And it includes some incredibly annoying sound effects that are very loud. This does not have a subwoofer - a bass module, but nowhere even close to a sub (20-30Hz response is required to join the sub club, this one barely responds to 60Hz).This speaker looks so incredibly cool, what a great concept - a floating speaker and bass module. Wow, could they make a cooler speaker? Yeah they sure could make a cooler speaker, maybe spend a little time with the sound and less on the magic floating and crowd funding campaign. They spent a lot of time convincing 3,904 people to back their project and managed to raise over three quarter of a million dollars - and yet they jammed a $50 Bluetooth speaker into this thing. Not cool guys, not cool at all.For the low low price of $330, you get a Bluetooth speaker that levitates. That's all you get. No AirPlay, no WiFi connectivity, no Aux in, no streaming ability - nothing, just a Bluetooth speaker. I turned this on and was immediately struck by the harsh strained sound. It is not a relaxing speaker to listen to, and music should be relaxing.And then I was hit with all kinds of beeps and boops and strange sounds at a very loud volume. I can't find a way to turn those sounds off - maybe possible in the app, but that doesn't work. The speaker makes a very loud noise when it enters Bluetooth pairing mode. It then makes another loud sound when it is paired. It also makes a really loud sound when it has finished charging. I don't want any of those things - none of them.The levitation - OK - as a science experiment and something that looks cool, yeah that works. The speaker does absolutely float above the base. Unlike all the other levitating speakers, this one is very easy to float. And yes that speaker has a massive strong magnet inside it and it is waterproof, so you can take the little floater with you on your bicycle (assuming you have something steel on your bicycle). But don't try to float it in the pool, even though it is a floater that will evacuate a public pool, it sinks like a rock.The sound is truly miserable. Given the massive size and weight of the base, and the price point, this thing should work to subwoofer levels - 20-30Hz easily. Nope, it does a lame job of just barely having bass response at 50Hz, the response ramps up very slowly to around 100Hz and then flattens off. The speaker also has a nasty vibration around 100Hz that shows up in a vibration test. After taking the speaker apart I can see where they went all wrong - tiny weak amplifier and no attention to any acoustic design. They basically jammed a speaker in a space they had in the base. They bought an off the shelf or tried to replicate a bass tube - they even messed up that part.The satellite / floater speaker is a real problem. Because they had to put the Bluetooth receiver, a battery, charging circuits, amplifier, and a massive magnet in that container; there was no room left to do any kind of acoustic design. They basically crammed a speaker in the hockey puck. The speaker just can't work in that environment - it is about as good as a transistor radio. There is no bass response in the floater - the amp is too underpowered, and the speaker too large to move any air. In theory the floater can be used separately for on the go listening. It hurts my ears.I had to see how this thing was built. I love taking things apart and this wasn't too hard to get into. The levitation is done in a cool way. There is a gigantic permanent ring magnet (it is just smaller diameter than the base and about two inches deep), with a servo motor that lifts the magnet. When the base senses that the floater is in position, the magnet is raised up slowly and the floater, floats. Oddly, I recognize the sound of the servo motor (no idea why they used a motor that makes noise - a silent one would have been much smarter), it sounds exactly like the motors for presenting the door handles on a Tesla. I'd guess they used the same parts bin as Tesla. Surprised they didn't put that in their marketing.The lift mechanism takes up about half the volume of the base. The other half is the control buttons (they could have made that panel much thinner and tidier), a box of electronics, mounting plastic, a bass tube, and the downward facing speaker. If they had hired an acoustical engineer, they would have cleaned up that space, wrapped the speaker wires in foam, and sealed everything with thick silicone. The bass tube doesn't really work very well - the speaker enclosure is not sealed. And most importantly, they would have used a much more powerful amplifier.Aside from the floating mechanism, this is a parts bin build, with little to no attention to detail.And to rub salt in the wound, the Crazybaby app does not work at all on my iPhone 6 Plus. The screen turns black and nothing happens - the app then crashes. From what I can tell, the app not working is not a big deal at all. Since this is just a Bluetooth speaker, within any music app or video program, it is simple to select the crazybaby speaker.If you want a brief conversation piece - hey look at that speaker float - this is an awesome deal. If you want something to play music, look at any other speaker - honestly, any other speaker sounds at least as good - probably better. I feel sorry for the people that invested in this crowd funded program and got this speaker in the mail, a year or two or however long it took them to build this, later.So much promise, so little delivery.
