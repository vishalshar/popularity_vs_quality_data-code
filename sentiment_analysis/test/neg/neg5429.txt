I was so excited to receive this product because of all the great reviews. I love the smell and the texture but, it irritates my skin and leaves me chaffing and red. I thought maybe I just needed to get use to it but that was a bad idea, it only lead to more redness and chaffing. So sad this product didn't work for me.
