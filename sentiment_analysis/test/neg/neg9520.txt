Not sure about this cam - it's my first higher resolution cam after working with many basic D-Link cams sucessfully. Either mine is defective (i did return it), or the iris can't cope with scenes including bright light. Unlike my other D-link lower-resolution cams, it seems to be overwhelmed by bright images (eg can't point it toward outdoor bright views - and I'm not talking about pointing it toward the sun) I've been using several D-Link cams to look outward from indoors with no problems, but not this cam. Good image - works fine otherwise.
