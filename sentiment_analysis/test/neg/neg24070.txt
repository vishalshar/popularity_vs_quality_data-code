DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I received this weather station and, while it looks fancy, the hygrometer was registering false-high readings.  The forums on the netatmo website speak of being able to "manually calibrate" the hygrometer, however my emails to their support email have gone unanswered for over one week.  For $180, every element of the weather station should work.  There shouldn't be a need to manually calibrate anything.  ...and if there is, emails requesting support should be answered.I also purchased 2Â NETATMO NIM01-WW Additional Indoor Module for Weather Station - Retail Packaging - Aluminum.  Upon setting up the additional modules, the CO2 readings on each register at "0".  According to the forms on the netatmo website, this is the result of the modules not being calibrated at the factory.If each item Netatmo ships requires a "Manual calibration" or was not calibrated at all, really makes you question the integrity of the system.  Yes, it's pretty cool to be able to to show your friends all the graphs from your shiny new weather station, but before you do so, consider the integrity of the data the station spits out.
