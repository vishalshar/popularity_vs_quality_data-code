I was excited to try this product since the natural ingredients looked excellent and I've seen a bunch of youtube videos on sugaring. I didn't feel like cooking my own, so I ordered this product. Unfortunately, I think the sugar must have been overcooked. It's hard as a rock in the jar (I bent a spoon trying to get some out) and 10 seconds in the microwave didn't soften it. I didn't want to make the mistake of melting it like wax and burning myself -- with sugaring, it's supposed to be soft enough to use while cool. Hopefully this was just a bad batch!
