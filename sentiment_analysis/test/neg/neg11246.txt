Completely unimpressed.  I was expecting this to work like a spot tracker but not even close.  Does not give a real time location, probably about a 10 minute delay if outside the whistle zone.  Guess if your dog or cat is located in someone's house or garage you would be able to find them since they are unable to move but if dog is running around this won't assist you in locating.  The app is also rather confusing initially.  Hopefully Whistle improves the software but if you are looking for a realtime location device for your pet this is not it.
