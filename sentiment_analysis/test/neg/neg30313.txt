ok so ive had this cooler for 8 months now.first off, it definitely has some cool features.  the speaker and bottle opener are all great and it does a decent job of keeping things cold.now the negativethe blender doesnt work.  It isnt strong enough to crush ice and make margaritas.  i charge the battery overnight and it dies within a few hrs with nearly no use. the cooler itself is kind of heavy with all that hardware in the lid and it limits the storage space greatly.  the handle started to flex from dragging the cooler with a backpack on top of it.  now i have to force it up and down to carry.overall.... i wish i got a Yeti.
