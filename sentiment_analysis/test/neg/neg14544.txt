Overall experience, 1-5 (1 being worst, 5 best) I give this drone a 2.My son was looking forward to this drone all week.  He was so excited about the videos I showed him from the website.  Once the drone arrived we opened it, and it came with the drone fully assembled, a small box containing the beacon and charging cables, and a manual taped to the top of the box.  We took it all out and put in the batteries (1 AAA not included for the beacon but a rechargeable battery comes for the drone itself, just simply slide it into the slot).  I download the app from the App store (which works with iOS and Android, I have KitKat software).  I had to download the firmware which took 3 tries to complete.  The manual states to operate the drone in an uncrowded area with a flat surface.  We played with this in my living room with what I would consider plenty of room.  I have hard wood floors.  Here is my experience:o The first flight happened after 2 reboots of my phone thinking it was the problem.  Afterwards the drone lifted in the air about 2.5 feet for 3-5 seconds.  It did not respond to any command.  I had to power down the app and try again.  The second flight was straight in the air, hit the ceiling, slammed into the wall, took off after my son, and fell to the floor all within 5 seconds.  The 3rd attempt (after restarting the app) it went up a few feet and randomly did a flip and fell to the floor 4-5 feet from where it started.  When we finally got the drone to fly (after  or 4 more failed attempts) for about 10 seconds to start the Lumi to the Beat game, it decided to fly left, smacked into my leg (left a mark), stuck on the yellow color, and crashed under my armoire 5 feet away.o Sensors do not work.  It flew into the ceiling, under the armoire, hit me in the leg, chased my son, and slammed into the wall on more than one occasion.o It is pretty loud.  Barely could hear the song from my phone with the volume up.o Blades already showing signs of wear as if we have played with it for weeks.  Scratches on all blades already.I really had high hopes that this drone would be a lot of fun for my son and I.  We are going to try using it again in various rooms after a full nightÂ’s charge, even though there is no indication that the battery is low to see if this helps the situation.  But as of right now, we have not had successful experiences.
