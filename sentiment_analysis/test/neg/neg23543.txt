Update- I sent feedback to the folks at Korner and they offered many different pieces of advice.  They were polite and friendly, but their basic solution to my problem was to offer to show me how to set up regular on and off schedules for my alarm. For one thing, I come home at different times each day depending on my work, gym, dinner, etc schedule.  For another, a regularly scheduled alarm doesn't do any good if the app is running behind and doesn't cut it on and off on time.  As I pointed out to them, four is just the number of times in two weeks that I have had false alarms.  There's been several times the app was running behind and I just left my apartment without arming the system and had to go back and arm it later.  That defeats the purpose of having an alarm.  The are nice enough folks, it seems, but the app is what separates their product from all the other motion sensor alarms, and it just doesn't work reliably enough to be worth the cash or headache.  My neighbors upstairs finally complained after this time to the landlords who basically asked me to find a more reliable alarm.  And honestly, I can't blame them.  Before you buy this product, go to the app store and read the reviews.  I wish now I'd paid more attention to them.I am returning this security system because I am very fed up with it.  In the short time I have had it, I've had to break into/out of my apartment, setting off the alarm at a an earsplitting scream, four times in two weeks.  The sensors are decent, but the app is HORRIBLE!!! Twice I have tried to turn the alarm off while entering or exiting, only to have the app run behind and not work.  I ended up outside in the rain in front of my door for over half an hour while the app kept saying attempting to turn off.  Every time I tried, it would register that I'd tried, but then nothing.  I finally just came in.  I also went to leave one day and it said I had turned the alarm off, but it went off anyway.  Woke my neighbors up at 8am on a Saturday.  The UPS guy put a package notice on the door and the alarm went off while I was at work!  I rushed over just to find a freaked-out UPS guy.  Finally, the last straw today was that the stick couldn't be detected from about 10am onwards until after I got off work at 5.  Well, I couldn't disable my alarm, but foolishly I figured if it can't find the stick, the alarm won't sound.  Wrong!  I am sure the neighbors love me at this point! Setting this alarm off four times in two weeks is just ridiculous.  This sounds like a great product - very affordable without a monthly monitoring fee.  Unfortunately, the web app is awful!  I should have listened to all the reviews on Google Play when I downloaded it, because they mostly rated the app very badly and they were RIGHT!
