I purchased this wearable on October 6, 2016 specifically for the body composition feature. As one of the few wearables that measure/track body composition, I made the decision to buy it and give it a go.I have been disappointed with the tracking features available through the app (unlike other fitness trackers, there is no associated website that stores one's overall statistics.) The app, during the time of my BAND usage and as of this review, does not auto sync with the BAND. Syncing requires manual intervention and, the longer one waits between syncs, the longer it takes for the BAND to sync its data. Go too long (I believe 7 days) and data gets lost due to limited storage capacity on the wearable itself.Measuring body composition, my reason for the purchase, is a bit tricky. It requires placing thumb and forefinger on the device contacts and awaiting the result. Far too often, the device would fail to measure, I presume due to poor contact reception. It is simply not as efficient nor simple in its measurement process to be beneficial in the long run.The last straw for me regarding this device is that, on December 20, 2016 the BAND strap broke at the connection between strap and device. It had not seen undue wear in the less than three months it had been owned. I would assess it as poor quality and/or design. I believe inBody has a ways to go before they become (if ever) a competitor in the wearable market.If you have read this far into the review, I would recommend a another wearable for activity tracking (eg Fitbit Surge Fitness Superwatch, Black, Large) and a body composition scale for BF% measurement (eg Withings Body Cardio - Heart Health and Body Composition Wi-Fi Scale, Black.)Forego the inBody BAND--not worth it at all in my limited opinion.
