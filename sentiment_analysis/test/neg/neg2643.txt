Horrible taste.I had Fava beans before from asian stores - mostly fried with salt and oil so I thought the world peas fava crisps would have a similar but healthier taste, however tried one and almost threw up - does not taste like bbq at all - there is just something weird with the taste.I couldn't finish the rest of the bag and just threw it out.
