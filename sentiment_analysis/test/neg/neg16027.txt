The setup was easy, but programming this plug via the Android app does not work.  I have tried via both my phone (Galaxy S5) and tablet (Nexus 7), with the same results.  The app will not let me change beyond the "Basic 1" schedule.  Selecting any other schedule reverts back to "Basic 1".  Additionally, the app crashes constantly.  "Error please close app and try again (215)"  I tried unlinking the plus, uninstalling the app, and reinstalling but the end result is the same.  Will be returned.
