The palm rejection doesn't work as you'd expect.  That was the whole reason I purchased this device...so I could rest my palm on the ipad and still doodle.  No go.  The screen jumped around a bunch, and my palm still often registered marks on the page.  Using this stylus also highlighted how limited the Paper app is...and the smart features of this device won't work with other drawing programs.  Returned it.
