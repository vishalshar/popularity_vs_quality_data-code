The GPS device would not stay connected to my smart phone for several weeks.  I contacted the seller who put me in contact with TLink.  I spoke to two people.  The first one could not help me and said he would have someone else email me.  Never heard from them.  After about three weeks, I called again.  No help.  I contacted the seller again to no avail.  During the past week I tried the device again.  It worked this time.  There had been an app update which I was told would happen.  The device has worked once so far.  I am skeptical.  But, the customer service SUCKS big time.  I could write a book about this but will leave it at this.
