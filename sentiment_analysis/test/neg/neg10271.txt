Have used this cleanser about 20 years, so yes I like it. However they have went from 8 ounces, to 6 ounces and now 4 ounces. The tube is very misleading as it looks like it could hold 8 ounces. Brand new the tube is half full. 4 ounces is just one more ounce than travel size, and we know how small that is.  There should be truth in packaging, and they shouldn't be allowed to use such a big tube. The price is high for that. I have now switched to Avalon organics CoQ10 organic cleanser. Many of the same ingredients and two bottles for 20.00.  It also has no parabens. I hated to leave a product I have used for 20 years, but it has become so ridiculous. Next year it will be two ounces for 25.00. The Avalon removes all my eye makeup and has a nice light scent.
