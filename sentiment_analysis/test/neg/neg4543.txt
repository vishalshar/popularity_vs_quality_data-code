I got it and it took me a while to get it to work, had to reset it about ten times, and then the video was not working properly, I could see some part of the video with lots of pixels, sent a question to customer service and I don't know what they did but it's working now and I love it. I get to see my dog while I'm at my job and give him some treats. Costumer service was very responsive and quick.Update: I had to reconfigure my Petzi, tried six times without success, reached costumer service, they are nice and answer quickly. However, my Petzi is still not working, I've spent a lot of time on a process that should be straight forward, not only trying to configure it, also on the emails with costumer service. Now it is not even resetting, I'll update my comments after I'm able to make it work, or not. Hopefully soon.
