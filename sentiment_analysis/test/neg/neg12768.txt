Purchased this for my father who has the Iphone 6s and it is very well made. The packaging is very nice and everything about the case screams quality. The phone slid into the case very easily and usually provides up to an extra day of use. the tricky part is getting the phone out of the case. Eventually we figured out that to take the case off you need to undo the rubber flap on the top that protects the charging port, then lift straight up.Probably one of his favorite features is still being able to use his lightning cable (although it is now on top).The phone will charge with the battery pack and to check the charge status of the case you'll need to press the volume up button 2x (weird but works)It does add a bit of bulkiness and size to your phone but it is not a big deal when you get an extra day of juice.feel free to ask any questions you may have about this product.Edit: his case just broke on him and it will not charge his phone. No physical damage, it just flashes red when he tries to charge. It has been less than a year and it's already broken and no warranty. Disappointed with product and seller at this point. A $60 case should last a year or have a warranty.
