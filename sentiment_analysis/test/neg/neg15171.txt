I received the Novi Security devices about 2 weeks ago. Its essentially put in storage now because its totally useless - see attached picture. The devices doesn't hold a reliable connection to the base unit, the android app is so slow that it can't be used. I've asked for a refund but they have denied me of it. PLEASE BE WARNED ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. There are much better solutions out there for a lot less including Foscam and Ring.com
