Bought for my wife and the first one had issues with the screen activating. Amazon was great with the replacement process. The second one's screen worked ok but the device simply couldn't compare my fitbit that my wife would wear to compare steps. Some days the two trackers were off by 5,000 steps. We would calibrate by going for walks and counting and verified the fitbit was spot on and the Mira would constantly miss steps. Product is a good idea but just is unreliable.
