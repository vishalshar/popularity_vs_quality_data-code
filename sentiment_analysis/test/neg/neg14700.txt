We got this game for my sister in law, we order an adult version and a family friendly one. We started playing the adult one but come to find out the cards some how got switched in the 2 boxes. We never opened them. Not to mention tons of duplicate cards which made the game horrible to play. We only got to use about 25 cards. I buy my Christmas presents early so it was too late to return.
