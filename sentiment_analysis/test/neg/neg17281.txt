I bought this as a gift and set it up. It found the keys no problem, we were at work. Then when she got home her phone kept beeping about every three hours all night. I had to go across town to meet her at the gym and deleted the device from her phone. She is frustrated and I have to return the device.  How come it doesn't come with an instruction manual.
