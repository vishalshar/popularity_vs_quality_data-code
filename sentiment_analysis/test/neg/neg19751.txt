I just submitted my return request after giving it a real try.  Honestly, if Bragi were to remove 50% of the 'smart tech' features and focus on fit, sound quality, connection quality and maintain the waterproof status, I'd be back in a heartbeat.These aren't ready for consumers yet.  If you're interested in buying a beta product and being an early adopter of a new category in fully wireless headphones these may be interesting to you.  They're well packaged, well designed and 'feel' like they're worth every bit of the price tag.That's about where the good review ends.  The joy of opening the box and powering them up is quickly diminished by the actual user experience where it becomes very clear that these are not quite ready for mass market use.First there is the act of getting them in your ears.  I'm a big guy but generally tend towards 'medium' with my in-ear product.  I tried actual workouts with medium and small.  Small became my preference and I can say when I got them to work they were quite pleasant.  The problem was the 10-15 minutes of frustration trying to put them in, then taking them out and trying again and again to get the necessary seal that makes them work like actual headphones.  If there's ANY air between your inner ear and the outside world the quality of the audio diminishes 50%+  It is a FRUSTRATING process to get these things in and fitting right.  By the way - if you smile while wearing them, start over...  Any major facial changes can knock them out of your ear cavity and create the open space that ruins the sound quality.When they're in, connecting is about as difficult as you'd imagine.  Nothing crazy, connect the left ear for services and the right ear for audio, but they both work perfectly in tandem and the sound synchs up great.  There's some learning curve but I won't criticize for that.  I wasn't able to use them enough to really work out the system of 'remembering' the headphones in my iPhone so I honestly won't criticize the connection process too much.Once connected the connection quality - even with the firmware upgrade - is pretty sad.  I've been a user of Jaybird BlueBuds for about 3 years and those cut out on occasion if you're sitting on your phone in jeans or something like that.  These cut out if there is literally ANYTHING blocking them - your body, your running shorts... they cut out.  A lot.OK - so they're in, they're connected, your phone is in your hand and unobstructed, now let's crank it up and go for a run.Sound quality is a B.  B+ if I'm being generous.  The + is acquired because it has a nice full range of sound if you're standing still and have a perfect seal. Given that these are athletic headphones, who is standing still while using them?  When biking it's not bad.  I didn't try swimming.  When running there's a nice bass thump every time your footfalls because it's jostling something in your inner ear that you hear as distortion.Also there's a major volume limitation.  There's a "safe limit" which is about 2/3 of total volume and a max volume which I'd say is about 2/3 of what my JayBirds put out.So between low volume, OK sound at total rest and very mediocre sound while moving, I think a B+ for sound quality is generous, but accurate.Battery life seems to be as advertised.  I did notice when I didn't keep the charger plugged in and keep the headphones in them for about 2 weeks without using them the whole system died and needed to be recharged.But here's the thing - these are FULL of extra tech I don't care about.  I don't want a heartbeat monitor in my hears.  I don't want it counting my steps.  I have a GPS on my phone for my running and biking.  If I was an avid swimmer than maybe I'd use the tracking then.  The 4GB of onboard memory sounds great, but it's another unnecessary chip adding bulk and reducing battery life.  Remove all of that and give me a good pair of headphones!So I've tried multiple sizes, multiple activities, multiple genres of music and audiobooks and now this item is officially a return for me.  I commend them for getting to market (unlike their main competitor Kanoa) but they haven't beaten JayBird in the quality and value category.  Removing the wire between the two headphones isn't worth another $150, especially when you consider the drawbacks.
