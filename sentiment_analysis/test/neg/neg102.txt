Rating this just based on sound, 5 stars all the way. It is very small but it gives out sound like a big sound machin. However, the battery life stinks and that's why it gets a 2 star rating. The description claims it lasts 16 hours on one charge, that was true the first day we got it but ever since then it dies earlier and earlier each time. I charge it every day and it won't even last through the entire night! (It is used in a nursery so yes, I need it to last all night)It wouldn't be as big of an issue if the charging cord they sent with it was longer then 5 inches long....although that wouldn't even be an issue if the thing would just last for the full 16 hours they claim it does!For some people it may not matter because they'll just keep it plugged in but where it is used at night, I do not have easy access to an outlet to keep it plugged in all night (because of how short the charging cord is). Because of that, I am in the process of returning it. I need something that actually does what it claims to do in relation to battery life.
