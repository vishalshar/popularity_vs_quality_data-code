I love the concept of this product, but it is difficult to keep assembled (what you have built falls apart as you continue to add on/continue to build).  The motorized parts do not fit on the buildings as pictured. The directions are vague at best.  I understand the whole idea behind the product is creativity and self design, but some directions, particularly with the motorized parts would be really helpful. This was at the top of our daughter's Christmas list and unfortunately has been a big disappointment.  We won't be purchasing any other Roominate sets.
