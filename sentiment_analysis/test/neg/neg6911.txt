For the price, I purchased the 2 bag bulk crystals. Normally, I use Tidy Cat or Miracle. The problems with this product is the crystals are twice the size of other brand crystals, crystals are large enough to got caught in my cats paws, they do track, and it hurts my feet when I stepped on those tracked around. As far as clumping, because the crystals are large, they don't absorb quickly or thoroughly. What used to be a 4 day scoop, turned into a daily scoop. Got rid of the product when one of my cats was chewing his paw and I noticed a crystals were caught in his paw. I'll spend the extra money on a product that works for me and my cats.
