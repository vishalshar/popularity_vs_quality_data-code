This is honestly the worst quality toy I've ever purchased. Logistically, it does not work. The elastic isn't attracted to the front of the launcher securely, and even if you are able to pull it back to the clothespin without it snapping off the front, the clothespin isn't strong enough to hold it back. Oh, and dont worry, the loose clothes pin hinge will render the clothespin useless within the first three attempts to use it anyway. Also it looks a little too much like a pistol for me to feel awesome about giving it to my child, but that ship has sailed. I wish I could return it but my child asked for one thing from Santa and this was it, so we feel like we have to eat the outrageous $40 we spent on it because returning it would blow the whole magic of christmas... somehow more than just leaving him thinking santa makes bad toys. I'm bummed because this company seemed really cool, and I would have come back time and time again for other gifts had this one been remotely acceptable.
