I bought these for my son who has fine motor problems and can't tie his shoes. I had hoped that these would be the answer for him since he has outgrown children's sized shoes with Velcro. These quite simply do not stay closed. Every day he comes home with another one popped open. My son isn't capable of reclosing them and quite frankly them popping open defeats the entire point. Perhaps they would be ok for someone that is doing very little activity in their shoes but that is not the case for us. I am disappointed in these and am looking for a new solution.
