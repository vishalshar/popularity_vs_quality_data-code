This thing just dosnt work nearly as easily as the commercial shows. Very difficult to the point that even my kids have said ' just use the remote, it's way faster and easier'. Sorry, I really thought it would be cool too, it's not. Furthermore, when I asked for a return, the seller said the time to return expired and I would have to contact the manufacturer. All around zero star experience. I feel ripped off, but at least you don't have to be.
