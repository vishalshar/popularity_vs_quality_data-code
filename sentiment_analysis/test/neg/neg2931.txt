DO NOT BUY!  Please look at the dates of the reviews!!! I guess it was great in 2015, but the 2016 update is really messed up! It won't connect to any network and the app screwed up my phone to the point where I have to reset settings and replace icons.  DO NOT BUY. I returned in 6 hours of receiving.  Still dealing with phone issues.
