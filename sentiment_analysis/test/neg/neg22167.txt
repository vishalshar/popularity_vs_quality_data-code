I got this mat so that my cats would stop tracking the blue crystals all over the floor.  The problem is that the crystals end up getting stuck in the loops over time.  I've tried to vacuum it as well as shake it out and it's really hard to get those buggers free.For those that aren't aware of the design of this mat, it is constructed with carpet-like loops of plastic.  While it looks good and does match the box and cover, I actually replaced it with a small swatch of regular carpet.  Believe it or not, it's easier to get the crystals out of the carpet with a vacuum cleaner than it is to get them out of this mat...  I am rather disappointed.
