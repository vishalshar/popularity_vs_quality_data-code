Disappointing. It seemed to work fine when I first installed it and took it for a 5-mile bicycle ride on a paved trail. However, after using it multiple times off-road, I cannot recommend it. It rattles and will not hold my iPhone 6 (with a very minimal, slim case) securely. If I push down on the top to snug it up, the bottom portion flexes and lets the 'phone slide out.
