While the filters are being nice, one thing that was not clear to me is that you need to remove those filters every time you power on the Mavic. Otherwise the initial gimbal initialisation will fail, as the Mavic does a Gimbal check - and the filters are blocking the free movement of the Gimbal.For me, this is not practical at all. Additionally, adding and removing the filters take some amount of force to do. And I don't want to put that much stress on my gimbal, especially when I have to to do this for every battery I fly.
