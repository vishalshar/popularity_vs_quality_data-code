I made a mistake ordering these, and I also made a  mistake ordering shortly thereafter, the Plugfones.My primary application for these is under a motorcycle helmet. You need something that can block out the wind and engine noise, and allow you to hear music or cell/Bluetooth communications. The Deibullz seem like a nice idea, but I've learned from wasting money on these and the Plugfones, that there are no good shortcuts. Initially, I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a set of custom in-ear-monitors. After trying these and the Plugfones and throwing away $100 between the two, I ended up going with a custom set that are far north in price, to the ones that I initially didn't want to buy.Why did I spend more? You just can't get a good seal in your ear unless you get a custom mold. Once I realized that these other imitations just don't work and I committed to going custom, then it was a question of how far to go with sound quality. I ended up with a set of Ultimate Ears monitors. It's more than a night and day difference in noise isolation and sound quality, and although the same can be said for the difference in price - I would ask: why waste money on stuff that doesn't work? It's a night and day difference in comfort, too.If you can afford something better - don't cut corners as I did, initially. I threw money away before getting to the right solution. If you have a similar application - motorcycle helmet - the Decibullz are not going to cut it. Best of luck.
