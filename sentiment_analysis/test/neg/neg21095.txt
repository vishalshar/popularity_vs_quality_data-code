I really want to like this product, unfortunately it isn't cutting it. But I think your interest in the product will depend entirely on why you have decided to purchase a $300 alarm clock. So I will tell you a bit about myself, if identify with any of these issues this is not the product for you. For the rest of you, I'll address your needs below.First, I am a physician and have even lectured on sleep to other physicians. I am not a sleep specialist but I know more than your average MD on the topic. Second, I have a pretty significant sleep disorder. I have always had trouble waking up (see my mom's review for PTSD flashbacks). It was the worst during residency and fellowship due to the sleep deprivation. For the past 4-5 years my schedule has been 7P-7A, 7 nights on, 7 nights off. It has led to a severe circadian rhythm problem/shift work disorder. For my weeks on, I am lucky to get 4-5 hours of sleep. My weeks off I am all over the place. I have trouble even making plans, I never know when I'll be awake. Despite this exhaustion, it takes me hours to fall asleep. I bought this product because I thought I would actually be able to use the data to help me regulate my sleep schedule, would help me wake up easier, and I was most excited about it helping me fall asleep. I also thought I might be able to use the data to convince my husband that sleeping with the room at 80 deg is literally ruining my life. None of these happened.- Definitely not accurate. Only people with sleep disorders would know this. The rest of you are sleeping, if the app says your in a phase, why would you argue. But if you lay in bed wide awake for 2 hours and it has you repeatedly cycling through sleep stages it becomes quite obvious. And if the only data I can really evaluate (aka the only data I'm awake for) then I can not trust the sleep data either.- The red light did not help me fall asleep at all. That is probably because the sleep cycle is profoundly more complicated than melatonin, and melatonin itself is pretty complicated. Blue light does have strong suppression of melatonin, red light has the opposite effect which is to not suppress melatonin. As far as I interpret the studies, it is the color with the least impact.- There doesn't seem to be any contingency plan for a second person in the bed.- Not only does it collect data when not running the program, there is no way to delete it later. After much searching, I finally found I could swipe to delete in the dashboard. It even lets me pick a reason...not accurate, not me, etc. But it just keeps coming back. According to this, I am very well rested.- Very difficult to visualize the data trends for any type of in depth analysis. All the bars and squiggly lines look super cool, but hovering over each data point puts my brain into a tailspin.- Why does it take so many hours to transmit data to me? It actually takes longer then my sleep period.- It did help me to quantify that, when solo, I like the room at 70 and he likes it at 80. But since there is no way to compare the temp trends with the sleep data, it is useless info.- No adjustment from the set alarm time for the smart wake up, only goes off when I set it. But since it doesn't seem to know my actual sleep stage, I'll take the few extra minutes.- Measuring heart rate through a mattress? I'm not saying it can't be done, but I am very suspicious and would need to know what technology they are using. I have checked heart rates in all kinds of different ways and they all require touching the body. That includes high tech hospital options.- Measuring the respiratory rate through the mattress seems even crazier. Again, not saying it can't be done. But even the ones we use in the ICU that are touching the patients' chests are not accurate enough to trust.- Many have complained about the lack of available info. I agree, and would like to add there is a lack of info on how sleep modes are being monitored and evaluated. When I was suspicious apple the apple watch being able to monitor, I was able to look up the mechanism (it is impressive).- The complaints about obnoxious chord lengths, sensor position, and placement requirements are all true as well. But I think these would be a small price to pay for sleep if it otherwise suited your needs. There is also a screw mount on the bottom that fits nicely on my tripod.- The speaker is much too weak and not annoying enough. I generally sleep until my backup alarm goes off without noticing. When I open my eyes, the blue light probably helps. I only fall back asleep for 2-3 snoozes instead of 10-12.So who is it good for? Probably people with minor issues. Or normal sleepers who wake up just fine with an alarm but want a more pleasant experience. People who like to spend money to have stuff. The red light is nice since, at the very least, it doesn't suppress melatonin. If you want to increase it taking melatonin is probably more effective. It is really beautifully designed. The spectrum of light is gorgeous. The device itself is sleek. The gesture controls are super cool. Of all the wake-up alarms, this one is probably my favorite. It is just a shame it doesn't wake me up...or put me to sleep...it is a very expensive reading lamp.
