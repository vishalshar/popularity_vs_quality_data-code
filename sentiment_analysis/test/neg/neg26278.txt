I value the intent behind the case (i.e. extra security), but switching back and forth from a covered lens to an uncovered lens is not smooth. Moreover, when you uncover the lens, part of the picture is blurred because it still covers the lower half of front screen camera. Keep perfecting this design - it's not quite there yet.
