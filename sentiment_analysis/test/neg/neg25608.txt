My daughter used the gift for a few hours over a period of two weeks and then it would no longer power on.  Programmed it, turned it off and 10 seconds later it would no longer power on.  Since it was in my closet for Christmas for 2 weeks I was directed by the re-seller to contact the manufacturer for assistance.  Seven days and no response from my online support request so I called support on the phone.  The recording states they no longer use the phone for support, on-line only.  So, sent another request for assistance or replacement.  Four days later no response.  So I have this $150 piece of plastic for a paper weight.  Thus far I am not very pleased with the product or customer support from anyone involved and my daughter is bummed to say the least.  Still no response just automated e-mails.
