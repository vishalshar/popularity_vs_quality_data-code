Such a good concept.  Purchased a medium set of these rollers through this same Amazon seller on their own website & purchased these through Amazon to add-on.  Have only been using the click n' curl rollers for about a week & half.  Saw my hairdresser for a bang trim over the weekend & she asked what I was doing differently about styling my hair - that she saw TONS of new breakage.  Before these rollers, I had VERY healthy looking, shiny hair because it was very healthy.  Before use I watched the instructions both on Joyus (skip those, WRONG unless you like frizzy looking hair) & on their site so I'm not doing it incorrectly - the act of seating these rollers in your hair/scalp is what causes the breakage - the top rollers will NOT stay in unless you dig them into your scalp - more breakage & uncomfortable.  The design of these rollers are that the bristles are longer - that is supposed to keep them in your hair - it does help the sides & back, not the top & only if you don't move around or look down, no looking down. Super sized clips might help but once you put together all the pieces together for traveling, you're really not saving any space or time. VERY disappointing!  Going back!!!!!
