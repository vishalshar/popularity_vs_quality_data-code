So after having owned this for a while here is my take on it.1. Falling behind in the market. Other systems offer much better capabilities.2. No wind gauge.3. Inaccurate and slow to update. Just look at their forums. Tons of accuracy problems, people having to calibrate weekly. Humidity is always off, and temp changes sometimes never catch up, as it only measures every 10 minutes. Very slow to update.4. No way to monitor this without logging in. Meaning you have to use their servers to read your data. No desktop panel or anything. If you want to check it, you have to log in to an app or server. You cant just set up a panel and glance at it when you want.5. Not special as far as apps go. Other stations off applications as well, that are just as good but report faster. This system only reports every 10 minutes. Other systems can report as fast as every 30 seconds.6. Extremely limited. Only 3 addition modules, and no additional outdoor modules. Want one in a shed, barn, or garage? Out of luck, additional modules cannot handle freezing or hot temps.7. Rain gauge is only accurate with light or semi medium rains. Anything stormy or serious, and it starts to fall behind. Sometimes very quickly. Also they recommend you bring the rain gauge in once temps hit 40 degrees f and below. So if you want something that you can use for those fall and spring storms when the temps are around 35 degrees and changing, your out of luck. This is a warm weather, light rain system only. Plus mounting it is a PIA. It has a camera style hole on the bottom...8. Look elsewhere. This system has serious accuracy flaws, no ability to add a user screen to monitor it without logging in, constant problems with having to calibrate, and limits you to 3 extra modules. My house has more than 3 rooms in it, does yours? Plus extra modules have to be indoors. I wouldnt recommend this, nor would I have purchased it if I knew the system would stay so limited. Get a Davis Unit, or Ambient and just add the internet station adapter. Then you will at least have both the app, and the ability to check it at home without having to log in. Just look at all the complaint on their forums of accuracy issues.
