I think the glow of colors in the toilet bowl if not only fun and functional but it doesn't stay securely on the side of the bowl.  Plus the little suction cups will pop off from main box.  When this happens you can not not reattached them.  I would have given it higher stars if it wasn't for the major malfunction on the attachment.  Perhaps it will have a style change since it was on SHARK TANK.
