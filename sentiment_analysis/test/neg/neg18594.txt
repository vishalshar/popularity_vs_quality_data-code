I just had to return my White 800 and switch to hue.The bulbs had great color and brightness along with great build quality.The deal breaker was the constant wifi disconnects. I tried multiple wifi routers and access points including meraki, cisco, and asus. They were the only devices on that SSID. What I don't get is that they have a radio for mesh networking but do not utilize it. You would think that one or 2 bulbs would connect via wifi and the rest would connect to each other, but nope.While I am not a fan of hue, due to lame build quality and horrible brightness, so far they perform their essential action, turning on and off.In the end the latest firmware update put them all into recovery mode. A bulb should always perform its essential function, turning on and off. If it can't do that it's useless.
