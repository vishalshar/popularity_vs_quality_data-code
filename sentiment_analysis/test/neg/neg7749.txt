Wanted so badly to love this product, but even with me getting the metal vision, I found lots of things not to like.  It fit nicely in my 2009 Outback's CD player, but I had to drill out the product (multiple pieces of it...) to get my audio cable to fit through the bottom properly.  Also, all the thread locker and tightening in the world doesn't make the position of the arms permanent like I want.  This just is not well engineered, so as much as it functions ok now that I made it ugly as heck, I regret the purchase and wish I had gone with another company's product.  :/
