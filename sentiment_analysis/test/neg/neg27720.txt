I absolutely love the magnetic attaching feature of this case. That being said, the black trim surrounding the case constantly pulls away from the case and is not very durable. I've wanted this product for a long time, so I was a tad disappointed with the peeling issue especially for the cost. I would like to upgrade to one of the metal cases, looking like it won't be long before that happens due to the peeling. Still a good product.
