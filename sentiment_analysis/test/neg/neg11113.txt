I was really hoping this product was legitimate.  Alas, it didn't work.  Most of the positive reviews here on Amazon are from non-verified purchases.  There was a YouTube video where a guy let several people try this product. He didn't tell them if they were being given the calm for the energize options, and nearly all of them guessed incorrectly.  To bad, I wanted it to be real.
