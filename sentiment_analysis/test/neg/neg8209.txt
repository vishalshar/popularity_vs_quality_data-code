I wish there was an option for 0. Do not be fooled by positive reviews. This coffee maker is frustration in a box. First, let me say it is a lot bigger than I imagined a standard size coffee maker. It has a water reservoir on top that holds calibrations, 6 and 8 cup capacity. It has a basket with a permanent filter, and solid metal base which holds the carafe. Where do I start?1. APP - The app is rated 3.2 and it should be rated -1. First the app is not at all intuitive. It comes from a cloud company called DADO. It seems like an easy enough dream to set up. Download the app. Plug in the machine, connect to DADO, then let DADO find your wifi and you're connected to the internet. After you're connected to the internet brew options are craft, brew and cool (being nonsensical things being advertised that no person who pays $250 for a coffee machine would care about like Starbucks coffee blends).  If it were that simple to set up I would give the maker at least 3 stars even it made decent coffee, but it's not. What about when you app won't find DADO? What about when it does, DADO won't connect to your wifi? What about when it does, it continuously says your coffee maker is offline and offers no remedy other than wait until it finishes brewing (But it's not brewing cause you just plugged it in!) So let's say you do get it connected and you're super excited about brewing your first pot of coffee...2. The "pot" of coffee cause you can only brew a pot. Slow bars craft coffee by the cup, then will not let you brew anything less than 5 cups. So I spend $25-$40 on beans imported from all over the world and I have to waste have the coffee because this thing won't let you brew less than six cups??? Let's talk about that brew...3. Be prepared to waste a pound of coffee trying to perfect the settings. Yes, it does let you select the temperature, pre-soak time, and number of cups (6 or 8), but that is really it. If you used to your Chemex, V60 or Aeropress, you better sit down and calculate because you have to get your grind right, your temp right and what you're not going to control is your extraction time. So it's hit or miss and your first couple of tries will produce some of the rankiest tasting coffee ever.4. But let's talk about that carafe. Yes, the carafe does keep your coffee super hot. But to pour from the carafe is ridiculous. It has a spout but unless you're waiting for your kids to grow up between pours, you're going to have to take the top off and release the heat in order to get anything remotely like a regular pour from a regular carafe. This is the worst carafe construction ever because no coffee actually comes out of the pouring spout, it comes out the heat release holes on top of the carafe. Freaking insane.5. So for $250 bucks you're going to get a substandard cup of coffee, with an iffy "connected" app. Oh did I mention, you can program your brew? Yep you can program when your brew goes off. But um when that time comes, it's not going to move forward until you tell you confirm that you have water in your maker. So programming is useless if say, you want your coffee ready when you wake up in the morning unless you actually press the button to confirm that you've put water in the brewer. That's so NOT counter intuitive.I like Behmor. They're roasters are great, coffee makers not so much.
