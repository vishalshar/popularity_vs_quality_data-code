Please stay away from this food. I should have read other bad reviews before buying this product. Last week I gave this treat to my dog, his poop was not normal. I stopped giving it and he came back normal. I thought it might be something else other than this treat. So stupid me, I gave him this treat yesterday again. He got completely upset stomach, got severe diarrhea. Note my dog was completely fine before I gave him the treat. I had to call my vet as he suffered entire night.In short - if you love your dog, please stay away from this food. I will not stop short from making a formal consumer court complain against this brand . I am amazed that Amazon is still allowing them to sell on their website, despite having bad reviews.
