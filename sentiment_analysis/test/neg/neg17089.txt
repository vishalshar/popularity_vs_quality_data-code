From the get go these were really hard to pair with my phone (I bought a set and both had the exact same problems).In fact, even after multiple attempts, including the bizarre "take out the battery and put it back in" (WTF? That's like people hitting their tvs to improve reception), both TrackRs only successfully paired once and when I did a trial separation from the phone (to see how the entire setup would work), I was never able to repair either TrackRs.The following day, I took the two TrackRs with me on the bus when I started my morning. I kept trying over and over again to pair them to my phone. Even the battery removal didn't help. I gave up and put them away intending to just return them.That same day, as I was heading home, I forgot my wallet on the bus.Not only was that day a particularly awful day, but it happened at the end of an similarly awful week. Plus, the complete failure of the TrackRs due to innate pairing problems was just adding insult to injury.I decided to try this particular brand because I surmised that since these are second generation devices, and TrackR has large user base, surely I'd deal with less bugs and defects.I guess I was wrong, and I've never been more disappointed in a product.The TrackR alarm volume is very faint, even on the highest setting, during the test separation, I could barely hear the one in my wallet, and it was impossible to hear the one in my backpack. So maybe I'd have lost my wallet either way, in which case I'd be out the money I wasted on these. At least I had the good sense to put them in my backpack, so I can get a refund.
