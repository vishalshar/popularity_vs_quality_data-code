Really wanted to like this because the great price point.  With the free year of 1-day recording, it's half the price of a top competitor!But after setting it up and contacting Oco customer service, I discovered that the 1-day cloud recording is a little bit misleading.  The Oco cam only records after it's been triggered by a motion or sound event.  So if you're expecting to go back and review all the footage from the last 24-hours, not possible.  And to make matters worse, it will automatically stop recording after a few minutes even if there is sound or motion.  (I even changed the settings to the most sensitive settings)I assume this is to save storage space and cost for Oco and is acceptable for some consumers but not for me.  What's the point of having it record an event only to shut off on it's own after a few minutes??
