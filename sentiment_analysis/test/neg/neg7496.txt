Bad:  I wore it less than two weeks (1 hour running and 1 hour biking each day) and had not even washed yet and the jacket developed multiple small tears under the armpits and on the sleeves where the fabric bends.  In other spots the reflective material fell off of the outside of the jacket.Good:  It was very reflective.  I felt very sure that cars were able to see me in the dark.
