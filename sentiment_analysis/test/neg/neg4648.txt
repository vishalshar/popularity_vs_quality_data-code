DON'T waste your money. Clever design with a serious flaw. Car got hot today, 90 degree day, left it for a few hours. 3m dual sided tape failed. Unless you're prepared to superglue this to your car, or go out and find some very temperature-resistant adhesive, this is a design that will disappoint you. Save your money. Buy something else.
