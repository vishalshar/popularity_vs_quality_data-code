The reviews I read paint an unreliable product, with gimmicky syncing with the phone and sporadic stops of the time. Well it turns out I wasn't lucky. It should work right out of the box but it didn't. After I took it to a watch shop to replace the battery, I could activate it, but the time stopped after 2 hours. Syncing with the phone corrected the time, not for long though. I cannot rely on the watch for time, so I have to return it. It's a shame the watch looks beautiful.
