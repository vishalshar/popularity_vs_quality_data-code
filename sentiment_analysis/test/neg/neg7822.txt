Not that great, I am actually going to return it.While the concept is great and the hardware is nice I just wish it worked as advertised.Example:Oh look its raining, gee I do not have to worry about turning off the sprinklers...Wrong! the sprinklers are going off... not once..every time.I really wish it worked, I wish the app wasn't so basic and really had more flexibility and information.  It is basically an on and off button.. I see reviews with answers from blossom promising updates and changes a year ago but it clearly hasn't happened.Going to go with a Rachio instead.... Sad because the price point was right....
