This works as intended, but the trajectory of the toss is very low. The ball was fired into my dog's left eye, it is swollen and she is in grave pain. Train your puppy to clear the canon by at least 10 feet, I wasn't able to though.Balls are very small, perfect for only very small breeds. My Cavalier KC is too large for this, I should've gotten the larger one.Also, the "inaudible" tone that the machine produces is audible to humans :(Hope this helps
