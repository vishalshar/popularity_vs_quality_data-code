It's a bluetooth device. It's not meant to find your lost cat in the woods or your stolen car or anything like that as bluetooth barely goes from room to room in my house. If you understand this, I think you will find this device really useful. Here's my use...(ANDROID PHONE)In the morning I often have trouble locating my keys (the TrackR is on them). Instead of frantically searching for them I just walk into a room, wait a 15-20 seconds while pressing the chime button in the app, and move to the next room if I don't hear anything. It's worked everytime for me and certainly saved me 30 dollars worth of my time.In the evening sometimes I have still have my keys in my pocket and have misplaced my phone. I walk to places where I think I might have left it and smash the button on the TrackR and find my phone right away even though it's on silent.The phone only alarms for a certain amount of time, but I believe that is adjustable. This is easier than ringing the phone from my pc or girlfriend's phone.I have yet to use the other features, so I cannot comment on those.I'm docking a star because the device itself has already gotten a dent in it from being on my keys. Anything made to be put on keys needs to be built strong as it'll likely see a lot of abuse. Other than that, I'm quite happy with my TrackR.UPDATE: I have had a couple occasions where I could not ring my phone from my TrackR. It simply did not work until I opened the app on my phone. Not sure if this is a connection issue or software. I also occasionally get "new bluetooth device connected" notifications on my phone for the TrackR connection. Still, it has worked every time when ringing from phone to TrackR and has worked the other way 9/10 times. It's saved me a lot of time so the 4 stars still stays.UPDATE 2: It completely died after about a month. Maybe it was just the battery, but I threw it in the trash anyways. Adjusted down to 2 stars. It was nice while it worked but I can't recommend it.
