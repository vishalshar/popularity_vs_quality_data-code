This lock isn't very reliable.  It often thinks it's locked when it's not.  This is utterly unacceptable and downright dangerous.  The app should under no circumstances be telling me that the door is locked when it actually isn't.  It often won't unlock automatically when you come home the way it's supposed to.It was also advertised to be able to automatically lock when you leave the house.  There isn't even an option to do this.  Their doorbell suffers from similar false advertising.
