What I should have gotten:one small spawn bag filled with ground coffee substrate colonized by only oyster mushroom myceliumWhat i got:an old overgrown mushroom colony soaking in its own waste left to be over powered by mold.I was very excited to give this to my brother for Christmas. After he opened the box he showed me that the substrate was contaminated with green mold. I let the company know that my product was contaminated but they wanted me to send the product back for me to get a replacement. I decided to cut my losses and pitch it rather than to pay big $$$ to ship it back. You would think with how much they make on these that they could have better service. I really don't enjoy writing a review like this but no effort so far has been made to remedy the situation.Check to make sure your kit is contamination free before you use it and if mold does take over do not harvest any more.I just hope that someone doesn't grow contaminated mushrooms and get sick.
