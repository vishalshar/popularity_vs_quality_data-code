I bought these stickers so that I could tag each of our family Christmas gifts with a unique video message.  However, every time I scan a new tag, and tell it to upload a new video, the tag always plays the very first video that I uploaded.  So after trying to setup 12 different labels, they all play the exact same video.  I have tried everything I can think of with no joy.  I even tried using a different phone to scan the new tags and upload the videos, and every tag still showed the very same video I had uploaded for tag #1.  I tried reaching out to Tine Support but haven't heard from them yet.  Unfortunately our Christmas party is coming up in just a couple of days, and now our whole plan of using video tags is ruined.I think the concept behind these tags is brilliant.  However, there is obviously a problem linking the uploaded videos with the tags.  So at this point I would not recommend these tags until the company gets the bugs worked out.  Don't make the same mistake I did, and waste your money on tags that you can't return (since mine are all stuck on Christmas gifts).  :-(
