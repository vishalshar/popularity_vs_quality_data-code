I thought this thing ran on batteries and expelled the balls with more force . I paid 100 dollars which includes shipping for a product that is worth 30 delivery included .  The sad thing is , is it would cost another 40 to return so I'd be out 80 dollars . It will sit and collect dust . The dogs ate a ball within 3 minutes . Ping pong balls work in this product too . Half a refund and I'd be a lot happier .
