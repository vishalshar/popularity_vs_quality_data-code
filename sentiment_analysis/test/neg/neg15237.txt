I really wanted to like this phone. It actually makes a stellar first impression. The packaging is excellent, and the phone design is unique and stylish. When I first picked it up out of the box, I fell in love with the design. It's unlike any other phone on the market. However, upon booting it up, you'll notice the biggest problem this phone has: performance.Simply put, the performance of this phone is unacceptable. Every tiny action you do causes lag and stuttering. Scrolling through the settings menu? The phone stutters. Swiping through the home screen? Stutters. This phone cannot handle the most basic tasks a smartphone does without noticeable lagging and stuttering. Considering the phone is near stock Android (only some light color changes and other tweaks) and has no carrier bloat, it just makes no sense. At first, I though maybe something was wrong, so I reset the phone, cleared the cache, and started fresh. Even after that, there was no improvement.I've used the LG G4, Moto X Pure Edition, and Nexus 5X. All of them identical hardware (Snapdragon 808, 3GB RAM) and yet all three do not have any of the performance problems the Robin has. Fortunately, that should mean it's a software issue. I'm hoping the upcoming Nougat update will help, but it's a toss up at this point.As of now, I cannot recommend this phone at all, even heavily discounted. On paper, the Nextbit Robin has so many advantages over something like the Moto G4 Play, but I would honestly recommend the Moto G4 Play over this.
