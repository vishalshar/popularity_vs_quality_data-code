To my horror, no matter how the interior reflective mirror is adjusted, the laser periodically shines directly at a cat's eye level, potentially damaging the feline's sensitive retina. Although, that became less of a problem, as the interior rotational motor soon got stuck, as to shine the laser back and forth an average of 3in., depending on the angle of the reflective mirror. I brought the item and the box to my workroom to try to change the angle of rotation and correct the jammed gear mechanism, only to find a weird, ominous warning basically saying don't service, throw away if malfunctioning. Needless to say, neither my cat, nor I are amused.
