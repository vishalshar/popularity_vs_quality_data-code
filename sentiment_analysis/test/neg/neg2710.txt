I owned one of these in the past which worked quite well. I left it on an airplane and so needed to replace it. I read the reviews about the plug prongs being problematic, but my first one worked for six or eight months and had zero issues. So I ordered a replacement and yesterday the prongs suddenly started moving independently and flopping around. I have no idea why as it had not suffered any bumps or bangs. I went to my order today to try to get it replaced and I discovered apparently it's outside the return period from Amazon. This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in an Amazon policy.
