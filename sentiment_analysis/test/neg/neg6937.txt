Thought i'd take the chance of being an early adapter, seems like things arent all together with this company. Set up the service, turned on the box, it wont go past the welcome screen. Based on potential, i'm going to try a replacement. If it doesnt work, my search for a free dvr moves on.Update: My search for a free dvr carries on. This is a real piece of s***. I fully realized that when it failed to record a game for me. The reason it gave me is that the storage space was not formatted. Meaning the internal storage that comes with the box is not formatted to the box! Maybe in a few years when they've got their s*** together.
