Its constantly sending dumb alerts to my phone, JUST TELL ME IF HE GETS OUT! I dont need to know that hes STILL in or that the device is on the base. Also, that rubber part on it, yea that got chewed off real quick. The actual metal part is durable. Tracking lags a bit, but if the collar doesnt get chewed off of slipped off then I imagine would be good at tracking.
