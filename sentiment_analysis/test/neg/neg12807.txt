If I could give this thing 0 stars I would. I barley had it for 3 weeks and it doesn't work anymore. When I needed it the most, it became defective. I just want a replacement and the only thing I see that I could do is get a refund. On top of that, shipping gets deducted from your refund and I paid extra for shipping.
