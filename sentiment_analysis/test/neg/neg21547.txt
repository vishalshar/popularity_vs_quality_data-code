If you use an ANDROID PHONE then this is a TRIP LOGGER ONLY!  It works ok but occasionally loses Bluetooth connectivity  with my phone.  The fix is simple, turn the car key to the accessory position and remove and reinsert the adapter into the OBD port.  No big deal but annoying.  If you are, as I am, an Android user looking for real time diagnostics and data you'll have to go with another product.  I'm going to try the OBDLink MX Bluetooth from Palmer Engineering.
