We purchased two of the for our clinic and have had constant issues with them since day 1.  I give the 2 stars because they are very appealing to look at and are very durable as far as craftsmanship.  However, they constantly stop working and freeze up and we have to constantly take the batteries out to reset them even when putting in brand new batteries.  One of the units reads finger prints really well, when it's not freezing up, and the other not so much.  I think we are going to send these back and pay the extra money for a higher end product like Samsung!
