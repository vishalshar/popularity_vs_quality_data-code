I always re-order this because I like the product so much. But the most recent order was not very good. I know what the gummies should look like because I've ordered this before many times. The product was sealed and new, but when I opened it, all the gummies were moist and stuck together. They were wet and smelled bad. They definitely need to figure out how they could control the quality of the product. I am disappointed.
