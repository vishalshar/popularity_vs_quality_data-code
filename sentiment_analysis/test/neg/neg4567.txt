I like these elastic shoelaces, but I don't believe they're a one size fits all. I've only had them for two months and already some of the elastic laces are wearing out/breaking, and I'm unsatisfied with a product that breaks every two months. I have size 10-10.5 shoes/feet personally. Perhaps if my shoe size was 8-9 or less these laces would not stretch so much and break, but that's not the case.
