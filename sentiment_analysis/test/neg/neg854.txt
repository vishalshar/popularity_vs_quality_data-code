This growler is so awesome. It keeps the beer cold, dispenses it to make the perfect pour, and looks great on the counter. The reason for the two stars is the pressure gage doesn't work - it just stays below 0. For this being such an expensive growler I anticipated it to work! I'm a little bummed, since this was a Christmas gift to my boyfriend. I purchased it back in November and it is unfortunately not returnable any longer.
