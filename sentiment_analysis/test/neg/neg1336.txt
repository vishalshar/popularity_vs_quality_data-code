Another s..t object sold with a tricking advertising. If it is more than 15 yards far from your phone it is out of Bluetooth range so it is not true that you can find it out of your home, but this could be acceptable. The main problem is that its ring is so very low that you can listen to it only if you are within 2 feet ( 60 cm ) from the object in a totally silent ambient. I bought it 2 times. Last year and I threw it in the garbage after 1 hour, I bought it again because I thought that it was improved but it is not. Forget it.
