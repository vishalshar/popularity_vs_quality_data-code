Had it installed for a couple weeks and the screen protector cracked. I removed the protector and placed the phone on a life proof case. A couple weeks after that the screen cracked. Not OEM quality. There was also a gap between the screen and the metal phone housing that kept growing like the bracket was coming off of the screen that held it in place. Rough way to loose a 100$
