Sound quality was pretty bad, especially for gaming. Also, I think it could have just been a problem with my set but the left ear cup was noticeably louder than the right. There was a constant hum coming from both speakers but louder on the right. To compare, my Sony PS4 Gold headset is dead silent when no audio is coming through. The mic quality is just okay, but the mic pops really easily.The controls for both the audio volume and the internal mic volume seem to be backwards. You mute and unmute from one ear cup, then have to change the volume on the opposite ear. That would be weird if there were only one volume control...but there are two! One for the main volume and one for your inner mic. It's so confusing!I'm going to return mine and maybe spend a bit more to get a really nice pair that don't sound like junk.
