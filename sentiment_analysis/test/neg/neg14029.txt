While the customer care agent contacting me and was nice about the issue I had, I feel that there is a blaring issue that is not addressed in the manuals or written anywhere else: you CANNOT use more than one per email address, it NEEDS to be registered, and once you register a new device with the same email, the device is WIPED (memories and all). We used 2 devices and came home to nothing after a wedding because the devices were WIPED by the software. The software only stated that the it was registering a new device and provided ZERO warning that doing so would also ERASE everything.
