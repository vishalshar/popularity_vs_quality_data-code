These worked well for a while. I've ordered three sets of 6 refills. The first set of six was great, each refill lasted about 3-4 weeks. I don't know what it is, but the second set was qualitatively different. They didn't last as long, maybe 2-3 weeks. I used the first refill of the second set like I did the previous ones and after three weeks the box was soggy.I cleaned the unit but instead of just pushing the feces into the containment section, the rake would push the litter in there too, so after about two weeks most of the litter was pushed into the containment area. Perhaps my cleaning is not meticulous enough? But then again, if I have to spend a bunch of time scrubbing down the rake on this unit then it defeats the purpose of it being convenient.The third set of six refills has been the worst. At this point my cat will use the crystals for about a week the all the litter gets pushed away and he starts defecating outside the box until I change the tray. I still have three refills left and have switched back to a normal, $5 cat box and a 30lb box of littler for $15 and my cat has had no issues since. I supposed I can use those refills in case I go out of town or something but I do not recommend this product, I guess I'm just tired of all these self-cleaning cat box gimmicks, there seems to be no substitute for spending 1-2 minutes cleaning the box once or twice a day.
