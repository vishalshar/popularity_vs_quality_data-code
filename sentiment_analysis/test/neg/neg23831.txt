Before you open the box fully, just open the main controller, see if it charges.. have now bought and returned it twice, both due to controller not charging.. interestingly the controller I got in the second attempt didn't have a on/off switch.. bizarre (was actually not there).. frustrated. not sure if would do a 3rd attempt.. But, since I bought it on Amazon, was able to return it quite easy..
