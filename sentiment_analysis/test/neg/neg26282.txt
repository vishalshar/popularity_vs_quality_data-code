This product was incredibly hard to install and apply. Especially when it gets to the biggest size that it offers. We bough two of them and I ended up throwing away one of them b/c of the ripples and air bubbles. The second one worked but still have areas were it is not completely smooth, which caused bubbles that's always coming back.If you've ever installed portable cell phone (iphone/android) screen shield protector... picture that with 30x35" size.It is a waste of money. Would like my money back for sure.
