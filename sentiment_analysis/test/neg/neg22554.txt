Setting aside for a moment that this thing should really cost about $7, it does not do what it promises to do. Here's why: it does indeed cover and protect the lens of the P4, but it does nothing to fix the gimbal in a stationary position. Meaning even with it on the gimbal assembly including camera can be torqued and jammed in different directions.To me this cover is not something I would use to transport the Phantom drone. I would just maybe use it briefly between multiple flights just to protect the lens/filter, as it does zero in terms of protecting the gimbal and camera overall.
