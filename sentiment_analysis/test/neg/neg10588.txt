To anyone that is interested in this product to use with PowerPoint. Don't waste your money.  I order this product because I read in here were someone was using this for presentations  WRONG.  It is listed by Amazon as a product suitable for business and Education, again wrong on that account.  The problem is this nice little projector does not throw enough light.  It MUST be used in the dark.  Also the resolution was disappointing.  I purchased a ViewSonic unit from Amazon for the same price.  and the quality of the picture and inputs, basically everything is hands down better.  Just to give this product the benifit of doubt I played a movie and some youtube stuff.....  Again what disappointment for the money you drop on this gadget.
