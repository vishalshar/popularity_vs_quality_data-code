They were just ok. I like how they have the live culture in them. Our dog was on steroids and antibiotics. He had an allergic reaction to...well the vets was not sure. so we liked the ingredients. However, they  were crushed way too much when they arrived.Our dog is a picky eater so I can only say he's not a fan. He likes his homemade peanut butter pumpkin oatmeal cookies better.
