Tried it for dog, stops tracking after he leaves the room. Then comes back in the room, and it says connecting. Setup was clunky.  I have tiles for my keys and it works much better. I just bought this one for the promise of battery changing. It does do that, but don't expect it to track anything consistently unless it's right in front of you.
