I had to contact the Healbe Service many times to assist in getting it to work correctly. They are replacing the one I bought as it would not charge fully, allow me to note hydration status, or recognize it was placed correctly on my arm. It did work for about 3 days. Really like the idea of this, but mine did not work correctly from the outset.
