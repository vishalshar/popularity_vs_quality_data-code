Purchased this one  when it first came out after installing the app it worked great unfortunately they did an update on the app now the camera is  not working as good. got in touch with tech-support and they recommended  I send a Camera back to them for recalibration which I would have to pay shipping to and from. Or I buy a new one ridiculous that's why I'm only going to give this one  now I have a $230 paperweight. Another thing is now you have to register the product which wasn't in the original description .
