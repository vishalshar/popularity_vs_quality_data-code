I had to return mine. The size chart is completely wrong....if you DO order one, be sure and order a size down. I ended up cutting off the top of a "diabetic's" sock to cover my husbands picc line - is cost me about $3, a fraction of this cheaply made "fashionable" prouduct. Do not waste your money!
