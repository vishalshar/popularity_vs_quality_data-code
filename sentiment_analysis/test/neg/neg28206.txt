It had the perfect specs.... but the display was so poor that it rendered the laptop worthless. I really wanted it to work but the display had very low quality resolution, the screen was matte to the point that every thing appeared to have grainy texture. Again, very disappointing. I bought a Lenovo and an MSI, both of which have superior displays. I recommend the GE62 its display and performance is excellent.
