It worked well for the first 2 or 3 times I used it, however today when I was shaking my salad dressing up the bottom broke out and I was covered in my salad dressing! I had bought this because of its size but am really disappointed that only after a couple weeks I now need to go and buy a different salad dressing shaker.
