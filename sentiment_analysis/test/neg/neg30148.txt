The super sticky gel that you stick on your dashboard is super sticky--it ripped the vinyl of the dashboard when it fell off and landed on my passenger seat. Although the mount is sized to accomodate an iPhone 6S Plus in a Defender case, I'm guessing it was just too heavy, and the super sticky gel that prevents mount from falling off instead took off part of dash in the process.
