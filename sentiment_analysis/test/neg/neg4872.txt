They are great conceptually, and there are finally headphones that are affordable and fit in your ear. But about a month in, the speaker stopped working, and I can no longer use them exclusively, which, as you can imagine gets pretty annoying to carry around two sets of headphones. I was really disappointed with the product. If you are going to invest in headphones, they should be quality, and have a longer shelf life. These don't have that shelf life, and therefore, are a shame to buy.
