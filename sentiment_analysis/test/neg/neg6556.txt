Beautifully designed product but that would be the end of it. Despite the stellar reviews, I found the player had really poor range. After about 10ft, the audio began to go in and out. Also the sound quality was subpar compared to a lot of compact portable wireless speakers of equal value. Lastly, it came with a USB port to charge your device but the none of my USB cord would fit into the port. I ended up sending this back.
