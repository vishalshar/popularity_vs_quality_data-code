TAKE THE SPIRE CHALLENGE---set your spire on an inanimate object, and behold as that object, let's say, your bed, or a counter, or a table, breathes at the same rate you were just breathing at...indefinitely.So---it's collecting data on God only knows what, because it is clearly fraudulently claiming to be measuring respiration.  Unless my bed and table are actually breathing, in which case, I'm pretty sure needing a refund for my Spire is the least of my problems.Also---whatever data it is collecting is OWNED by the company.  I'd love to know what they are actually doing with said data, especially since it's clearly NOT actually measuring breathing.I ordered this, downloaded the app, noticed they do not actually collect a baseline against which to measure your breathing or activity, and then put that out of my head and started to try to use the weird little rock on a clip that was supposed to collect data on my breathing and activity levels and the relationship of said levels to my "normal" levels.It never worked consistently with the phone app.I would recommend NO ONE buy this, especially not for 100 bucks.
