My feelings about this product are mixed. I love not having to scoop out poop every other day, which I've done for over 16 years-- almost 17. I had been looking for an automatic cleaner for awhile and finally settled on the Scoop Free litter box after reading all the reviews. I honestly do not know how people say this box lasts for 20-30 days!! At most, 7 days. I have one elderly cat and I stretch the box to about 10 days before it becomes unbearable to open my washroom (where the box is) because of the strong urine smell. I ordered 9 boxes online in the summer '08 thinking they would last the year at least and I just had to reorder another 6 boxes (December '08). I buy in bulk for the reduced price but am finding that with the rising cost, I'll just go ahead and purchase at Target for about a $1 less. If there is some secret to this product that I do not know about, or if my cat is an aberration, I just do not understand how people with 3 cats use this and change every 14-20 days. Do they store it outside where they cannot smell it? I will stick with this because I figure I have a few more years with my cat and it's not worth purchasing something much more expensive. I've already paid much more than I expected to.
