We are VERY disappointed after having tried to contact the company several times (with receipts, pictures, emails) to show them how after only 6 months the band was starting to break and the USB port was bending. Nothing. It got to be so loose that my son was holding it together with Scotch tape! So I suppose it was only a matter of time before he lost it, which he did a couple days ago (I had started contacting the company last month).I waited to leave this review but seeing how they haven't responded AT ALL and the Gameband is now officially gone, I can say that we are not happy with this company. The product was great while it lasted but we got six months only out of it and my son is so upset I'd almost rather he never had it. His teacher and the whole school spent the afternoon looking for it. Very frustrating as this could have been avoided if it was better made or if the company had responded and replaced the faulty band when I first contacted him.I would have considered buying this as Christmas gifts if I felt I could count on the company. Now I can only say that if you get it, be prepared for your child to have some heartbreak or frustrating after six months.
