The Mira fitness tracker met my needs for a stylish alternative to a Fitbit (a product I used for well over a year with absolutely no issues). However apart from its looks, this tracker has been a disappointment. The first Mira I ordered would not power on or charge. After thoroughly reading the online FAQ section on the mymirafit.com website, I contacted Customer Service at Mira. The Customer Service Associate was helpful in determining that I had received a defective product and advised me to return it to Amazon to be replaced. Amazon replaced the Mira, and the second one I received worked well until this weekend; it successfully tracked steps and kept time for just over a month. Unfortunately, now the display does not work, and it no longer tracks steps or displays the time. Of course, the time period for returning Mira to Amazon ended eleven days ago, so now I have a very expensive piece of plastic and metal that does nothing.
