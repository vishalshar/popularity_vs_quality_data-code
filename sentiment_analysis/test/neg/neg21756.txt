After reading the reviews, I purchased this bike for my 6 year old.  He learned to ride it with just two wheels in just a day, but since then it has been all downhill.  The wheels aren't holding air, the hand brake is already broken.  I don't know if we got a dud or if this bike was only meant to last a month.  Very disappointed...
