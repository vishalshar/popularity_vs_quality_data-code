I gave this to my boyfriend for his birthday on July 28th, we had separate coffee makers bc he drinks high test and I drink decaf so he was so happy to have only one unit on the counter. after using it once a day for less than two months the bottom plate under the coffee pot on the right side has multiple chips in it. so now the black coating is showing metal chips though it. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I shop on Amazon often and never had any problems before. apparently the return policy was for only 30 days, I missed it by about two weeks.  Will NOT buy anything from this brand again.
