I had such high hopes for this toy, however I am disappointed. The idea is a fabulous one, but the band and the app falls short. The connection is patchy and sounds are "set" and leaves for very little creativity for a child to play. The band and app lose connection with each other, and no matter what trouble shooting we tried, nothing worked but turning it off and going back to it  a much later time. I think the concept for this band is great, it needs a lot improvement to really let a child be creative. So disappointed.
