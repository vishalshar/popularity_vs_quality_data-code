Update: Looked at the other low reviews and most are pretty accurate. The picture is NOT at all what is sent to you. Look at my pictures. The product pictures are supposed to be like my old Elite collar with a plastic-rubber collar. What is sent to you is a completely different model with a fabric collar but box is labeled like the pictured model number (check out model PDT00-13625, that's the collar you really get).***I just received this collar and my dog has not even worn it for a full week until the receiver fell apart from the collar! The contacts and pieces that held it on the collar are nowhere to be found (and replacements are just as hard to find online.) I came home one day and found the receiver on the floor but the collar still on my dog. I did not use this 24/7 nor did I have my dog wear it that often. I give him rest periods where I take it off for half the day then put it back on as needed. It worked great when it was in one full piece. But I am really upset at Petsafe and this product for poor construction that it would break down in just a few days!I already have the Elite dog system with remote from over a year ago but the original collar no longer works. I thought buying this add-on collar would be a cheaper solution replacement to still use the remote I have that does work. But this collar is constructed completely different from the Elite collar(see attached pictures). This is a fabric collar that has holes in it to attach the receiver, but there are a lot of extra pieces in between the receiver and the contacts to keep it on the collar. Essentially making the collar prone to falling apart, like what happened. My original Elite collar doesn't have this issue because the collar doesn't come in between the receiver at all. So the contacts are secure with a very small chance of falling off because nothing is in between them.Another con was that this collar did not sync with my remote like the instruction book said. I had to play around with the remote buttons trying different combinations until the dog number option popped up. It was still having issues connecting so I just made the add-a-dog collar as the "first dog" option instead of "second dog," which finally got it to work.Since I can't use the contacts on my Elite collar(female contacts) with the add-a-dog collar(male contacts), this is now just a huge waste of money for quality that just isn't there.
