I have bought this product for years and loved it. The products is still good but the company pulled a "fast one on the unsuspecting public.  To satisfy those existing and potential customers who care about such things (mostly millennials who are brainwashed and paranoid about the food that they consume)  they made a HUGE deal about going "uncured" sometime in the past year.  At the same time, and without any notice to customers they reduced the size of the product by about fifteen percent.  I just noticed that they have reduced the size AGAIN. The price has remained the same despite the fact that product quantity has been reduced approximately 20 percent.  To me this is unethical.  I guess they knew that there are enough consumers out there that are so hung up in thinking they need all these "pure" foods, that they are willing to pay anything to be "in" with all of the food trends that they are brainwashed to think are important.Not me.  I'll find an equally tasty pepperoni from a company who doesn't try to pull the wool over the eyes of their customers!
