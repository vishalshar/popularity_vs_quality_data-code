I hate this phone I purchased this phone because of the size but it is a great disappointment a month or so after purchase the phone froze up on me and I couldn't receive or send texts. I contacted the company and they sent me a new/refurbished phone lo and behold I after spending $25 to download data from old to new I still can't receive text messages. I hate this phone please don't buy Buy only if you want a substandard phone.
