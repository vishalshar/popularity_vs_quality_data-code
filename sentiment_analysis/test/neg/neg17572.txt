The lock was working fine for the first two months. After that, the locks starts to auto-unlock the door at random times during the day and night. This is very dangerous if you do not have another secure door. Also, the knob mechanism now feels very rugged when turning. I have sent multiple complaints to August including the log history but they are unable to resolve it and gave me a crappy reply.
