Putting this together and noticed a problem. I have six servos. #1, #1, #2, #4, #5, #6. I should have a #3 but instead I have two #1's. From what I can tell from the instructions, and logic, I'm not going to be able to build a working robot. So, on Christmas night, I have a bummed out kid, a bummed out dad and a bum robot. I have emailed the Jimu support and am waiting to hear back from support, who I am sure have the night off to spend with their families putting together their working presents?I don't mean to be petty, but it seems like even the most rudimentary quality control would keep there from being duplicate servos when the instructions are VERY VERY insistent that you use the correct servos each step of the way.So I'm the lucky guy who gets to tell his kid that we got a bum kit.Fortunately we also got an mbot Maker Bot that he is enjoying immensely so he can spend the evening coding it with mblockly and having fun with that...I will report back and see how they handle my bad servo situation. Hopefully it will impress me. I'll let you know.
