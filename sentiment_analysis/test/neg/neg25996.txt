Not too impressed overall.  For the price, seems too much focus was spent on packing them full of tech and not enough making it actually work.  Noise cancelling is so-so.  Touch response is mixed, frequently get the wrong response (I waited a bit as they say there is a learning curve, and while that is true it's still not as fluid as I expected - double taps are hard to get through, you have to hit a very small target area which is difficult to do while running, and occasionally it will turn volume down when I swipe forward/up).I can't speak to the fitness tracker as the two workouts it was supposedly tracking never showed up, and they disconnected and would not reconnect the third time I tried (running without music really sucks if you were wondering :)).  If you're looking for a fitness tracker I wouldn't rely on these.Battery is also disappointing.  The charging case is a creative solution, but after a week (and only one use) they were completely dead even though they were sitting in the charging case.  So it seems they draw a decent amount of power even in the off state - pretty much have to leave them plugged in if you want them ready to go when you are, which defeats the point of the charging case (I expected to get four or five uses out of them between charges, now it's one more device I have to always have plugged in).Bluetooth is very weak.  I had my phone on my left arm and it couldn't maintain a link, had to switch to my right arm.  The link between the earbuds themselves seems fine, once I got them running initially I haven't had any problems there.Overall not impressed so far.  Hoping some or all of these issues can be fixed via software updates, it appears they have done a lot of work to date.  I trusted some tech site reviews I read over the Amazon reviews and it appears I shouldn't have.  Happy to update if things improve, if they worked as promised they would be well worth it.
