This device, and the support that comes with it is absolutely horrible. You should not even bother selling it until you learn how to create a user experience worth having.From the website & ios app you can not do the following:1. delete an existing device from an account2. restart pairing after a device was reset3. add the device to a different account after a tado.com account is locked into a device4. connect to a device via wifi and do anything if it's not already paired or a tado account is expecting to pair with it5. get support during US business hours6. delete a tado.com account7. make use of the qr code for registration instead of having to type the whole serial number by handIronically, you can do a bunch of stuff from their website that you shouldn't be able to do1. Modify the core login e-mail address to invalid characters2. Modify all the home and location information to invalid data3. Perform a hardware reset following instructions from your website that render the device useless without help from a support team based in Munich4. change a password to a single character, including invalid characters5. change a password without validating the existing passwordAnd generally, the adhesive strips provided, leave goo on the wall, and rip. Choose a real 3M adhesive to protect your customer's walls and provide a secure grip.Shipping this horrible product back today.
