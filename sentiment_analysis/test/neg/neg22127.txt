My dog's have eaten barking at the moon for well over a year. Before I found lower pricing on Amazon I purchased from a pet supermarket. I have never had any issue. My most recent purchase I noticed a change in packaging, but there is no indication of any changes in the formula or ingredients. Both of my dogs were sick within 24 hours of eating this food. We do not feed table scraps or give snacks, and both dog's are leash walked. So I am confident that it is an issue with the food rather than an environmental issue. I have contacted solid gold and am waiting for a response from them. I am very disappointed with the situation, I will most definitely be changing the brand to a more responsible company after they see the vet.
