I previously purchased these at Target and the sweetener listed is Coconut Nectar. On the website this is what it says too, but the actual product I received listed the sweetener as Cane Sugar. In my opinion the taste is different - the version with Coconut Nectar is far better. If you are looking to avoid sugar, this is not the product for you.
