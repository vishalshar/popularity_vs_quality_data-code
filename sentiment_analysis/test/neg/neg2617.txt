It's an attractive concept but it doesn't seem to keep the fish healthy.I purchased this for my betta and within a week he died.  I followed the directions to a tee. I'm not sure what went wrong but I think the pump was defective and not properly filtering the water to keep the fish healthy, or there is some kind of flaw in the system.  Prior to this, I had the betta in a 1 gallon unfiltered tank and he was fine with frequent water changes.  The health of the fish comes first to me; the plant growing part was just an added bonus.  Unfortunately I can't trust this tank to keep my fish happy and healthy so I can't use this product anymore.  Bettas need warm water to thrive and this tank doesn't even include a heater or mention the need to install one, nor does it provide a slot to install one.  I'm still mourning the loss of my betta and hope others who have this tank have managed to keep a healthy betta and won't be subject to the same sad fate.
