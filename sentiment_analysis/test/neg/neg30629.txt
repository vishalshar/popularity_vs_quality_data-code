I have configured my own Ethernet network, routers and WiFi access points (AP) for several years.  But I could not get the Logitech Harmony Elite to setup and operate my TV and surround sound system.  Because of the lack of feedback in the install setup routine, it was impossible to trouble shoot where the problem was.  After 3 frustrating hours fighting with the install routine, I decided this was way too much effort for a TV remote, and returned the product.  It is unfortunate.  I have 3 other Logitech remotes - two Harmony One and an older 900 - that have setup easily in about 10 minutes through the USB port on the PC and worked fine for years.First, be aware that you cannot setup the Elite without both a smartphone and a wireless network.  When the wireless setup failed, I tried to setup the remote using the Harmony PC software through the USB port, but it would not let me finish the routine without moving to wireless.  The difficulty with the Elite is that there are 5 sets of devices that have to successfully communicate with one another in order to setup the remote and have it work - (1) your smartphone (2) your wireless network (3) the Logitech Hub (4) the Elite remote, and (5) your TV, AV receiver, cable box, and DVD.  And these devices are using different radio functions to do that - some WiFi, some Bluetooth, and some infrared.  The setup routine uses your smartphone to connect to your wireless network, and then uses the smartphone to interface through your wireless network over the internet between Logitech servers and the Hub. As the system is designed, the Hub is supposed to become the center of everything.  When you use the Elite remote, it communicates with the Hub, which in turn communicates with your TV and AV equipment. But first you have to communicate with the Hub and set it up through your smartphone and wireless network. I was able to determine that the Hub had in fact communicated with my smartphone and connected to the wireless network, but not because of anything in the Logitech software setup routine that told me that.  I had to manually login to my router to see what devices had connected to it.  This system design also requires that wireless devices connected through your access point (AP) be able to talk to one another.  This fact is buried deep in the online setup help for the remote.  However, many APs have a security setting that prevents this.  You need to login to your wireless AP and disable that setting in order for the Elite to setup and work.  I'm sure the average person looking for a TV remote knows how to do this.  And of course, when you disable this security setting in order for the Elite to work, it means that if someone does hack into your WiFi network, (or heaven forbid,you have an open, unencrypted wireless network) they will have no trouble accessing other devices connected to your WiFi, such as your laptop or smartphone.I was never able to figure out whether the problem was communication between the smartphone and the Hub, between the Hub and the remote, or between the Hub and the TV and AV receiver.  There is nothing in the setup routine to give you a confirmation as you proceed through the setup routine that the various devices have established a connection and are in fact communicating with one another.  You find out that they are not when nothing works and the remote remains dead on your table top.  And it is any one's guess whether this is because of a communication problem in the software, something in the setup routine that didn't take, or maybe you just got a bad Hub.  Or a bad remote. Maybe its the IR from the Hub that doesn't work.  Or maybe it's the Bluetooth in the remote.  Or both.  The entire experience reminded me of the  often finicky and buggy first generation devices of the early wireless era.  What Logitech seems to have forgotten, is that era is supposed to be behind us, and most of us have better things to do with our time than futz with products that, in my opinion, are not ready for prime time.
