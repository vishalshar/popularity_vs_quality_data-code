This cable is advertised as "the toughest cable on earth". After owning this cable for less than a month and using it less than a dozen times, the lighting connector ripped away from the cable shroud under lateral / shear force, rendering it useless. The fact the cable does not bend easily means that there is a strong lateral force induced on the lightning connector when the iDevice is moved while charging, putting a large strain on the connector.I think there's some more engineering work to do here to improve the design.
