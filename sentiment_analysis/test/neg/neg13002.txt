I felt like I had done a lot of research on this watch--apparently not. If you have an android phone, youll love this watch. If you have an apple phone--like me-- don't get it!!!! It actually says on the instructions for getting apps on your watch "If you have ios, you will not be able to download any apps"........... don't know how that got missed. Even after I opened it and tried setting it up, I re-looked online to see how I missed that--and it says "compatible with android and ios", and it is, technically (because you can get texts from your phone). But you cannot do any other apps--maps, fitness tracking. None. Hahahaha funny, not funny.
