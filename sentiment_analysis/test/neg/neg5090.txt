Bought this a few days ago.  It never recorded sleep.  I work third shift.  Then I discovered it only records sleep during certain hours (apparently at night to benefit people who work banker's hours).  I left it off my wrist to simulate sleeping during the night and it still didn't record sleep.  Promptly returning.  The company was misleading saying it automatically tracked sleep.  It does not if it only tries between certain hours.  The Fitbits do it automatically at all hours.  This is nothing more than an expensive pedometer.Update:  So misfit tech support tells me the Ray only has the capability of tracking your sleep at night but they are hard at work with trying to fix that.  If their other models do it why can't the Ray?  Seems like that would've come up in development...the fact that a great number of people sleep at different times of the day.
