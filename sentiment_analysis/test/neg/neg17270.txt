Unusable. Wants me to plug into my laptop to activate. Won't activate without updating firmware. Firmware update keeps failing and asking me to reboot. After an hour and a half I give up on this $450 pair of sunglasses.Wish this worked as advertised.UPDATE:Got the glasses working. They are uncomfortably heavy and buggy. Music control constantly crashes, maps won't load, camera is slow to respond. Would be worth $200 as a novelty for occasional use, nowhere near ready for prime time or regular use. Using the glasses ultimately detracts from the workout. Cannot recommend at this point.
