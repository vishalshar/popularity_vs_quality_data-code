The drone flies OK but the Avatar mode only works sometimes. You cannot view what the camera is seeing nor even know what the camera is looking at. I cannot find any detailed instructions on how to work the drone. I emailed ehang and the information that they supplied was worthless. The camera did not work at all and seems to be a piece of junk.
