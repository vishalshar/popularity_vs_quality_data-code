First thing is it's hard on the nose. I had to get a Band-Aid so I can stand it enough to try to get it setup. I never could put my router password in because the number pad was blurry and way, way to hard to navigate the thing. You end up putting letters you don't mean to because it's so sensitive. I tried everything I could to get my right eye focused, but it didn't happen so it ruined the pic for me. It looks like your in the middle of a theater and it was clear in the middle of the screen, but the sides were all blurry. Sound is good! They need to make a hand controller like the rift has instead of the knob on the ear. I kept hitting volume all the time. It's just not for me. They got the 3D down if it was blurry on the sides.
