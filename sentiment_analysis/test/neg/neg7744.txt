This seemed like a really good idea when I saw the video. However, the execution just doesn't work on several levels. First, it doesn't work well for phones with wide protective cases. Our LG G2 has an Empire MPERO IMPACT X silicon protective case. It won't fit in the phone holder plastic guides. The grooves are just not wide enough. It will fit in the holder designed for the tablets, but even then those slots could be a bit wider. However, the bases on the that holder are so wide, they overlap (see photo from backside).  The plastic guides for the phone were designed with threaded inserts for the screws in the bottom and little cleats to hold them in the grove of the metal bracket so they won't twist. For some reason, the plastic guides for the tablet only get thumb screws and nuts. Looks like the plastic guides were an after thought for the tablet. I cut part of the bottom guides on mine with a saw so they won't overlap. This brought up the next problem. When mounting the unit into the CD slot, there is just too much play. They included some rubber gasket material that's supposed to address this issue, but that did not help much. On a smooth road, this my be fine, but drive on a rough road, hit a bump or pot hole, and your phone is going to be jumping up and down and an inch or more. Looks like this was wasted money.
