I have ordered this mug twice now. The first time I was so excited, and anxiously awaited the arrival of my cool new copper mug! Instead, when I opened up my box (which was clearly made for the right mug) I found a black plastic one instead.. the suction function worked though, so I forgave all and ordered my refund, and reordered the same item. Just got the second order today. This time it's the right mug!! Just it doesn't work AT ALL. The "vacuum" doesn't exist, and it leaks out of the top also. Do not buy this mug. I really tried. I'm sad now. Do not buy this mug...
