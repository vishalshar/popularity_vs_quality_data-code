These were a great IDEA, but they did not work properly. I blame it on the app since it is the only way to control them. They did OK if I was only using a couple of lights but trying any more than about 3 they would start acting on there own. Turning on and off randomly. If they made them more reliable I would buy them again but for now I unfortunately had to return them.
