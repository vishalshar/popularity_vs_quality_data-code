I was really set to love these and order a million more sets for all my son's shoes, but I didn't. They're little more than plastic buttons. I got them for my son's Converse because he hates to tie his shoes, but now he can barely get his shoes on. They don't stretch very much at all, and are prone to snapping open when he tries to squeeze his feet in. He has to fight for several minutes to get his shoes on now; the top ones are the same size as the bottom ones, and there's very little elasticity. These might be ok for REALLY little kids' shoes, but not for adults or large-footed kids. They also don't look as cool on the shoes as they do in the package; they just look like cheap plastic.
