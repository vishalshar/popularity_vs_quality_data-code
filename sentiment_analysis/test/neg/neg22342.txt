The technology is pretty good (some issues with missed putts or duplicate shots that need constant adjustment). Also, it's too bad there is no online editing function, because editing the shots on the iPhone image is difficult on such a small screen. The BIG PROBLEM is they use Apple maps instead of Google maps for their GPS overlay. Unfortunately Apple updates their maps only every 3 yrs or so, whereas google maps is updated regularly. The result is my home course, which was renovated over a year ago is showing an outdated map of the old course. Arccos has no solution except to wait for an Apple maps update (which is scheduled for 2018). This renders the Arccos system completely useless for me.
