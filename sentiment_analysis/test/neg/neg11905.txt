This is the first time I am writing a review on an Amazon purchase. I bought these vitamins in hopes to increase my water intake, as I have a hard time keeping properly hydrated and the fact of having to use soluble vitamins would force me to drink more water, especially if the flavor was pleasant. Boy, was I wrong. These taste absolutely HORRIBLE! Drinking my daily vitamins turned out to be a torture. The idea is great, but the flavor needs to be changed to something palatable. I ended up having to throw them away and going back to taking my regular prenatal capsules. Total waste of money. Do not recommend.
