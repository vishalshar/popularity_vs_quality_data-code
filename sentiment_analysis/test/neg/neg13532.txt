I thought this would be a good quality bicycle for my kid based on the good reviews. But after less than one year of rare use, the bicycle is now sit there as a garbage. 2 or 3 of the wires from the front wheels has broken. Because of those broken wires, the front wheel keeps shaking when my kids ride it. Before the wire broken, the chains drops frequently which is very frustrating, moving the back wheel doesn't help. This is totally a bad choice. Not recommended. Don't buy!
