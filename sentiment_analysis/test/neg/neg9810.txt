I received a laser pointer for Christmas several years ago and the only thing I ever use it for is playing with my cats. I always get tired of playing before they do so when I saw the Amazon listing for the FroliCat I bought it. It arrived and I set it up. I turned it on and thought "That's so cool." First cat got up from nap and came into living room. I turned on the FroliCat and the cat went wild chasing the laser dot. For about three minutes. Second cat came out a while later and I turned on the FroliCat for him. He played chased the dot for about five minutes. Neither cat has payed any attention at to it since.But they still chase my old fashioned human operated laser pointer. The FroliCat says that it is interactive but it isn't; it moves the laser dot around on a semi-random pattern with no interaction from the cat. The FroliCat laser dot moves too fast and too far to keep the cat's interest. I don't think that cats like anything that moves faster than they do. When I move the laser dot around I really do interact and don't move it very fast or very far away so they can keep catching it.My cats will play for hours with a paper bag and less than ten minutes with the FroliCat. Cute but not worth the cost.
