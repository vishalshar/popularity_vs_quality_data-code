If you planning on buying this for use with the Echo your going to be disappointed.  Simply put,,, Amazon says it compatible.  It's not.  I received mine and after not being discoverable to the echo I spent 2 hours with Belkin.  Bottom line is that you have to perform numerous firmware to "make it Echo compatible".  However I wasn't able to perform even the first firmware upgrade. It simply would not talk to the Belkin mothership despite an excellent signal to the router.  So is it compatible after a firmware update?  Beats me...  Never made it past the first version firmware update.
