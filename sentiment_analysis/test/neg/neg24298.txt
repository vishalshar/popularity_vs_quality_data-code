I purchased this case on a recommendation from a friend that the magnetic mount was very convenient to use while driving.  Upon receiving this case I immediately installed the magnetic mount on my dashboard.  I found the use of this mount to be very convenient and quickly fell in love with this case.  This love was short lived when the day came I needed to take a picture at night.  The auto flash went off on the camera and overexposed the image completely.  I had taken pictures with my phone before I got the case so I knew there wasnt an issue with the camera.  I took the case off and took the picture again and didnt have any issues.  I realized the flash was bouncing off the side of the camera cut out of the case and was illuminating into the lens, causing the overexposure.  Its such a good case for protection it makes it quite inconvenient to take the case off every time you want to take a picture that needs a flash.  I checked with my friend that had recommended this case and he told me he had the same problem with his and his wifes phone.  He didnt realize it was caused but the case; he thought the camera on his phones was not any good for taking night pictures.  I contacted rokform immediately and they told me they hadnt heard of this issue.  They offered to send me out a replacement case.  I didnt think it was going to do any good since my friend had two other cases with the same problem but I figured Id give it a try.  Upon receiving the warranty replacement case, I took pictures in a dark room and immediately duplicated the problem.  The practicality of mounting my phone in my car is not worth loosing the functionality of a great camera that is part of the cost that comes with the this expensive phone.  I reached out to rokform again and they asked me if I wanted to upgrade to the aluminum case that is a little slimmer at an additional cost of $50 bringing the total to $99 for the case.  I requested a refund and they told me they only have a 10 day refund policy and because I purchased through Amazon Id have to go through them.  I have already used the mounting tape and threw away the original packaging so they wont take it back.  Now Im stuck with a case that interferes with the flash and have to remove it with great effort every time I want to take a flash picture.  Thanks for pushing out a substandard product rokform.
