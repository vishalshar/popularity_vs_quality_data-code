From some of the reviews I thought this would make a cool alarm clock.  Not so.  It requires an open guest network on my wifi which is not safe.  If there was another way to connect it to the internet I couldn't figure it out.  Also it's hard to read.  The apps for news and stock quotes are a cool idea but you can only quote one stock and the news is a joke.  I would pay $25 for it.
