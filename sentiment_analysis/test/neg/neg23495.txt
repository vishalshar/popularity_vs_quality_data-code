UPDATE:  It is now 3 months later and I'm taking the rating from 5 star to 1 star.  After about a month my multiple Windows 10 PCs stopped recognizing the drive when connected, each requiring a system restart to just see the drive.  Eventually Windows 10 said there is an error, which required a reformat and loss of data, but even after that the PCs still need to be restarted each time to see the drive.MyDigitalSSD website has zero technical support information, driver downloads, or anything at all.  Message posted on their site for callback on these problems went unanswered.  It's all about marketing and trade shows. 2016 news is about new products, but the last driver updates were in 2014.When I bought it in October 2016 I wrote: After struggling with a wide variety of Western Digital (my passport ultra) and Seagate portable drives, finally a portable drive that works flawlessly every time.  No fussing to get Windows 10 to recognize the drive without a reboot!
