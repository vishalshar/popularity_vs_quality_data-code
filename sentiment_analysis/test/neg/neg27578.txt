Not sure yet, but I think the liver Bixbi treats are making my dog feel bad for a couple of hours.  She loves chicken hip and joint better than any treats, but after a few times of finding her bloated and unhappy lately, I suspect these. She won't get up or even wash her tail for these.  I will not purchase again, not because I'm sure there is something wrong with them, but strongly suspect them.  I've subtracted stars here mostly for what I am sure if, which is that these stink, are crunchy and hard rather than soft like the chicken flavor.  We use those for nose work (I hide them and she searches).  The liver I hate handling and would not want to use in this way in my home.  Phewwwww!
