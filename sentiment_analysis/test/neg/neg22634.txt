This review is for the "Barnana Organic Chewy Banana Bites, Peanut Butter, 3.5 Ounce bag".I originally found this item in Whole Foods a few months ago. I found it to be a great addicting snack. I decided to stock up and purchase these on Amazon (Med Therapies) - 12count box. It took a few weeks to arrive and was excited to tear into a bag but unfortunately was very disappointed when I opened the bag to find stale/old pieces. See in photos of old & fresh bananas.  I'm rating this 2 stars for quality. Currently requesting refund or replacement.
