There are apparently two versions of this case and it's just random if you get the decent one or the one with clear flaws.The first one I received was made completely of a very stiff plastic that made the power and volume buttons very hard to push.  After just a few days the rubber started separating from the wood/plastic backing and would come off in my pocket.I sent the first one back and received an updated product.  This one has the hard rubber on the back side, but it's welded to a softer piece of rubber that wraps around the front and has much thinner rubber over the volume and power buttons that make them much easier to press and locate.Hopefully this one holds up better than the last one.
