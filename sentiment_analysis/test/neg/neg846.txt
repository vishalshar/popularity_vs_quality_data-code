This bed is no good for those of larger size and wieght.  Wife and I would sink into it and have difficulty moving as to cuddle was a problem.  Was not able to get a good nights sleep thought two weeks on this bed.  Could not make it to 30 days.  If you are 250 plus lbs, with another person in the bed you might want something else as well.  We are getting it picked up soon and with refund will buy a Purple.  Tried it out and like it much better.
