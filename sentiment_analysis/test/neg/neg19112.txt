They're only ok.  The bands are all the same size and don't look clean/neat when on my shoes.  I also expected them to be a little higher quality based on their branding and the price, but you can see the injection molding marks on the nub and the tail and the tails are hollow instead of full rounds.  I'm going for an elastic lace system instead.
