I ordered the 54x30 for my office.  Watched the installation video on their website first.  Put it on the wall (painted drywall surface) with the help of a co-worker exactly the way they show in the how to video.  Smoothed out all the air bubbles for a few minutes and it looked great.  The next day when I came back into the office it was laying on the floor stuck to its self.  I straightened it out, put it back on the wall and spent the rest of the day smoothing out the bubbles again.  I kept working at it and pushed bubbles out on it all day.  The following day, same thing, it was on the floor.  Tried to return it, and this is a non-returnable item.  It looks great and is a great idea, but is of lower quality than I expected for the price.  This is basically a glorified piece of saran wrap.  I was expecting a thicker plastic, or something that could be hung in ways other than relying on it sticking to the wall.  Either way, it should hold on drywall and did not.  The smaller ones may work better, however I cannot recommend this product at all.Update 1/12/2016 Amazon customer service responded to me that they are refunding the cost.  The product may not have worked, but customer service on AmazonÂ’s side came through.  Thank you Amazon!Save yourself the time, money and frustration, buy a normal white board.
