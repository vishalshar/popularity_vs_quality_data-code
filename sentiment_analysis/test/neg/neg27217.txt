I wanted to love this drone... but I don't.  The nail in the coffin came today. The prop guards I ordered came in.  I went to put them on and found it was an orchestration.  Seeing this, I knew I'd have to go through this same "orchestration" every time I flew it - IF I were to continue to use the case (b/c it'd never fit in the case with those guards on). "Oh well, not a big deal." I thought.  But then.. then I go to unscrew these 6 tiny bolts with hexagonal ends.  A tiny allen wrench is provided to do this.  Well, from the factory, the hexagonal ends are nearly round... "round".... as in... I found it virtually/literally impossible not to strip them. I stripped 3 of 6 of them, with no effort at all. It's such a small yet huge design flaw. When I told them tech support "chat" the deal - he immediately sent me a link to a youtube video on how to extract a stripped screw (like... any stripped screw).  I was like for real?  Anyway.... even with that, I don't have major issue with their support.  The issue - is with the drone.  It just seems it's got these minor things (like that) that majorly suck.  Another issue is this feature where, if you point the two controller sticks "toein" or "toeout" and hold them for 2-3 secs, it kills the engine. WHY, on a professional photography drone, in which the pilot inherently NEEDS to move the control switches ALL sorts of directions to get good pics or video - is this a feature?? Why AT ALL, much less... one that CANNOT be disabled?  Lastly, in 10 flights, I could never manage to get the camera to simply point downward or upward. I was instructed by tech support to change the gimbal ratio/speed to 50, and I did.  It made no difference. It did not change the fact that there was simply no stick movement that correlates with up and down movement of the camera.  The footage is amazing from this camera.  The "go home" feature is on point.  It simply needs a little more work. I swear I wish those 3 things I mentioned were different, but they just aren't... and support (while they're quick and accessible) they treat you kinda like "noob #5443 Can I help you? Yeah whatever... try this. Next?"It just seems like they don't take you seriously. I mean I told the guy I use the drone for my livelihood... he sends me a youtube vid on how to extract a screw...  which 3 of the 5 suggestions on the vid involved sawing or drilling....NO. How about you admit it's poor design and send me some bolts that work (if you have them). If that had happened, I might stick with Autel.  It didn't - so we'll holla!Revision:  Sorry.. my mistake.. you CAN control up/down with the thumbwheel.  Apologies, but.... the rest of my review is true. And yes.. from piloting RC aircraft for years, I DO know that toein stick movements that kill the engine are an "industry standard", but with the addition of these amazing cameras - the industry has changed, and the controllers SHOULD change with it.  I can't see why/how anyone could argue with that.  Makes -0- sense to have a kill feature, activated via the control sticks that, at the very least, is not  feature which can be disabled by the pilot.
