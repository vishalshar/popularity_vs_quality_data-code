Maybe I expected too much.  I read all about it, and was excited, but disappointed after the first use.  I've remained disappointed, as I work through the somewhat expensive facial scrub.  I've used scrubs with different mint combinations in the past that have seem to "awaken" your skin (something like a tingling, refreshing lift).  Thrive neither felt refreshing or pore-tightening.  At first, I liked the coffee-scrub beads... until rinse time.  The grounds get smaller, but they don't disappear, and they have a tendency to stick.  I have to use a washcloth AND stick my face under the shower for way too long.  Even then, half the time, there's still little specks that stick on and interfere with toner and moisturizer.  On the plus side, I think it's kind to sensitive skin.  I haven't had any redness, or irritation (except for the annoyance of tell-tale grounds!).  But for me, this is a Fail.
