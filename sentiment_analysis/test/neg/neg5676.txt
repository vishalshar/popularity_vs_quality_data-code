The ball is innovative and provides some entertainment through its bright colors and "tricks", which you can unlock by driving the ball around or playing it's missions which require you to navigate the ball, purposely crash into items, etc.  The tricks are pre-programmed moves where the ball will perform various moves such as dances and jumps with alternating colors.I'm giving this item two stars because the battery life is too short and constant "calibrating" is required.  Often times it is too hard to drive the ball because it loses calibration easily.  (Ex: Pressing up intending for the ball to move forward will equate to going sideways etc. which is frustrating)
