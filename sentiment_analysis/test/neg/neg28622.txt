Customer service is not competent- very dissatisfied with the way they handled my request to replace- five plus days without a resolution.Product worked for approx 60 days. Pictures show the product after it fell off. It is held together by pressure and no screws exist to hold it in place.Will be stuck with the unit- unit is past the 30 return policy.May 30 purchase...Early August and the product has failed- the round component used to manually open/close the deadbolt has become flimsy and has fallen off the door numerous times.Product stands out next to regular door knobs- would be another downside- not discreet.
