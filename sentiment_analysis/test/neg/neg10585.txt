Good small device, I like the size and portability. Micro SD works with Video and images with slideshow. Tested all the input ports but then there are few draw backs:1) It does not auto detect the HML device when moving from HML-HDMI to the main menu  and back to  HDMI-HML I have to power cycle the device or factory reset in order to have the HML-HDMI input to be detected again.2) Using my Samsung Note 4 as a source every time I adjust the brightness on the remote it causes to pause the Movie. Seems like it is sending some command to my phone. Requested a remote replacement from RIF6 but it does the same thing.3) All the cables are proprietary to RIF6 from HDMI-MHL to HDMI (or micro usb) cannot find any vendor that sells the same cable. If you have streaming devices (Chromecast), you have to use their cable and then used a HDMI female to female converter. This is due to the HDMI MHL port in the RIF6. If the cables breaks good luck finding in the market. You have to Call RIF6 to get a replacement. Not sure if they are going to send you after warranty expires.4) Tested the HDMI port with laptop and I get the flickering video. Not able to isolate if is the cable or NOT.  The HDMI port on my laptop works with a LCD connected but every now and then I get flickering output when connected to RIF6. Major draw back for me since i was planning to used for an event for montage and onsite photo slideshow.5) It does not come with a power pack. You have to use at least 2 amps source or higher.6) Does not support 64G micro SD which is not a big deal but was not listed in the product description.7) 50 Lumens is not much, you have to use in a totally dark environment. So for business presentation or party events not recommended that has ambient light.With all those listed above my RIF6 has to go back. I would like to see Bluetooth audio transmitter, used a regular HDMI (non MHL) and at least 300 lumens in their future design.
