Not terribly impressed.  It was a pain in the butt to get it to connect to the phone, constantly cutting me off during the personal information process.  Finally, I entered the data as quickly as I could and the error stopped.  The unit often buzzes me to suggest that I seem tense, not one time was that accurate.  Another time it buzzed me while I was napping and it suggested I was very focused.  Seriously?  Then I decided to set the unit on a table and link it to my phone.  Guess what?  My breathing rate was 22 breaths per minute and the activity line gently moved up and down as if I was breathing.  I came back 30 minutes later and the thing still reported 22 breaths per minute.  From my perspective, this is an overpriced gadget and nothing more.  If it worked, I don't think you should have to pay more than $30 for it.  Definitely returning this unit as it's not trustworthy and has ultimately been a total waste of time.
