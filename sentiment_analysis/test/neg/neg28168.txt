When I installed, it said i have low pressure on tyres. So waited for couple of days... and went to air filling place to find the rear tyre's, fobo's cover gone with battery. Realised... s*** happens, somebody must have tried to vandalise it. So filled up air and replaced the rear one with front tire sensor.. If had only one... i would prefer to have it be on rear tyre.Alright came home and ordered [...] as i was liking the concept since my bike doesnot show air pressure.Now tried to change settings on my app ... as app was still showing it to be front sensor. Wasted 20 minutes fiddling with app ... couldnot reset it. Thought hard resetting the hardware by taking battery off and putting it back might reset hardware... (Just to let people know i am masters in computer science as well as hardware engineering... doesnot mean anything... but i know how to handle hardware as well as software..  )... to my surprise the casing just popped open in my hand. That was time.. I realised.. i did a mistake ordering this in first place.. and then second mistake by rushing to get another one... (which obviously has asked to cancel my order... hopefully i dont have to write follow up as i cant give less than 1 star :( ).. Good concept ... Would suggest to stay away from this product... hopefully they really make it proper for Motorcycles... as generic product it doesnot work.....Happy it works for others...Waste of time and money ...
