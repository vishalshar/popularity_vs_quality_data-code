Very disappointed. I am a Physics teacher, took this to motivate my school kids learn principles of aerodynamics. It has been a week since I have purchased this plane and I have not been able to fly it. Every time I try it dashes to the ground I have followed all plane making instructions and have followed the guidelines. It is just crazy work of some stupid brain. Don't ever waste your money on this. I am going to return it back tomorrow.
