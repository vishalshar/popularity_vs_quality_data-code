Avegant Glyph - Video HeadsetThis is my first ever product review on Amazon.com.  A representative from Amazon encouraged me to write my constructive review.First unit received - DEFECTIVE:  When I looked through the lenses, the top portion of what I was seeing was flickering.Second unit received - DEFECTIVE:  Dust/particle trapped behind the left lens.Third unit received - DEFECTIVE:  The device worked flawlessly for two days, and then on the third day, it would not power on.When this device works, it is FANTASTIC.  The picture quality is AWESOME, the sound quality is AWESOME, and it is incredibly easy to use.  This is a great device for playing games on the Nintendo Entertainment System Classic Edition mini console.There is clearly an issue with the manufacturing of this device given my receipt of THREE CONSECUTIVE DEFECTIVE UNITS.I really hope Avegant will reach out to me (I know that you read these reviews) as I would like to speak with the CEO of your company who is responsible for this product.  I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED - a conversation with the CEO would be most helpful!
