5 STAR RATING ON September 6th 2014Great smart power bar with 2 controllable outlets and 2 always on outlets. The configuration with the Wink app on iPhone is easy and straightforward (I have also read many Android phones have issues programming the device with the screen flashing). I have integrated it with my Smartthings Hub and use it to control a camera (it only records when i am away) and also to control a small night light which only turns on when other lights are off at night. It uses your standard Wifi, so no extension of your Zwave or Zigbee network. Also since it is a wifi connected device, your experience will probably be as reliable as your Internet+Wifi reliability, if you have spotty Wifi coverage, you might want to fix this Wifi first. Also keep in mind large metal objects can interfere a lot with your Wifi signal.DOWNGRADED RATING TO 1 STAR ON November 17th 2014Here's what happens when you get to use this device over a long period of time.The devices keeps loosing wifi settings, it is located 10 feet away from my wifi router, so distance is not an issue. And whenever it looses wifi it just won't reconnect. I have to take the app and reset it using the setup procedure which is a pain. In the IOT, behaving so poorly is not a small issue. I have many other smart devices and none of them have such issues, switches should stay the way they were set EVEN if they have wifi issues, and first and foremost they should reconnect if there are wifi issues, but just dropping the wifi and turning off is certainly not the smart thing to do.
