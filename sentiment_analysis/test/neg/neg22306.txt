A piece of crap that belongs in the toilet, not on the toiletWhen the product works properly it is AWESOME! If the company actually listens to the customers and makes a few minor adjustments it will be worth owning. The best advice I can give is to either find a different  light or wait for an upgraded version.PROS*designed to only work in dim or dark room*batteries last forever*lights are beautifulCons*doesn't come with batteries*suction cups suck (not in a good way)*not water proof/resistant*short range on the motion sensor*lights sometimes stay on or won't come on*expensive for a night light*easily broken
