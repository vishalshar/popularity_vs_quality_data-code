I was thoroughly disappointed with this pedal. The pre-loaded beats aren't beats that you could or would use in a rock, blues, country, or jazz playing situation. Most of the beats that come pre-loaded aren't something a drummer would play. I did some investigating to find out if more beats were available or if I could build them myself. It turns out the company DOES have more beat packages that can be loaded onto the pedal BUT THEY MUST BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY. I find this rather irksome that I'm paying a large amount of money for a pedal that doesn't come pre-loaded with something that I can use and they want me to fork over more money for beats that I can use. Save yourself some money, time, and frustration; look elsewhere..this pedal isn't the one.
