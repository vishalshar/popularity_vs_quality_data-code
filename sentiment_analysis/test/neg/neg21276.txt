The phone app doesn't work on my Samsung Galaxy S6.  The GunBox links up, but then I can't access it to change the settings.  It's a nice box, appears to be well made, it looks pretty, and the Kensington lock is a nice add on. The box opens with the RFID cards included, but without the phone app I can't setup the finger scanner, set the alarm, or open it remotely.  For now I will use the RFID and hope they fix the app before I decide to trash it.
