I wish I could give these zero stars, since they were a complete failure. I'm a 4-6 miles per day treadmill runner. I am 5'5", 125 lbs. and wear a ladies 8 1/2 medium shoe. I used these laces to replace the ones that came with my Asics Gel Nimbus. I laced them as instructed. After three months, the middle lace on my left foot broke in half. I replaced it with an extra lace. Two weeks later the middle lace on my right foot broke while running. I ended up removing the laces and using the type of elastic that laces through the eyelets, "Slack Laces," also bought on Amazon. I don't have especially wide feet; I wear a medium in my street shoes and my running shoes. This product was a bust for me and a waste of money.
