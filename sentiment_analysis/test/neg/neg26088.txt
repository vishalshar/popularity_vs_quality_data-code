It worked okay for about a month. Then the USB bit to recharge the card became loose and stopped working unless in a certain position. And worst of all, it barely charges my phone 5% before the card runs out. At it's peak performance, it charged my phone about 20-30% (with the phone off!). This product is not worth the money.
