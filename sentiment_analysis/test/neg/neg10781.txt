I purchased this expensive product because I wanted my father, who has had a head injury & is bed ridden be comfortable. I haven't used the product long enough to know its effectiveness but it has started leaking some transparent liquid (consistency same as oil), I am not sure if I received a defective piece but my father weighs between 85-95 pounds (very skinny). Its very disappointing, I am not sure how to contact the seller regarding this problem but I would like to have the product replaced.
