this item frequently disconnects from wifi - the battery is already showing dead and I only bought this thing 5 months ago. Its always been spotty. Their customer service is even worse, they just don't answer.  Good luck and pray if you buy this. I would highly suggest passing!!! .  I have a smart home...wifi garage, doors, cameras, lights...and much more,i know good things..this is not one of them.
