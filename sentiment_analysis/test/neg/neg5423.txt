Great idea, big need, did not meet expectations, I have an Android system, and was unabot to get anyware near the distance mentioned in the spec sheets, and video.I hope the folks at Cassia, will continue, and improve this concept, as again, we all need this to work as advertised ( and it DOSE NOT).Bottom line here" product not ready for primetime yet"
