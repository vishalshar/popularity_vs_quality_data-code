Well I wanted to like this, but after using it for a little over a week, the sleep tracking was terribly inaccurate.  I set up two sensors on the master bed  (a king-size pillow top mattress with memory foam and other stuff inside), and one on our 5 year-old son's bed (twin-size traditional spring mattress).  Waited a few nights and none of the readings were accurate, so went ahead and used the strips for all of the sensors hoping that would help.  It seemed to marginally improve, but still no where close to reality.  Our son's data was the best, although his were still usually 30-60 mins off.  As for the master bed data, it was all over the place and ranged from several hours too early to several hours too late.  It almost seemed as if the 2 sensors were confused as to which person to track, as several times my wife's readings were closer to my actual activity, and vice versa.  She wakes up an hour before I do, however most of the time it had her waking up an hour or so after I did.  Overall it was just way too inaccurate to be of any use to us, and actually became a frustration for my wife to the point where she was asking me to send it back every day, which I finally did.  By comparison, the wrist trackers we have used in the past have been much more accurate.  I love the idea of having our bodies "untethered" from trackers, but it just doesn't seem like the technology is quite there yet.On another note, support is also very slow in responding.  I had emailed them a day after I got it because their system was giving an error when my wife tried to join from the invite I sent her, and she ended up accidentally creating a separate account which blocked me from being able to invite her again, so I had emailed them asking if they could link her account to mine, or delete the account she created so I could re-invite her.  Several days later someone responded not with a solution, but just saying they would forward it to support.  A couple weeks later and I have yet to receive further communication from them.
