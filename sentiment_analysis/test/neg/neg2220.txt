Been having major issues with this water controller ever since the app was upgraded maybe some software upgrade of the device as well.It is not watering the duration that is set even for fixed duration sprinklers. All my plants and lawn is dying and I have to manually water the plants when I have time. Ready to chuck this system out and buy something else.
