I put this in my sock and went on a 19 mile day hike.  It only charged up to one light out of four and when I plugged into my iPhone 6+ I only got a 1% charge before it went dead.  I suspect the others that have reviewed this product and gave it a good review charged it from  the USB and never really tested to see if it actually charges while walking.  I did read somewhere that you don't want to start with the Ampy being dead for it to charge while walking.  For me that would make this useless as I planned on using this during long distance hikes and plugging it into my phone in the evening and then having to monitor it so it does not get totally drained would be impractical.
