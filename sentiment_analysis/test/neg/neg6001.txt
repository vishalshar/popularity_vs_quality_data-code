This item looks really good once on.  It gives your watch a different look - better.  The band is secure and looks great.Here is the problem.  The bizzle itself.  Clearly to make a buck the manufacturer uses crappy quality material.  I used my new watch band for approximately 30 days and already the finishing is coming off the black bizzle. I take really good care of my watches and especaiclly when washing my hands avoiding to get my watch wet, but clearly my black watch bizzle covering my Apple Watch looks like if I had for 5 years.I expected more for the price.
