This was delivered a month and a day ago and now I'm afraid I'm with those with a bad battery. The time is off by about 8 hours and it wouldn't light up at all this afternoon. If I can't get the time right tomorrow afternoon it's going back.Edit - My 11 year old son went into the on PC settings and changed the time zone then changed it back again and the band time corrected itself, except AM and PM are reversed, but nobody cares about that, he can figure that out for himself.
