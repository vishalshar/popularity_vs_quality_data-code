Okay, this is a tough review.  The scale is super cool looking.  That's where it stops.  The app is a disaster, you have to set it up from scratch each time you want to weigh yourself and most times it doesn't work with my phone (or my husband's).  If you close the app, you can use the scale display, but you don't get any other information besides weight, so why pay so much?  Lastly, both I and my husband just weighed ourselves on our doctor's scales two days ago and we are BOTH weighing 6 pounds heavier on this scale.  I am afraid I will have to return it.  Sorry!
