Well I've had this stereo for a whopping 4 months, and I turned it on today, the LED screen lights up, but nothing is displayed, just a blank blue screen. I have since discovered that the CD player still works, the radio still works (changing the station will be tricky, since I have no idea where the tuner is at), but the main reason I bought this system was for the bluetooth connection, and, yay for me, that function no longer works. So now I have a very neat looking radio/cd player. Should I be happy that it now only operates the functions that are as retro as the system appears? Since I paid $80 for this thing, I'm gonna go with no.
