I ordered two of these games. One came in a shrink wrapped box and we had a great time with it. Kids and adults loved it. However, the second one, came directly from China and was sent in an envelope and arrived smashed. The box is smaller than the first one and doesn't indicate how many mouth guards are included, as is indicated on the box in the picture.
