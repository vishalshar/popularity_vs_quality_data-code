Honestly, this is a bad product. I purchased this because they announced HomeKit support but I very much regret it. Its WiFi antenna is awful and cannot receive a strong signal when it is 10 feet away from my Linksys WRT1900AC router (a 200 dollar router). For comparison, my iPhone received a score of 148 mbps down and 153 mbps up on SpeedTest at the same area as the doorbell with the door closed. That's not all. The August seems to randomly draw more and less power. It seems pretty arbitrary and actually prevents the device from functioning. If it does not have enough power, it will refuse to show you any video. I have not experienced these issues with the Ring Video Pro so this is definitely a problem on August's end.Worst of all, the product does not function well even when things aren't falling apart. I rarely received notifications for doorbell rings, despite holding the doorbell right next to my router. Furthermore, the picture preview that the August is supposed to take never worked. It always lied and used a thumbnail from my last viewing session. This is simply unacceptable. Furthermore, motion detection, a feature that is actually advertised as a MAIN selling point on the official August website [...], does not work as well. Compared to the RING VIDEO PRO, the August is less reliable and has less features. In addition to lacking motion control, the Ring Video Pro has night vision and recordings- two very useful features the August lacks. Most importantly, Ring has announced HomeKit support for the Ring Video Pro as well.Finally, the customer support was very unresponsive and very rude when they did respond. When I brought up my issues to the August support team, they dismissed them. I even provided the link proving that the official August site advertises motion detection as a MAIN feature and they simply disregarded it. I would not recommend this device to anyone and I am supremely disappointed with my experience. Please look elsewhere.Edit: Device still doesn't work. Very unsatisified.
