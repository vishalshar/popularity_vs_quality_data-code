I really wanted to love this but maybe it's the OCD In me. This cup is awful. It's extremely hard to line the top on properly and it leaks out the top through the little hole. We've had for 3 days now and it seems as if it's ready to tear. The cup in itself is nice; we really like it. I wouldn't purchase this again.
