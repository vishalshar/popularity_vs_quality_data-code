Beware that the packaging may not come as described.  I received the old packaging and a third of the pieces were pulverized and turn to dust, a large part of the bag was just dust and waste!  Item packaging did not come as described and have been having this same issue every time an order comes with the hold packing in the foil bag, not vacuum packed and without the addition cardbox protection.  Expensive treats when a third of the bag is damaged into a fine powder that is unusable as a treat.  Buyer beware.
