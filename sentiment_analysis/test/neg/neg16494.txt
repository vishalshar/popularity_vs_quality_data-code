Our daughter wanted this toy more than anything the first year it came out.  It won't walk on ceramic tile.  It won't walk on standard carpet.  It won't walk on low area rugs.  My husband finally moved a huge plankboard into the living room and we got it to walk.  We have half a finished basement and took it down there to try out.  It will walk down there; it is very low commercial carpet with no or barely any pad underneath.  That is where it has been ever since. I think she has played with it maybe two or three times.
