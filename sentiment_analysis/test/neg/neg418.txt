I really wanted to like this device... it had so much promise but it needs more work before it's worth the cost. For starters, the tracking behavior is inconsistent. I've had plenty of tense moments where this thing should be buzzing every five seconds, but the two times it gave me Tense alerts, I was 1) washing dishes at home, not stressful; and 2) sitting in a chair watching TV. Not very exciting TV either! It is amusing and relaxing to watch the breathing line go up and down, but if I want to watch something drift back and forth like that I'll get a goldfish, and the goldfish won't drain my phone battery.It also likes to drop the bluetooth connection whenever. And god forbid you disconnect and shut the app for the night -- it freezes when you try to reconnect the next morning and I have to delete the app to reset everything. This could all be due to user error but Spire's FAQs/Help is slim on actual usage info. And they don't (as of this review date) have Twitter or Facebook accounts where slightly confused yet hopeful people like me could possibly reach out -- I find it odd for a tech company to be completely nonexistent on social media.When you see it in person you understand why it wins all kinds of design awards. The cork in the charging station is beautiful, and the soft plastic coating on the device itself is really nice. But's it's all form with not-so-hot function. I'm returning my Spire and will check back in a year or so to see if they've improved on the operating system at all.
