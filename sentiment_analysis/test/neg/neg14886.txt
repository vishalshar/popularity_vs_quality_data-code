Unfortunately the Hickies no tie shoelaces did not work for me. Initially I put the Hickies on my shoes for a regular fit but they were so tight I was unable to put them on. I then followed the instructions, which were included, for a loose fit. I was then able to put the shoes on, but they were still too tight for me to wear my shoes comfortably. I would have liked for them to work for me as I wanted to be able to slip my shoes on and off, too bad they didn't work out for me.
