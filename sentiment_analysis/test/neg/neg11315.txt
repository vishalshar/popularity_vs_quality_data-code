I bought it, connected my laptop just for 30 seconds to simply do the following:1) connect to a search site2) type in the word "testing" just to see how fast the results would come back.It was fast.I immediately disconnected my laptop. A few minutes later looked at the display which had the original 110.00MG of data they give you available.It now showed 104.34 MB.About 2 minutes later as I was writing this and was disconnected from their network, I checked the display again and it now showed that it had reduced to a balance of 104.26 left.  Still NOT connected, it kept reducing until it stopped at 104.24MB balance. I double checked to make sure nothing is connected but as long as the device is on it bleeds data for a while even after you disconnect.Im going to test it out a bit longer, but I think almost 6 MB of data to look up the word "testing" on a search engine with NO images other than the one the search engine puts at the top of their page, is a bit scary. To be honest, I don't believe it. So I did the exact same test on another hotspot that I purchased thru Amazon. Same laptop, looked up the same thing the exact same way. It was much faster (but the Glocalme was acceptably fast as well, just not as fast)Doing exactly the same thing online, I used 1.2 MB. So thats very concerning... Glocalme depleted at almost 5X the actual usage....
