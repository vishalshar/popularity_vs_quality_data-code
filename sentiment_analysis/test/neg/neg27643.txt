Although set up was quirky, I was initially happy with it until I had to upgrade my home router.  I have never been able to get it re-connected.  It won't even give me its OWN wi-fi to start the connect sequence.  I've tried on multiple occasions thinking somehow it might magically work, and I've been through every trouble shooting technique on the web to no avail.  It's a complete waste of money if it won't even connect to its OWN wi-fi server, much less your home router.
