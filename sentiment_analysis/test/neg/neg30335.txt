The iOS interface is lacking.It's also not very accurate. Eg if I get up at 4am to use the restroom and then go back to sleep, it will tell me I woke up at 4am and had 4 hours of sleep.Insights. Provides 0 useful insights. The only insight it gave me was that my wake time was 80% more consistent than the average Sense user. There wasn't anything more and there weren't any concrete suggestions.Interaction design. Not the most intuitive. I can't easily see how I slept the past night and how that relates to the broader picture of all my nights. It also appears to ask me sporadic questions about sleep (eg how was your sleep?) in no routine manner. Nor does it seem to do anything with the responses collected.The sleep sense itself does nothing except light up pretty colors (which arguably is a utility in and of itself) according to whether there is something wrong or not.I also generally don't like having 3 different objects all necessary for sleep tracking. Particularly the sleep pill- you pin it onto your pillow. It's incredibly difficult to get on/off and small. Not ideal for a traveler- I've forgotten it multiple times while traveling. It's also easy to forget to take off when you're doing laundry- heads up! Along with that, doesn't give me useful information about my sleep.
