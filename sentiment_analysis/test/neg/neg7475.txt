At first I thought that this would be fantastic.  It was the perfect size to fit on my fiances wrist.  The luster wore off quickly.  I am very disappointed in this product.  Once she actually started wearing it...it kept accurate step count and sleep records for the first day.  The second day she had it...it did not register any of her steps. Since it did not count her steps the device warned her every 1.5-2hrs that I was being inactive, even though I was moving around.  The leather straps that were included did not take kindly to water.  To get around the strap issue, she tried clipping it on her gym shorts and it kept falling off. The menstrual tracker is all self-entered.  You basically have to guess when your next cycle would start.  The "stress awareness feature" was basically some bad breathing exercises.  The calibration of the breathing exercises was way off which blows your point count for the day.  The iOS app is very primitive.
