I wanted to like the entire system, but dear lord does it smell so terrible in way less than the advertised month.  In theory it's a really great idea... Out of sight, out of mind. But No, I can't continue to use it.  You can smell the litter box after a week the second you walk into your house.  When you dump the litter in it kicks up an insane amount of dust. I always held my breath for a few seconds to avoid inhaling the dust.  Honestly the system doesn't work that great.  Using the crystal litter and just scooping once a day work much much better.  It keeps the smell down and its about 1/3 the price of these every month.  At first I thought I liked the system, but I was in denial and wanted the convenience.  It's too expensive for me to recommend someone try out for a month to see if they like it.
