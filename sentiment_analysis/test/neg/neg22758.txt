*** FURTHER UPDATE to the last two posts *****Today is August 10th, 2016 **I stopped using the RejuvadermMD in June 2016.There was literally nothing happening.Here is the problem with the unit:1. The head is too small -- I ended up using it sideways to cover 1/2 my face for a 30-minute session --I do the other 1/2 in a second 30-minute session. This is great for people who have nothing to do -- but it isn't reality for the rest of us.The head should be 1 foot X 1 foot in size to cover the face immediately. Currently, it only covers the center of the face at three-inches above the nose.2. The glasses are a big problem. The plastic material allows too much light in. I have wrapped the glasses in foil and then in cloth and that works. The glasses are cheap plastic -- my pair was broken on the side and I had to mend it before use.I had originally posted photos of the glasses. I see those photos have vanished on this site.==================================================================================*** FURTHER UPDATE TO THIS POST --three months later---****** Today is March 6th, 2016. ***My unit has now been used for approximately 3-months.I bought the unit for Christmas 2015. I have been using it each and every day for between 20-30 minutes (Face) and 10 minutes on the hands.I can say with absolute certainty -- Ladies (and Gentlemen), not one single fine line is going to disappear using this product. The only thing I have noticed -- and I noticed it in the first 4-weeks -- is that your skin will look slightly more shiny. This is possibly because there is very mild/minor plumping under the skin.That is it.Customers, If this is what you want and expect from this product, you are going to get it starting with the first 4-weeks.If you thought you were going to erase even one fine line -- and I do mean fine line -- FORGET IT.Coming from someone who has several device patents, and license agreements, here is my assessment regarding the design of this product:1. The oval shaped head is not truly suitable for treating a face. Why? Because our cheeks curve at a steep angle. This means the sides of our face receive a glancing light beam -- this makes it much weaker. The only thing receiving the stated intensity is what the light strikes straight on. If this unit had a curved panel (30-45 degrees) or a 1/3 semi-circle, all the parts of your face would be properly illuminated. Right now I have to do my face in two sections (4 inches away from the skin) to get the whole face.2. The oval is too small. There should a 1 square/foot size panel (with curved or hinged sides) to cover ALL of the face --- from the hairline to below the chin. At present (at 4 inches above the skin) this is not possible in two sessions.There is reliable data to support the creation of a light therapy product.A number of different wavelengths can be used to have a very mild impact on hair growth or on skin quality.I personally would have designed this product differently.After testing this product, I can honestly say I would NOT buy it again. My rating is based on the design alone.By the way, my unit does not look like the one now pictured (March 2016). Mine has an oval head. The one I now see above (Amazon 1 inch add) has a different shaped light panel.______________________________END OF REVIEW FOR MARCH 2016_________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW: DECEMBER 2015I bought this product after reviewing similar products which are both on Amazon and by other companies. Light therapy does have sound clinical research behind it for healing or stimulating collagen. However, do not expect it to stimulate so much collagen formation that it would ever fill in deep wrinkles (go get a face lift for that). I am using this product to smooth fine line and make the skin 'plumper' on a subtle scale. In this respect, I expect results.I have been using this product for two weeks, 30-min each day, on my face and hands (backs).The first thing that happened after 5 days of use was -- I broke out with several acne pimples on my face! Since I had not had acne in decades, I suspected it was related to using the light therapy. I did nothing and the acne went away on its own.I do not notice any tingling or any unusual sensations when I use the light.I am only 3 inches from the light (my nose is closer) and I do feel some warmth  -- but nothing uncomfortable.The glasses were A BIG problem.I experimented and fixed the problem (see the attachment).Basically:The glasses are supposed to make lying under the light safe for your eyes.I found that these plastic cups are totally inadequate for blocking the strong yellow/red lights from your eyes (my pair came with a broken end).This light is seriously painful with these glasses on (eyes closed makes no difference).So, I did the following I used tape to affix the string to the end of the cup.To combat this light problem, I found that the best non-bulky solution was to wrap the lenses in two layers of aluminum (no  this still wasnt enough), thenWrap a fuzzy dark cloth around that. Now I can still see a lot of light, but it is no longer painful. (see photos)These photos were taken on December 27, 2015.As I said in the title -- it is too soon to tell, but since I saw something happen in the first 5 days, I am willing to go for a full 60 days to make an honest test of this product --stay tuned!I have another product from this company (a micro dermal machine) and it is still functioning after almost two years. I use it once each week and can not complain. If this product performs as the other one I purchased from this company, I would say they have a good track record.I am in 'wait and see mode' right now.** FOLLOW UP ******************************************************************************It has been a full 1.5 months now -- no more zits have happened.If I am supposed to see 'plumping' on the face after the daily 30 min sessions -- I don't. I can say that it looks a little 'bright'.I have also been using it on my hands. One thing that has surprised me is what I have seen happening with a new arthritic finger joint.I was using the light on the hands for only skin 'appearance', but the arthritic swelling on the joint decreased dramatically. I will watch this for the next few months.Again -- no real significant improvement in the face features, only very minor' ones.I will check back in 3 months.
