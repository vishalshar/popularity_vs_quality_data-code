False advertising, plain and simple.  If you're buying this product because you THINK it'll allow you track it via your phone if lost, stop right there.  It can't and won't.  The term "GPS" is not an accurate term here.  The suitcase can ONLY get its location (rather YOUR location) when its connected to your phone.  Yes, it's an otherwise useless feature.  If you're connected to the suitcase, and standing right next to it, of course you know its location.  If you become "disconnected" (because the suitcase is more than 20 feet from you), attempting to call up the suitcase's location will only tell you it's "last known location" - rather, the location your phone had when it was LAST connected to the suitcase.  Completely useless and false advertising.If that wasn't enough, and you happen to be an Android users, you'll find the app terrible.  I should have taken a look at the Google Play Store reviews on the app before purchasing - they're horrendous... and rightfully so, as this app is garbage.  It only has four buttons on it - (a) lock/unlock, (b) lights (turns suitcase lights on/off), (c) weight (which consequently doesn't work well), and (d) location (as discussed, doesn't actually work!).  So, what you're ultimately getting is a $400 suitcase that can be locked/unlocked as you're standing next to it with your phone, weighed (woo-hoo!), and turn on and off its silly blinking lights.  The most important feature here, the location tracking, is purely false advertising and doesn't work.And lastly, you'll find the construction sub-par.  It's flimsy and "mid-grade" suitcase quality at best.Save yourself the $400 and hassle of returning it (as I'm doing now).  This company should be embarrassed and most importantly start advertising their product for what it can actually do.
