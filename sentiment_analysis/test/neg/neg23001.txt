I really like the concept, however, the material used is weak. With just about two months of use, one of the elastic bands has broken. I did not catch it on anything and there wasn't much tension on that band as it was the second from the front. I would have thought the company would have included an extra one or two bands, but they give you just enough for each shoe.
