Got this for my wife for our anniversary. She loves it. It was the smallest smartwatch I could find. Just the other day the faceplate (metal rim and glass) came off. I tried to get it to stick back on, but it came off again yesterday or today and my wife doesn't even know where it is. Worst possible timing, because Pebble just went out of business so their watches "are no longer covered by or eligible for warranty exchange." Tried to get my credit card to cover it, but their insurance minded folks are trying to weasel their way out of covering it by claiming it as "normal wear and tear" and therefore not covered by their extended manufacturers warranty. So $180, down the tubes. Don't buy this thing for more than $100 now, might as well get it on eBay because you will get the same level of support either way.
