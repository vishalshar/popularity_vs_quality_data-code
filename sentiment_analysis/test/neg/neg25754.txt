If you're looking for a smart lock to "auto-unlock" your door as this one advertised, don't bother. As others have said, it has issues and they are still working them out. For the first month it would typically unlock in the middle of the night, hours after coming home. Now it typically unlocks after i come in the door and lock the door. So almost every trip in the door requires me to walk back to the door to re-lock the door. I am running their new firmware and that helped a little, so that the unlock happens either a couple minutes or within the hour after i enter. Right now, but one out of every 50 entries will it actually auto-unlock for me. If i try to use the manual unlock, it can take a minute or two to connect with bluetooth. (better than in the beginning that sometimes would never connect)  I'm pondering boxing it back up at this point.TL;DR - Don't bother, it doesn't do any of the things it advertises very well.
