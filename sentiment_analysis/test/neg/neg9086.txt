When I purchased this product, 8 was under the impression I was getting a brand new, never used product. After installing and turning on my smart lock, I realized there was nothing in the battery compartment and thought that was odd. Well upon opening the app it said my lock was connected to another user. HIGHLY IRRITATING to say the least. Now I'm having to go through a lengthy process to get it reset. If you're going to sell something that is refurbished, 697 should probably factory reset the lock and let the purchaser know. I now paid a lot for a non-connected lock. ???
