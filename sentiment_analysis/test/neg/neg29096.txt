I had mold and white stuff on my cheese after two weeks.  I was so disappointed in this product.  I followed the directions and had 8 different cheeses put away.  It looked so nice in the fridge...all organized and labeled, and then the cheddar got mold.  Then the ski queen gjetost got mold after only 2 weeks.  That's when I got mad...you do not mess with my gjetost!!!!  So I will be switching back to my ziplock bags.
