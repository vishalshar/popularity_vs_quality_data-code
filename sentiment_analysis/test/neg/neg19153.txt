Bought this watch case during the kickstarter campaign. Really liked the appearance and the size was nice (I like big watches.)2 months in and a strap broke. Lunatik replace it, no problem,2 months after that, a random chunk of plastic breaks near the other strap.When I contacted customer service they gave me a run around. Suggested the break was my fault. Finally the offered to replace the whole thing with one caveat - they no longer had the color I ordered so I had to pick a different one. I requested a refund as I don't wear white watches or R&B for that matter. Too bad. Too late for a refund. Take the colors we have our you're SOL.And to make matters even worse, the case did not provide complete moisture protection. Some soap at work (I'm a nurse) for past the barrier and damaged the finish of my Apple Watch.What kind of poor performance do their other products boast? I'll never give them another dime to find out....
