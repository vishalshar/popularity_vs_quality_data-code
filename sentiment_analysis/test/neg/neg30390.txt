I ended up returning it.  The Cogito does track steps (fairly accurately with its internal accelerometer), and this watch notifies you with a way-too-faint vibration for texts/calls/emails/calendar... but it does not do both at the same time!  In order to save battery life, per their Zen Desk help desk, if you activate the step tracking feature, then the notification vibration feature is automatically turned off!  The little icons will still blink with a notification, but no vibration.  Really, though, that's not much of a loss... because as I alluded to with my "faint" comment, this watch has the wimpiest vibration strength of any smartwatch I've owned.  Zero noticeable sensation at all.
