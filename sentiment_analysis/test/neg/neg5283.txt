I have two other 3D printers and I understand how to get good print quality.  My cheapo $250 printer prints way better quality than this $700 plus printer.  I spent two days of my vacation trying to figure out why this won't print out an acceptable print ... I've been everywhere with the software and I just can't get proper extrusion and this thing has excessive vibrations issues so I've come to the conclusion that this is defective.  There were also signs in the packaging that this printer may not have been brand new or at least it had been removed and put back in.  When it first fired up, the stepper motor got caught in the filament holder (poor design placement or misaligned stepper motor?).  The only way I could get it unjammed was to turn the printer off and work at pulling the spool holder away from it ... the spool holder was in the proper place according to instructions... it shouldn't have done that.  I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 star because this may be an isolated incident and another printer from another box might have worked fine.  I'm trying to decide if I should return for replacement or refund ... I just can't spend anymore time trying to get this to work.
