Great concept, functionally they perform as advertised.  Unfortunately ThinOptics lend themselves to being lost very, very easily. Combination of factors: the product is small and VERY thin + almost entirely transparent + will fall off your face with even moderate movement after several  minutes. When they are set down: they're easily overlooked and/or forgotten, and once that happens they are all that more difficult to locate. When they fall off, you may not hear them hit whatever they fall onto or into (depending upon what is in front of or under you).  It also appears that they are not retained very well in the universal "sleeve" that adheres to a cell phone [or phone case]. I have lost two pair due to this issue specifically (and at that price -> I'm done)...
