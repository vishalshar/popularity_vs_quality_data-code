The lenses came glued to the envelope from the glass. You can't clean them as any other lenses. The seller don't make any warnings concerning the proper way to clean them. Once you open the envelope the seller make a small warning starting with a oops and offering you a replacement. I  live in Costa Rica, Central America and the cost of sending this glasses is higher than the benefit of having the replacement. I don't recommend this product. The idea and the concept are great. The quality and the endurance is poor.
