I really wanted to love this, but the picture is so dark. I don't leave lights on during the day and the one room I thought it would be okay - the kitchen with south facing windows - is still really dark, can't pick out my black dog off the light floor. The sound feature has some kind of weird feedback. No matter where I put the camera, when sound is enabled there is a noise that almost sounds like hammering.  I tried talking to my dog once - freaked him out. I watched him run to the back door looking for me. Unless your house is constantly lit by fluorescent lights, don't bother with this unit.
