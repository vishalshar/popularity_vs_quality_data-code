I bought this drone based on the reviews and I don't know what people are talking about. The drone it self doesn't operate very well and constantly goes to one direction even after calibrating it. The app is hard to use and connect too and the thing only has a 3-5 minute battery life. For $130, after tax, you can get a MUCH better drone. Don't be fooled this is something you will buy for your kid and he will be excited for one day and never pick the thing up again.
