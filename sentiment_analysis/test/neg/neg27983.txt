Like a number of other reviews I find the sensors to be OK but the App and software limited.If you only are using IHome smartplugs than temperature and humidity are fine.  Have not tried noise or light level yet - motion is just plain stupid and useless.I put the sensor inside my furnace duct - I use rules to control 4 duct blowers in my old house with poor heating and cooling ducts.  The temperature sensor is slow to change values so more delay than I like to turn on or off the duct blowers.  It is better than what I was doing before but not worth the price.Using humidity sensor with rules to run a blower for my humidifier on furnace.  Use to have it running full time, guess I am saving a few bucks per year - but payback vs price is poor.Motion is stupid - it senses motion but you have NO control over the level setting. Inside my duct work the motion sensor is seeing motion every few minutes/seconds.  Based on a time frame you set (5 minutes up to 120 minutes) the monitor will make a occupied or not occupied decision.  In my case its always seeing motion - hmm must be mice in my duct work - so this is useless.  Hopefully a future firmware revision and app change will allow me to have some control over the level of motion that triggers.Not played with the sound sensor.Biggest issue for me - no Wink or Alexa connection.  Neither can see or use the data.For some reason there are no good temperature sensors for Wink or Alexa - makes no sense to me since this would seem to be a good use of smart things.  The sensors in the Apple Home app can be seen but the Apple app does no more than the IHome app - both IMO very weak software use of the sensors.  So apparently - make the sensor work - worry some other day/month/year to have actual value from the sensor.  To be fair Alexa and Wink do a crappy job with the furnace/AC items like the Nest - they pretty much  use the Nest Home/Away as their claim to fame - I find the Nest Home/Away to be almost useless.No apparent way to get data from the sensor over time.  I would like to track temperature and humidity in my basement in Excel file.Will update if future revisions make it more useable. For now - if you want IHome smartplug control based on a sensor than this might work.I will buy several more of these WHEN firmware withWinkAlexaData streaming
