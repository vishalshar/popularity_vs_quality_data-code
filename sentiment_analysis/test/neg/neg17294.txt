I bought the Alcohoot AHT101 and the BACtrack mobile for a backup comparison hoping that if the readings were similar I might trust the readings more. After using both devices a couple of times, I did find the readings came out nearly the same. With that said, the Alcohoot is not as well-made as the BACtrack. With the Alcohoot, I have to remove the protective cover from my phone of course, but still the App often tells me I am not connected. If I give the device any pressure at all to improve connection, my phone thinks I want to ask Siri a question or sometimes my phone wants to turn off. One out of five tries to connect I didn't have a problem, but as I try to put the mouthpiece in place, which always falls out because it does not fit tight, I eventually get the not connected symbol. I find that if I close out the App and restart, I get another chance to connect, but I have never had any success fiddling with the connection to get it to succeed without first shutting down the App and starting over. Very frustrating. It also is more difficult to blow in the device and get it to take a reading. I always had to take a second breath even if I took a deep breath and blew consistently for a few seconds. Sometimes a second breath would cause it to register, but mostly I had to restart the test. I probably should return it, but I am going to give it another try within the return window. I would recommend the BACtrack because it uses Bluetooth and is a much more solid design.  I do like the App features better on the Alcohoot, but I can always set my own 15 minute timer and use Yelp to find a nearby restaurant. And no, I was not at a legal intoxification level either time I used the devices. Steady as a rock!
