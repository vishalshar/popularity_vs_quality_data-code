A disappointment!  Received the product in a perforated metal case.  No printed instructions.  After opening the case noted a few comments on the face of the metal box that were next to impossible to read.It said to go to Apple store to find the APP.  After repeated tries the store does not recognize Honey Bee but wanted you to buy several dozen other APPS.Googled it and found the APP for Free.  Hooray!Waded through the steps until it got to start the unit.  Didn't appear to start!  But is said something about a "Hive" and wanted me to buy more! After several tries with other family members looked for a Help number to call.  There was none.  Found an e mail and asked for help.  Then waited and waited.  A person from some country came back and we proceeded to go back and forth.  Now several hours have passed.  Finally the last message sent said I might need a new battery and theywould send one.  I thought of that in the first place!In the mean time I contacted Amazon and requested a return label which was sent promptly!Sent it back for full refund.I intended to order the product, evaluate it and planned to sent a bunch to family members for Christmas gifts.  I concluded that was not a good idea.Maybe the "Honey" is fine for the "Hip Hop" generation but not for this 74 year old Vet.  Also disappointed that the range is only 150 feet.  GPS takes you all over the world - why not this?Packaging, range and not user friendly besides poor quality!
