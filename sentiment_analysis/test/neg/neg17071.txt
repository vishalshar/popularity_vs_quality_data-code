The robot itself is pretty cool and I know my daughter is going to love it when she opens it on Christmas morning. But, and its a big but... The packaging it comes in is not the retail packaging. So don't expect to see this robot in same box you see at the retail stores. Its packed in a plain non descript brown box with the words "made in china" printed on the side. Its not something really presentable on Christmas. Plus there's so much tape holding it together, you're definitely going to need a pair of scissors... While its not that big of a deal it should be noted in the details. I wouldn't have purchased it from here had I've known this.
