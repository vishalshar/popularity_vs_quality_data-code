Starry Station is completely over-hyped.  It has average wifi range at best.  My existing ASUS router turned out to have better range.  The odd shape necessitates a LOUD cooling fan. It sounds like water running through a pipe. You'll constantly wonder if you left an outside water faucet on. The final design flaw is the sole router port. You'll need an additional switch to plug in your devices. Industry standard for wifi routers is four ports, but you won't find it with this product. Save your money...AVOID!
