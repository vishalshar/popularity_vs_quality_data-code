Worked great until I had to move it. I was swapping it from my summer car to my winter car this week.  I installed this in mid august and 2 months later moved it to my winter sleigh. The past 3 nights it's fallen off. I've followed the cleaning instructions for the sticky pad and the dash. (car is a 2016 so it's not exactly an old weathered dashboard) I'm sad because I now have a 25.00 paperweight that lasted 2 months. I'm not going to sink more money into new sets of sticky pads every season to change this out.
