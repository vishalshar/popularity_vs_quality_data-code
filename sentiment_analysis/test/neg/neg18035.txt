I've used these multiple times and eventually stopped using them.  They damaged the brush hairs on my expensive Bobbi Brown brushes and they made it virtually impossible for the brush to dry! It took over 48-hours for my brushes to try. Kudos to everyone who loves them but I was less than impressed...or not impressed at all.
