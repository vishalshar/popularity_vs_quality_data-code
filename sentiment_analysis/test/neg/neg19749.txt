I bought these earbuds for swimming. After learning how to use them I spent 2 days testing them out. They were pretty awesome. Sounds was decent, pretty easy to connect (some issues, but overall simple), stylish as heck.So this morning, it was time to go for that swim. I jump into the pool and move my head down.'Sweet the music is still going!'About half the length of the pool down on the first lap, the audio began to turn crackly. It's hard to pick a word to describe the sound, but its basically the sound you would image if a microphone is picking up water swishing around it. So my theory is that the 'Transparency Mode' somehow got activated while swimming and thats what I was hearing. I got the the end of the pool and moved my head slowly down, and again I was hearing the swishing/crackling. So I took them out, put them back in and then did the same thing, and cool, they stopped being swishy. So I thought alright lets try again.Again, the same thing happens, but this time I got a cherry on top: the left earbud was now muffled. As I swam a few more laps, the right earbud began to act the same way. So you can imagine I was pretty tilted at this point so I decided to screw the rest of my workout and read up if I had done something wrong. The manual says for swimming we should disable 'Transparency Mode'. That's fine since I hated transparency mode anyways so I always had it off. Maybe if I had put it in swimming track mode, it would have been ok, but honestly if THAT were the case, what good is a pair of earbuds which is waterproof only when you tell it to be? Heck I could place my current iPod inside a plastic bag and it would be just as water resistant.Apparently as well these thing sink? (Thats what I read from another review, don't quote me) Sweet so that means the 1 meter it can be water resistant to will be reached if the earbud ever falls out during swimming. I really hope they actually float, but I'm in the process of wrapping it all back up to send back to Amazon.I would give this crap 1 star, but since Amazon's Customer Support is OP, it gets 2.
