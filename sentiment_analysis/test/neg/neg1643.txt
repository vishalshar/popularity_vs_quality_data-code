Like a couple of others here, this thing has been a nightmare. As soon as I plugged it in my internet problems began and remained until I unplugged it. It is not a simple plug and play for me, which is the reason I bought it in the first place. I am not comfortable going in to my (Comcast) router and changing all kinds of things to get this thing to work. I was sold on thier video and presentation that it was " plug and play" and it simply is not. While they do get kudos for thier quick response to my email outlining my issues, the only options have is to get into my router and make several changes, which again I am not comfortable with given its not my router. DisappointedUpdate 12/15/1016I bought this based on the numerous reassurances from the company (via videos) that this was most definitely a plug and play device. It was and is most definitely not in my situation. I was refused a refund because I bought it through Amazon and missed the return date by a hair. You would think that based on their false advertising they would accomadate a return, but they most vigorously denied a return so I am stuck with this piece of plastic. Buyer beware!!
