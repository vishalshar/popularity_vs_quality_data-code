I purchased this for my two year old. I wanted a glass cup for travel and settled on this, despite several reviews talking about how easily it breaks, since it was much cheaper than the alternative products I found. At home, he uses glass dishes and we have never had anything break so I thought it would be fine. Low and behold, we had it less than a day, and it broke. Obviously you run the risk of glass products breaking if dropped, but this is SUPER thin, fragile glass. It was dropped from a height of about one foot and it shattered. Only purchase this if there is absolutely no risk of it being dropped because if dropped, it WILL break.
