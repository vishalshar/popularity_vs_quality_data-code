I bought this for  a Christmas present for my in law's one drinks caffeinated and the other decaf. I saw this coffee maker and thought best of both worlds right here. I compared prices there is a more expensive one but the reviews on it wasn't that great. Ginny's sell these same coffee makers brand and all for 80.00 so I chose this one for the price and reviews. My in laws loved it, they could make 2 pots of coffee and the same time and not have to be put up with all the muss and fuss like before. Then she called and said it had stopped working I felt so horrible. I got back on here after contacting the sellers which are great by the way. But anyways I was reading the reviews again and still the reviews are mixed between good and bad. But a lot of the reviews are the same as mine worked great for a week or a few days and it quits. Hoping the replacement does better.
