I purchased the black CoWatch excited for a smart watch with Alexa. What I got instead was a product that wow'd for three days, and then started randomly resetting itself, losing all settings and requiring it to be set up as new again each time. The look adn feel of this watch is PERFECT, but the funtionality with an iPhone 6S+ running OS 10 was subpar at best. Not all notifications make it to the watch, Alexa is buggy at best, and the software resets were the deal breaker. Fantastic hardware, sub par software. Made me feel like it's not ready for prime time. Decided to get a FitBit Blaze and love it.
