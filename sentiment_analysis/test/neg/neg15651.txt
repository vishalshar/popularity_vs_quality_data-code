Hard to install. After installation, if you drive above 50 miles per hour, the set is shaking and wobbling, it is impossible to read the screen, and feel like the laptop can topple over at anytime. This is a design problem even though every part of the set looks sturdy, it is like a strong antenna holding a TV on top. For the manufacturer: you should have thought from outside the box from every beginning, if you set up the holder in the front passenger's seat, you will render this seat useless anyway, so why not take advantage of the empty seat? an inflatable (balloon-like) chassis may do the same work easily...
