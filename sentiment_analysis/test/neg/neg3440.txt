Besides the bad reviews, I decided to purchase DCH S150. I am having PROBLEMS to connect to it using "www.mydlink.com", although connecting with my Android mobile was quite easy, but insufficient to my needs.I was expecting to receive email notifications every motion DCHS150 perceived, but it is not doing that. So I decided to enter the "mydling.com" site in order to try to find some configuration option to setup the target email.I thought that I could configure the DCHS150 using "mydlink.com" site, but when I open the configuration tag I got the following message:"Unable to access your DCH-S150.If you cannot access your DCH-S150, please check that:You have at least 256K of bandwidthYour DCH-S150 is not being blocked by a firewall or an antivirus program"There is no guide on how to overcome this problem. DLink reference manuals are pretty bad and there is no means how to find information on how to fix this problems.
