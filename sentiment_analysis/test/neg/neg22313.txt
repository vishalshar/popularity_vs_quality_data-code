After trying DOZENS of different gummy vitamins, my 2 kids ate these without any problems! Do they beg for them? No. Do they jump up and down when I give them to them? No. Do they take them without any complaining? Yes! HOWEVER, I have decided to STOP giving my kids this multi vitamin due to the fact that I just recently realized that smarty pants DOES NOT USE FOLATE in this formula! Smartypants kids vitamins contain folic acid which is the synthetic version of vitamin B9 which is not only not easily absorbed, but has known health risks! Folic acid is not safe for children or adults and it's scary how so many people are unaware of this. Folate is naturally found in foods like spinach and liver which of course most kids will not eat. The only other way to get this VERY important nutrient is via vitamins. My kids are picky eaters and have always been a tad underweight so the peace of mind that I once had when they started taking Smartpants multivitamins is now gone and has been replaced with concern since they are currently not taking a multivitamin while I desperately search for a new one that contains Folate.
