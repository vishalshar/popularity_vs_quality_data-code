This is not a good speaker.  We got this speaker "free" with the purchase of an RIF6 projector.  The only positive thing about this speaker is it is small and it matches the RIF6 projector.  My household has six bluetooth speakers we've accumulated over the years for different uses.  The RIF6 is easily one of the more expensive speakers in our collection.  This speaker has the clarity and volume level of a speaker you would expect from a dollar store.  Unless the room is absolutely quiet you have to concentrate to hear dialogue and/or lyrics from movies and videos.  We hooked up a different speaker to the projector we purchased for $40 years ago.  The sound clarity and volume from the other older less expensive speaker was more than double and made watching a video on the projector so much more enjoyable and relaxing.  For what it's worth, I thought RIF6 projector was impressive (with the exception of the built in speaker).  In conclusion, I got tithe RIF6 Sound Cube speaker for free, and I'm still not convinced it was worth it.
