I have not been able to connect to my network. I have a Dlink router which is buggy anyway (drops internet, etc) and despite several attempts, the DCH-S150 will not connect. I've tried every outlet in my house, including the same outlet my router is plugged into. I have tried resetting the device with a straightened paper clip. I always get to the flashing green light and that's where it ends; no connection ever happens. I've tried manual setup and it never connects. I've contacted dlink support several times, and have never received a response.Don't bother with this device; it's obviously not ready yet.
