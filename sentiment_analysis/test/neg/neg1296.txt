I should have listen to the reviews before I purchase this. I wanted it to work so much, so I purchased it anyway. It is a great idea, but it fails because it simply does not work. As most of the reviews state, I too could not get the batteries to connect to the cloud.  I'm very tech savvy. I set up my own network at home. If there was a way for me to connect this to my home network, I should've been able to figure it out fairly easily.
