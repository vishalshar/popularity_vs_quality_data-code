I purchased the camera last September and while it worked the first few months, more recently, since they updated the app it has stopped working. Now Petzi is telling me I have to call my router manufacturer to change the encryption mode... I don't have the time or energy to do that for a device that was fine before. Now they won't return it for me. Don't buy this product! It won't work.
