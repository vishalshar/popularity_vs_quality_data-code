It was stolen before I got too much use.  But I did use it a few times.  Not nearly as loud as I expected.  I researched quite a few and expect this little guy to really boom.  I brought out on my boat and the playback could barely get over my engines.  While floating, it was comfortable room music - not the booming, crowd rocking levels that I expected.
