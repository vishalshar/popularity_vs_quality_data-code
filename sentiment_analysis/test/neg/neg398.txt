Adorable and great size.However, 2 major flaws that don't make it functional.First, the part where the spoon meets the handle is too flexible.Second, the scoop on the spoon angles DOWN slightly instead of up.What this means is even I have a hard time using this floppy spoon to scoop up food, and if some food does get on the spoon, the downward angle of the scoop means it usually falls back off...
