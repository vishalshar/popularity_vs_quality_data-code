This charger is awful. If you want to help a good cause. Go for it. If you want a flash light. This is the product. But actually having it charge your phone or even charging itself in the sun. Forget about it. I took it to hawaii and left it in the sun from 10am - 7pm. It charged my iphone5 about 20% and then it didn't charge any longer. I'm not sure if mine is defective but it's now collecting dust.
