They are extremely tight on my feet, I don't have big feet or anything. Not even wide, I suffered through workout hoping they would stretch. This is my 3rd time wearing no them and I think somehow they have gotten tighter. So they don't work for everyone. Great concept, but now I wasted $14, because they hurt ;( guess I won't be wearing them anymor. :(
