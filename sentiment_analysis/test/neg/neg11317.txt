With tolerable amount of frustration for initial registering and set up my g2 works as advertised. It automatically  logs in and searches out local network connection. To date I have only connected 1 device, and that has been simple and easy. In the car I used the g2 to connect my tablet and opened Google maps and used as gps. This also worked  fine (I live in northeast US ). After 5 miles  and 15 minutes I powered g2 off . I had used 5mp. I don't know if  this is  good,  bad,  or average. So far I am happy. I will be putting to more regular usage later in the  month in Florida and later in the spring  in italy.  G2 EXPERIENCE / hardware good, BUT customer service /support staffed by most dense, obtuse, and unhelpful support staff i have ever come across. My interaction with this bunch of morons is the resullt of purchased data packages failure to load into account for use by g2. Several weeks before a planned vacation to Europe in May i purchased global data package. As the glocalme app refused to proceed to checkout, and after wasting time on numerous attempts to do so i contacted support. Thus began a long, long, series of emails to support.  They have a big problem with answering direct questions (example: at some point in purchase process i was asked for "id card", as i had no "card" i asked support what it is. It took several emails to get responce to this question,  finally they answered with "identification card". Idiots. Finally figured out for myself, it is id number found on g2 info window- that is all they had to tell me). Eventually as they had no clue why app failed they told me to make purchase thru website.  This took several attempts before making purchase using PayPal. Okay,  so now over several days and way more emails than necessary i have purchased global data package. Now the real fun starts. The package does not appear in my account. More emails with direct questions ignored and they finally tell me not to worry that package will load automatically when current data is finished.  Right, this just sounds like  BS, but I'm tired of the wasted back and forth with these idiots and i leave it at that for now. A week before departure i inquire again. Once again the same "don't worry" BS. Predictably,  in Venice, the package does not load into my account. Now begins an even longer series of back and forth emails.  Once again they ignore direct questions in favor of useless instructions or requests (they really, really, love screenshots of the messages generated by their own g2 operating system,  none of which contributed to solution). Eventually they acknowledge that I purchased package,  but it is in wrong account. Note: i pointed out to them from the beginning that the issue was an account issue,  of course they ignored this observation and did not address it untill much, much  later. So after wasted time, frustration, we seemed to be nearing a solution, right? Wrong. Now a new series of emails complete with rediculous requests and ignoring my input , i am angry. Their responce,  "calm down".  The input from me that they ignored and didn't acnowledge was quite simple, load a data package into the correct account. They just could not , or simply refused to so for whatever reason,  to do this. Hence my anger. At this point i told them i was through with their delays, i didn't really care why their system screwed up so bad, or why they didn't understand it, but to just put my purchased package in my account. Their responce, for the first time to a direct statement, was  "Fine". At last , even if with pissy attitude, a positive ,we are moving forward response. All this has taken place over 6 weeks with more emails than i want to count. Customer service  took a simple issue to fix and turned it into an excruciating experiance,  during which time i could not use my g2. Now it is working, but they still owe me Â€15 of data which shows up as credit in my account, but won't load. I told them of this and it seems they have not changed their support model,  that is one of delaying , useless emails. I'm taking a break before that battle.BASED ON CUSTOMER SUPPORT  I WOULD NOT PURCHASE
