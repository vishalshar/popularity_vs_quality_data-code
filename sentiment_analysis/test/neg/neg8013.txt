I really wanted to like this.  It is beautiful.  I am blown away by the technology which can track a finger movement from across the room.  Unfortunately, the singlecue is almost worthless for my application.  I wanted to control a Dish satellite dvr, a Panasonic home theater system, a Toshiba TV, and a Roku streamer.  Working my way through the finger menus usually got me to the wrong place on the respective device.  There is a reason that the Dish, the Toshiba, and the Panasonic clickers have so many buttons.  It is much easier and many times faster to just use the clickers.  Also, I like to watch TV in the dark.  The singlecue will not work unless my room is well lighted.  It doesn't make sense to get up and turn the light on, wiggle my finger many many times, and then turn the light off when I want to do something.  I will be returning the device to Amazon.  Perhaps I will try it again in a few years.
