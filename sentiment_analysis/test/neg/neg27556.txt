These were great...until they broke. Ordered two identical pairs. One broke after about two weeks.  The second lasted 5 months. I am not at ALL rough on these. They are just too delicate to last. If they were $7 LIKE THE OTHER BRAND FOR SALE ON AMAZON-AHEM I wouldn't care. I'd just order more and consider them disposable. But $25 is waaay too much for  these.During those first two weeks, I raved about these glasses and SEVEN friends ordered, as well. At least two of the seven have broken. (That I know of.) I'm not only annoyed with the fact that I purchased a shoddy product but also very embarrassed that I encouraged my friends to do the same.
