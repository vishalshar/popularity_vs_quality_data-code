I had originally loved the August keypad but now that I'm 4 months in, I've been through two,  THAT'S RIGHT TWO AUGUST KEYPADS!!! The first one was replaced through August because it had just up and died on me,  tried changing out the batteries and nothing would work.  The second one disconnected and started blinking and when I disconnected it and tried resetting it, if could not be set up after many attempts and troubleshooting with the help of August Tech support. What I've noticed is that the August keypad seems to be extremely unreliable and faulty if you if you use it on a daily basis... Because even the lock would sometimes stop opening when you walked up to the door...  Another issue with their system,  a great concept but completely unreliable!
