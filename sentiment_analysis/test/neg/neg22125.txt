My dog loved the flavor, but I had to discontinue feeding it to him.  I was willing to spend the extra money on a food that offered a unique and tasty novel protein source such as quail for my dog who suffers from so many food allergies.  I was very disappointed to see that it contained turkey and pork meal fairly high up on the ingredient list.  This took it out of the running as a novel protein source dog food.
