I was really excited about this attractive activity tracker, but was very quickly disappointed! According to the Fitbit One and the iPhone, this tracker is off by thousands of steps a day most days. As someone who is trying to be very aware of her activity level, this is extremely disappointing. I also noticed that the metal part that holds the tracker to my clothing stretched out the slightest bit very quickly, so anytime I adjusted whatever clothing item it was attached to, it simply fell off and flew onto the floor. The goal was for me to feel like I was not advertising that I had an activity tracker, but having it drop so much made that impossible. I am not back to my Fitbit One and have a new appreciation for it!
