Sometimes it shows up on my phone - sometimes it doesn't even though it's in the same room. I already returned one and the same thing is happening with the new one.  It is really frustrating when I'm trying to leave work and make sure that my phone is in my bag and the find my phone sound doesn't go off. Then I have to run back upstairs to get the phone. Similarly it was frustrating when I was trying to make sure my USB port  was in the car and I didn't leave it in the office, and it last showed up on the map as somewhere on the freeway. In a panic I ran down to the car to make sure my computer bag was in there and not on the freeway! Thank goodness it was. I just do not have confidence that Pepplebee will work in situations when I need it the most, sadly.
