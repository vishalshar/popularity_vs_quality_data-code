I have had my Kuna light for about 6 months now.  It has huge potential, but has too many issues right now.  The real nail in the coffin though is that if you don't give them $59 every year, you basically have nothing but a camera that you can view live IF it will connect at the time. This is not a company in busy to sell security cameras, this is acompany in business to rent you space on their servers every year.
