I had some fun with this stuff.  I used it on the handles to my griddle.  The handles became very hot and were a safety hazard so I used the sugru to cover them as a protection to my hands.  I used 6 of the packets for this one project, so it wasn't a cheap fix, but it worked.The pack of sugru I bought was black and white so I mixed them to get a different design on my safety handles. I didn't have enough of either to go with the one color option. I considered mixing them for gray but that seemed like too much work and this seemed much more unique.Update.  I bought this so my griddle handles would not get hot and be a safety hazard.  They still get way to hot to be safe. So I spent $20 and did not do what I had hoped.  So basically, I wasted my money.
