I tried really hard to grow these mushrooms and I have not got sprout yet. It's been 7 days and still got nothing. I kept misting them and the instructions were confusing. This is what the instructions said, first put in sun light, then remove front panel and cut open bag. Remove and submerge in water soak for 12 hours,Replace bag and mist 2 times a day, now they should grow. I don't know if I had a hit or miss or what but I have been following the directions on the back to the roots website and misted them 2 times a day and still nothing after 7 or 8 days. Very disappointed and I say if you are going to buy this product expect to be lucky or unlucky and unfortunately I was unlucky. Very disappointed
