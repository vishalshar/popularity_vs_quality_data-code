I bought this to monitor the dog and some subcontractors working in the house. The picture was good when it worked. Like others said, it whould stop broadcasting a video feed about every 16-20 hours. After a bunch of calls with D-Link they sent me a replacement. Guess what? The new one does the same thing. I am tired of dealing with this. It's too late to return it, I will be staying away from D-Link cams from now on.
