{update} 8/24/15:  What a shock... what arrived is absolutely nothing like my previous 2 orders.  It's like little cubes of processed turkey vs actually turkey.  They completely shatter and disintegrate in my hands when I try to break them into smaller pieces.  I'm attaching a photo.  In the photo, above is the bag containing the new order and below are dehydrated pieces from the previous orders.  Such a disappointment!!! This just went from 5 stars to 1.  :(3/20/15 & 5/1/15:  This freeze dried turkey is a massive hit with both my cat and dog.  At first my cat wasn't interested, but then I "hydrated" the pieces and he went crazy.  Eventually he started eating the dehydrated pieces.CAUTION:  Hydrated your cat may try to rip the skin off your hand getting to it!!!
