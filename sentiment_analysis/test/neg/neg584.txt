This is a good idea for children's shoes maybe; but these did not work well on my adult shoes at all.I wear a US Women's size 8 and I put these on my Nike gym shoes. They were really tight and made the tops of my feet hurt, they also came undone all the time (I didn't have any break like a lot of people have been saying, but I'm also not very active).  I would not recommend these as they are now. Perhaps if they revised the design to allow for adjustability (for different sizes) this has the potential to be a good product.
