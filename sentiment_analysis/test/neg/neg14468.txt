Very nice idea, but unfortunately I could never get the app to recognize the eraser tip.  Most of the time it smudged (as it should when using your finger), other times it drew (as it should when using the "graphite" tip of the pencil), and sometimes it erased.  Tried to troubleshoot with the manufacturer, but to no avail. Had to return for a refund, cause without that feature working properly I don't think it's worth the high price.
