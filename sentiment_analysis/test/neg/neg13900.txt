I really like the concept of this product, but the execution is lacking.The mechanism for holding onto the vent is not as strong as the magnet. So after a day of running errands, mounting and Un- mounting your phone, eventually, the whole thing is going to come off.Also, the adhesive for the metal SEEMS strong at first, but after a few hours on a road trip last weekend, the adhesive melted in the heat of the sun shining through the windshield, despite the air conditioning running on low.Very disappointing.
