I read the negative reviews but thought it could afford to blow $25 because if it works it would be very useful. I can only assume the positive reviews are fake or they got free products because this thing is worthless.  Mine actually seems to work as intended unlike many of the reviews you will read.  But if you really learn what this thing does before you buy you'll realize it does nothing useful.  It only tracks something in Bluetooth range so we're talking maybe 50 feet if you had a big open room 50 feet wide.  Less so indoors in a normal house.  But here's the crappy thing, it still isn't going to pinpoint it's location.  The best you're going to get is maybe it will pinpoint down to a room or few rooms.  What's the point, I really don't get it?  How is that going to help anyone track anything?  Maybe if you lived in a big city the "crowd gps" which has nothing to do with gps so is already misleading may help you track it down to a building or two but again, how in the heck is that going to help you?
