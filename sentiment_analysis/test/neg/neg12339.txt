This device isn't nearly as easy to set up as they describe, and the only way I can troubleshoot is to reset the whole thing and start from scratch.  I have gotten it to work properly *one* time in the month since I received it.  I thought perhaps I got a bad one, but I haven't been able to discuss it with tech support since the number isn't on the website (despite their recommendation to call if you have any problems) and I still haven't received a response to the email requesting that they provide the number.
