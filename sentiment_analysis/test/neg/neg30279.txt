Seems made well and could be effective, but how in the world are you supposed to use this if it will not hang on your fridge?  The magnets wouldn't hold anything up.  Wouldn't you want it to be moveable?  I'd rather not use the sticky pads on my stainless steel fridge and I'd rather not hang it inside a cabinet where it is forgotten about.  I seriously will return this if better magnets are not provided.
