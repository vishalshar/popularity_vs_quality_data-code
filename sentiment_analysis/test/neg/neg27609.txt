I got it charged it up and thought this would be a very interesting piece of tech. I know I get focused and breathe shallowly, so I thought this would give me a push as some of the other reviewers said. The day I first put it on I discovered my central AC had been hit by lightening. It was 93Â° and to make matters worse my big plasma TV was gone, Tivo dead, cable boxes gone, phones dead, firestick blown. Let me tell you, by afternoon I was really hot and hyperventilating trying to get service people out and getting quotes that would take the top of your head right off. This device actually congratulated me on how many calm minutes I was having... I sent it back. Calm? no...
