Are they kidding?!!  I bought this a few days ago and it was working fine.  The readings vary a bit but are generally within .5 degrees.  There are a few annoying things about it.  First off, some people, like me, just want a really good digital thermometer.  I don't need to take my temperature every morning and track it on the web.  But, there's no mode for that.  You have to connect the thermometer to your wifi (that's after you connected it to your phone).  Then you are supposed to enter the names of the users with birthdays (fat chance I'd do that due to security issues).  So, as this is happening I'm thinking, it's annoying but probably worth it to get a good thermometer. Then this morning, my daughter has a fever. I go to use the thermometer and it has a message on it that says to "go to thermo.withings.com", which is their splash page to download their app.  I tried all the usual stuff to troubleshoot it but no luck.  I couldn't find a way to factory reset it (although I'm sure one exists), so I went to customer support.  No telephone or chat support, of course.  So I sent Withings an email and am waiting.  Think about that... I bought a $100 thermometer that is a few days old and I can't use it because of some issue that has nothing to do with it's core function, taking temperatures.
