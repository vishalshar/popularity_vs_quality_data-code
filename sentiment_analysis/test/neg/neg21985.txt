Was excited to try it. I have O positive blood and that means I am a Banana split to the blood thirsty ladies. I put it on during Halloween and was really covered here in Florida due to the fact I hate mosquitoes. I am here to report I got bit several times. I guess I am going to go back to the DEET and hurt the environment.
