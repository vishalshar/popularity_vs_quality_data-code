The write up on this product was certainly appealing, however practical application was nowhere near what was published in the product definition. When you receive the product, it will tell you that it works best if the additional units are within 40 feet of the router connected unit. It also says that it works best if it can see the other unit - If the units can see one another, then I'm guessing if the devices attempting to access the first one could see it, you wouldn't be looking to extend the signal to start with.  That said, my router is installed in my front office and would require considerable wiring work to even think about moving it. I had the second unit within 15 feet of the first one and it would not recognize and sycn with the first unit. I couldn't position them so they could see each other due to the design of the house. Basically, my current wi-fi extenders work solidly, albeit that they do have different names that the devices must switch to. I would certainly not recommend this product based on my experience with it.  I would however give Amazon huge accolades with respect to their extremely timely handling of the return and credit to my account.
