First I must saw their customer service is amazing. Maybe I just got a dud of a product... But the devise wouldn't work even an hour after trouble shooting. They are willing help fix the problem. But I have a dog that like to escape... I can't wait for their support team to get the info and call me for more trouble shooting.On top of all of that.. I just don't have faith in the product. It could take up to 15 mins for your lost dog alert to tell you. In that time... My dog could get to a busy street.
