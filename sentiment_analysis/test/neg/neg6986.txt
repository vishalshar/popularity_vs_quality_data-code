I upgraded from the Misfit Flash to this Shine w.  It worked well and was very attractive, and seemed just as accurate and easy to use as the series of Flashes I've been using.  I would give it 5 stars for function, but it popped out of the strap and disappeared on my second day of wearing it so I'm only giving it 2 stars.  This Shine 2 is too expensive to keep replacing, which is why I'm back to using the Flash(es)!
