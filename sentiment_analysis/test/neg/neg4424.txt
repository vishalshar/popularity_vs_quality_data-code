I purchased two of these. I purchased these after reading the positive reviews.I received the two bulbs quickly in three days. The packaging is crisp and stylish looking. There is one small square booklet inside the package that tells you how to setup the bulbs. In theory it's fairly self explanatory- screw in, turn on, install on phone, follow instructions and everything should go as planned.My problems began when I kept getting an error that said "LIFX failed to onboard your bulb. Try turning the bulb off and on and try again".I went through this at least five times with each bulb at first. Then I tried relocating the bulbs closer to the router, along with my phone. Then I checked to ensure I had WPA2 with proper auth, checked the channel, bridging, and Hz. In all, I spent five hours futzing with my router, resetting the bulbs (turning them off and on five times), resetting my router, etc. in an effort to get these to be 'bound' by LIFX. The solutions on Reddit did not work either as I was not using WEP, I already has the correct Subnet Mask, my channel was not above 11 (I tried multiple ones), and no other solutions from Google helped either.At one point, the bulbs stopped responding to wifi!Worst part of this? There's no phone number for you to call and just ASK someone. Instead you have to fill out a request for help online and wait for a response.I packed these right up and am returning them tomorrow. I'm buying the Philips Hue pack instead of wasting my time anymore on these startup company gimmicks. Beyond disappointing.
