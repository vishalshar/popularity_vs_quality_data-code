The Lifx Original A21 Color bulb was my first ever smart bulb purchase.  I have purchased Insteon and X-10 home automation products before, but this bulb is my first venture into Wi-Fi home automation.  I use Android phones, and the initial set up was straightforward.  I had everything working.  I was pretty amazed by the range of colors.  The green tones were great.  The light blue was very nice, but it seemed to go purple without moving into dark blue tones.  Being able to adjust the white tones was fabulous, though.  Note that I am using the past tense,  because the bulb stopped connecting to my Wi-Fi network after about 30 minutes of use.  I tried the reset procedure multiple times, but when I got to the last step of the set up, the bulb still would not connect to my network.  During my initial use, I did select to upgrade the bulb's firmware.  I never got any confirmation that the update was successful, so I don't know if the connectivity issue was caused by a firmware upgrade.  However, I do know that the bulb is basically a brick without Wi-Fi.  I can turn it off and on manually, but that is it.  It went from being a $50 smart color bulb to a non-dimmable bright white LED, controlled by a light switch, which means it is now worth less than $11.The newer, more energy-efficient (and smaller) Lifx color bulbs are now available.  I just ordered one of those because I still like the concept and the color and brightness is rated better than the Philips Hue.  But, this bulb will soon be on its way back to Amazon.
