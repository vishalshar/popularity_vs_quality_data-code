This didn't work. I synched it and everything looked great but all of the sudden my 1st one stopped shocking my dog intensely enough and I would have it all the way at 15 and nothing happened...she normally was on a 5. The 2nd collar had the same thing and it didn't shock my other dog. For some reason this system really only works effectively with 1 collar and not 2. Don't waste your money just buy a separate system in you need another collar because this will cause neither to work. Now I'm stuck with it. I deactivated it from the remote to see what happens when I go back to just 1 collar linked.
