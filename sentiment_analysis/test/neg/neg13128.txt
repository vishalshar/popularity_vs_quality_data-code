I'm frustrated with this product. When I log feedings or diaper changes from the changing pad interface, it only sends the events to the app about half of the time (despite showing a confirmation that the data was sent). The scale has also been off by as much as a couple of ounces, and won't register any weight if my baby is wiggling in the slightest. While the companion app is very useful, I didn't pay over $200 for an app where I manually input information. I paid for a reliable product and did not receive one.
