I had high hopes for this undershirt, but even though the color matches my skin tone pretty close, it still is visible when I wear common white dress shirts. The problem is that the V-neck collar is too thick and stretches too low. For a shirt this pricey, it needs to do what it claims, and it just doesn't. I gave it two stars because the material is comfortable. Still searching for an undershirt solution ...
