I wish I could give this zero stars. The whole point is that this should make the process easier and faster, but it does neither. I thought I could place it on the tuning peg and spin it like a wrench, but you can't. The head which goes on the peg is on a different axis for some really dumb reason, so that eliminates all effective functionality.
