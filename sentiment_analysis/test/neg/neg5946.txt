This is not specific to this WeMo switch as much as it is a commentary on the Belkin Wemo Support for the whole environment which is severely lacking. Their devices have worked well right out of the box and with Alexa, but when something fails down the road, my experience is that their support process sucks.I co-own a cell phone and computer repair and home automation business and use my home as a test bed to recommend different solutions to customers.  For WeMo, in the beginning, I ordered the WeMo hub with a couple of smart plugs, later expanded system to 4 Wemo bulbs, 3 smart plugs and 4 light switches. The Wemo hub failed after around 6 or so months, it will not establish connections with my devices.  The smart plugs and light switches still work with Alexa (as they are accessed directly via WiFi), the bulbs don't as they use RF and need the hub to translate.  So the bulbs are useless without the hub and the switches can't be put on a schedule without hub (which was a significant reason to order them, to activate lights when out of town).The only way I found Belkin to offer "support" for these Wemo devices is via email, NO live phone interaction. In my case, the issue is clearly a defective hub (been doing home automation for many years so this issue is not rocket science), and the email interaction offered is a rudimentary Level 1 support dialog scripts (that I already tried before I reached out to them). My very simple request was for them to verify the defect and then send me a warranty exchange.  They were unable to put this into motion, so I requested several times a phone call back to talk to someone for 5 minutes to resolve.  After a month since the latest ask, I have yet to receive a call (and at this point don't expect one). So the hub just sits there reminding me of their lack of phone support and inability to do simple warranty exchange.So, save yourself a lot of frustration when a problem arises and order a different manufacturers switch/plug. My experience with other vendors, like TP-Link, which have live customer support and functionally identical units, are they are competent and have always resolved issues quickly and to my satisfaction. One specific similar example was a warranty issue with a smart TP-Link motion detector that happened a couple of weeks after the Wemo hub failure. TP-Link resolved it quickly. I reached their live phone support and after walking through the diagnostics with their support person on the line, they determined it was a defective unit, cross shipped a replacement and I was back up an running in less than 4 days.  Contrast this with Belkin/Wemo which still unresolved almost 2 months later...
