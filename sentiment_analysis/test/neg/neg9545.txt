Its a great mouse. It really is. But there's just some stuff I can't get passed when I had it.PROS:-Shape is great. Works for a lot of grip types-Coating feels really good, but might not be for everyone-Big mouse feet. More companies need bigger feet-Side buttons feel pretty good-Sensor is amazing. Never skipped a beat or anything with fast flicks or really slow aimsNEUTRAL:-Scroll wheel is ok, not great, but not bad. Steps are sorta noticeable but not good enough for certain things-Rubber side grip. It does help you grip the mouse, but if your hands sweat, it was make it really hard to use-Lighting. Its good, not very bright, and doesn't do certain colors very wellCONS:-The cable is braided and it does move nicely, but mine wouldn't STOP moving and being in the way and it wouldn't stay to where I would like it-The left side is slanted pretty drastically so it might not be great for some people. My thumb would sometimes rub the mouse pad-Mouse button 4 is placed pretty far out-LMB and RMB are pretty mushyI've had an Avior 7000, Naos 7000, and 2 Castor mice and EVERY single one of them have had something wrong with them. I don't know if I just get really unlucky or they really need to work on their quality control. The most recent Castor I've had the left click was so mushy and so dense it was really annoying to use. The scroll wheel was also loose and hardly worked either way and scrolling down it was super loud. I understand that there's most likely going to be something wrong with a mouse like a noisy scroll wheel or something but if it actually worked I wouldn't care.I most likely won't be buying anything from Mionix anymore. They have a great line of mice and seem to know what they're doing, but I just won't be a part of it if they can't get their quality in order.TLDR; Good mouse, can be great, if you get one that actually works the way its supposed to.
