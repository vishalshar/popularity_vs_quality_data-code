I had a subscription to have these litter trays delivered every few months.  I think the trays from Brilliant Pet are less effective than the ones made by ScoopFree.  I'm finding these trays to only last 1 week, they are a lot shallower than the ScoopFree brand, the receptacle for the solid waste is smaller and they leak!  I'm pretty disappointed and cancelled my subscription; returning to the name brand.
