I ordered this lock for the specific reason because it worked with HomeKit.I then bought a new gen Apple TV so I could operate said lock while I was away from home.It's all been a waste so far.The lock needs some sort of firmware update to work properly with Apple HomeKit. Because of this, I am unable to connect to the lock if I am not within Bluetooth range or on my home network.Another issue, is that the widget is cut off after the application was updated. And realistically the widget is pretty useless. It has 2 options, lock and unlock. And no matter which button you press, all it does is open the august app and and you still have to click the circle again.Other problems I have encountered:- auto unlock is very slow and sometimes doesn't even work.- connecting to the lock even on the other side of the door takes forever.The positive:Uses existing hardwareSiri does work while you are on home network.Is convenient when I go for runs or walk the dog and don't wanna carry a key.Honestly, I read reviews and narrowed down my options to this lock. I was going to buy 2 to take care of both my doors, but I wanted to see how 1 would work. I'm glad I waited.Until this starts to work better...my review will remain.
