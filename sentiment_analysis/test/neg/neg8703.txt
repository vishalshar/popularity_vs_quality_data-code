Mine turned out weird and look nothing like the pictures shown, although I have misted it every day and kept it out of direct sunlight (it's placed on a counter a little ways from the window but enough to get sunlight). Definitely can't get two cups of mushrooms out of it as suggested for the included recipe. This picture was taken 12 days in, for reference.
