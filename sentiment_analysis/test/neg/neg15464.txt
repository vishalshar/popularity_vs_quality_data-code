This drive is slower than other drives I am used to. But that was only a problem when I was loading it with my data. The REAL problem is that it's made out of cheap material. I  have it attached to my keys. I put my keys on the table and walked away. About 30 minutes later I reached into my pocket and discovered that the drive was still in my pocket because it had fallen apart. Not to mention I was in a facility where thumbs drives are not allowed. I was able to snap it back together. But I am sure it will happen again. I have to keep looking for a better thumb drive
