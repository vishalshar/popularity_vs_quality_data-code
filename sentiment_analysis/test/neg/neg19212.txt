For $20 they feel cheap. I've seen the owner's youtube channel. In a vid I saw him with a big bag with alot of these in it. They were restock. These triggers were made in quantities and not quality. I say that because of the experience I had when they arrived to me and using them. They fit easily, only positive. The negatives were they would sink the R2 and L2 triggers to the point where the ps4 thought I was pressing them when I wasn't. I had to shave off some plastic off the trigger stops to resolve that issue. The other issue was that they would pop off when I would get competitive. Annoying as heck. Ended up ordering trigger extenders. These are unreliable with no quality.
