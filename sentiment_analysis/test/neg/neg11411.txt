Did not work at all. Appears as if the power module is defective since even connecting it directly to one of the LED modules (bypassing the use of any ink) did not cause the LEDs to light up. Tried swapping 9v battery for a new one and tried multiple modules in case the LED was defective, but the whole kit is dead in the water. Very disappointing to sit down with your child and try to start working through these only to be shut down cold by a defective product. Great idea, terrible execution.
