I just got my second Leaf today since the first one was defective. This one doesn't work either. It takes three days for customer service to respond to emails and there is no phone number to call to talk to anyone. If you go to their website to try to get info about contacting them, there is a message that says that representatives are available from 8am-4pm. You have to leave a voicemail and then they will call you back in 10 minutes. However, there is no number listed to call. This is the worst product I have ever attempted to use and the customer service is just as bad. That said, it is beautiful but I didn't feel like paying $150.00 for a necklace/bracelet/clip.
