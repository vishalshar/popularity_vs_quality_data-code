I've been really excited to buy and use one of these for about 2 years. Finally, I get some extra cash to buy one and it was kind of a let down. I know I probably had some high expectations, but here are my biggest issues1) Getting it installed and recognized on my computer was... frustrating. The firmware update took forever to finally resolve itself so I could continue through the installation.2) People hoping to use this for their work computers! If you have to encrypt a device before you can use it, like a flash drive, you'll probably have to do that with this device as well since there are a whole 12 MB of storage. For me, that was more trouble that it was worth since I mainly wanted to use this for my mobile devices anyway.3) Personal computer use - eh... again, a let down. The gestures trying to move through a powerpoint were a little screwy and the Myo couldn't differentiate between most of my gestures. Things like clicking a mouse were misunderstood as the "Listen" feature and then things got really out of hand with screen zooms and pointers put on my screen.4) Mobile use....... It's got a long way to go. Again, trying to make a gesture was seldom recognized, or when I was just doing my own thing it would think I was making a gesture and everything would getBottom line, I would not suggest buying this device- at least not right now. It has a long way to go for improvements before I'd consider buying one again anytime soon.
