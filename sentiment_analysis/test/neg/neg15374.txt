My wife gave this to me for my birthday.  I am pilot and I have also done some RC flying.  I could not get the airplane to stay connected to my phone (less than a year old iPhone 5S) for more than a second.  I let my more technically savvy 15 year son try, and he had no better luck.So basically the phone would search for a minute or two and then pair with the airplane.  I would hit the throttle, engine would engage, and then it would "unpair".  The phone would start searching again.
