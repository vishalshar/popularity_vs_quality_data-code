useless - it needs an external blood pressure reading to work properly. I thought this looked good and maybe a replacement for my blood pressure cuff. I regularly track my blood pressure and it is a pain to have to put the cuff on and off and do 3 readings at a time. So this looked like a good replacement, which would give me a new measurement of my heart that could be a proxy for blood pressure. Well the reality is that this device _needs_ a blood pressure setting to be entered via configuration before it can give a valid reading ! It does not replace BP measurement, it needs one. And as my blood pressure can vary from 120/80 to 150/95 in the course of a day then I'm at a loss for what to configure it with. If I enter a configuration of the highest values then I get a reading of yellow and raised 3.8, if I put in the lowest of 120/80 I get a green good 2.8 value. So basically I can change the value I get given by changing what I enter for my blood pressure configuration and as my actual blood pressure changes over that range daily no value I enter will actually be accurate unless I do a BP reading exactly before I use the mocaheart device so it is a pointless exercise. I guess it may be useful for checking your heart rate and oxygen saturation but I think there are cheaper and easier ways to get that.
