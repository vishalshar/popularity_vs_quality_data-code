I was so thrilled about this product and man, did I want it to work.  But this product is EXTREMELY NOT READY for prime time.  I think the positive reviews may come from people who have a couple of these dimmers.  I ordered 24 dimmers and paid an electrician $1,000 to convert about half the switches in my home.  I am having terrible problems and tech support is zero help.  I think these products are unfortunately just defective.  Here are the issues which are numerous.  (1) Sometimes they don't install right.  It hangs in the provisioning stage, or sometimes they won't even pair.  You can cold start the switches by pulling out the reset tab but that works sometimes, other times it does not.  Out of 24 switches, I never got 4 of them to sync and program AT ALL.  About 6 others required tons of time to try, try, try again.  (2) Even when programmed, they "disappear" from the app sometimes.  So the switch works locally, but it just disappears from the app.  So you can no longer program that light, and it disappears of course from all scenes and timed events (example: I have 5 outdoor lights with an event to come on at sunset - one of these just keeps "disappearing" from the app).  (3) The keypads are not properly sensitive, or maybe they are too sensitive.  It is virtually impossible to get them to dim up and down.  It usually just turns or or off completely; the nuance of swiping to get dimming feature is extremely hard to activate.  Also the nuance of two fingers for whole rooms is faulty, sometimes the whole room turns on with one finger and sometimes two fingers doesn't turn on the whole room.  The keypads are simply not properly functioning.  (4) The commands are forgotten from time to time and the light has to be re-provisioned frequently.  For example, one of my daughters rooms, she's scared of the glow, so we turned it off - but mysteriously it just gets turned back on - which freaks her out.  This morning she was in our room at 5 am crying that it was back on and scaring her when she went to the bathroom.In short - these lights and especially the provisioning, software app and stability of the lights working and "holding" their programming - F minus.  Absolutely positively a HUGE fail in our house and now we are down $3400 in equipment and installation and having to revert to Lutron.  What a bummer.  You can trace my other Amazon reviews - I am a totally supportive, positive guy WHERE DESERVED - but this product is a MASSIVE FAIL.  Stay far, far away.
