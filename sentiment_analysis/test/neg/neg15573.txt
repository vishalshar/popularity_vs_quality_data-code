Speaker does well most of the time, though have had serious issues with bluetooth range. Will walk 10ft from speaker with bluetoothed phone in my pocket and music will cut out. Seriously dissappointing as part of the draw for this speaker is that it can go where my phone cant (water proof + wireless) but i find myself leaving my phone right next to it to ensure the signal doesnt drop. And i mnow it isnt my phone, as i use it with cheap bluetooth headphones at the gym. The phone stays in my bag and i can walk 30-40 ft away and not miss a beat.Seriously dissappointing performance based on advertised bluetooth range. Would be awesome speaker if this issue were fixed.
