This product is advertised as fitting the iPhone 6 plus on the Bandiwear site. While one could use two hands and stretch the pocket to fit their 6 plus, the flap does not close over it and it takes two hands to remove it from the pocket. I returned this item and went with the large pocket Spibelt, which not only comfortably fits the 6 plus, but also leaves room for other items.
