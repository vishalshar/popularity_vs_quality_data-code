I wish I could rate this 5 stars!! I loved my misfit shine and was SUPER excited about the new "misfit move" feature where it tell you to get up after a certain amount of inactivity.I've been wearing the shine 2 for 4 days now and it's SOOO close to being perfect. The only problem is that it will randomly start vibrating every 3 seconds for no apparent reason. It's not a text or call notification, silent alarm, misfit move notification, or anything else I can identify because there are no indicator lights. When it's in this mode I can't tap to make it stop, I can sync it, there's nothing I can do except take the battery out and do a hard reset. This wouldn't be a huge deal if it happened once a month or so, but instead it's been happening at least 3x a day for the past 4 days! I have no idea what's going on or how to make it stop, since this is the ONLY problem I have with the product. Contacted support a few days ago but haven't heard back from them :(Will probably have to return the product if I don't get a response since this is sort of a dealbreaking issue.
