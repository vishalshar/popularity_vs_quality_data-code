I buy a new mattress usually bet 1500 to 2000 range every 18 months. Last mattress was an I comfort genius which I would give 3.8 out of 5. And I prefer a hard mattress.The Casper: hard like concrete. Well, not really but u get the picture.  For the first time in 13 years I have had my shoulders and upper back knotted up with muscle spasms the size of Mount Everest. And I owe it all to my brand new Casper bed. Do not buy this bed if you are a side sleeper. emphasis added. A high end topper may solve this problem but I  will end up returning this mattress. I'm at a loss at how so many ppl can write such rave reviews.I'm miserable and now have to figure out how to return this beast that does not fit in the little box it came from.
