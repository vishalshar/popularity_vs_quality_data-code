The IR blaster itself may work perfectly but getting it set up through the app to actually work with anything in my household was an absolute nightmare. Getting my TV setup seemed to work half way decent, however there is a lag between pushing the button and the action responding that is much greater than my standard plastic remote.Heres what I found while attempting to use this:When connecting to things like the Philips Hue bridge which they claim support of, or the amazon fireTV, or Roku, or I imagine any other non-ir device. The setup does not use the standard bluetooth setup most remotes for such products use, instead it uses a backdoor over wifi connection method which I believe to be the source of many of its problems.--Get your network developer pants on!If you have your router set up to DHCP which 90% of people do because its the factory default on most routers, you won't be able to use your fireTV or Roku without having to erase your custom remote and re-discovering. It saves its connection by IP and username. A work around for this is to painstakingly go though the user interface on your streaming device and try to set up a static IP, or go in through the router and reserve DHCP setting by MAC address for the devices. However even after you do this, if you attempt to use the Philips Hue bridge you will be required to push its button to pair the remote. every. single. time.--LAG! holy unreasonable LAG!Once you've managed to get the devices to pair and maintain a reasonable connection (never happened with the hue) you are still going to have to make some setup changes to the FireTV. Even then once you get it actually "working" expect lag, lots and lots of lag. On the fireTV I saw lag of up to 15 seconds between button push and actual execution on the TV. on the Roku, usually between 5-7 seconds lag, but on occasion up to 20.. this is absolutely unacceptable.The biggest draw to AnyMote is of course the amazon echo skill allowing you to control your IR devices via voice command. This too I found to be extremely lacking. In the video they make it seem like it just works, but in reality after a day of trying desperately to get anything to happen fluidly I just plain gave up. It seems like you should be able to say something like to the tune of; "Alexa, tell anymote to turn on the tv"Simple enough right? In reality its more like; Alexa, tell anymote (extremely well pronounced and specific button name) my (extremely well pronounced and specific remote title) which for me ended up with having to say things like, Alexa, tell anymote to power toggle my fireTV or Alexa tell anymote to pause my fire stick. You of course CAN find out how the naming convention works and plan ahead and spend hours trying to set up a custom remote with easy to remember and pronounce button names, but this simply is not good enough to replace any other many convenient ways to control things and in my opinion is barely if at all even usable.After having the issues Ive had I attempted to contact customer service for a walk through on getting my devices set up. Its been 3 days now and not even a courtesy "you're very important to us" reply.If your expecting this product to replace anything, I hope you are very patient. Personally, I simply cannot recommend trying.
