I purchased the pebble bee based upon many positive reviews from Amazon. My experience was far less than expected. The first pebble bee I received did not work properly. I emailed the company and rather than just returning I agreed to have them send another pebblebee as a replacement. After a couple weeks I contacted the company again. It seems the item was lost in the mail. They sent it by snail mail. Quickly sent me another sensor. My experience with the pebble bee was marginal. I was using it as a key ring finder. The app gives you red yellow green as an indication of when you're close to the pebble bee. to be honest it wasn't very useful. The feature that activates the noise and light on the pebbles was OK but not great. Today the light came on and I cannot turn it off. It is not registering on the app as being connected even though I am right next to my keys. Quite frankly, a rather use this product in my opinion. Did lost pebble finally came in the mail. Even having free pebble doesn't make up for the inadequacy of this product.
