I'm planning a trip to Europe in April and I thought this would be the ideal item I could use on the trip, so I bought it.  During my trial period, I bought 2 - 1 G Data packages, and within a week, the entire data was gone, even though I had only surfed the web and not uploaded or downloaded any photos or movies.  I contacted Help Desk 4 times and they could not resolve the problem, except to tell me I needed to change the time on the device to China time.  Go figure?  The fact remains that I turned the device off overnight and part of next day day, and during that time, the system showed I had used up the remaining 472.69 GB of data I had remaining when I turned the device off.  I suspected there was very bad data bleed after the device quickly used up the 1st 1-GB data package so begin taking time lapsed photos of the device showing the data remaining on the device, alongside my computer's date and time to document usage, etc.  I made sure that all other devices I have could not connect to it and that there were no auto updates running in the background of my devices.  Still it bleeds my data.  So, BANG, overnight while the device is OFF, I lose 472.69 MB of data.  THIS THING BLEEDS DATA BAD - I DON'T RECOMMEND BUYING IT.  The website indicates that a person can rent the device per day with unlimited data usage, which might be okay.  I liked the device overall, it's feel, it's style, even the quickenss of the help desk service (although it was of little benefit in my situation), but I CANNOT keep pouring out $29.95 dollars every other day for data, especially my data that is mysteriously bled away.  This is not an inexpensive alternative to American phone company data plans while overseas.  When I turned the device totally off on Monday night, I expected to see at lest 400MB or so left when I turned the device on.  Oh no, it wouldn't  work and just kept saying my account was in arrears and I used up all my data.  I'm sending this thing back!
