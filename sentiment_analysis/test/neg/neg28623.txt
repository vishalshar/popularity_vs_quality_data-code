Hi guys!So we ordered the August Lock and the Connect (wifi control) and the device failed miserably for us as airbnb hosts. Here are the reasons why:- all virtual keys need to be invited by the owner through the app. When someone receives the invite, they need to download the app on their phone and create a new profile. Part of the process is verify via text code. August Lock only supports North America (US & Canada phone #'s). If we had a guest outside of this (which is about 85% of our guests), the SMS Text "may" reach the guest. If not no way for the guest to verify their profile which means no way to receive the virtual key, which means the guest is locked out of the home.- We also had guests with US phone #'s and they used the lock. It was kinda glitchy because the guest would have to open the app, turn on the blue tooth, wait for it to connect, then go into the app and click on the red button to unlock and wait for a few seconds. We also found our selves waiting in front of the front door to go through all of these steps. It was kinda annoying. Especially when it's raining and when we had things in our hands.It's a slick lock when it works. The notifications were nice when it worked. The auto lock was nice, however the auto detect when I was near by didn't work too well and was not consistent.For what we were looking for as airbnb hosts the lock was just not consistent and the con's out weighed the pro's. We went back to our old lock:Schlage BE365 CAM 505 Camelot Keypad Deadbolt.We really wished the August lock performed better. Our expectations were not met and as a result we returned the lock. The customer service from August Lock was stellar! Lia and gang did everything they could and even researched what we could have done for possible solutions. Hopefully over time there are updates that would make it more user friendly for international guests. If so, then this would be the perfect front door lock  for those hosting on short term rental sites.
