If you care at all about having your house locked, do not buy this product.  It works maybe 20% of the time, and even then, only sort of.  And when it fails, it fails hard.  Let me paint you a picture of how it works.You're headed out for a few hours.  You pull out your phone and lock your door.  Oh, this product claims it has an auto lock feature.  Bad news:  if you have any resistance in your lock (for example, you've got some weather stripping on the door) it just gives up.  So instead, you hold it just right and tell it to lock.  Eh, that's as annoying as a key.You head back home.  You've got about a 1 in 5 shot of the door unlocking.  When that happens, it's awesome!  Cap'n Kirk would be proud of the technology.  But... the other 80% of the time, you walk to the door and sit there, hoping.  About half the time from there, if you wait long enough, the door will unlock, but that's really annoying.  So you pull out your phone and unlock it.  You can either manually lock it or use the phone again once you're inside, but I've got more bad news for you:  your door is about to be unlocked again.  Ya, turns out, 4 out of 5 times, sometime in the future it is going to succeed on that unlock request... usually once you're already inside you've walked away to put away your groceries.Pretty terrible.  This is the sort of project that engineers build but never use.  Lots of little annoyances.  When you fire up the app, you have to pick which lock to play with.  Oh, you've only got one and you're standing right next to it?  Pick it off the list of 1.  Sigh.  But like I say, the 20% of the time it does half of its job... it's really cool.  If you're willing to pay the safety, annoyance and failure tax, it almost seems... well, I wouldn't buy this again.
