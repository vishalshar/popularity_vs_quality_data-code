Two weeks after Christmas and this thing is kaput! We're on our 3rd filament jam in two weeks. The first two times, we were able to un-jam it using a thin wire. The third time, it just won't come un-jammed. When running the wire through the tip, there doesn't seem to be anything significant blocking it. Just a tiny bit of filament film. We contacted support and got in contact with live chat and their instructions were of no help. My kid loved using it while it worked; unfortunately, it's proven to be junk.
