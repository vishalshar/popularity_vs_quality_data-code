Yeast Extract is MSG and that's about all you can taste.  I had such high hopes for these.  I was sold on the all natural/organic labels and the ease making them for a quick lunch, but the taste of the saltiness is too much.  I already opened all three to try so I can't return, but save your money.  If the company can get rid of that one ingredient these would be the most amazing things and I would buy forever, till then though I will be looking for something else to a quick lunch option.Quick update:I did not email the seller at all, yet they sent me an email right after I posted this review.  Their customer service is outstanding and that is a rare quality these days.  Very impressed with the seller.Email from seller:------------- Begin message -------------Hello Rachel.
