So far not going well. The motor noise which is pretty loud (I found it alarming myself) scares the crap out of her...  Now she won't go anywhere near it or play with any of the blue balls. She's even afraid of me incase I push the button again. Why on earth would you make it so loud!?!?! Dogs are commonly afraid of loud noises?!? We will keep trying but right now it feels like $125 down the drain. Ouch.
