I wanted to love these bulbs so badly. Great colors, very bright, lots of settings - TERRIBLE CONNECTIVITY. Bulbs are always on and offline in the app, the Amazon Echo can never find them because they are dropping connection all the time. Have a ticket open with LIFX that goes endlessly with no response, terrible customer service. I have 100mbps/100mbps internet, a router than can have 80+ connections, gave the bulbs static IP addresses - still can't stay connected. After hours on end every day trying to tweak settings - i give up - time to try another product.
