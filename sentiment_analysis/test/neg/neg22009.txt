The 3 steps before clicking "buy" for the Portal router:1. Check your devices first.2. Check your devices first.3. Check your devices first.And it wouldn't hurt to..Check your devices first.This router has 1 thing and 1 thing only going for it.  5 Ghz "fast lanes" on a *narrow* niche of devices.  Our house has 4 ethernet connected devices (3 PCs and a FireTV 4K), 2 laptops (both a little more than a year old) 2 smartphones (both 2016, high-end devices) and 3 tablets (1 each from 2016, 2015 and 2014 - all major brand, high-end devices).  There are no Apple devices in my house.As others have said, if you want ANY sort of features you have normally seen in a router since, oh 1990, forget it.  This is as simple as it gets.But the main reason you're here is performance.  On the devices that can take advantage of Fast Lanes, the 5 Ghz performance was noticeably faster; like 2X.  BUT...  of our entire  suite of wireless connected devices, only the laptops saw the boost.  Every other device saw huge decreases in speeds, whether connected tot he 2.4 or 5 GHZ SSIDs.  On the order of 50%+ decrease.And this was compared to the TP-Link Archer C9 the Portal was supposed to replace.  I have a TP-Link C3150 arriving tomorrow, and if it's performance is a modest increase over the C9 then the Portal is going back to Amazon.  It's juts not worth the premium you're paying for a 1 trick pony.
