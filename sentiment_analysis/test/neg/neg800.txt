There is something seriously wrong with the audio on this thing. I'm considering returning it for replacement. Really sucks because everything else about it is wonderful for a laptop in this price range.UPDATE: ASUS recommended BIOS update did not fix problems with audio and video. Also encountered inability to connect to external webcam and wireless printer. I consulted with Amazon technical assistance, and they are shipping a replacement laptop. I hope it works better than this one did. I will update again after it gets here in a couple of days.
