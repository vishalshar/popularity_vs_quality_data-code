This is a potentially useful product, but with a shelf life if just a couple of months it's not something to keep handy for the odd job where it would be useful. If you buy it for a project you need to do now then it'll likely be great, but put the rest in a drawer and in 2 or 3 months when another use arises it's already be cured in the sealed package. I thought it was great when I bought it, but now that the rest is useless I can honestly say that the one use I got wasn't worth the purchase price in my opinion.
