I really wanted these to work, but they didn't for me.They are attractive, and easy to install in the shoes.  The big downfall is the clasp that holds the band together.  As the material in the band stretches, the circle around the button stretches and they pop open.  usually only 1 or 2 in the widest part of the shoe lacing area.  then you have to work to pop the end of the band back in the receptacle and pop the button back in the hole.This usually happened to me two or three times a day.A great idea, but the clap needs to be improved so they don't come undone so easily.
