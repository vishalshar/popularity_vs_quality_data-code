I'm an avid tech purchaser.  I've got Echo X 2, Canary X 2, a couple of Nests, a Ring Pro doorbell and now 6 pieces of junk called Ilumi bulbs. The bulbs probably aren't bad themselves, but the apps (and there are two of them out there) are horrible. Bad UI. They don't work as advertised and create a poor user experience. If I were to do it again, I would have gotten the Hues. I'll probably return these bulbs this week.
