I bought this as a gift for my wife.  Having previously purchased a FLIR unit for her IPhone which was lost, I thought this might serve as an "extended range" alternative, based on the description. Unfortunately, the resolution is greatly inferior to the FLIR unit. I ended up retuning it and will likely by her another FLIR.
