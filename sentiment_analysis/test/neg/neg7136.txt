The outer box of the GreatCall Splash was sealed and brand new looking. I opened it, and tried to activate this item on their website, and GreatCall could  not recognize the serial number. I tried to use two different numbers (per their instructions) with no luck. I called the call center at GreatCall, and after a 3-5 minute hold with the first representative, he transferred me to a "tech" who also had me hold on and off a few times. Mind you, both of these people were nice, polite, and professional. My issue is not them. Customer service was terrific for what they could do. With that said, the call was 28 minutes long to find out from their "tech" that the serial number not active. Her recommendation was to return the item to Amazon (which was listed as a retail kit) and buy from a block and mortar retail store. She didn't even say buy it from GreatCall directly.  Additionally, the accessory clip was missing from a "sealed" box. It was listed in the user guide as being part of the box contents.
