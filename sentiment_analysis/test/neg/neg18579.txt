I purchased this after the Note 7 issue.  I have grown dependent on a stylus and thought that this would satisfy my need.  It worked perfectly for about a month.  Then it began to be 'hit or miss' when touching the screen.  I decided to purchase tip replacements.  Well, that didn't work.  So my advice to anyone considering this stylus is to consider another brand or type of stylus.  It is just too expensive to last for only a month.  It's been relegated to my kitchen junk drawer.
