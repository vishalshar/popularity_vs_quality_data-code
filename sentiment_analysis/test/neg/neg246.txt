I recently purchased one of these devices.Out of the box is showed fully charged, green light showing. It did not take the 8 - 12 hours to fully charge as described in the manuals.When I initialized the app, it said that the 30 day trial had already expiredBot of this leads me to believe that this device was Used, previously registered after being charged and resold on Amazon.After the app was setup, and I paid $30+ to set up an annual tracking plan, the device would not establish a Bluetooth connection on my iPhone 7, running iOS 10.1.1On my second iPhone it found the device by bluetooth, but would not show a GPS based location, stated that it was unavailable, and no Bluetooth proximity would show on the second iPhone. This is an iPhone 6 also running the latest iOS.
