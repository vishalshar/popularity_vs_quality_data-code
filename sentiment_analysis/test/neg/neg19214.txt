They came faster then I expected. They also broke just as fast. I had them maybe an hour. I got them on and I liked the feel. The curve of the trigger is nice. I just wish they'd stay on. The part that clips in doesn't look like it fits rite.  Maybe I got a defective pair but for 20 dollars I was pretty disappointed.
