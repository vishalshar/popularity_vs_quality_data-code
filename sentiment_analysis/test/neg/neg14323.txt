I so wanted to like this product!  It was fast and paired well with my phone (iPhone 6s), but I could not get it to take an accurate or consistent reading. When taking 3 readings in a row the temperature would vary by up to 3 degrees. And it always read high compared to an oral thermometer that I was using as a comparison. Several times, on several different days, the Kinsa said I had a fever over 101 while my oral thermometer was reading 98.5.  I read the instructions about how to tug on the ear and followed that method. I got this primarily as a thermometer for my one year old daughter, but with that much variability it wasn't usable. At first I thought I got a faulty unit, but I sent it back for a replacement and that one was just as bad. While I love the concept of this thermometer I can't say that I recommend it at all because of the huge variability in readings and lack of accuracy.
