I know what you might be thinking.You've come across the AquaFarm. "How fun!" you think. "How interesting! How convenient - fresh herbs right in my kitchen! A self-cleaning tank!"I was like you once.I purchased the AquaFarm, and it arrived on my doorstep on a gloomy December weekday. The UPS man brought the box to my doorstep, not meeting my eyes, walking silently back to his truck. He was leaving me with a product that would bring me months of endless frustration, and I think he knew it.I opened the box eagerly, ignorant to the troubles that lay ahead.Adorable packaging! Simple instructions! Fun aquaponics time were ahead of me! I could already see myself, humming merrily in the kitchen while trimming some fresh basil for the sauce simmering on the stove behind me. It was all so charming and domestic. What a great time I was going to have.Cue ominous thunder.I had no idea. No. Idea.From the moment I received the AquaFarm, I encountered a problem. I had received wheatgrass seeds, but not the basil seeds that were supposed to be included. Which brings me to the one positive thing connected to AquaFarm - the customer service. When I contacted them saying I didn't receive basil seeds, they sent out a pack immediately. Back to the Roots clearly is trying their hardest to please their customers  - over the past several months I have emailed them numerous times with various issues, and they have always responded quickly and been very helpful.Yes, their customer service is excellent - some of the best I've ever come across. But customer service can only go so far. When a product is horrible, a product is horrible, and there's not much someone on the other end of an email or phoneline can do about that.All right then, here we go. There are SO MANY problems I've encountered with the AquaFarm that I don't even know where to begin, or how to keep this review succinct. So I'll do my best to list them succinctly, bullet-style:- WHEATGRASS ONLY. The only thing that will flourish in this is wheatgrass (or other sprouting varieties), unless you buy a plant lamp. You may have luck if you set your tank up against a sunny window, but then you're going to run into other problems, such as algae and temperature fluctuations (not good for your betta).- HEATER REQUIRED. Betta fish need warm water, between 76-82 degrees (fahrenheit). The majority of people will need to buy a heater for their fish. Like, 9 out of 10 customers will need a heater, if they want to be responsible pet owners and maintain a good environment for their betta. But the tank is built in such a way that there is no convenient way to thread the power cord up out of the tank. This exacerbates the warping of the plant trays on the top, because the lid can no longer sit flush against the tank with a heater cord against it.- THIS IS NOT SELF-CLEANING. This tank is touted as being self-cleaning, which would be awesome...if it were. It says in the directions not to change the water, because the plants and the fish create a 'self-cleaning' environment. This is absolutely not the case. I tried the whole self-cleaning thing, more than once, following the directions given closely. Every time I left this tank to its own devices, my poor fish got fin rot or pop eye.- BAD FOR FISH. If you are a sensitive animal-lover, this tank will break your heart. Because your fish WILL get sick, since this tank was not designed with a betta fish's best interests in mind. I went into this with no aquarium experience, under the impression that it was a good tank for beginners. I followed the directions extremely closely. It didn't matter. My poor fish still has gotten sick several times, and it's horrible when it happens.- POOR DESIGN. I mentioned how there is no place for a heater cord. Back to the Roots even recommends that customers purchase one, but then don't design the tank to accommodate it. That's not the only design issue. The AquaFarm has gone through several versions and redesigns, and they're still working out kinks. The lid doesn't fit properly. The plant tray warps. It's a hot mess.- INCONVENIENT. The directions make cleaning out the growstones and putting in new seeds seem simple. 'Just rinse out the plant baskets and drop in some new seeds!' they quip brightly. Yeah, right. Cleaning out the old wheatgrass is a mondo gross process. The stones get tangled up in the roots of the plants. You have to stand over the sink, shaking out the roots, picking out stones, rinsing everything in a colander...oh my God. Just buy freaking wheatgrass. I feel like the biggest sucker in the world with the amount of time I've devoted to growing freaking wheatgrass, because it's the ONLY thing that will grow in this tank, and now I'm stuck doing it in order to help maintain cleaner water for my betta. I never thought I could hate wheatgrass as much as I do now.So here's the quick and dirty:If you are an animal lover, this tank is not for you.If you are interested in hydroponics, this tank is not for you.This tank is one of those borderline products, not quite useless but also not great. It doesn't do anything particularly well. The concept was a cool one, and the customer service is great. But the tank itself?Grief machine.Seriously, I'm writing this post for YOU. For the customer who is thinking about buying. Who's hovering over the 'add to cart' button, but not quite sure. I'm grabbing you by the shoulders, more serious than I've ever been in my life. "Walk away, kid," I'm telling you, my expression battle-worn and weary. "Leave it behind. Walk away now and save yourself the trouble, the pain, the heartache."Trust me on this. It's not worth it.
