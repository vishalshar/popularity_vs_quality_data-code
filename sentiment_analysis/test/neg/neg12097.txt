Unfortunately, I cannot say how it worked as it was given to my adult daughter for a Christmas gift who leaves in the DC area. She wore it one time and the bracelet came off her wrist. Of course, no one turned it in. The clasp or fastener needs some work so this does not happen to anyone else. How disappointing.
