Though this unit looks cute and colorful, it literally fails to hold up the phone. The weight of the phone in the holder gradually pulls the plug out of the electrical socket.Kids may like it just as a cure accessory. But don't buy this thinking it will hold up a phone at the outlet.It's a great idea that was not engineered well.
