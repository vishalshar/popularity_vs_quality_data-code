We pre-ordered it and were very excited to get it. It is however not anything close to the video shown.Cons:1. Video is misleading. Most things shown are either not functional or are exaggerated greatly2. Voice recognition does not work.3. gestures dont work.4. Voice went off after 1 hour, so it does not bark now5. Instructions are a joke.6. It is basically functional like a remote controlled car, nothing more.I hope they get this to work in future versions
