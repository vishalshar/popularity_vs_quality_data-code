Bought it for a Christmas gift because why not the reviews were positive.  After opening the drone and installing the app on Android, the app would not connect because of "Wrong Wi-Fi".  Eventually it connected and was able to fly around while using my phone to take pictures and video, but the damn thing dropped like a rock and the camera busted.  Ok, no big deal I can still fly around right? Kinda.  I charge it overnight, connect it again to the controller and start flying again.  This time it just takes off and flies right through a micro black hole.Had fun for a whooping 30 minutes and now I have nothing but a blinking controller.Pros:- Instructions- Not to expensiveCons:- Too damn small- Poorly made app- Camera isn't 720p- Will abandon owner
