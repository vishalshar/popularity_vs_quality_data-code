Buyer beware - despite being very excited for this product, it shattered on first use, after about 3 shakes. Tiny shards of glass, not to mention the oil and vinegar that was in the bottle - flew everywhere. Picture below. Dangerous situation when you have food (if you shake over your salad at your table) or if you have kids running around. For me it went all over my clothes and carpet - I hope I got it all out but am wary. It really is too bad though. Product looks beautiful and looked otherwise well constructed. Did not look like a cheap knock off, and had a nice aesthetic. I loved the concept too.
