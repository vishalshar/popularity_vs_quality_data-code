1. Inaccurate MPG2. Interferes with phone's bluetooth on phone calls. My phone constantly disconnects and reconnects to my car's bluetooth which makes talking impossible.3. Android app for engine data is non-existent.4. What was suppose to be a cool device to tell me more about my car turned into a nanny device that beeped at me when I went too fast or stopped too hard.
