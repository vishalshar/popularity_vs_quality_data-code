I am not happy with this purchase. Besides the fact that the food and plastic container came in two separate orders, the advertised illustration and our received product did not perform the same.When we received the food and Dino's we were very careful in following the directions. As the instructions stated we were patient in letting the dinos come to life. After a few days we would see just a flash of color for 1 second if we swished the container at night. Not anywhere near the luminescent glow that all the pictures shown. After about a week the dinos stopped responding at all. Now it's just a plastic container filled with clear liquid. A big waste of $80. I'm not pleased.
