I can't say I would suggest this to a friend. The whole idea of the two caps to make for easy cleaning is sabotaged by the cap threads. I had to use a special brush anyway because grime and mold can accumulate in the cap threads so its a mute point in my opinion to have them come on and off. They just created two hard to clean areas.
