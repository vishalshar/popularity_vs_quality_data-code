I recently got an Amazon Echo, and I decided to try to use smart switches to jazz up the controls of the electronics that I use. I got the switch for my lights. The setup for of the Wemo switch was very easy for me. I was able to get it to connect to my wifi network with no issue. I also got Alexa to notice the smart home device and to add it. Also using the voice commands was no issue.The reason for the one star rating from me is two-fold. First, the switch only stays connected to wi-fi about two days at a time. After that, when you try to use Alexa to turn on the switch, it will tell you that the device is not responding. So you need to disconnect it and re-connect it to the outlet it is on. And again, this will work for about 2 days before you need to do it again. It does not matter if you reset it to factory default, it will do the same thing again.I contacted Belkin support about this and I told the representatives there that I reset to factory default about 10 times and the issue kept happening. I was told to try the same thing again, and also to try to do it with cellular data disabled on my cell phone. That would have no effect because you have to use wifi to set it up. I had both my cell phone and the switch on the same wifi network and it would still inexplicably lose connection.I got the TP-Link smart switch instead and I have had absolutely NO disconnects from the wifi network ever, and also no issue with Alexa. This switch does not work and then Belkin support is atrocious as far as honoring the warranty they are supposed to have on these devices. I am not sure what is happening to Belkin but their products and quality is slipping. I would not buy any of these switches again nor would I recommend it to anyone.
