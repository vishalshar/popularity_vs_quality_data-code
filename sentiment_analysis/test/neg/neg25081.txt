Looks is nice, almost like a G-Shock. The button, crown and pushing the crown worked flawless. The bad part, at least in my experience is the touch screen. This product affected/reduced touch sensitivity of the screen of the watch. Either I tap on the screen hard or tap it twice before it does something. All normal when I remove it. I thought about keeping it even with that annoyance assuming I will get the hang of it but for its price over imperfection, I decided to return it.
