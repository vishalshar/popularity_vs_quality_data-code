We have had these for about a month and have broken 4 already. Bought these for my 7 year old's tennis shoes since I haven't taught her to tie shoes yet. (We're working on it!) At first I thought these were great. She loved the colors and she could easily slip on her shoes without help with tying laces. But they just keep breaking. This product is a good idea, just bad material.
