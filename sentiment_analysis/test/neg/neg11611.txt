Initially, I was stoked for this thing. Simple to setup, easy to use, and I love new distruptive startup technologies.But unfortunately, this router stopped working after about 3 weeks of using it. I called through to the ISP, and they said everything was running on their end, and after testing the connection hard-wired, I realized it was the router.We tried contacting support, and after some very unhelpful basic toubleshooting ("did you restart it?"), they said they would escalate my issue to the next level of support. 2 weeks later, I still haven't heard anything back from them, and have since returned the router to Amazon.Was hoping for good things out of this product, but unfortunately this was not the blissful incredible WiFi experience I was hoping for...
