First the good: When .... and when it works its actually a pretty cool product. Walking up to the door with my hands full and being able to hear the sound of it unlocking automatically is pretty cool. When ..... and when the August connect actually works its pretty cool that I can unlock the door remotely.Its very easy to install and by no means am I a great handy man, but this is a pretty easy product to install, just need a screw driver and a about 10 minutes.The bad: First, it hardly ever works 100% of the time, which is something you really want from a product that controls access to your door. The geo fencing to auto unlock is still really buggy. The August connect, which allows you to connect the August lock to your wifi is really glitchy.Really what it comes down to is, if you have one door that you want to put this lock on, it will probably be okay and you most likely get rid of it in a few months. If you have more then one door or if you have more then one person living in the house that might have the app, well get ready for lots of headaches.I'll Explain:The August lock works off of blue tooth, so if a couple walks up to the house, both of which that have the app installed on their phone, well you won't know which phone won the blue tooth pairing until you both have to open the app and unlock the door. Same principle, if you have two front doors, maybe you have a security door and a front door, both of which have the August lock, well same thing, the phone that controls the app will only be able to connect to one of those locks. At this point, auto unlock won't totally and who knows which lock your phone will pick up first, then from there its just a battle of trying to disconnect the one lock so you can get to the other lock to unlock that one first.I'm really shocked the product mangers when developing this application and device didn't think about having more then one person or more then one lock and the headaches that it would cause.
