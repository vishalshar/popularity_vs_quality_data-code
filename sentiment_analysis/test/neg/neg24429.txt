I am very disappointed in the product.  When I have taken my dog out for walks, in the last two weeks, I never know if it will work or not.  I have contacted support and they were helpful - the unit is just plain undependable.  I can't trust it to track my dog.  It is wonderful at telling me the unit is turned off but that is it.  Works some days and then others nothing - no reliability.  Now I am out of my time to return this product so all around it is disappointing
