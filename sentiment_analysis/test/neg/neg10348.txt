Bought this and used it for only a couple of days.Pros:- Looks cool charging- Sounds like a great ideaCons:- Doesn't work well at all- Quite uncomfortable to wear in work clothes while sitting- Mysteriously tells me that I alternate between periods of stress and focus - with zero periods of "calm" - each time I sleep- Ironically does not posses the ability to actually measure sleep which nearly all other trackers do (although based on my above statement, I can see why).
