I really wanted to love this product. Living in a house from the 1800s in a city, I was really curious to see how much polluted air was making its way into my home (or was already there!). This was one of the first devices on the market to do so in the sub $200 market, and I jumped at the opportunity to purchase it as an early adopter. Sadly, this device just hasn't lived up to my expectations on a single front.The initial setup experience is one of the worst I've ever seen. Rather than look across the industry to see how others have implemented wifi setup for IoT devices, Foobot decided to go its own way and implement a solution that requires close proximity to your wifi router. If you use this device in a dense city with >10 wifi networks appearing anywhere in your home, expect to have to go through the setup sequence multiple times without success. The process was so painful for me that I actually let the device sit completely idle for over a month when I had to make changes to my wireless setup that caused the Foobot to no longer be able to connect.Unfortunately, even the data hasn't been reliable for me--recently, after trying really hard to reduce the level of PM2.5 in my home, I noticed that the level of particulates was significantly lower outside of my home than inside. I finally used an air blower to completely flush out the unit, and the PM2.5 readings dropped from a level of 12.0-16.0 ug/m^3 to 0.0-0.2 (more inline with my expectations given the level of air filtration/purification I now have). The FAQs on the Foobot website suggest cleaning your unit yearly, but it doesn't actually document how to do so, nor did I have the device for anywhere close to a year prior to having to try this. Worse yet--24 hours later, I looked back at my historic data trend and noticed that my prior data had been adjusted from 0.0-0.2 to a range of 2.1-3.1! No explanation has been offered on why my previous data was adjusted for me. I don't know which version of the data is/was correct, and I don't feel like I can trust the real-time data any longer--will it be adjusted for me again?The app falls short as well--while I can expect a lackluster app when a product first launches, I expect to see improvements over time. So far, I've seen a lot of efforts to make the app prettier, but I still have to constantly force quit the app and relaunch it to get it to refresh the data displayed to me. Thankfully, the app also crashes all the time which saves me a few steps of trying to relaunch to get accurate data.When I first bought this, I pictured myself buying a case of these to put throughout my home. Instead, I lamented my decision to purchase this device in the first place. This product has failed to nail the core experience of making this data trustable, reliable and actionable. Instead, they've tried to jump ahead to 'delighting' me--I have a device that lights up brilliantly whenever I bump into my table (lightly shaking the device) and an app on my phone full of pretty animations/transitions that crashes all of the time and changes its mind about my datapoints.I can't recommend this device to even my greatest enemies. I'll be moving on towards Awair next. Find my review there in a few months. Hopefully someone will nail this scenario soon.
