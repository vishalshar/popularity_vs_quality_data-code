My right headphone in The Dash is dead after just 5 uses.I used it primarily for swimming.I've noticed right dash was discharging faster since first use, but today it lasted only 45 minutes while left dash still showed green light.The most scary part is that before it discharged it was much more hot then left one in area just near speaker. It also started to randomly(for few seconds, stop, repeat) produce high pitch hissing for about 5 minutes before I've decided that hot hissing thing with li ion battery in air is more dangerous then interrupted training.Attached video is taken after training finished and both were left in charger - left one is ok, right one is not even in "red" (it was when I've interrupted training) [...]Now it just hisses when being plugged in charger, no led indication, no anything
