The earlier review that mentioned the difficulty/impossibility of removing the mouth nozzle is dead on the money. It simply will not come off - regardless of how much effort we put into it. No leaks so far and fictions fine otherwise but that's a deal breaker for a product that is supposed to deliver complete cleanability.
