Mainly, I am disappointed!  I haven't been able to watch any movies so far because IT DOES NOT COME WITH ADAPTER FOR MOST APPLE DEVICES.  I read reviews saying it was iPhone and Apple's best friend, so I thought it would be compatible upon arrival.  It came with 3 other adapters for other devices, but those are pretty worthless to me since I don't have samsung, other android, or HDMI compatible computers, consoles dvd or xbox.  If this would have been more clearly marked I would have ordered the adapter at the same time, but alas I am still waiting for it, wishing I could just watch a movie on my new projector, but no, not yet. =( TIP TO THE MAKER:  let buyer select at least 1 cord for which device they plan to use with this.
