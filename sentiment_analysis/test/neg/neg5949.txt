Sorry...I wanted to love these.  Bought five.  The switches may be an excellent idea with fair implementation, but the software is unforgivable in a consumer product. Take for example if you wanted to do something extreme, like turn on a light - 1) open the app, 2) wait for the app to initialize, 3) wait for the app to connect to your WiFi or 3G/4G connection, 4) wait while app scans for devices (yep - it scans EVERYTIME), 5) pray to the electronic gods that the device you want to turn on is discovered during the scan (and all of them will NEVER be found), 6) press the device's power button and again make offerings to the electronic gods that it actually connects to the device (turns out detecting the device isn't the same as being able to control the device).  Ta Da, so after 10 - 15 seconds you might, might have turn on the device.  Don't get started on implementation of rules - something as simple as transitioning to/from DST has not worked in three years and didn't make it with the latest transition either.
