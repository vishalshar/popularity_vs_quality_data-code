Let me first start by saying I preordered the Lumia in the Spring of 2016. I expected to wait a few months as the product was said to not be ready for launch. I even was ok with a delay as this was a new product. What upset me was that while Im still waiting for my preorder I happen to discover that Bestbuy already had it in stock two weeks before I received my preorder. This makes preordering pointless. The packaging was very nice and the units felt sturdy but that is as far as it gets. I asked specifically if the units were going to have their own internal web admin or preferably a Windows app so I can administer it from my Surface. Upon arriving, I discovered that the Windows app is nonexistent, with no ETA, and the web admin has been permanently tabled. This left me to use my work phone to configure the units and work does not like me installing apps that arent work related. It became unavoidable so I used my work phone and set up the first Luma only to discover that shortly after I installed the first one it said offline. I decided to continue on and set up the others only to discover a new problem. Everything depends on the first unit you set up. If something goes wrong with the primary unit, nothing works. So now the self-healing advertised was also not there.The one bright spot is support. The support staff are friendly even if they cant always answer the questions. This was marketed as easy setup and I found it more difficult to configure than normal business routers I configure at work. At least the support is available unlike most other consumer routers.Once I had them up and running I looked at where to configure block only to discover that it was as basic as they come. Block based on a rating. Furthermore, it doesnt tell you this but you have to add each user and then assign devices to filter. There is also an overall filter level for devices not configured. The big problem is no fine tuning is allow and filtering is for the entire device so any device configured for multi-user, such as Windows and Android, is going to have problems. To make matters worse if a page is block the device just says Page Cannot Be Displayed leaving you to wonder if it was blocked or you had a problem. Considering this is still new and it technically it had filtering I gave it a pass for now. If you were looking for the reporting features to check on your kids, that is missing too. There is absolutely no reporting of childrens activities.For anyone thinking of gaming there is no QoS and no UPnP.All these features could be fixed in a future firmware update but to have it be that bare after a late launch is concerning, particularly when preorders had to wait longer.So finally we come to performance and stability. Because of the limitations of the systems, I cannot make these devices a mesh Wi-Fi to add onto my network. Nothing was said this would be missing a common feature that any other WiFi equipment has is to act as an access point either. Asking support, I am lead to believe this will never happen. They MUST control the entire network. Because of this I had to install them as a second network on my modem which brought up a new problem. Even as a separate WiFi something about the configuration of this device is allow it to attempt control devices in an adjacent network. It took me a while to figure this out. Without going into detail, if you have this connected adjacent to another network behind your modem everything goes crazy. Random devices stop working saying there is no internet. Digging further into stability, at random times the entire system just stops working. Sometimes you can go reset the master unit but that doesnt always work. Sometimes the only thing you can do is just leave the unit unplugged for a day. In regards to performance, a lot is left to desired. They state there is no loss of speed between nodes. And technically that could be true if your internet speed is 50Mbps or less. The problem is I have 400Mbps internet which technically this should support. It doesnt matter which node you use, you get no more than 50Mbps. This leads to another discovery. I unplugged nodes to see if maybe I was on a slower node only to discover that signal strength never really changed. I finally realized that as I moved through the house, none of my devices were roaming to the closest node. They only connected to the closest when first connected. For those of you who dont know, that is not a mesh. It should hand off between nodes allowing you to seamlessly roam to the closest node.Overall I am left disappointed, frustrated, and angry that I spent this much money that has almost none of the advertises features and ones I asked about are either not coming or there is no timetable. At this point I want to return it but even that will cost me money.
