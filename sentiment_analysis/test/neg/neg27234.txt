Setting up the unit was done without incident. The controls work as advertised. I have not used the walkie talkie mode. It's a nice simple ergonomically usable device, but the sound is of poor audio quality and is only just listenable, even for this application. Granular, thin and prone to distortion, the experience is tiring. I did not expect high fidelity but this is a disappointment, there is room for a lot of improvement.I have also used the direct connection. I had expected the sound quality to be better as it eliminates the wireless circuit, but for some reason it is worse, even when feeding the signal through a decent amp. I bought these to replace a wired system for the convenience factor. The wired unit has substantially better audio quality. What should you expect for $130? More than this. I would gladly pay more for a better system though but unfortunately this is the only game going and probably these are going back.
