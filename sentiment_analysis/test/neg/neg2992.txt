Doesn't work very well for my dog. She is picky about most food. I added this to her dog food and she is still not interested in it. If I crumble up an actual chicken dog food treat into the food, she'll try to lick that out of the food (and sometimes deign to eat some kibble), but she won't do that for this stuff. So it's just not compelling to my dog. Your mileage may vary.
