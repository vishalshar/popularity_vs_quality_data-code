These tweezers are okay but don't live up to the hype.  I've managed to pull a splinter or two with them over the two months I've had a pair, but more from digging with the sharp tip than any particular gripping power.  In fact, the tip has a bit of a gap from the tips being over compressed in their holder.Also, the holder is a different, seemingly cheaper, metal than the tweezers themselves which detracts from the overall quality of the set.They're okay, but for simple stamped steel, these tweezers are not worth the price.
