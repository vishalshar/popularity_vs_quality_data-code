Very Disappointed, this is the second chip I got for my daughter. I bought Chip for my daughter for Christmas she was so excited. We unpacked it and got ready to use but the smart band would not charge, it was on the charger for the entire night and kept flashing purple. I went to WowWee website and created a ticket but heard from no one. I returned to amazon and got a replacement 5 days later. Got the new chip, unboxed it my daughter excited and ready to play... Once again the watch did not work after charging for over 2 house, this time its flashing red..... I am returning to Amazon...
