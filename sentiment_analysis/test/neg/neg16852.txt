I was anticipating a nice little absorbent towel that my son can easily pack in his backpack for after school swimming. Well, one thing is right, it is weightless, but it does no drying either. The material is a very flimsy bathing suit lycra type material and does not absorb water.  Will be sending it back. Way too expensive for not absorbing water.
