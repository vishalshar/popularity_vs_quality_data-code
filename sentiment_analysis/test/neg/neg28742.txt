This is a neat gadget which an inbuilt flaw that makes it mostly useless for any family in which drivers share a car. Apparently, while one can use the device in a number of cars, it will pair with only ONE device (iPhone, etc.).  That means that only one person's phone can be used - if another family member drives the car with the ZUS, s/he has to take the paired phone along to use the location feature.  Trying to pair another device gets the error message that another person is using the ZUS - one must "send a request" to use it, although it's not clear whether that is in addition to or instead of the paired user.  Unfortunately, when one sends the request (by clicking on the button), one gets a message that the request has been sent, BUT NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS. Did it three times; no response, no fix.  It gets two stars because it's a good idea, but only two because it just doesn't work for us.  And it apparently doesn't work for anyone unless you always let the app run in background. Very uncomfortable with that. So, close (or so close), but doesn't do it. May work if you have only one driver per device, or you have a phone dedicated to that particular device.
