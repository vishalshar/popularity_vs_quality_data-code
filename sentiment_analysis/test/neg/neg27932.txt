I really wanted to give this higher ratings, but there are several issues I'm finding. The main issue is that it doesn't function like my Anker, Aukey or RavPower. I can never trust that the charge will happen on first connection with my phone or other devices. On most occasions, I have to remove the cable from the Bolt, reconnect it, and that's the only time I'll start seeing a charge. This is not how a portable charger should work.The Anker doesn't do this, and the Aukey and RavPower all work the same way... you can leave a cable in the device, and as long as you "turn on" the device first, the charge will happen on first connection. With the FluxMob Bolt2, I have found that, after "turning it on" and then connecting to my phone, there will be no charge.People should be warned about this. I really like the form factor of this device, it's a great size. It's light as well, and the fact that you don't have to carry a power adapter is excellent. The problem is you cannot rely on it. As for power, while they rate this at 6000 mAh, I am not able to get a good two charges out of it for my iPhone 6 plus phone. I'm not sure if I have a dud, or if this is the experience others are having, but this is extremely disappointing that this is not a reliable device.I own about 6 FluxMob cables, and I love them - they work as expected. Those get a 5-star rating from me, had I bought them from Amazon. This device, while it does not deserve a 1-star rating, I cannot give if higher than a 2-star, as I think it may be a dud.
