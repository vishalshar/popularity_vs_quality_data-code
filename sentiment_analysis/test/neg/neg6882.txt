Note: This is my first drone, so I may not fully know what to expect.I crashed my first take-off because the beginner assist turned into ATTI mode after take-off because of magnetic interference (scared me like crazy, but that's another story). Anticipating more crashes, I decided to put on these propeller guards. The drone handled very well with these on and made several take-offs, flights and landings. However, I messed up one landing and the drone tipped over, and these guards got hit by the propellors, and three of the four guards broke! The propellers themselves look and operate great even after the crash. I've decided to fly without these from now on because the drone itself is built solidly and as long as I'm not flying near people or crowded spaces, I don't think these guards have any use.
