Very disappointing. This collar is NOT fully compatible with the other fences as described by the manufacturer. I have the in-ground PetSafe fence for Cats and this collar is way more sensitive than those collars. It will activate a full 8 feet farther away from the fence than those collars and with my small yard it is just impossible for me to use it. Now that I have opened it to find out I that I can't use it, I can't return it. So unless you are certain this collar will work for your pet, think twice before you buy. A rechargeable collar is a great idea, but this one fell short. PetSafe items are usually quality products but I think they may have tried to cover too many lines with this one collar.
