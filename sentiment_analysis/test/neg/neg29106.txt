I bought this to try because I had been using the Tile product and even though it wroked greast, I didn't want to have to buy a new one every year because the battery went down. This item has a replaceable battery. Big deal. Like many other reviews here, I found that this device hardly works reliably. It may work when paired but then after first use if you want to show someone how it works, it fails. The app shows the wiggling icon but the Trackr doesn't ring even if a couple feet away. I've reset it by telling blue tooth to forget the device then opening the battery door and closing it again to start over. Again, it may work once, then not again. I wish the Tile had a replaceable battery, then it would be perfect.
