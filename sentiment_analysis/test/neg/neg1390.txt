I was very excited about this item.  However, the packaging does not include instructions.  You have to watch a video online, continuously pausing and playing to see how it is supposed to be put together.  The jars are nothing special--just mason jars.  The mint is still not growing.  The others are growing, but it is clear that the herbs will need to be transferred to larger containers very soon.  This was extremely disappointing, especially given the high price tag.  I wish I had put in a little more effort and just bought everything myself separately.  Not something I would ever buy again, nor would I recommend this to anyone else.
