Unfortunately, the Bellabeat Leaf was a complete waste to me. It started immediately when I was unable to link my email with it and had to contact customer service. The next issue was tracking my sleep. I noticed within two days that it was not doing that correctly.  I contacted customer service and received a notification that my email would be sent to a "human" who would contact me to help. A week later, and nobody contacted me. Next, it kept it not tracking steps. This was after approximately 18 days of having it. I tried to wear on the necklace, shirt, bracelet but still nothing. It started with only tracking half a day of steps and then two days later, nothing. Once again I contacted customer service and I got the same response with NO follow up. I ended up returning the Leaf. I'm sad that this product failed because I truly loved the idea behind it. I'm giving it two stars because I liked the piece itself. It was very light and has a very esthetically pleasing appearance.
