Not there yet.Pro: When it works its pretty cool. I like getting reminded to breath when I'm stressed.Cons: Mostly it doesn't work.1. Gets disconnected frequently2. When it reconnects it takes a long time to sync.3. The app crashes quite often.4. It tells me I'm tense when I know the Spire is sitting in the laundry basket5. It doesn't seem to be responding to my breathing when I'm on the subway to work6. Focused and Relaxed don't match how I think I'm feeling very well.7. I'd like to be notified by a vibrate without having my phone beep. There is not that option. I'd also like to control the length of vibration so I can have a more subtle notification. The vibration is audible and its awkward to have my bra make noise in tense situations.8, Although it says its synced to my calendar there doesn't seem to be any way to see if tenseness is associated with certain events.I hope they get this working better.
