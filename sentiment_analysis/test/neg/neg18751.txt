Worst product ever! I wish I could have selected zero stars. The GPS doesn't alert you as advertised and the activity tracker technology also doesn't work. I contacted support and they completely acknowled the activity tracker doesn't work and offered to give me 3 free months while they are working on trying to fix. They charged me a year of service up front. What good is 3 months free if it doesn't even track my dog? Complete waste of money and energy!
