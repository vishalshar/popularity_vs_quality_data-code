I wore this product to a NYE wedding the day it arrived. I should have tested it, but the other reviews were so positive that I couldn't wait to wear it and was certain it would work. It absolutely didn't...not on the dance floor and not whilst lounging around the house the following day. Here's a recap of my experience with this product:Granted, I'm a sweater. I'm a prescription anti-prespirant sweater. I'm not a stinker though. So, when I rented this gorgeous, glittery, expensive Dolce and Gabana dress for a ritzy New Years Eve wedding that took place at one of Americas fanciest hotels, I planned for the sweatiness by ensuring the underarm area was black--and immune to showing sweat stains. I did not, however, purchase enough insurance for the dress to cover the disastrous odor now emanating from it. I'm certain I will be billed for the cost to replace the dress if the receiver uses his nose to assess its condition--and lives to tell his boss about it. My husband said that when they open the bag I shipped the dress back in, they will probably pass out. Nice.Luckily, while holding his nose with one hand and wiping my tears with another, my husband stuck by my side at the wedding, even though no one else would come close. "Maybe I didn't use enough of the stuff," I thought in despair, chastising myself for not trying the odorant on before wearing it out. So, to be fair before writing this scathing and honest report of my experience with the odorant, I tried it on again today. I slathered the stuff on--thicker than on NYE and covering a greater surface area. Alas, my husband smelled me when he got home from work and suggested I send back the unopened stick of unscented stuff I got for him. It clearly does not work.Does this work for some people? Apparently--the other reviews are great! Does it work for me? Absolutely not. Not on the dance floor and not while lounging around the house.Back to the aluminum stick for my pits. :/
