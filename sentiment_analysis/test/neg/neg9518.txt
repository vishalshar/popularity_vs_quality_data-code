The D-Link 935L camera will NOT work.  The camera wizard set-up software is ONLY available for smart phones (not computers) and the wizard demands a router name but does not allow for typing in a non-broadcasted name.  If you wanted to add the 935L to a D-Link recording device, you cannot because the camera is not capable with the recording device (and the recording device itself does not work).Save your time and buy a different brand.
