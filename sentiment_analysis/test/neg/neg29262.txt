Love this little maker,..and the hot coffee is amazing..BUT I was so disappointed on the 2nd k-cup....the coffee g rounds were all over and clogged the funnel...it was just horrible! I want another one so bad butt this also happened to me with the KNOX k-cup machine. Im purchasing another brand right now..but seriously wish i could have had this one work out. The coffee is so hot and that is what i like. its a cute little machine....sad.
