After watching the short video and reading the reviews I decided to purchase a six pack of the rotini.  I consider myself to be a good cook with an above average palate and to me this product is bad.  It's not so much the taste (a little sweet for me) but the texture is horrible.  I made a pasta salad with italian dressing, olives, and feta cheese and to be honest with you I could not tell the difference in texture between the pasta and the feta cheese.  It will actually crumble in your mouth like feta when chewing.  I've tried cooking it for both 6 mins and 8 mins with no difference in texture.  Taste is very subjective but texture is very objective and this product leave much to be desired.  I really wanted to love this product especially with an endorsement from Joe Bastianich but ultimately he is an investor in this start up company so take his recommendation with a grain of salt.  Also I'm not a big fan of having to buy 6 boxes especially when you don't like it.  Smart marketing though as you get six customers with every purchase ultimately they will lose in the long run with minimal repeat customers especially at this price.
