I really wanted to love this product. I bought it right before a trip to Iceland to get some adventure type shots out the car window or while we were hiking to set up shots anywhere. The legs on this products are very versatile and could grip around anything. They were great. However, the tightening fastener holder were very weak. You would just jiggle the tripod a little bit and your phone would loosen up and fall right out. I had a iPhone6 and not a "plus". So unfortunately, this was a deal breaker for me because I couldn't trust it'd actually hold my phone if I put it by my side during hiking. Defeated the whole purpose of convenient, spontaneous shots because I had to be very careful it didn't come out of the holder. Luckily, I only paid $10 for this so I just use it as a stand alone tripod on my office desk or flat surfaces.
