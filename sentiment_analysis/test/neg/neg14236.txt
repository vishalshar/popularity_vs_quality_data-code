UPDATE 11/14/2016 - After not receiving an RMA label for a few days from WowWee, I received an email saying that their FedEx system was out. By this time, I had already given up and used AMAZON to RMA the item as defective. I should have done this in the first place. It was super easy. Long story short..we have had the toy for about a week and while its cute and neat, it really doesnt do much. It will follow you around if you have the watch on, you can make him dance with the watch, you can control it like an RC car from your phone and do a few other things. He responds to me saying "Hey Chip" but not the kids or the wife. Learning that it needs to get your slipper from under the bed like the commercial...probably not happening. In fact, i dont think it is going to "learn" much. Gesture stuff is cool for a second, Yoga routine is the same every time as is the dance routine. Ive updated the rating to 2 stars now that we have a working toy. After the 50 dollar price drop immediately after I purchased it, the lack-luster customer service, and my kids not caring about it much anymore...I cant help but feel like this is kind of a waste of your money.I received this yesterday, it worked for about 5 minutes. It played with the ball for a little bit and then died. Completely. Leaving my 8 year old crying on her birthday. I emailed support and they told me to "uninstall the app". The app isnt required for the dog to work. They told me to uninstall the batteries. The battery is secured with tiny Torx screws. Good luck. They told me to replace those batteries. Im pretty sure they arent just your off the shelf Duracell AA batteries inside the robot. How do those recharge anyways if they are? They said finally..to make sure the Bluetooth on my phone is on. Again, its advertised as not needing a phone for the dog to work so...I dont know. Maybe the Age requirements should be more of a College Degree requirement instead of 8+.Ive responded to customer service. Hopefully they respond with something a little more than the "FAQ" answers. As of right now, I am wishing I got her Cozmo.
