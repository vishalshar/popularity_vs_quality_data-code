We have been using this for about 5 months and loved it.  We are able to see how active our dog has been.  The bad part is the mount isn't designed very well and ours has already broken.  You have to bend the plastic to remove the device for charging and due to a weak part of the mount it breaks easily.  When this happens you run the risk of losing the device rather easily.  I have emailed support and got an automated response, but still nothing after a week.  If you are considering one of these loosely attach a $100 bill to your dogs collar and go for a walk.  Sound like fun?  It's not, so now it sits on the kitchen counter and emails us a report about it not moving or notifies us that it needs charging.  Too bad since we really liked it.  I don't want to rate it 1 star, but with the problems I feel I have no choice.
