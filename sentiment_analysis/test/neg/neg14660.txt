Product looked ok - I put it on my phone and then the contact charger didn't work, so I wrote to customer service and asked to tell me how to make it work or trade it out for the keychain model.  They wrote back with some off the wall response that didn't even address my problem and offered a discount to buy another phone attachment.  I returned the item and responded that the customer service was not up to par and they should really make an effort to read customer emails.  All in all the product is workable - somewhat expensive for the design and actual quality.
