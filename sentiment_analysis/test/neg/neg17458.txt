I hate it so far!. Took me couple of tries to get the first battery connected. Connected both batteries, still not able to get the alert on my phone. I guess it is a load of crap! Also getting a low battery warning, while the phone app says the battery is good.I have given up as support is not able to help either. One of the battery managed to send alerts, while the other one gets connected initially, does not send alerts and goes dead later.I am returning it to Amazon.
