Okay, so I read the reviews and thought, "Perhaps ..."  Well, the reviews were right:  This is the most awful piece of cheaply made crap dressed up in a nice box.  I opened it today and1.  The turntable arm won't return at the end of a record (a common problem, now that I've checked into it),2.  The components are the cheapest, flimsiest plastic - it's hard to believe they would work at all.  I shudder to think what would happen to my LP's if I continued to play them on this,3.  The recorder does not work. At All. The recorder doesn't acknowledge when a cd is in it.4.  Yes, the cassette player has only eject and fast forward...and a peculiar burning smell when used...Simply awful.  A shame too since, when I played an LP and then a cassette, it sounded rather good.Now, I must box it back up and ship it back.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SKIP THIS ITEM.
