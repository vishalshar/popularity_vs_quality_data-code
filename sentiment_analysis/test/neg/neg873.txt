I would of given this more stars but when I got the ifetch, the box was falling apart. No instructions. Only worked once for me. I think someone had this before & return it to amazon. Needless to say, I don't think customer service checked it out to see if it work. Someone just put in back on the shelf before checking to see if it worked. I did get a replacement iFetch. That one came with instructions. Hmmmm!
