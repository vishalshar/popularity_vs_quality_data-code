So far I am LOVING this tank!! I tried a different small aquaponic tank and have had TERRIBLE luck with it. I'm still waiting on the basil to grow before I can move my Betta over, poor guy is due for an upgrade. I LOVE the light settings, it even makes an amazing nightlight. So, SO happy I made this purchase!!Update 12/01/2016I am unfortunately upset with how this has turned out. I loved it so much at first. Unfortunately, as it turned out, the aquarium I got came with the Kickstarter Sponge- which dissolves and does not allow anything to grow. So I had to go and replace the sponge with a new material (got sea sponge as was recommended by the company, I got it at a pet store). It's not a HUGE deal, just kind of inconvenient, since I also had to get new seeds.My biggest issue with this tank is the flow of the filter. It is so strong, my poor betta gets tossed around by it whenever he swims near the top. I rotated it a little so the flow went closer to a wall, so as long as he stays in certain parts of the tank, he is ok. I just feel bad watching him get pushed. :( I plan on just getting a 10 gallon regular tank one of these days, and if I want to try my hand at aquaponics (I really really do!) I will look into other options.The tank itself is really pretty though, and I would love it more were it not for the hiccups at the beginning, and the really really strong filter pressure.
