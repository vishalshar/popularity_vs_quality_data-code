Bought an original LIFX bulb a couple years ago.  Worked well enough, decided to add 3 more. I am sending them right back.  After fussing with 1 bulb for 45 minutes and never getting connected, decided they are just not worth the money or my time.  And, as I already own 1 bulb, I'm not new to the product. I still couldn't figure it out!
