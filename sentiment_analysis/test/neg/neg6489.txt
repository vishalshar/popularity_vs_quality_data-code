I just returned this mount, the magnets are very weak and dont plan on buying anymore from this company. Phone kept falling off mount and was very frustrating and scary when you have a fear of cracking your device. So I purchased a different mount from TECHMATTE! And I'm very happy with it, strong magnets and much cheaper. So buy techmatte instead and you'll be happy.
