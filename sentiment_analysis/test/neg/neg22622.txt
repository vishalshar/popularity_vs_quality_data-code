Sucks Sucks Sucks. Maybe first day or two worked great, awesome speed. Tried switching my phone plan thru metro pcs to it with my sim card an service was just horrible. Slow. Glitchy. Now it wont even turn on no matter how long i charge it. I got into some financial hardship recently an being a single mom with a two year old i am furious because i lost track of time and it being 2 days over my 30 days and clearly ive bought some nice pricey items thru amazon i cant even get credit or a gift card. So i have this just lying around letting me know ive wasted my money and can get no help. Especially with Christmas around the corner? Definitely rethinking where im going to do my shopping.
