Get the blue screen with "no signal" message trying to connect to iPhone 6 and iPad Mini2. Have the correct Apple lightning adapter (model (MD826AM/A). Amazon was good enough to overnight me another CUBE and the second one doesn't work. I don't know what I am doing wrong. I have contacted RIF6 through their website 4 times with no response.
