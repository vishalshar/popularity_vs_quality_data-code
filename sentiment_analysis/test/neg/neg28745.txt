Great charger, reasonably priced  a few more features would be nice.  customer service is terrible, they don't even post a phone number. they get back to your email within 24 hours, but its an automated response.I had this at a 4 star, but after dealing with customer service i dropped them a few stars. all i did was change phones (just an iPhone 6s to another 6s)  and the zus needs to be reset on the companies end  and trying to get that done is like getting a hold of the president.  its been about 2 weeks and still not working.and not a solid response from the company.
