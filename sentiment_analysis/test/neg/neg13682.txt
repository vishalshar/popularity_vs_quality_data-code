The clamp is made of a cheap polymer that was brittle and cracked after just a few uses. We did not over tighten the unit or handle it roughly but it still developed multiple stress fractures on the inside of the ring that holds the main cylinder and the clamp assembly that goes on the inside of the pot completely broke off.  The app is ok, gets the job done and the cooker itself works. But since our clamp broke after just a few uses we are frustrated with this unit. Very disappointing.
