i bought the device to use while traveling to India. The device never worked. I would turn it on and it would be stuck on a message saying "registering connection". I called their customer service and to their credit, a live person picked up the phone. They claimed that I am in a "poor connection area" where as I've been in major cities around India and got perfect cell reception through my AT&T iPhone. I am returning this unit as it is not what it is promised to be. Don't waste your time and money on this device, it simply does not work and does not hold up to their promise.
