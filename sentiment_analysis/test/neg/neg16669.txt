this equipment only worked once. the timer went crazy counting down from 30 seconds and would not stop from this loop . Because of this I am unable to set the proper timing for making yogurt. It constantly counting down 30 seconds and then repeating the countdown very rapidly. Several emails to the company on info@storebound.com are yet to be answered.
