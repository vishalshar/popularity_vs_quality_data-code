I was psyched when I received this phone. It's beautiful! nice display, Android platform, everything that I was looking for. I needed an unlocked GSM phone for travel in SE Asia. However when I tried to use it in Vietnam it would not work. I went to a couple of mobile phone shops with great hope, but even though they wanted to sell me SIM cards and air time, they were unable to make it work. I ended up buying an inexpensive Nokia at a store other than the first 2 that I tried , to use on my trip.
