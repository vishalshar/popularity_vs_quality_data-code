Bought this for my sons 10th birthday and although the idea is great, the execution of the product makes that idea worthless. Every time you smack the card even a little bit, it turns off. Go back to the drawing board and create a better product, and please let me know when you figure it out so you can send me another card that actually executes its intent.
