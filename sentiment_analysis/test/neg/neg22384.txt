Huge misrepresentation.There are no flowers ever, just grass and something that looks like weeds. There is some assembly and the one we received did not fit together properly so when we would water the plant it would leak, significantly. The ONLY reason this got two stars instead of one is because for some reason I'll never understand my daughter still liked it. I will say the "plant" sprouted fairly quickly and she was so excited the first time it did but honestly you're better off buying a basic flower pot and your own seeds.
