Come on! I got this bag in and it only contained a small amount of treats! What a ripoff! Look at the photo of the Amazon ad. That is not what it looks like AT ALL. The turkey pieces are cube like and have a pile of dust at the bottom. If you measure the "height" of treats in the bag before you even open it, it only has about 2 inches worth of treats in the bottom. Literally two inches up from the bottom is all the treats that are in it. TOTAL RIPOFF FOR $6 AS OF DECEMBER 2016! I am calling the company to make a complaint. The bag is misleading ad is the photo of the product. But since my cat ate them, there goes about 12 cents worth of treats for six bucks! ?My cat loved them but ate them in TWO DAYS because there were hardly any to speak of. A small palm-full at best. Don't even give them your money. Or find a big bag elsewhere. This is too bad. The scoundrels need to offer $6 worth for God's sake. My cat loves them so you freaky ripoffs get 2 stars. Nah... make it one.
