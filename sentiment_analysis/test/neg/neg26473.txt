Don't waste your time or money. Cheap, battery operated toy. The concept is good but the execution is terrible. I suppose if you have a ton of patience and lots of batteries then it's worth playing with. Worse yet, mine came with the seals broken  so you can tell it was returned once already. I'm sending this one back a second time... Just hope they don't ship it to another unlucky soul.
