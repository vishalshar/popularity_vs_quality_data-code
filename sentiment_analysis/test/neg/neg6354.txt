I actually purchased four of the Ollies for Christmas presents, one for each family and one for me, naturally. In summary, the APPs did not work well enough for me to see if the device was worth $100. I also had a lot of trouble getting the BlueTooth to link to an iPad or Android phone.  All four were returned because they were going to be much too frustrating to operate on Christmas morning.As with all electronics, I make sure we have batteries charged and ready to go, so I opened my Ollie and charged using USB as instructed. I then installed the APP on my iPad on about 12/1/14, and waited for Ollie to turn green indicating a full charge. I started the APP on the iPad which gave me the next steps. However, this is when trouble started. The APP told me that there was an Update available, but there was not. (On each of my many times restarting the APP, it said the same thing so I even tried multiple times to update, even removing the APP and reinstalling what should have been the latest version.)When I opened the APP, it said to 'touch the Ollie to the phone', but the BlueTooth did not connect. Then it said to wake up Ollie by connecting the USB power again. Ollie would turn on then turn off again. Clearly the Bluetooth was not connecting. Finally after trying multiple combinations of opening APP, waking Ollie, touching Ollie to various parts of the iPad, it finally said it was connecting. That took over 1 minute. By this time, excluding the 4-hours of charging, I had been working at starting the Ollie for about 30 minutes, way too long for a Christmas morning. (A base ball is instant and cheaper and probably more fun!) During this process there was a 'Help" button on the lower right which gave me some basic steps to operation.Ollie finally did work, sort of. I may be slow, but I am not stupid. It took me 10-15 minutes even to get basic control. However there were many obstacles to having any fun with it. If you bumped into anything, Ollie often got disoriented besides being stuck. It made disconcerting clicking noises that sounded like plastic gears slipping.If i picked it up, one wheel would often spin like it was a spring wound up. There appeared to be a way to re-orient Ollie, but that was not intuitive and turned out to be trial and error. (A quarter turn would often make Ollie go in 180o opposite direction. I made multiple small adjustments and tried Ollie until it went where it did when first turned on.) After spending at least an hour playing, I decided that no one would be spending that much time for one present at Christmas.I did not give up though. I loaded the APP on my Android phone and tried again on that platform. However, I never could get Ollie to wake up long enough to link to the phone. I don't know what the trouble there was because I gave up after 15 more minutes. However, if it was the APP not able to connect, that would have been a killer failure on Christmas morning. If it was because the Ollie battery was too low, that would mean that it only had minimal operating time before it would shut down and need recharging. I had only played with it for 1-hour of minimal use, certainly not high speed racing or tricks, then 4 more hours of charging? I think not.There is an outside chance that this was operator error and this is a great toy, (the reason I purchased it). But it is not mature enough to be fun even the average techie.
