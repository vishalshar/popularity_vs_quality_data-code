UPDATED FEEDBACK ON OCTOBER 25, 2011Eight months later I have discovered this product has broken off small chunks from the foam dust cover inside of the CD slot, in addition to deforming other areas of the foam. No big deal if you leave the mount in all the time, but may become an issue should you decide to sell the car in the future. A new OEM stereo would likely cost hundreds of dollars to replace. Since the manufacturer didn't bother to acknowledge or respond to my email about this issue, I'm revising my rating from 4 stars to 1.*************ORIGINAL REVIEW ON MARCH 1, 2011This mount is well made and feels substantial in the hand. If you no longer use your car's CD player, it presents a great alternative to the suction-cup mounts, however it can block access to buttons and/or air vents depending on your dashboard layout. I found my large HTC Evo smartphone to bounce excessively during road drives, but not when used with my small, light-weight Sony MP3 player.
