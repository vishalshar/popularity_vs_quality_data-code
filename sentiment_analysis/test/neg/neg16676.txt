I have never given a 1 start review on Amazon before.  But I am super disappointed with this product.The main feature attracted me to this product is the KeepNear Notifications because I want to know I left something below as soon as possible.  This did not work at all.  Here are 3 cases I encountered.  At all time I have the latest version of the XY Find It app (version 3.35) running in the background, everything enabled as instructed i.e. KeepNear, Location Service, Notification, etc.:Case 1)A day before yesterday at home I opened the app to check for the location, which was accurate, then switched the app to the background.  Yesterday I bought both the XY3 and my iPhone with me to the office.  Just before I finished at the office I wanted to test the XY3.  So I left it on my desk and go downstairs.  When I check the app it indicate the XY3 is out of range, BUT the location was still at my home, although it had been with me the whole day in the office.Case 2)Yesterday I left the XY3 at my apartment and walked a block away.  NO notification on my iPhone.  After about an hour I return to my apartment, again NO notification.Case 3)Today in office the XY3 and the iPhone were both sitting on my desk (1 foot apart).  Suddenly I received 3 notifications within a 25 minutes saying the XY3 is out of range.  The notification only stopped after I switched the app back to the front.I use the apps feedback function to send 2 feedbacks to the company, and received no reply.So I recommend to stay away from this product.
