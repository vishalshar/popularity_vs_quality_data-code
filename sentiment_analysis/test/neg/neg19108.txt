They worked great for a while. I have pretty wide feet, so I had to lace them in the loose pattern. They were comfortable until yesterday when they started to snap. And today, I looked down and 2 more had broken. As I write this, it's been 18 days since I placed my order. I've been wearing them for 16 days and 3 have already broken.
