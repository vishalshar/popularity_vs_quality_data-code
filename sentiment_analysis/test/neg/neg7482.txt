This said I slept an hour and 16 minutes, but I slept 8 hours. The next night it said I didn't sleep at all, but walked 400 steps in my sleep. I contacted their support via email, but still have not received a response. I did receive a response extremely quickly to my review, so publicly calling them out seems to be the only way to make them pretend to care. Clearly this cannot accurately track anything, even though I am wearing it on my wrist. It's basically just a pretty bracelet at this point, and a complete waste of money.Update 3/24/16: I have been contacted by bellabeat, and told they have made several important improvements. I should be receiving a new LEAF sometime soon, and will be comparing it to my previous experience with this tracker, as well as my current experience with my FitBit Charge HR. The LEAF was/is significantly more beautiful than my fitbit, and I got a lot of comments when wearing it, so I am looking forward to seeing how this goes.
