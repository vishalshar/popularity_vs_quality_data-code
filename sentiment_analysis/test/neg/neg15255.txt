NO SUPPORT AVAILABLE AFTER AUGUST 31, 2016--This seems to be a great product.  However, I received the following email from Bevy on July 11, 2106.  "We regret to inform you that Lineage Labs, Inc., the maker of Bevy, has discontinued normal operations due to insufficient funding and will no longer be shipping Bevys.  The Company is providing a Transition Period effective immediately through August 31, 2016 during which time Customers will be provided email support at support@bevy.us on a best-effort basis.  At the conclusion of the Transition Period technical support and warranty for Bevy will be discontinued.  We encourage you to backup all the photos and videos on your Bevy using the instructions here:  [...]  We are immensely grateful to all of our customers, partners, investors, and friends who helped us realize our vision of building a better way to manage your family's photos and videos.  We were inspired by your support and your appreciation of Bevy made all the hard work worthwhile.  While we all wish the outcome were different, we feel honored to have been given an opportunity to create something that would have a positive impact on the lives of the families we served.  With best wishes, Team Bevy"  Sucks!  Once the operating systems are updated, it won't work anymore.
