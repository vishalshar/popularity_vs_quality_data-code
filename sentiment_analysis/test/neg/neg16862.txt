The lense was extremely tight when trying to put it on my GoPro. The lense just ended up popping out and broke so I was never even able to use the PolarPro lense. My GoPro is my baby so I know I did not put too much pressure or incorrectly put it on. I wish it didn't break cause I thought the product looked good. I would super glue the lense back on, but we all know how super glue goes :)
