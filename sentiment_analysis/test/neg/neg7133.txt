The Splash is not just a box with a button, it is a service. First look out for the activation fee $25 if you can do it on line and $35 if you have to call in. Good luck with the web site working for you. With mine the web told me it could not activate the device due to the SN# being wrong. So a made my first call to Greatcalls. After 6 calls, 8 customer service or technical people later and with over 2 hour invested and still the device is not active. So far this is the worst service ever and I have not even been able to test the device.
