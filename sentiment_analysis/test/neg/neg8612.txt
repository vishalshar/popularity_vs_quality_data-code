I just started using the OctoFire 3.0 hub yesterday, and after awaking from sleep, my computer notified me that an independently powered USB hard drive that was connected to the hub was disconnected improperly. This hard drive has its own power and the octofire hub was also powered with the power adapter. Also note that I have used this hard drive for years plugged into another USB hub with no such issues.Additionally, I tried to register for the 6 month warranty extension via the website, and the OctoFire Hub is not one of the available products in the select menus.Also, this is not putting out the required current to charge devices over 1A, as claimed in the description for this device. When I plug in the iPhone, I get the "iPhone not Charging" message on my computer, along with many other devices requiring a current greater than 1A. I tried to process a replacement for a defective unit, and in the seller's words:"We take immense care to maintain High Quality Standards by multiple checks to make the product durable. Unfortunately, we still come across few defective items. We provide 1 year warranty for our products and take the responsibility for replacement of any defective products. We can process the replacement for the Octofire Turbo unit.Â”Based on the reviews here and on Kickstarter, It seems that they're coming across much more than just a few defective items.Even worse, the seller hasn't responded to my email pursuing the replacement they offered from over a week ago. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find any other USB hubs that will offer data and 2A current through each port, but based on the 0 accountability offered by the seller and the rate of defective units, this is obviously not a good option.
