Once again GreatCall is charging me for service I did not use. I purchased a GreatCall Jitterbug5 Easy-to-Use Cell Phone and Medical Alert Device for Seniors - Red on January 19, 2015 from Amaazon. They tried to charge me but relented after much arguing.and hassle. I like an idiot purchased another GreatCall Samsung Jitterbug Touch3 Senior and received the phone on Dec 21st however as you can see GreatCall is trying to charge me from 11/2215/ to 12/22/ a month before I had the phone.Screenshots enclosed let great cal;l try to dispute these facts as they did at consumer affairs.
