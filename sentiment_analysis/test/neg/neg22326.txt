Alerts didn't work our baby cried and we didn't even hear him with the listening mode on.Slow to connect. Didn't connect Wirelessly until my wife got it to connect on her phone, and then she invited me.  I've got Gigabit wireless in the house and I work in IT at a hospital. The only good feature was that the 360 degree is awesome and it was neat to move the camera with the phone.
