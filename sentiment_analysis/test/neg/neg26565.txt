I had high hopes for this sauce as Bravado Spice Company's Crimson Hot Sauce is outstanding and in my opinion a must try!  The Ghost Pepper & Blueberry sauce was quite the disappointment.  The blueberry taste is so lacking my family and some friends could barely taste it, and since this sauce contains ghost peppers I would have expected it to have a kick to it.  Tabasco sauce is much spicier than this item.  I would not order this again.
