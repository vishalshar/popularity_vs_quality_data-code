I have been buying this product for awhile through other vendors and at local holistic stores. Usually, this product is outstanding and my pets love it. This week I decided to order through Amazon and received the new packaging--the clear plastic bag inside a box, not vacuum sealed. (I usually buy the resealable bags this used to come in). I opened it only to find mostly tiny scraps of chicken with a large amount of chicken dust. It appears to me to be the 'end of a batch' or the stuff you find in the bottom of a container when you have used up all the good stuff of something. For nearly $55, this is ridiculous. To top it off, I cannot return it because it is considered a food item. This product line is twice as expensive as other natural treats, so I expect better quality control than this. You are going to lose the very customers who have CHOSEN to spend more money on your products because they expect consistency. I have read your responses to other complaints about this same issue. Unless you are personally supervising and overseeing the production of this product with 'eyes on' inspection, then you have no idea what your factory is producing and putting in these bags. They may be trying to save you money by not throwing anything away figuring no one will notice. Since this issue has sprung up in the last few months to a year, I would suspect a change in the production process.
