Like many others whose reviews I read, I used to love this product, back before they cheapened the quality of the refill trays. I used to be able to go about 3 weeks with one cat before I had to replace the tray, which was reasonable. Now, I can barely get to 10 days, and the box is soaked through with urine, and it is very flimsy. It is clear they either off-shored their manufacturing or went to cheaper materials to earn a higher profit. Meanwhile, the price of the refills continues to go up. I loved this system for about 2 years, and now I'm just buying enough trays to carry me until I can purchase the next good thing... I'm really bummed about it. When a product starts out good and then gets cheapened by the company, it is corporate greed at its worst...
