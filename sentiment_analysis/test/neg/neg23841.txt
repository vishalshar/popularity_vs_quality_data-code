Rokform used to make a very solid and nice product. Not so much any more. After ordering two phone cases for the iPhone 6 plus, neither one of them lasted a week before the rubber trim completely separated from the plastic. Tried to contact customer service, in which they said it comes with a 2 year warranty. I submitted proof of purchase and pictures but have not heard back from them. Think twice about ordering this product. Wish they would go back to the all plastic, 2 piece phone cases likely used to use for the iPhone 4 and 5.
