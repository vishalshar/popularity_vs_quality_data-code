Band broke within two months, after normal use. App is unintuitive and hard to use and to get the full features of nutrition tracking you have to use "MyFitnessPal" which is another app loaded with ads and useless garbage. The sync between the two apps is very faulty, and the numbers displayed on each app vary with regards to calories burned, and goals for weight loss.
