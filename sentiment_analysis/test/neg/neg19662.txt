I bought this item to place at my back door during the winter snowy season. The first snow we had was 1 inch or less and it did it's job of melting the snow before it turned to ice. However, the next snow storm we had over 3 inches of snow and the mat was covered with snow and it did not melt the snow! I intended to use this all winter as our area gets quite a bit of snow, on and off, throughout the winter. This product did not meet our needs and I would not buy it again.
