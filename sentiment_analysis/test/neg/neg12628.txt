We've ordered BIXBI treats a few times for our dog, and she loved them! However, the last time we ordered these treats, we noticed the chicken treats were slightly discolored (a little more gray than when we had gotten them the first time) and smelled off. We're disappointed that the quality appears to be inconsistent and won't risk purchasing again.
