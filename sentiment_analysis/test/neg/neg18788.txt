I like the product. It was delivered as promised. A little thinner than I expected. Not sure yet how durable. Kids will show me on Christmas! As of now, I'd buy it again.UPDATE. As for this case's durability...Let me just say, I am now on amazon purchasing an iPad repair kit for a pad dropped INDOORS encased in this thing. 4 Stars down to 1
