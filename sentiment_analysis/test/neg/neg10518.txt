Installed August Smart Lock to help wheelchair-bound family member open front door.  For two weeks it worked pretty well, every now and then it wouldn't respond to iPhone, necessitating phone reboot, but mostly it worked.  However, last night, on its own with nobody near it, it unlocked the door.  We did not activate Remote Access at install, and we never gave anybody Guest rights.  Only the linked iPhone is set up to work with the Smart Lock.  Highest available security has been enabled on phone and wifi, and BlueTooth is active only when needed for the Smart Lock.  Yet it unlocked the door while I stood 20 feet away.  This is scary.  I will return it, and the August Doorbell Cam (bought at the same time), which almost never works.August products look cool, and are a great idea.... but unfortunately they don't work consistently and are untrustworthy.
