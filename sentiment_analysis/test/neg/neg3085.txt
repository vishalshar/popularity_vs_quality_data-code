Saw the reviews and was really excited.There is no way to turn down my voice when chatting. It's awful, I am much louder than what I am listening to.Sound volume in general is much softer than wired headphones. I expected it to be a little softer, but not this bad.Fine for a cheap set, not fine for $150. I'm having a hard time believing there are so many 5 star reviews.
