UPDATE:  I originally wrote the below review giving this 3 stars.  I'm downgrading it to 2 (and that's generous) because the right earbud stopped working entirely after 1 month.  This product is a nice idea, but like any product from a small start-up, you need to be prepared for quality that's not up to what you've come to expect from Bose, Beats, etc.  Definitely hesitate before spending $300 on this.----------------------------I can't give this product more than 3 stars because it's extremely buggy, but can't give it less because when it works it's extremely useful and the sound quality is good.CONS / Bugs that I've encountered- When using the internal music player, you can't alternate between playlists (making it useless to have more than 1).  Bragi support advised me on how I might fix this, but their feedback didn't solve the issue.- The online updating feature of the Dash doesn't seem to be compatible with Windows 10.  Basically, you're supposed to update each side of the Dash individually; the right side updates fine using Bragi's instructions, but the left does not.  Thus, after updating I can listen to music with just the right earbud inserted, but as soon as the left is inserted a woman's voiceover comes on and continuously advises me to go to Bragi's website and try the updating process again.  Ultimately, Bragi couldn't solve this issue so I had to replace the Dash.  To be safe I'm never going to try to update the Dash again; I'll just accept it as is.- Music spontaneously cuts out then starts again, even when not listening in Bluetooth mode.- Slow customer service.  You can only ask questions via e-mail; no phone or chat service.PROS- No cords.- Bluetooth works at considerable distance (probably 20-30 feet).- Can use 1 internally stored playlist with no need for Bluetooth connection (you can actually store 4 playlists, but due to a functional bug you can only listen to the first playlist).
