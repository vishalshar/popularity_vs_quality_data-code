I realize this is not exactly the kind of product for the faint of heart, but come on. I did not have the best time getting this thing to connect to my very new and up to date iMac. Online instructions and Livid's wiki are well below average - they look pretty with cool graphics, but not well thought out. There is apparently no thought to telling people a sequence of actions to follow and simultaneously providing clear links to apps/downloads required. Where they do provide instructions seemed to suggest it was so easy and simple, but not a shred of troubleshooting tips. The result of following supposedly easy peasy set of instructions left me unable to connect. The USB receiver connection is still no go for me, but I am able to connect via Bluetooth. Figuring that out was pure luck. Or is that what I was supposed to do all along? Did I miss some essential detail in my 4-5 retries? Who knows.After all that fun (trust me this would ruin a Christmas morning) I have it working with their app LividWingFX (yawn), Guitar Rig and Ableton, but there is no shortage of complaints on their lack of support for Ableton 9.7 (and more). Am I missing something really cool, or should I be happy I can use Ableton learn to manually assign this thing to effects parameters and more? In actual use, I'm not sure I like the huge 4 buttons being momentary only. Seems like a waste. Can't see the sliders too well when playing and they don't seem to consistently react to my slightly chubby finger tips. One quibble - if you want this to fit on a Les Paul kiss your pick guard goodbye.Livid needs to hire someone (qualified) to really organize their online documentation. It is 2016 and everybody is selling more than apps and hardware, they are selling the "User Experience." This was not a good one to start. People should have a nice clear set of actions to follow to get up and running. Gee whiz, how about actually numbering steps!!! What a concept.  Next how about troubleshooting steps for each step instead of having to dig into the morass of their wiki for troubleshooting information?Before all the whiners and haters jump on me, I don't rant about this kind of thing unless I think it is constructive. Livid has something really neat and fun. I think we all expect a wireless MIDI controller to be challenging and a bit more complex to set up than a printer, but a great and innovative product should never be impacted by a bad website (unless it is open source, then we expect that).
