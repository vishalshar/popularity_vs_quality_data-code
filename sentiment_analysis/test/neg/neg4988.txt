It disconnects/un-pairs quite often. We will be doing a full shift today (with the nurses and aides) with these so we will see how it goes. Aside from the disconnecting, these are pretty nifty!Edit:After working with these for a few weeks, we still haven't been able to get them to work properly. The messages are delayed (by minutes) or don't go through at all. Either they are defective or just poorly made devices. A bit (a lot) disappointed.
