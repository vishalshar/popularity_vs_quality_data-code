Several problems with bag:Overall liked the concept but:1. Does not charge. Could not get it to charge.2. TSA Problem. Bag pulled out of scanner after 2 rescans at ISP.  TSA supervisor was called and opened bag - unzipping and checking all compartments, Swabbed bag twice.  I explained it had an internal  battery and Bluetooth connectivity. He just scowled and told me that the bag "was not a good idea" and that he would not recommend using this bag.
