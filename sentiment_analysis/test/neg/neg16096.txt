It is a good product don't get me wrong. Very nice and doesn't actually look like a fitness tracker. The issue I have is that the battery dies within weeks. I changed the batteries within 1 week of using this product and now I am getting warnings that the new set of batteries are dangerously low. Also the battery compartment is loose and needs some manipulation for the device to come on.
