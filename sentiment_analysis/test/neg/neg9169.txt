During my "first time"  registering process my PC accidentally powered off, and the process was interrupted. When I try to register again I couldn't, Minecraft always start with the demo user, so I can't use my license.I posted a ticket in the Gameband forum, 20 days ago and they never replied me. It's a "good look" product, but there is a problem with the post sale service, so it did not run !
