****Edit: Oh oh! What I was afraid of happened. However, not in the way I was expecting. about two weeks ago I needed to charge my iPhone and tried using the Nomad and unfortunately, it didn't charge. First I thought maybe it just doesn't have a charge anymore so I plugged it in. It said it was fully charged, but I left it plugged in overnight anyway. The next morning? Same problem. However, when I keep it plugged in *then* plug it into my phone, it works. So the problem isn't the wire, which is what I figured would fail first. So somehow, the battery is charged but is refusing to release it's power unless it's being charged. I'll attempt to contact the seller and see how that goes. If things go well, I'll return my five star rating. Until then, a wallet that fails two months after purchasing it is simply unacceptable. A year? I wouldn't even be happy with that and would want two full years. Two months??? I can't recommend it if it's going to fail that quickly. See below for my original review.===========================================================================================================Let's face it, for many of us our devices are our life and having a dead device is simply not acceptable. I program for a living and always need to be able to communicate and receive communication. While I generally plan my day to make sure I don't go too far without being able to charge my phone, sometimes things happen and you land up being out longer than planned. We've all been there!I bought a mobile charger that I added to my keychain. It did the job, but I quickly got rid of it as it was simply too big. I didn't want to look like a janitor with gigantic keys and stuff in my pocket. I wanted something that made me forget it was there but did the job when I needed it to. I think this wallet is the best solution I've seen so far.As you can see from the attached pic, the black wallet is slightly larger than my previous brown one. This size difference is something you forget about very quickly and it slips into my front pocket just as easily as my brown one. There are six credit card holders that are snug, but that doesn't stop you from being able to put two credit cards in each one. On either side of the charging cable there is an additional holding area for rewards cards, medical cards, stuff you don't use that often. It doesn't have a "windowed" card holder for people like me that have to show my train ticket every day. It's nice when you have this feature, as you just flash your card without having to take anything out. Now, I have to actually take out my train ticket to show the conductor. But this design makes the wallet stay slim while being functional. In the money area, there isn't a divider like my previous wallets and this is something Nomad should fix and wouldn't be an issue at all. Simply put a divider in this area. I like the divider because sometimes I'm carrying money that I want to keep separate from a different set of money. Not a problem. You can use a piece of paper to divide things.Now, let's get to the actual battery. I personally carry a tiny iphone charger on my keychain and would actually prefer that the wallet didn't have one. Why? Well what happens when the cable fails (as they all do)? I guess I have to throw my wallet away and buy a brand new one! I reasoned that the wallet was relatively inexpensive but this was actually an issue for me. I'd rather there simply be your standard usb female and I can plug a lightning cable into. Lightning cable goes bad? Just buy a new $5 one. No need to replace a $35 wallet. But with that said, it is indeed nice to have an all-in-one solution and the battery charges at about 1% per minute up to about 80% charged, then takes longer. I haven't drained the phone super low, but I would imagine that based on what I'm seeing so far, I'd expect the battery to be able to take me from 20% to 80%. Lastly, one little annoyance is that you don't know the charge level of the battery unless you actually plug in a micro usb charger. So there's no button that you can press to see the current charge on the battery. Come to think of it, however, that's actually a good thing or the button might constantly get pressed inside your pocket and burn the battery out. So nevermind! That's a good thing!!!The idea is to get you that little extra boost when you're stuck somewhere with a dead phone battery, not to charge ten devices! If I was taken away from my normal routine and wasn't going to see a wall outlet for another 10 hours, I'm confident that I'd make it through with this wallet charger. With that being the goal, while also making you forget it's there when not being used, this wallet does the job!
