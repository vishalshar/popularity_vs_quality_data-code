This is a cool idea and it works, when it was working. I had the device for 2 months, and only used it for 5 days twice to break two different habits of mine before it completely stopped working. Other than this it has mostly sat on my nightstand for the vast majority of the 4 months since its been purchased. The two months in between it stopping working and today approximate the amount of time it took to get to the response of pay for shipping it in and we will fix it.I paid 200 dollars for this battery pack, and the company wants to gouge me for return shipping on a defective item?? Well here's your review.Also the watch band looks as it I have had it laying in saltwater for an extended period of time, again after 2 months of sitting on my bedstand.Update: still waiting for my replacement item. It mysteriously disappeared in shipping, pavlok agreed to send a unit out despite this yet has not shipped as of yet. "Due to issues with defective units" so they are still struggling with quality control it sounds like. I do miss it, and it does work. I still think the price is high, and the service low though so I will keep this review as is until at least my unit is replaced.
