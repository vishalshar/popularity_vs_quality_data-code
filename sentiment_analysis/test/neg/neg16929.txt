I had such high hopes, but the product is quite a disappointment and the low reviews appear to be spot on.  The following issues will affect Macbook 2016/Skylake users:* When connecting the device with a USB-C charging cable, 90% of the time the device will cause the macbook to quickly flip between Charging/Not Charging state. This will eventually stop if you unplug and replug the device several times. (There seems to be a host-client negotiation issue)* After longer periods of charging, the device heats up and STOPS ALLOWING ANY CHARGING. That's right... after a while, the charging stops. This one's a deal breaker.I really wanted to like this device. It simply doesn't function as it was intended to.
