The smart is slim in size but it doesn't have a key. Firstly, in case of running out of the battery, it is locked up and cannot be opened. Secondly, the app got some problems and need to be improved. Thirdly, the front panel is not sensitive enough to activate the Bluetooth of the smart lock. The last one is the customer support that doesn't sound good. Although this lock was successfully funded in KS, it means nothing to a user.
