Purchased this light to try out the smart technology with my Echo Dot. Wifi worked great, app works great, lots of options and customization, connected to Alexa without issue... but the bulb itself would not brighten more than candle light. No matter what I did to troubleshoot (resetting the bulb, changing light fixtures, disconnecting and reconnecting, etc), it would not get any brighter. Compared to my 800lm regular bulb, it didn't even look like it was on. I could see the bulb change hue when I adjusted it in the app, so it was communicating fine, just not bright.I suspect it was a defective bulb, the package had already been opened when I received it, maybe a return got put in the wrong box.I'll give the benefit of the doubt to the company, but the reason I won't get another one is because neither the website nor app has a way to contact customer service (if it exists). So I had no way other than the FAQ and troubleshooting guide to fix the situation.
