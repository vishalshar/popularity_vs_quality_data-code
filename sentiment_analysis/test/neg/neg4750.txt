I wanted to love this. It seems like such a great idea, a place for warm items and cold.  However, the size is awkward.  The warm container only holds one cup of food. One cup of soup is a small even for my 4 year old. The first time I sent it with him, it leaked all over.  I thought he must have not sealed it back up right.  So today, I filled it with soup again and put it in his backpack.  I thought, hey it is Friday, I should add a treat.  So I opened it up to add a few pieces of chocolate and soup was everywhere. I was sure I sealed it up correctly, in fact it took me about 4 tries to get the soup top to line up right and close up.  I am sure it is fine for things like ravioli or chicken nuggets but again, the size of that container is awkward.  You can't even put a warm sandwich in there unless you cut it in a circle and waste 1/4 of the sandwich.
