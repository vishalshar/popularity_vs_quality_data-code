I do not like the build quality of this product. After TWO DAYS of light use, the wrist-strap ripped off the handle. Upon inspection, it seems as though the glue holding the strap to the device came loose. Luckily, my GoPro and the device did not fall to the ground. For fear of the mounting screw failing or breaking on me, I replaced it with the mounting screw that came with GoPro itself for the remainder of my trip. Not sure how long this product is going to last upon repeated use, but so far it's not looking good. With that said, there are some pros to this product.The StrapMount was very tight and secure when mounting it on my backpack, though I did not use this feature much as the backplate of the StrapMount dug into my chest. Very sharp and painful without padding. The ProGrip has a very subdued and sleek look, which made filming with the GoPro very professional looking. The contoured grip has a rubbery texture which makes the device easy to wield as well.Overall, this product was okay, but not worth the premium price that I purchased it for as the quality of the materials was subpar.
