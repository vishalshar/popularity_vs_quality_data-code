After using the device as indicated several times a day for almost a week, I can't say I've noticed any effect. It feels buzzy, sure, but no energizing effect. No calming effect. Not even a placebo effect. Nada. There are a few different "vibes" offered in the app, each promising a different effect. In reality, they all do the same thing: make the device buzz a bit, and nothing more. A sonicare toothbrush does the same thing, costs 1/4 as much, and can clean teeth to boot.
