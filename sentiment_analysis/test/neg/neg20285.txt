Please don't waste your money on this as I did.  Doesn't work AT ALL.  The least amount of pressure and it comes to a halt.  I mean ANY pressure.  Can barely touch it.  Eats through batteries at a horrific rate and won't adhere to my shower floor.  I used it everyday for 3 weeks and have seen no difference.  It's headed for the bin.Point to ponder...all the glowing reviews are "unverified" and only the 1 star reviews are from verified purchases.  Hmmmm
