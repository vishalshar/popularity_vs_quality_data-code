I wanted to love this device but found three major faults.  First, it did not support my Cisco set-top box, not even recording and playing back the "plastic" remote.  Second, support was non-existent--email direct to Color Tiger's support address and via the Amazon email system went unanswered.  There are no self-service materials on Color Tiger's website and seemingly no way to support other than sending an email and hoping for response (which in my case did not happen).  Finally, the Amazon Alexa integration is just awful.  "Alexa, tell AnyMote to Power On my Vizio TV" was the default until I learned how to tweak things by renaming the power button and renaming the TV in the iOS app.  This I found by trial and error; there is no support in the form of documentation, quick start guides, or even FAQs on the manufacturer's website.  The device should enable fluid, natural language interactions, not require a rigid, structured vocabulary.  I have a single TV controlled by AnyMote; why should I be required to provide the name of a specific TV?  And shouldn't AnyMote know that "turn on" and "power on" are the same?  I don't want to have to trick the product by renaming buttons and devices just to simplify the conversation.  For a function that will be used a much as TV/Video control, the control should IMHO be much more tightly integrated and more natural to use.  Lots more work to do here.As a big fan of bleeding edge products, I really wanted the AnyMote to work.  Lack of technical support, zero online documentation, and awkward Alexa integration resulted in my decision to return the device for a refund.  Hopefully, Color Tiger will resolve these issues in the future.  Until then, I recommend to stay away from this product.
