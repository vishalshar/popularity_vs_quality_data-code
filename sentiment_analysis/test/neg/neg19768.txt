If you are an Android user, DO NOT BUY this case!  The Android app is clearly and afterthought cobbled together to claim they support Android when they do not.  Many features are missing, including key features like notifying you if you get out of range of the case.  To add insult to injury, it is incredibly buggy, leading to a very frustrating experience for the features that are implemented.The case itself seems decently made, but only time will tell how well it lives up to the rigors of travel.
