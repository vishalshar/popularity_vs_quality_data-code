I don't think the engineers tested this on the elderly because it is actually fairly difficult to set up. To use maybe OK just the phone anything else is complicated and/or menu driven that requires a series of steps on a small screen format. I spent 4 -5 hrs setting up including being placed on hold 3 different times just to activate than to release and watch my mother try to use it with her tremor and other issues, computers and technology we have grown accustom to and I see it was just another thing to make her feel old and stupid, actually her words. She wants her turtle shell back. So I will be sending this back.
