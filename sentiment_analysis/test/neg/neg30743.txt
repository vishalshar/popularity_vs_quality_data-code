I'm not sure what the use is for this.  My limited tests have shown that the stuff comes off too easily, yet leaves a residue behind on the item (this was at 24hrs).I made bumper for a flashlight as a test yesterday.  It peeled right off today and left white goop behind that won't come off.WTF!!!!???????
