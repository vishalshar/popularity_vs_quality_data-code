I couldn't get the app to work.  When I tried to "add a new skybell", I always got a message saying "there was a problem connecting to server, try again later"  I spent an hour with tech support who couldn't solve the problem.  Tried to contact tech support yesterday unsuccessfully.  I asked for a call back, and the call back was to say they had no techs available.  I have a Samsung S7 phone, and a 3 month-old Asus router.  I'm competent with most tech devices, and have never had to send one back because I couldn't get it to work.  I sent the Skybell back today.
