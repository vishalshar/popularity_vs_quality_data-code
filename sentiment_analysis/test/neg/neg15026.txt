Initially it was great but then after 4 months of use, it started having problems connecting and dispensing treats. tried to reboot everything but no improvement. I hope Amazon would get in touch with the seller and get some answers. The camera itself started getting weird pictures even though the wifi connection is great. Can't get a decent picture. Now I am regretting this buy.
