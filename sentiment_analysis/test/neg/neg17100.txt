This food used to be great, but they must have just changed the formula because it is not the same food as before (I was buying 3 cases a month). The food is darker, has less chunks of tuna, and smells worse.  My cat wouldn't eat the new formula, which is sad because this was the only food she would eat.  So now we start the process over of finding a food she will eat that doesn't have any chicken in it.  But Amazon was amazing to work with in resolving the problem, so this is all on the manufacturer.
