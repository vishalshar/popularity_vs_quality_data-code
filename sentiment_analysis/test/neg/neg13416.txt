Don't believe the hype!  I wear a size 12 wide shoe.  I just bought a new pair of shoes that have two sets of holes and the rest are loops down the sides where the shoe laces go.  These Hickies are hard to get turned around so they hook with the button on top.  They want to twist every which way.  Also, putting that end piece in the hole and then stretching the opening around the button is not easy.  Try that for six or seven times and it gets very frustrating.  Now, do it for the other shoe!Once I got all the Hickies in place, it looked nothing like they show in their ads.  Some were up-sidedown with no amount of twisting and turning could get them right-side up like in the pictures.  Putting my shoes on was almost impossible.  My shoes were so tight, I could barely get my toes into them.  I finally shoved my foot into the shoe, crumpled the tongue completely underneath and rolled the top of the heal completely over.  I could barely get my fingers in the shoes to straighten the tongue and the heel out.  Not comfortable and they were tight, very tight.I have some limited bending ability, I can't bend over to tie shoelaces.  But now, I can't even get my shoes on because they are so tight with the Hickies.  Of course, I took them off and I've gone back to my shoelaces.  I guess if you're a young teenager and wear regular tennis shoes, you could possibly put these in without a problem, but I don't think slipping your shoes on and off is going to be that easy unless you wear a size 6 extremely narrow!Just my opinion.  I'm looking for something else, NOT Hickies!
