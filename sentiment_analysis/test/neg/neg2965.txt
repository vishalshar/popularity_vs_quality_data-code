Like a lot of the other reviews, this product really feels like a waste of time and money.  It's a great idea to begin with, but fails.I didn't set mine up immediately when I got it and it stayed on a tabletop for at least a week before we opened it. In that time, something started growing in there, but out the side of the block.  When I finally did soak it and set it up, it started to grow pretty quickly, but not much grew.  The mushrooms themselves also grew very little and just stopped and started dying, which forced us to harvest.  They were so small, we never even used them.  So it was a complete waste of time and money for us.We definitely kept up watering them twice a day (morning and night time), but it didn't really help.  It seems like it's pretty rare to see a second batch and we definitely didn't.  I tried continuing to water it, hoping another set would sprout, but it never did.
