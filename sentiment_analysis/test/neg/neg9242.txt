My two dogs were so excited just to watch me unpack the iFetch.  I showed them the balls first and they were literally jumping up and down.  I plugged the unit in and dropped the first ball in.  It was set on 30ft. so I lowered the setting and put in another ball.  It did nothing.  I tried several more times and nothing.  Then hubby tried and it shot one more time and then nothing!  I am so disappointed.  For what this thing costs, you would think it would work more than once!  I am returning it!
