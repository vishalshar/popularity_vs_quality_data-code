I have been using these trays for years and loved them. Then about 6 months ago, I noticed that the labeling and packaging was different. Well so is the quality. The old trays were completely sealed inside so no urine leaked out. These simply have a piece of plastic liner across the bottom but it doesn't protect the corners or edges so if your cat goes near the edges it soaks the cardboard through to the bottom right away.  I took advice from another reviewer and I now have to reinforce with duct tape.  I just use it to seal all the way around the bottom of the tray and it seems to work really well. However for the price I paid I should NOT have to do this. I'm very disappointed with this company.  I just can't find an alternative.Update 5/18/16 - this is STILL terrible and getting worse.  I really cannot believe this product is still being sold.  Urine goes everywhere and the trays are soaked.  I am on here now trying to find a new litter box and thought I would update my review again.
