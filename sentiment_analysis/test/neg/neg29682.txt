Honestly, I am not sure what all the hype is about. This filament printed fine at 220C, nice surface look, but terrible mechanical properties... Heat treated it for 60 minutes at 265F, warped and shrunk a little as to be expected I suppose and was not terribly bad, but I was shocked at its really awful mechanical properties. Really what's the point of a carbon fiber part that is more brittle than regular PLA? Snaps clean through with very little force applied, much less than it would take to snap the equivalent PLA part. Not sure what the premium price is for? Maybe bragging rights? It fails to provide any real value and has a huge cost in terms of the expensive nozzles needed to resist the wear. Not to mention risk of health problems from carbon fiber particles. I can see absolutely no practical benefit unless you like brag you printed stuff in carbon fiber. I'll probably finish the spool out just to see if I can find some light at the end of this bleak tunnel, but I won't be reordering. Huge disappointment.
