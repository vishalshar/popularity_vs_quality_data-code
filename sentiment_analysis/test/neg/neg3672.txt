This coffee pot did not hold water in the reservoir and kept leaking out the back. Also when making a pot of coffee the pot did not push up enough to let the coffee out of the basket. It ran over 2 times(once on each side) spewing grounds all over my counter. I had to put 2 popsicle sticks on the lids under the knob to give enough height to let them drain. I sent it back.
