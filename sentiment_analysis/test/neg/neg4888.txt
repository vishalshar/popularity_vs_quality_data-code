I got this for my 18 year old dog. He has a history of of vestibular disease and many lumps and bumps which, at his age, will not be followed up on since he wouldn't be a good candidate for surgery. In any case, for the past year or so he has shown significant confusion. I'm not sure what constitutes a lame dog, but I hoped this odd mushroom mixture would help him improve his quality of life. I am fine if it did nothing since I did not see an improvement, but he actually became much more confused in the morning. His incontinence increased and he was showing some tremors when standing. I haven't changed his diet for 9 years now so I don't know what else it could be. Since stopping the daily dosing, he seems to be back to his baseline from last year. He is back to being more aware and being able to find the dog door. Would not recommend since smaller or older dogs may be sensitive to this formula.
