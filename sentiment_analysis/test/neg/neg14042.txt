I ended up returning my unit to Amazon, I was waffling on giving it a one or two star review and decided on two for what I think is overall a great product, but with one major issue that I couldn't live with.Pros:*Real-time monitoring! This works great, there's no delay at all, so it's better than literally every other gaming headset. If you normally hate monitoring, you might hate this too! But it's better than every other headset you've tried, so give it a shot. If you still hate it, I don't think you can turn it off.*Build quality - these headphones feel sturdy, have actual metal in places, a nice foam cover, and hinges/swivels that feel like they will last*They work across all platforms - yes you need a wire for Xbox, but that's Xbox's fault (and otherwise would raise the price of this unit to match something like an Astro A50.)*Microphone - I'm listing it as a pro, and also as a con. It sounds great though, and seems very accurate (i.e., you will sound more like 'yourself' through this mic)*Setup - setup was easy enough, the instructions were well written. If you are having issues with operation/control from a PS4 (this is what I used primarily) then you didn't follow ALL of the instructions.Cons:*Microphone - there's a reason you can scroll down and find windscreens as other items people have bought with this - it DRASTICALLY needs a windscreen. Like, if you buy this, buy the windscreen 2-pack for 6 bucks too without hesitation. It's horrible without one. Every p is plosive, hissing, all of the bad noises that could be picked up are picked up. It's both a blessing of the mic and a downside as they didn't include windscreens.*Pairing button - the pairing button requires a pin or paperclip and is recessed into the wireless dongle. WHY?!?! I spent more time trying to find something that would fit into this hole than I did the entire rest of setup. The first paperclip I tried was slightly too big, I had to use a safety pin, which I didn't like but it seemed not to damage the button/insides.*Dongle size - first, teehee at 'dongle size' because I am a child. Second, I was using a PS4 Pro, and the dongle is thick enough (teehee again) that you have to really cram it into one of the front USB ports for it to fit, and if the plastic piece of the PS4 Pro around the ports on the front didn't have the flex that it does, they wouldn't fit. For my purposes, I plugged it into the back USB port next to the optical audio output, because it's pretty long and sticks out a lot if you use the front port.*Feedback/hum/hiss - this is why I returned the headset. I have not tried it wired, but the wireless audio had a very loud hiss/hum just being on. I tried operating without the mic being plugged in, and still had the same hiss. I'm sure there's a technical term for it that someone might know, but essentially this seemed like the minimum noise of the unit just being powered on/amplified. Wired, the unit uses amplification from the device, so it's not using its built-in battery/amplification, so I assume it would not buzz that way and had a friend who bought the unit too confirm they didn't hear it wired. Wireless however, which, honestly is why I bought it, the noise is so loud that it is audible unless you turn the volume up very loud. I could hear it over game/chat audio until I turned it up almost all the way, which for me was too loud. Sound quality was good for a stereo headset at high volume, and probably even at low volume, but the hum was unacceptable at low volumes for me.You may have a different experience, and I will update this as soon as my friend has a chance to test his out wirelessly to see if he had the same issue (maybe this was just a defective unit?), but because of this I would not recommend the headset to anyone who isn't planning on playing at max volume all the time.
