I spent 14 hours of my life fiddling with this phone that I will never get back. The problems are almost too numerous to mention. I started having my doubts about the phone when I went to the "About Phone" section and the text was overlaid with horizontal black stripes. At that point, I wondered if it was too late for me to buy the extended warranty for the phone. However I was still willing to give it a chance. As I started loading apps onto the phone, the phone would freeze and I would have to rebootit. Of note, was Facebook. I could never get that app to work. There were times when the phone screen would be totally black and did not respond to a reboot. After several minutes, I could usually turn the phone completely off with a hard reset and then turn it on again. I am not sure whether the person who tested the phone when requested, tried to load apps onto the phone. When it was first turned on, it seems to work fine. However, not being able to add apps, to have the phone freeze up, the screen turn black and not respond to a reboot was too much for me to handle. As I said, I gave up 14 hours of my life to this phone and I will never get them back. I return the phone the next day. I am very thankful for Amazon's return policy.
