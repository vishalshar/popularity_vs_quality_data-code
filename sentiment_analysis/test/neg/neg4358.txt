I  found this interesting new technology and after researching I decided to buy one, I made it through Amazon's office came very fast to Miami and from there I would shipped to Bogota Colombia, very happy I found it very nice and started having trouble with registration but good achieve on Wednesday will my operator (Claro) registered the device (required standard record all telephone and modem for security) triggered my data plan in order to test the inputs of physical sim and start to enjoy the bliss it lasted until Thursday night a message where I indicated that there was a new version apparently was updated at night and on Friday my ordeal no longer allows you to select any input from the sim is generated or not the recognition, sent several emails give me some explanations and till date no solution. today I will try the satellite signal but I see that the money was lost because I have the suspicion that here in Colombia this technology not yet served.
