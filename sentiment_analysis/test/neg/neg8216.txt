This unit is not weather proof so I has to be kept in side the grill cabinet.  So every time I wanted to see how much propane I had left I had to go into the cabinet instead of having a display next to the grillThis unit has stopped working after a year.  when It was working, it needed to be re-"setup" every time I changed the propane tank.  A real pain.  I do not think that this unit is very well built.
