I bought this item about 4-1/2 months ago when it appeared on Shark Tank.  At first, I really loved it.  But after three weeks, it fell off the side of the tank.  Well, I cleaned everything back up and stuck it back onto the toilet.  Another couple of weeks later, it was on the floor again.  Long story short, the best I'm getting out of the suction cups is 2-3 days.  About a month ago, out of frustration, I almost got out the duct tape, but I decided that I wasn't about to stoop to that level.  So, I just laid it on top of the marble countertop next to the toilet and pressed down on the suction cups.  It's still there and hasn't moved or fallen on the floor.  It still lights up the toilet, but just not as well as when it was on the side of the bowl. Not what was advertised, but at least it is still working. I'm not satisfied with this at all, so my recommendation is don't waste your money on this item.Edit (8/5/2016): Ten days short ofl 5 months of operation, it now quit working.  Stays on constantly, will not automatically shut off.  As soon as the batteries wear out, it's going into the trash where it belongs.  This purchase is a complete waste of money.  I'm changing my review to ZERO stars.Edit, 10/1/2016: One month ago, I was contacted by the manufacturer reminding me that this product has a lifetime warranty.  So, I took them up on their offer to replace the product.  A couple of days later, I received the replacement.  I now have a light that works, but it still does not stay attached to the toilet.  I still do not recommend this product.
