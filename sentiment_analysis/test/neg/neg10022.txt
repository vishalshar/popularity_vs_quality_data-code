Low quality high price. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend is an engineer and I thought this would be a fun toy for him. The components are held together by a very weak  magnet, and if the components are not strongly connected they cannot communicate to each other, so when he built a component it barely worked and if you bumped the table or any part it wouldn't work, so the commercial that shows the dog stepping on the door mat and sending a text would not really work because the pieces will come apart. In addition the wifi component worked intermittently. I think this is a cool concept, but extremely over priced given how new and unrefined the concept is.
