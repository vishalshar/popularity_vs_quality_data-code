Hands down the worst phone I've ever owned. Hands free volume is not very loud. I can't see who is calling without opening the screen, upon which, the phone automatically answers the call. So, no more screening calls for me. Texting takes FOREVER because everything is so manual. Remember the days when flip phones auto completed for you? This doesn't do that. I'm extremely unhappy with this phone. Posh, put a little effort into your product please.
