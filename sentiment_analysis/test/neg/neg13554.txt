I chose this pitcher system based on the first sentence in the description -- "The Soma Pitcher is a beautiful glass pitcher and 100% compostable water filter, featuring coconut shell carbon and a plant-based casing so you can feel good about your water." I even went ahead and bought the replacement filters right along with it, knowing I would love it and prepping for the start of many years to come enjoying it daily.  I like my water room temp, and imagined this taking an honored spot on my kitchen countertop near my sink. Well kind folks, this isn't glass, is the same old "BPA free" plastic the other manufacturers are peddling. Since Bisphenol A, often known as BPA, is just one of the many dangerous chemicals that may be present in polycarbonate plastics, which can seep into your food and liquids and cause problems with human reproduction, metabolism, neurological function and a whole host of other problems, I try to avoid polycarbonate plastics as much as possible. I'll be returning this pitcher reluctantly. I wanted to love it so much! Hope this review helps others, and sorry for the bad news if you are of a similar mindset to my own.
