I'm very disappointed. I ordered this a month ago and received it on June 12.  I have used it nightly for the past two weeks;  once a day for two weeks only. The tube stopped working yesterday, it no longer dispenses the oil. I can see that there is still product in the tube but other than breaking it open, it's not accessible.The other possibility is that the tube was only partially filled.I can't speak to product efficacy yet.I will update this review when the issue is resolved.
