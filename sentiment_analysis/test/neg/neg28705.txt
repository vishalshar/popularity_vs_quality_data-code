I really wanted to like these.  I really did.  A co-worker lent me his to try out, and after fumbling with the controls I thought "these sound alright."  I loved the idea that they were small, had a great little charger, were advertised as waterproof, and I wouldn't have to worry about the neckband breaking.The bluetooth pairing is a disaster (using a Nexus 6 in my case.)  The connection constantly drops, rendering them useless as headphones to me.  The audio quality is terrible, worse than cheap $25 bluetooth headphones.  The touch controls are atrocious.I totally understand that at the size they are, Bragi is trying to pack a whole lot of features in a tiny amount of space.  But the end result led to so much disappointment, and at $250, I was expecting at least stable connectivity.
