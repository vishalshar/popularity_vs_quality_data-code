This product did not do what it was designed to do.  I purchased the metal product because cars get really hot here in Texas.  After one day in the car the plastic coating separated from the metal base.  The brackets did not hold my phone securely and would not remain tightened.  I was extremely unhappy with this product and I have returned it.
