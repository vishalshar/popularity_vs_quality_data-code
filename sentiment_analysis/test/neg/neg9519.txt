I got this camera because I had good experience with D-link 930L and 932L. I want to replace them with HD cameras. I got one 935L, setup was easy and everything worked in the beginning. Within hours I began to get white screen (all screen is white except the black time display). I rebooted the camera and it worked for a while and then got white screen again. I thought it was just a bad unit and asked Amazon to replace it.  New unit was delivered next day thanks to Amazon but I got the same exact problem. I upgraded the firmware to the latest but that did not fix the problem. I will return it and no more 935L for me.
