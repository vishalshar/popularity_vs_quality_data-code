DIDN'T EVEN LAST THREE MONTHS!I specifically bought this speaker because my previous two bluetooth speakers broke on me through normal use. This supposedly "tough" speaker didn't even last three months before it died on me.The company isn't responding to my messages. They have a one year warranty they are supposed to honor. I want my money back.
