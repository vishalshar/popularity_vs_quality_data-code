I bought this thinking it would be perfect while using maps on my phone. It fits in to the CD player just fine but since the external part extends out past the CD slot it also pushes the eject and FF scan buttons on my aftermarket head unit. Also, since you can't actually angle the phone towards the driver it's hard to see the screen, and completely impossible if you have polarized sunglasses. The screws come loose on a regular basis (I tighten them as tight as my hand can) and my phone will fall out on a speed bump. Today, once I found the holder attached to my purse I decided that was the end of it. I have the black aluminum version
