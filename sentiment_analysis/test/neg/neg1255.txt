Looks good - until you scratch it - and it's very comfortable. After less than a week I scratched it and it no longer looks as good. Something you're supposed to wear all the time shouldn't be so easily damaged. I'm not a hard laborer. The sleep tracking is not great. Not only can it not distinguish between being awake (reading or just not able to sleep) in bed and sleeping, but it considers my nightly trips to the bathroom as sleep. The editing feature for sleep should allow for checks on the accuracy of sleep tracking, but it allows for only one sleep period a night. So if you're awake for a couple hours in the middle of the night, you cannot track this. The band does not recognize yoga as an activity - though the phone app will allow you to manually log your yoga time. The software is extremely limited. The Ray does not have a laptop app, only a phone app. The phone app allows you to designate your active times as running, swimming, etc. but it does not have elliptical or hiking options - which are my my most frequent cardio activities. The app does not sync with weight watchers. I'm told it's supposed to sync with myfitnesspal but I have yet to figure that out, given that the instructions ask me to make selections in the app that don't exist. The sync with GoogleFit is very strange, reporting my sleep to GF but not my steps. I feel like I threw away $100. What a disappointment!
