The idea is great. Unfortunately the QA is not.Bought one for Christmas to do some experimentation at my 9 y/o's pace - he sees me prototyping projects with Raspberry Pis, and the like, so his interest has been high.He opened it Christmas morning and we went straight to the table to play. First couple experiments were fine, but once we went to build a catapult(power->makey->servo), the servo would have a mind of it's own. Bypass the makey, all set. So I submitted for replacement. Second kit came, interest level less than before(since we couldn't build the first thing he wanted to). Tried to build the catapult, it works! but when the servo returns, it just sits there stuttering. Neat.I'm done. Two in row with issues. Returned again. This product is overpriced for the quality.
