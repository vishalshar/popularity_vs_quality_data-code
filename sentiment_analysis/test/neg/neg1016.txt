After the first week the light stayed on continuously which was irritating since I could see the glow into the bedroom. I bought this so I could have a sensor light turn on and off in the middle of the night so once it no longer sensed properly it was useless to me. I guess if you don't mind replacing batteries every few days it could still be used but it truely did not work as promised. Very disappointed with this "shark tank" endorsed product.
