I would recommend you to find another way to change mood or improve it using your old ways. It is just expensive for VERY VERY VERY SMALL EFFECT if there is an effect, It won't last more than an hour. The device is not convenient to use. Complicated! You have to stick strap to your head and wait for at least 10 minutes to complete your vibe.  Plus, the expensive straps you need to buy in order to use the device. The device is basically useless if you ran out of straps. The apps is very annoying and is not user friendly. It crashes but hopefully the app gets improved so we can ignore this point. The device is based in not very well proof science and mostly placebo effect they even admitting that there is a placebo effect so why waste all this money for expensive device. If you suffer from anxiety or other psychological disorders seek a real medical treatment. Yes, the device feels is doing something but not a lot it is just placebo effect.
