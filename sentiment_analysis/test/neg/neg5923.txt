Like the top critical review, I really wanted to like this product, and not just because of the promise of better sleep and the disappearance of neck pain.  My wife bought it for me, hoping I would sleep better and feel better.  But after a couple weeks of trying to force myself to acclimate my body to it I had to call "uncle".It is a very nice product, well made, nicely packaged, but it just didn't fit me I guess.  I can honestly say I have never had more neck pain than after using this pillow.  One night back on my flattened old cheap memory foam and I feel worlds better, like I actually slept through the night.  My neck is loose and pain-free.Try it, you might like it.  But be honest with yourself if it doesn't work.
