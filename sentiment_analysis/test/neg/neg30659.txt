The temperature readings are inconsistent. I give very little margin for error is pretty small given a couple of degrees is the difference between an "all clear" and a doctor visit. The novelty of the "smart" feature is superfluous as you aren't likely to use it with your phone after the first few readings as there isn't much utility to the app.
