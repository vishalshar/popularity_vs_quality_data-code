Very disappointed.  I bought the iottie car mount and it was excellent.  It comes off sometimes, but all you have to do is clean it and snap it back on.  It held my iphone 4 in my lifeproof case very securely.  It holds my iphone 6 very well also (I now use a catalyst phone cover), but the bike mount rattles, shakes and feels like the phone is going to fall out when I hit a bump.  Would recommend the car mount but definitely not the bike mount.
