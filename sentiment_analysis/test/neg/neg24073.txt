The product is of very low quality.  The unit worked ok for about a year and then we started having issues with it.  It would drop off the network periodically and there were large gaps of data.  We called them and their support gave us the run around for about 2 weeks, they tried to blame our wireless network and just about everything they could before finally telling us the unit is defective and if we wanted to buy another one we could but that they would not replace it.  If you want to waste time and money then buy this product, if not there are many more reliable alternatives out there.
