I am not a fitness buff, but I'm trying.  I hit the gym 3-4 times a week.  I do cardio.  I do weights.  I thought that getting a chest-strap heart rate monitor would help me track productive workouts and hone in on my fitness goals.  The Wahoo TICKR X seemed like a good product.  The chest-strap monitors tend to be more reliable than the wrist monitors.  There is a fitness app that goes along with it.  Bluetooth and ANT+.  Sounded great.  And for the first 2 workouts, it worked fine.  Workout number 3, the bluetooth disconnected mid-workout, so there was no data for the second half of the workout.  OK, no worries.  Maybe I needed to use the ANT+ instead of the bluetooth.  Workout #4 with both bluetooth and ANT+, the ANT+ kept dropping and reconnecting.  I literally spent the entire workout listening to "Heartrate disconnected"... "Heartrate connected".  Several times a minute.  For 40 minutes.  Most annoying workout ever.  Workout number #5, disconnected the bluetooth and just used the ANT+.  Same thing... "heartrate disconnected"...... "heartrate connected".  Workout #6, back to bluetooth... dropped connection after 5 minutes and didn't reconnect.It had crossed my mind that the bluetooth in my phone could be the culprit, but my workout headphones are also bluetooth and I don't lose the connection with them, so the problem must be with the TICKR X. Sadly, I am returning this monitor and will be trying again with a different device.
