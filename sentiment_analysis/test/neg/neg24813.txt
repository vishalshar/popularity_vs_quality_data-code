After 30 minutes I knew I had to return this! My purchase was for swimming and the face kept popping off. Well, that and the fact it stopped every time I put it on. The battery was difficult to change. I sent it back and ordered a Garmin Vivofit 2 and I love it! Ain't no way I will lose this swimming!
