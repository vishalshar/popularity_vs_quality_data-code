Probably great idea but doesn't work as a car finder. I got it 2 days ago; tried it in open spaces 7 - 8 times, it only worked twice; fails to establish GPS signal, etc. Also, I don't notice a difference in charging my phone; the speed is about the same as my $5 charger. Also, it doesn't stay firmly in the socket (pops out). As per design: it looks good on the picture but feels like a cheap plastic. I'll return it once I find my car.
