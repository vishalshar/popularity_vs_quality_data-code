Damaged our furniture. Daughter followed instructions, used the build mat to create her object and cured it with the light.  She put the object on our new wood dining table and later on her painted wood vanity table. The creopop object reacted with the finishes on the furniture and completely stripped the finish where it had been sitting. Contacted Creopop and was told that there is a warning that the ink can react with some surfaces.  Yes, the INK, not the cured object.  Very disappointed as the pen was fun for my kids, but it's now in the trash.  Disappointed in the company's lack of concern as well.  The pictures show the spot on the dining table where it removed the dark stain down to the bare wood. The blue picture shows the vanity with the small spot damaged and the last one shows the bottomof the object after removing it from vanity, you can see the blue paint on it.
