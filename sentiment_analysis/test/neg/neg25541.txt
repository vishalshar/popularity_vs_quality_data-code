They claim you will have ready to eat mushrooms in ten days, it's been 45 and I see nothing.  I followed the directions exactly as stated on the box and still nothing.  Contacted the company, they told me to put it outside for fresh air.  I thought this was an INDOOR growing kit?  Well, I can't put it outside because it's been 50 degrees or colder here. So I asked for a refund on April 4th, hopefully I will get one. I love the idea of this grow kit but I have had no luck with mine, I suggest this product if you can put it outside in warm weather.
