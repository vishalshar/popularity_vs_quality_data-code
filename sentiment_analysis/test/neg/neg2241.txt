I wanted SO BADLY to love this product. I'm a huge fan of fitness tracking gadgets (I've been wearing my FitBit One almost constantly for 2 years now) and I loved the idea of one targeted for women. Unfortunately, the only thing I really LOVE about it is the way it looks - It's a bit big as a necklace for my taste (and my infant kept trying to eat it, so that wasn't ideal!) and I couldn't figure out how to use the strap to make it a bracelet (I could probably have found a YouTube tutorial somewhere, but just using the instructions that came with the product I was baffled) but clipped onto my shirt it is pretty yet unobtrusive. The Leaf is actually pretty thick, but the thick part sits nicely against the skin and isn't heavy or anything. I had a lot of trouble getting the clip open enough to put on my shirts (they're not kidding about only using it on thin fabrics!) but once it was there I hardly noticed it anymore, even when working out.The features I was most excited about the prospect of ended up being some of the most disappointing. The cycle tracking just uses the date of your last period and your average cycle length to predict when your period will be due, which is a bummer since there are so many apps that let you input information about BBT or cervical mucous and it would have been nice to have that integrated. The way it is now is no more useful than looking at a calendar, so I'll just continue using more in-depth apps for tracking my cycle.Similarly, the stress relief function is disappointing. I thought the guided meditation was a little cheesy, and I never tried the breathing exercises because I had so much trouble getting the product clipped to my shirt that 1 - I didn't want to have to move it to my waistband and then back again and 2 - I wasn't convinced it would fit over the thicker hem of my pants. I think a common misconception is that it will alert you when it thinks you are stressed and could utilize the breathing exercises, but this is incorrect. It doesn't sense anything but is just supposed to provide you with feedback when you decide on your own to use that feature.The sleep tracking was horribly inaccurate for me (misjudging my sleep and/or wake times by over 2 hours). The way different sleep trackers work varies and can never give you a 100% accurate reading, but being wrong by that much time makes it totally useless. When you sync the tracker you can adjust your sleep and wake times (which I feel like defeats the purpose of having it - if I knew exactly when I fell asleep I wouldn't be as interested in the data!) but then it overwrites any night wakings you had! With my FitBit I can tell it when I went to bed or woke up and it will just recalculate the data it had already stored. But with an infant and 2 toddlers I wake up frequently during the night, and I want a sleep tracker that will tell me how much time I slept once I account for the multiple times at night I wake up to feed or take care of someone. If I change the sleeping times in the Leaf app it takes away the times it initially said I was awake and makes it look like I'm getting a solid night of sleep (when I know for a fact that I'm not!).The step tracking also seems pretty inaccurate even when clipped on my shirt (as is supposed to be the most accurate). I don't care about it being accurate to the step, but having it not count the steps I take when I get up with the kids at night isn't fair to me, and there have been times I'll have been walking around the house for hours and it says I took 150 steps (which just can't possibly be right!).Overall I would love to see this product developed further (or see other brands make products designed for women) but I just can't justify the cost for the limited and incorrect data provided :(
