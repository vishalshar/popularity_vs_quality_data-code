I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend's 2015 Volkswagen Tiguan.  No matter how I tried to attach it  to the dash... even after extensive efforts to clean the dash with isopropyl alcohol.... the included dash mount would not stick!!!After cleaning the dash thoroughly, and attaching the dash mount disc as per the instructions... then attaching the mount (also as per the instructions), this mount literally FELL OFF of the dash within a few seconds!!!I am unwilling to suction-mount this thing directly to the dash (without using the included dash mount disc) because doing so will damage the vinyl on the dash!!!  It suction-mounts to the windshield very well. However, if it is mounted to the windshield... it will interfere with the driver's ability to see while driving!!!This mount was a 100% waste of money.
