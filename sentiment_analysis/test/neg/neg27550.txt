I purchased this item one month ago, and really loved the convenience of it and the ability of the glasses to fit snugly and stay put on the nose.  Based on that alone I would rate the glasses as excellent.However,  the first shortcoming that I encountered was that if one is not careful when returning the glasses to the case the spring loaded nose pads  get caught in the case (because the case is understandably very thin) and bend.  Since I need glasses to read,  it is difficult to determine if I am sliding the glasses into the case properly in order to avoid that eventuality.  On a positive note, when bent in this manner the nose pads do easily bend back into place.Alas, after only one month the glasses broke while in the case with the cell phone in my front pocket.  I was not doing anything unusual, just walking. There is a metal connecting wire molded into the plastic that holds the two pieces of glass together at the nose bridge. The plastic on the right side broke off and the glasses essentially fell apart. They cannot be repaired. Therefore, I can only rate them at 2 stars when taking all factors into account, and would not recommend it.  It is a conceptually nice idea, but one that is not-yet-ready-for-Amazon-Prime-Time.
