The cube arrived today.  In addition to two of the four sides being scratched, the unit didn't power on.  I tried several times to no avail.  I held the power button as instructed, but nothing happened.  I even attempted to charge the unit to see if that would make it work.  No luck there either.  In addition, the cables provided didn't fit any of my android devices, including a Samsung and HTC.  In order to get this item to connect with my PC and Apple computers, I would need to purchase additional cables. See photo of cable input(s) on device I received.  The device is also absent any operational buttons; apparently, you have to use the remote to navigate on this device.  I wouldn't recommend this item.
