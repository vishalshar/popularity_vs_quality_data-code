Its OK.  Not what I really expected though.  Doesn't quite fit canont4i well...at least not the kit lens or the 40mm pancake.  It is definitely not a tool for quick shooting or on the go.  But for planned shots or shots on tripod where set up time is available it does the job well enough.  Takes a little practice and patience to get it smooth but it is better than without it at least.  A little pricey for what it actually does and I can easily see this a better value at half the price.
