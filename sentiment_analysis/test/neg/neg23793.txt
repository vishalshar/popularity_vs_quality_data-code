I've been using the ScoopFree litter box system for almost two years and I've now switched back to regular litter. I truly believe that the manufacturers have cheapened this product. I have one cat, and I used to be able to go almost a month without changing the Scoopfree litter. Now I need to change it every week. If I wait two weeks, the entire box is soaked through.The cardboard is thinner now that it used to be. You can feel it just when you pick it up -- it doesn't feel as solid and sturdy as it used to.It's really a shame because I did like it in the beginning. Now the product is unusable unless I want to change it every week and that's too costly.
