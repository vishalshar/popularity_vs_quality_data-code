I agree with JS.  It was impossible to assemble - impossible I say!!!!  Then when I finally got to the point of stretching the seat cover over the frame, the plastic connector (that connects the side rail and head rail), broke off.  Nice concept but nothing like the product shown in the assembly video.  I know it's probably not financially feasible, but maybe send in partially assembled??  Seems like a great concept but just not worth the effort involved with putting it together.  I'm wondering, if I WAS able to put it together, if it would have collapsed with me in it.  Then I thought, I would have to go through this endeavour all over again if I ever wanted to wash the cover?
