update - 5/31 - after couple of months of use, I decided to disconnect it.Main problems, product not reliable, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. bothe inside the house and outside.when I'm inside the house it usually faster to walk to the door than the time it takes the app to connect to the lock (if it connects).Outside the house, the chances are 50/50, couldn't figure out when it connects.Another problem, we set it to lock after  few minutes, but if you talk to someone with the door open, it try to lock it and when you close the door it damage both door and lock.I debated to give them 2 stars or 3, so I went with the 3.I just go it, but this is my first impression:1. Installation - very easy about 5 minutes2. The lock is much much bigger than I thought.2. Application - not ready for prime time. User interface could be friendlier.3. Application crashes frequently.4. Auto unlock is not ready for Android, and not really working for IOS as well.5. In the video, they control the lock from a computer, I couldn't find how to do that.6. In order to control it when you are not need the door you will need "Connect" which is currently back ordered with estimated release date. The product video is ahead of the actual product.7. invite other person, send him a text with a link to install the application.Basically you can open and close the lock with your phone, which is nice, the rest of the functionality is not ready yet.
