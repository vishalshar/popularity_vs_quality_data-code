The video and guide was helpful and it was easy to do. It held fine for about 2 weeks n ended up having to take phone in to be repaired and the guy told me it was a faulty screen . It just happens it happens to them too at times . You just never know.! Phones fixed but wasted too much money on it...should just got new phone
