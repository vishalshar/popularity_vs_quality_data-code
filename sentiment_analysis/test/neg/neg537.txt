Great idea in theory but spoiled by poor headphone and sound quality and defective controls.Initially it appeared the mouldable earphone inserts were too hard for ears. They became more pliable on moulding but we're still a little too hard. Needs to be a little more 'rubbery'Good fit in ears and effective blocking sound and found I had to keep taking phones out to have conversations when not listening to music.For the amount of money paid for the headphones inexpect the sound quality to be at least good, if not excellent. However, when listening to music the sound was poor, the headphones were unable to take any level of bass and maxed out. One headphone also only worked intermittently.Main issue was the headphones were constantly stopping playback (unable to listen to anything for more than a minute or two) and/or activating damn voice controls on my iPhone.The flat design of the cables also means it constantly catches on clothing and pulls the headphones out.overall a big disappointment... I'd recommend Bose headphones instead.
