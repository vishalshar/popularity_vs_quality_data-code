Beautiful, sleek headset.  Easy to set up on gaming console.  Unfortunately, the piece on the headset where the charger connects to broke... in less than 4 months.  Contacted LucidSound and am waiting for a response.  Will update review and rating pending outcome.Update 11/27: I ordered a new headset since LS customer service was not available during the holiday week. Received headset today and it was used.  Top of the box was torn, bottom of the box had been re-taped, cables/attachments were out of the bag and containment unit.  Nice. Docked another star from the rating.  A replacement order has been submitted.  Willing to give LS one more chance.,,
