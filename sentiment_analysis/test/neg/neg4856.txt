I really wanted to like this but it wasn't at all useful for me. The problem is how it defines "calm", "focussed" and especially "tense". I really wanted it to help with work stress but "tense" is shallow breathing and it mainly found me tense when other circumstances forced my breath to be shallow, e.g. packed onto a crowded bus, sitting slumped on the couch or in cramped seating at an event. When I was actually tense, e.g. difficult meeting, reading a bad report, it detected nothing. If they described it as "shallow" rather than "tense" it would have been more honest and maybe useful in a different way. As it is, it does nothing to help me with work stress because it doesn't actually detect it.I'm returning it for this and other reasons:- it doesn't distinguish sleeping from waking so I had lots of "focussed" and "calm" periods at three in the morning- it can't do calm/focussed/tense when you're moving so even if it did "tense" right, it can't detect "tense" when you are setting up for a meeting or rushing around getting ready for work- the notifications are weird - it will interrupt a calm or focussed period to tell me I've had one, breaking my concentration. You can disable them but I don't know why they're on to begin with.- when I contacted customer support about my "tense" issue I've had no response for a week. Really frustrating.The one really good thing, and the reason I give it two stars instead of one, was the breath wave visualisation which was the best thing I've ever used as a breathing technique for calming down. They got that part really right. Unfortunately it's not enough for me to bother keeping, wearing and charging yet another device.
