I absolutely love this product and therefore put it on my subscribe and save program for periodic shipments.  At the ~$25 price I paid in 2012, I thought I was getting a deal.  Now I just got my February shipment and the product shot up to $37.25 with the subscribe price being $31.66.  ---That is quite a jump and I do not recall getting any kind of notification of that increase (hence the two stars) --- I guess I better check all my subscribe items in the future to ensure this does not happen again with these "SURPRISE" price increases.
