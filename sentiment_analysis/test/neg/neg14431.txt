It's pure ( no filler) dried chicken breast and my dog loves it; she's fussy, so this is a plus. My only complaint is that we're not even a quarter of the way through the package and many pieces have crumbled to dust.  It's very dry.  I probably won't buy it again for this reason.Update 5/1/16:  Okay, when the treats were finished there was a full 1.8 ounces of "chicken dust" left in the bag!  This is almost half of the 4-ounce package. Too much waste for the money.
