I love the H107L.  Flies great.  This new model is just full of gimmicks.  Headless mode is nonsense and doesn't help pilots learn to fly.  Flips are just push button flips, another gimmick, but, sure it is cool to be able to do.  But, the worst part of this 'upgraded' model is the throttle stick.  It isn't like normal helis / quads.  It is stuck in the middle and the h107P is supposed to hold altitude when not touching the throttle.  This 'feature' does not work.  It constantly wants to go up and hit my ceiling.  I have to be holding down the whole flight, even after down trimming as much as possible.  If you are serious about this hobby and want to learn to fly, and hope to progress to other helis and perhaps even CP 3D flying, then this isn't for you!  If you are trying to learn to fly larger helis/quads that have this same type of control (I believe the newer phantoms have a throttle like this with altitude hold, but, it actually works) then it may be just ok to try to learn on.  But this altitude hold nonsense is really only good for people who are video recording on larger helis, it has no place on a heli like this, and, I would argue no place on larger quads either.  Let us fly like flying was meant to be!  Don't keep adding nonsense gimmicks that don't even work!You can see my review at Earthling1984 on YouTube.
