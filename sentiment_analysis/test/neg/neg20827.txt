I really wanted to give this product a chance but I'm highly disappointed by it. It doesn't detect changes in posture after a couple of minutes and you are forced to continuously recalibrate it to make it work as advertised. The app itself is glitchy and doesn't detect the device and you are forced to shut off the device and close the app and start over. Maybe in the future I will be able to give this product a try after they fixed the bugs in the app and improve the sensors on the device. Overall, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.A cheap alternative to this device is buying kinesiology tape. By simply standing in correct posture, and applying the tape in certain areas on the body, it can serve as a gentle reminder throughout the day to keep your posture corrected. How this works is when a person starts to go out of proper alignment (think of poor posture), there is a very gentle pull on the skin. This gentle reminder helps to keep a person aware when they out of alignment, and helps that person to strengthen their postural muscles on their own. SAVE YOURSELF THE $130.Edit:Customer service reached out to me and suggested placing the product on ur upper back instead of lower. It was too late for me as I returned the product. Maybe one of you can try and see how it works out.
