Bottom line: It's an okay mouse, but the "killer features" need work. From what I can tell, a lot of work. Enough work that you should wait before spending as much money as Mionix is asking.As a mouse, it's actually not half bad. A little lighter than it looks (and than what I'm used to, coming from a fully weighted M65), but solid build quality, tactile buttons, and a good, rounded feel in your hand. It's clearly been designed for people who are right handed, however, so keep that in mind. The RGB lighting on the logo and scroll-wheel are a nice touch as well. As far as the basics are concerned for most users, it's a well designed mouse that works on most surfaces and can have it's DPI cranked far past what any human would find comfortable using.If this mouse lacked the features that drew me in initially (and was priced around the naos 7000), I'd be happy giving it 4 - 5 stars depending on how the build quality holds up. I'm not doing that though, because this mouse isn't selling itself based on how it feels in your hand. If you want a mouse that is exactly this without the HR and GSR sensors, buy the Naos 7000. This mouse is getting stars based on it's advertised features. Overall, here's what I think:Maybe not as much of a problem for someone who is a "palm" mouse user, but the placement of the HR and GSR sensors seemed fairly awkward when trying to use the mouse normally. As someone who is very much a "claw" kind of guy, keeping my hand in the spot that was necessary to get even a half decent (and consistent) readout in the software (which IS still in beta) made it feel slightly uncomfortable. "So alright", I thought, "I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and try to play a few games of CS palming the mouse, as to get a proper readout from the sensors".Needless to say, the readout was anything but proper. As far as I can tell, your "heart rate" is updated in some interval anywhere from 5 to 15 seconds, and doesn't update nearly fast enough to give you a legitimately useful readout in game. There were times when the readout continued to show a fluctuating heart rate of around 60 - 70bpm, even though I knew that I had just raised it to well over resting in a few intense moments. Only after removing my hand and firmly palming the sensor again did it update to reflect the change. Those of you who want one of these to see some cool stats after a few games (and match up your high energy moments to a heart rate graph) will be pretty disappointed to see that the graph generated is fairly unreadable and chaotic (from all of the either false or stuck readouts being recorded onto it as well). I can't even talk about how well the software worked from a stat tracking perspective, because I was first and foremost never confident that the heart rate sensor was being consistently accurate enough.The one killer feature advertised with this mouse works, but not nearly well enough from what I can tell. I didn't go as far as to actually check my heart rate with another device against what the mouse was claiming, but it was obviously far enough off at times that you could tell something was amiss.Honestly, I don't know whether or not this has to do with reading someone's heart rate from their palm, under-preforming hardware, or beta software (or maybe a combination of all three), but for the time being, I can't recommend this mouse to anyone just based on the features alone. I don't want to outright say that they're only "a gimmick", because there is legitimate use in having features like this for some individuals. With the current execution however, that use seems very limited.
