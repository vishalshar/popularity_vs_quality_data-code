This product is more mascara like rather than tint... It promoted natural look without flaking or smearing but it smears and wears off leaving ur lashes no different. Product states conditions, darkens and lengths but other less expensive tints I have used in the past worked better. Their tint dried quickly and actually darkened the lashes with no rubbing off or smears and looked natural .. I suggest save your money!!!
