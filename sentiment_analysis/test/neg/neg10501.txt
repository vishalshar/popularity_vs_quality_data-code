I was so happy when I bought these Hickies and put them in my shoes.  I could slip my gym sneakers on and off with ease!  No need to lace and unlace.  Ten days later, after wearing them for only an hour a day while I exercised on the treadmill, they broke.  The top two Hickies simply split, and then when I was walking home two more split.  I had to hobble back home with shoes that would barely stay on, wishing I had laces to replace them with.  Because the initial package included four extras, I inserted them, hoping that all would be well.  Nope.  The very next day the Hickies fell apart again.  Please understand that I wasn't putting any extraordinary stress on them; I was merely jogging on a treadmill at 4.2 miles an hour.  I love the IDEA of this product, but I'm feeling foolish for having spent $60 to buy three pairs of worthless replacements for my trustworthy laces.
