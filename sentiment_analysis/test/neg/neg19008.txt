The instructions were simple. But it didn't work for me. After several days, I contacted customer support. After 3.5 hours of customer support I learned the following: the cell phone (iphone) has to have cellular turned to OFF during installation. I had to turn off all 5's on my wifi. Can only have 2.4 available during install. That brought others in the home down. After 3 hours got it to work when it was next to router. Poor quality even when on high. There is a 9 second delay when the camera was 10 feet away and a 5 second delay when it was at the router. We looked at the software version and I was told it was outdated even though I had just installed it from apps store. How do you update it? Well, they are in another country and the people who can update it are asleep and will be back when it is 10pm my time. I was also told I should have google DNS server for it to work best. I have comcast. Though the support person stayed on the chat with me for 3.5 hours, it was not resolved and I await a phone call late tonight.UPDATE: The engineers did NOT send me an email or call when they were supposed to. I started a new chat online but the chat was no longer working. I then called tech support and was put on hold then told to call back later.  The camera is working but continuously goes out and I have to reset and get a new oc code each time and start the install over. And there is now a 10 seconds delay when placed near modem. The noise is a horrible screeching sound even when moved far away. When I finally got someone in tech support, I was told I needed an engineer and they were not available. They put in a new request for someone to help me. then I was told to call back another time.  When I finally got tech support they looked up my ticket number and said it was empty and no request had been made. I repeated what had happened. i was told they needed to have an engineer call me and they were not available. I sent them a copy of the chat that said this would be resolved as a priority and a list of the entire chat (which I had the forethought to create in word). This has been a terrible experience.
