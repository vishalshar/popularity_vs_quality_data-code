I'm really upset about this scooter. It's pretty, but hard to use. My 10 year old granddaughter is a fit cheerleader & she can't pump the back. She also can't fold it up. My 6' 3" linebacker built son tried it out to see what she was talking about. He agrees it's hard to pump & he had trouble folding it! She can use it as a regular scooter, but if we'd wanted that, we'd have bought a much less expensive regular scooter!! I'm thinking it's defective, but nobody (the seller, manufacturer, or Amazon) seems to care. Bought my grandson one for his December b-day. Haven't opened it yet. I seem stuck with the other one anyway (no RMA). I will check it out before giving it to him as I don't want him hurt. Probably $260 down the drain for the 2!
