So I really should have read the reviews for this flavor before purchasing... like many other reviewers I experienced a strange metallic aftertaste and a numbing/tingling sensation of the tongue when I tried these peas. The flavor itself is good while you eat them, so I tried to eat another handful to mask the sensation which only made it worse. Do yourself a favor and buy ANY other flavor of green peas if you want to enjoy snacktime.
