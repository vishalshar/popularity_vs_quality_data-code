After a very short time of using these glasses occasionally, I noticed the lenses were badly scratched.  I have the case attached to the back of my phone and just taking the glasses in and out of the case must have caused these scratches.  I am very particular about caring for my stuff, so was shocked to notice the scratches for no apparent reason!  I hope the seller will honor their advertising of a  life time guarantee, and either replace these with better quality glasses or refund me completely.
