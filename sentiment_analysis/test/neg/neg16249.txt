The tools provided were awesome, along with the booklet of directions and pre-installed screen protector, the screen however was not.  After reading the reviews I took a chance on the iCracked Replacement screen for an iPhone 6.  The directions were clear and it was a long but fairly straight forward process.  After installing I powered up the phone and a few seconds later several vertical lines appeared on the screen and only the top half of the digitizer worked.  I created a warranty ticket online and received a response the next day.  The tech asked me to verify the cables, use alcohol and a q-tip to clean the connectors, etc.  Sensing stalling I instead ordered another screen from another Amazon seller which worked flawlessly and am returning the iCracked screen.  Several other reviews mentioned receiving bad screens and I wouldn't take another chance on this produce no matter how good the directions and tools are.  Consider once you have the phone apart, put back together, only to find out the screen is defective.  It's best to find a company with a better reputation.
