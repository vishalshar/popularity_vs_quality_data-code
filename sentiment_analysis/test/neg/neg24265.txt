After about 5 flights of using this thing it was hard to get the hang of and works pretty bad in the wind my power up just stopped working completely... It won't turn on at all and is now a worthless price of junk sitting in my house. I emailed the company asking what is wrong and they just gave a bunch of links on ways they thought they could fix it but it was literally just a video on "getting started" and I told them it wouldn't work and sent a video demonstrating how it will not turn on, and they haven't replied since, ( it's been about 2 weeks) so I highly recommend you don't buy this piece of crap and get you hands on another rc airplane.
