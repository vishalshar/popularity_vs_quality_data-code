I had such high hopes for this product, it was exactly what I was looking for. It has been two months now , both cans are sitting on a sunny windowsill and nothing, just no sign of anything at all! I even used both methods suggested, I soaked the seeds in one can before planting. I would appreciate some replacement product but it seems like there is no way to contact the company!!!!!!
