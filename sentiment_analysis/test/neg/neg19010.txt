When they work they're OK little cameras.  The key is when they work.  I decided to purchase these in the hopes they'd be easier to manage for my family to use.  The app is simple but it probably has a less than a 50% success rate of actually connecting.  I followed the instructions and tried to connect the cameras while being absurdly close to my router.  I created my Ivideon account and at first I was able to get both cameras to connect.  After just a couple days 1 camera would disconnect for minutes at a time at least 10 times a day.  After the 3rd day one camera wouldn't connect at all.  I ended up replacing the dead one with a more DIY Foscam (Foscam FI8910W Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with Two-Way Audio and Night Vision (White)) and it is much more stable (plus pan, tilt, zoom).  The Foscam is a little trickier to setup obviously but the internet is full of helpful sites.  I even downloaded the Ivideon server for a true apples to apples comparison with the Oco so they're both connected to the same app.  The Oco continues to drop several times a day and the Foscam has been rock solid since day 1.  The Foscam or any regular IP camera can also be easily setup to simply use your home network instead of the internet so you can get much higher resolution if you're home or close by.  If you're willing to do the setup yourself, you'll get a much better camera (and save money).
