Absolutely does not work.  Applied to my daughters iPhone so she could make her musicallys without having to do constant selfie film.  There is not a single one place we could get it to stick to.  On top of that, it is tacky when they advertise it is not.  It will pickup any lint etc from your pocket or purse.  The makers of the NanoHold need to bend over and place this back where it came from.
