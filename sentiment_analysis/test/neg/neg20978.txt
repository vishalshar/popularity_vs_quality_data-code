I purchased the pink because the pictures looked closer to a maroon almost purple color....The cord is a bright neon pink.My cord does not slow down when my phone has reached 100...Judging by the other problems people are having, it's a hit or a miss wether or not this cable will prove a good find.I say spend your money elsewhere.
