Nice concept but it just doesn't fly.  the pairing method is interesting, if not innovative.  but we were trying to control it from remote and it never worked properly.  Maybe we got a bad one?  But I have to say its a pretty good power bar if it wasn't for the extra price.  I like the snaking effect - makes it quite efficient
