I was really excited to receive this product, especially after an Apple tech suggested it, but my actual experience was horrible. Although it was the correct model for my laptop, the minidrive I received did not fit my card reader slot at all. Not only did it get stuck to the point I was frightened to remove it for fear of damaging my computer, but there was also a 1/4" gap on the right side which made it look cheap rather than an actual part of my MacBook. The icing on the cake was that the Micro SD card I ordered to accompany it then got stuck in the minidrive!  I was afraid of damaging both items but, thankfully, got them apart so they could be returned. IMHO, $40 ($100+ if you count the Micro SD) is way too much to spend on something that did not deliver on its promises.  It's a great concept but, sadly, it did not work for me.
