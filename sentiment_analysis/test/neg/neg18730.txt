I saw this as a lightning deal and pounced. I mean, how cool is this?  To be able to see things thermally in real time, predator-style?  Yes please!  The unit itself is compact and sturdy, but as noted previously, it will not fit with a protective case on the phone. I had to pry my case off every time I used it.  It also comes with a nice transparent plastic case.The images wee amazing.  A bit grainy but very usable. The detectable differentiation in temperature was impressive. My dog walked across the floor and I could see his footprints slowing fading away. Crazy!  I have included a photo that I took after he got up from laying on the floor.  You can see where his body and legs were!Alas!  All was not well. My camera had a tear-shaped cold spot that would not go away (the purple spot in the lower left).  I appeared in every photo and was always the coldest spot. I sent images to Seek and they told me that I had a bad sensor, so I returned it to Amazon. I was frustrated when my replacement unit had a similar flaw but less severe. I initiated a second return and dropped my camera off at UPS hoping that the third time would be the charm. However, apparently Amazon won't let you return an item more than once. I received an email that I would receive a refund, and that furthermore, I would not be permitted to buy another like item "until the problem has been resolved". Yikes!  I understand, but I wish they had told me that before I had shipped the second one back. I might have kept it.
