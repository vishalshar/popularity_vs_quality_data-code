Product arrived with someone else's information on it. Was sold as new but when I received the camera and went to set it up there was a previous owners info registered to it. Amazon did not reply back but Narrative did and said that these cameras can only be registered with one user. Now I have a useless device that I will be returning. After viewing Narrative's Facebook Page, it looks like I am not the only one this has happened to.
