Looks nice and matches the macbook but does not work well.  Device gets super hot and disconnects and connects repeatedly.  Does not  lock in to the port and can come out easily. Was doing a software update in my car and it got super hot and disconnected the device mid-update. Almost destroyed my Range Rover Sport Transmission Module. So if you need something reliable probably get something else or the Apple one. it became unusable once it passed my return window.
