I think they released this device a little prematurely.  It took 3 hours to set this up as I had to call tech support and it took them 2 hours to figure out the problem.  My wifi signal is over 100 Mbps and today I cannot even connect to the camera.  Battery life is about a day on a full charge.  I probably will be returning this product unless they send an upgrade in software soon.
