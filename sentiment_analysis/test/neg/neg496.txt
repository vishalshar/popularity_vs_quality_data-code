I like the slim profile of this unit and it sticks to the windshield very well.  As mentioned in other reviews, getting the phone out will result in movement of the articulating cradle, so you have to reposition it the next time you put the phone in the cradle.  Not the end of the world.  But the really irritating problem is the two jaws on the cradle retract using some form of plastic ratcheting mechanism that is subject to wear.  So, now the jaws will not stay open for me to mount the phone.  I have to hold the two jaws open (the spring is pretty firm) insert the phone and release the jaws.  And there isn't much room to hold the jaws open while inserting the phone (they counted on that ratcheting mechanism to hold the jaws open for you).  So mounting the phone inside the cradle is at least a 2-3 hand operation, hence my frustration.  I got 5 months of service out of this before it broke, installing and removing the phone 2x's a day, 5-6 days a week.  That's roughly 300 cycles and it's broken.  I know we live in a disposable society, but I did expect something better from this product.  I've written to the manufacturer to see about getting/purchasing a replacement cradle, however if they haven't redesigned the ratcheting mechanism, there is little point.  I'll update if and when I get a response.Update 8/2/13:  I got a response from the manufacturer within hours of sending the email.  All further communication has been same day, so I'll give them 5+ stars for customer service and communication!  They asked me to tighten the screw on the back and see if that made a difference.  It didn't, so they are sending me another cradle (or the whole unit, who knows) which should arrive tomorrow.  Unfortunately there has been no design change, which doesn't inspire confidence that my experience with the replacement will be much different.  So I took my existing cradle apart to see what the problem was.  There was no visible wear inside the cradle that would cause the issue I'm having.  Only two things could cause it, a loose screw (which I've already confirmed was not the issue) or a weak compression spring behind the center pin in the cradle (the one that pushes in when you mount the phone causing the jaws to release clamp onto the sides of the phone).  It's not terribly easy to shim that spring so it puts a little more force on the plastic parts that would allow the jaws to lock open, so it really needs a stronger spring.  Maybe this unit is a fluke, maybe they are all like this?  I've also sourced a replacement spring to see if that will correct the issue.  When it arrives I'll test it and if it works I'll post the details.  The good news is each spring is less than $1, the bad news is the springs are only sold in packs of 6 and with shipping I think it would cost nearly $10.  It's not available on Amazon's small parts store (aka Industrial and Scientific).  Let's see what happens.Update 8/5/13:  The replacement unit arrived from the manufacturer, thank you for that.  The replacement spring I ordered arrived as well.  Works like a charm!  I've passed that info on to the manufacturer.  The spring is a compression spring, 0.50" length (uncompressed), 0.15" length (compressed), 0.24" outer diameter, 0.022" wire diameter.  They are available at mcmaster carr's website (do a google search since amazon will strip out any links I put in).  The part number on their website is 1986K63.  With shipping the package of 6 springs was $10 or so.  You'll also need a PH0 phillips screwdriver to remove the screw from the back of the cradle, and a knife or flat head screwdriver to pry the clamshell cradle apart to get to the insides.  There are only 3 springs in there...two long ones that force the jaws closed, and one short one behind that center button in the cradle.  You're replacing the short one behind that button.
