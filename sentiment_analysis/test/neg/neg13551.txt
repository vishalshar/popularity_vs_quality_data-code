"The Water Quality Association has tested and certified the Soma filter to NSF/ANSI Standard 42 requirements for the reduction of chlorine, taste and odor. Their gold seal standard is known as a key benchmark for any reputable filter and a sign of innovation". I cannot find any information regarding the filtration of lead and metals by this filtration process. This filtration system should have passed the next set of requirements set by The Water Quality Association,  NSF/ANSI Standard 53 .  But it appears that this system, Soma, did not pass  NSF/ANSI Standard 53 . The information above is from the Soma website that this filtration removes chlorine only for better taste.  I just bought this and am returning it. The carafe is beautiful.  But just better tasting water, removal of chlorine, is not enough.
