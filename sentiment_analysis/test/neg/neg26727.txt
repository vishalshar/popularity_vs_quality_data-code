Being an inspector with a need for an Ir camera. I was looking for a smaller version than my bulky flir b-cam. Seek is not for any professional. Images are so blurred. Not of any true value ffor any real practical use. Being a Firefighter and Inspector , having used an assortment of Ir-camera's over the years.I had low expectations of this system from the start. But was optimistic. 2 minutes of use and I printed out a return label.It's a kids toy imo.
