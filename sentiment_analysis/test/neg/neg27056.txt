I think the Gramofon is just okay. At $50 (with the current discount) it's the cheapest way to add Spotify Connect to a hifi system...which I really like. The sound quality is decent though not amazing. Apparently it uses the DAC used in Apple AirPort Express. That said, I would not recommend this product to any of my friends.Here are my gripes:1. It's a trojan horse for Fon wifi sharing network. It makes a wifi access point that other Fon network subscribers can connect to and use your bandwidth. That's not mentioned anywhere in the product description! I wanted Spotify Connect not a Fon Network Access Point.2. Analog out only. It doesn't have digital out. I have a nice DAC already that I would like to use. A a toslink out would be really nice!3. Setup was really confusing. Especially the network part. You have to connect to wifi point or extend it...even if you use the the ethernet. Either way, you have a another wifi point in your house that has to be managed. I had to factory reset it twice before I could get it set up properly.4. I found that it would stop playing after 20 minutes. I thought it was because the app or the device was going to sleep so I used Autostart and StaY! to keep Spotify/the device from sleeping. That didn't work. Now I just wait for people to yell, " The music stopped again".5. Some people like it, but I think that ring light on the top is corny as hell.  It's bright and blue.  When the lights are down and I'm watching a movie, a corner of the room is lit up with that darn blue light. No bueno.6. No off button. That button the top enables or disables spotify, but I can't turn off the device. I really like turning off my devices.If you use Spotify, Spotify Connect is awesome. You should get something to use Spotify Connect,  but unless you have a really tight budget, avoid the Gramofon.  They need to work out the kinks in the management software and allow you to disable the Fon Network crap.
