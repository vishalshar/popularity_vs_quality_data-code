I have two black Labs, 90 & 110 lbs. One pulls much more than the other. The issue is the length adjustment in the "Y".  In theory, you can give the dogs more or less room apart by making the "Y" longer or shorter. In practice, the tension clips give way, and the dog that pulls ends up forcing the junction of the three cords at its maximum length, with the meeting point all the way to the end of the lead connection. For me, this puts the dogs too far apart, and I'm constantly getting one wrapped around a light post or tree.
