The product arrived promptly but did not work as advertised.  I purchased two, one for me and the other as a gift. I tried out mine and found the plungers did not stick very well to the porcelain, I don't know if it was moisture that caused them to keep coming off but when I tried them on a regular dry surface they seemed to work fine. I also found that depending on the location of the toilet it was harder to set up for the motion detector to work properly. My other issue was that the motion sensor did not work very well. On inspection of both items purchased the motion sensor plastic on the one I tested seems to be pushed in which might be causing the problem. I gave two stars because I did not test the second item purchased.  Returned both for refund. Great idea and with some product adjustments would consider purchasing again.
