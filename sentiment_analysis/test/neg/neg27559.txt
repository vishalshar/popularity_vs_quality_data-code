I almost want to split this into two separate reviews. As a night light, the device is great. That part of the device is simple, elegant, and just works. Very Apple-esque in design and execution. However, core functionality (the ability to alert me to smoke alarms) unfortunately did not work very well. The problem, I believe, is in how my fire alarms work. The alarms in my house are interconnected. So if one goes off, they all go off. Since the Leeo listens for as specific alarm pattern, it has difficulty detecting that pattern when all the alarms are going off at the same time, but not in perfect sync. Multiple attempts to test the Leeo resulted in me getting no alerts at all.So, if your alarm system doesn't work this way, or if you have a larger house where the alarms can't sound over top of one another, I think the Leeo will work great for you. For my configuration, it just didn't, so I returned them and tried the Roost smart battery instead and those worked no problem.
