Well thought out ideas, but implementation needs a lot of work:I really wanted to love this device, but I eventually realized that wasn't going to happen and had to return it.I'm an avid fitness enthusiast, I run indoors and out, cycle in and outdoors, lift weights and do aerobics when I can.  This device by description sounded perfect to track my wide range of activities.  But all of that would mean that it has to "work" as described.If this worked as described I'd pay twice as much for it in a heartbeat. Talking about heartbeat, the heart rate sensor is unreliable at best and that's when it actually shows up on my phone screen, compared to my Polar 7, it was all over the place and takes way to long to register changes, horrible for interval training.The stride rate sensor that measures distance when running on the treadmill was even less reliable, I understand that calculating speed and distance using stride rate is not an exact science, even if everyone had the same stride length other varying dynamics such as cadence and ground contact time can throw this off so ballpark figures with a reasonable margin of error is expected.  Let's just say the results I saw weren't even in the same ballpark, and that's after calibrating followed by a run of the same constant speed.I've seen reviews claiming that the iPhone experience is better, I don't use iphones so I can't comment there but if you user an android device, wait a while for this device and correlating app to get better. Just maintaining a connecting with my Note 4 was a challenge, while I use other devices with no issue.I will definitely keep an eye on this product, because it has a lot of potential, Wahoo simply needs to improve on the reliability and function, they have all the right ideas and with some fine tuning this could be the killer must have wearable for every fitness junkie.
