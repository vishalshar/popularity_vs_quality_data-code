Cap is hinged and falls off constantly, I mean completely off, with little or no force.  Difficult to remove from jar, and tends to fall closed while pouring.  Overall poor design.I am still glad I have it, to pour milk easier.  However it needs major improvement.**edit after few months use - I downgraded to one star.  I can no longer say I'm glad to have it and will be replacing it.  The higed cap falls of constantly, now even more than before.  Getting the thing off is often an epic quest, I usually hear a symphony playing some Hans Zimmer every time I try.  I am carefuly not ot put it on too tight, but it never wants to come off.
