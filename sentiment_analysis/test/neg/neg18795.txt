While it worked just fine it is essentially useless in a Home.  The balls are ridiculously small and my dog is 8lbs! They got lost under every single piece of furniture which negated the point of why I purchased it..  Keep the pup entertained while I work.  Sending it back tomorrow.  I wish I could give it half a star.
