I'm sitting here at 8:23 PM on a Sunday, with my sprinklers cycling on. I have setup my Blossom to water on Fridays and Tuesdays, not Sunday....Why is it on? Who knows? The app gives you absolutely no information about how long it will water, if it's currently watering, or how long it watered for. Absolutely zero feedback or live control ability. You want to turn off the sprinkers because you want to take a shower or they are just going haywire? Well, unplug the box, partner. This is inexcusable and cannot simply be dismissed as "we're working on it". Such functionality is fundamental to the operation of something as important as an irrigation system.Before deciding to waste my water today, it actually turned on per schedule on Friday, but the "Smart Watering" decided it needed to run the sprinklers for more than six hours straight... in drought-stricken California, on a day when temperatures were in the 60s and 70s! Sounds more like "Brain-Dead Watering" to me! I shudder to think about how long it will want to run in the summer on 90-degree days!There is a "dry/wet" slider to allegedly tweak this behavior but it can only cut the "cloud-chosen" watering time by 50%, not even close to enough judging from Friday's timings. (And per the above, forget about getting any insight into how long the "cloud-chosen" watering time will be, the app cannot tell you.) If I go full manual watering, I lose the ability to account for rain, since there is no rain sensor connection, and I lose the ability to account for season, since there is no global budget meter. Both of these features are present in even the cheapest ordinary irrigation controller.The hardware is very nice, granted. No problems installing or connecting wires. But the software is completely unusable. They clearly released this a year before it was ready. Even apart from the functionality issues, the Android app is full of major graphical glitches on a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (a very popular phone), ones that greatly impact its usability.The unit is getting returned and I'm going with a Rachio.
