U know it has so much potential for all ages and species. I was disappointed cuz it does not respond well to commands. Now maybe that is because the commands are like turning a page while reading an electronic book. Can't really turn pages any faster than your finger can slide across the screen. Hence, the ball does not move or respond fast at all. it just sits there like a choking, emotional ball while the dog easily steps on it and eats the nubby off. I wish they had an optional joy stick or something like that so I can make this fancy ball move like the shero she was meant to be! To hell with the iphone part. I want her rolling and turning on command like a Russian Mig.
