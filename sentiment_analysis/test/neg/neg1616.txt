While trying to train my dog on how to use the ifetch, she managed to jump in front right before the ball launched and it hit her in the eye. I took her to the vet and thank god her vision was fine. She had ulcers in her eye which eventually healed after medication. The vet told me she has seen many dogs get injured from this machine and that i was lucky my dog didnt have a permanent eye injury. Be careful or dont buy!!!
