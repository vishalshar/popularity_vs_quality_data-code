In the few weeks since I've had these, at least one has needed to be "retied" on a daily basis, and 2 have needed to be replaced entirely due to breaking.  Love the idea, and when they work, it's pretty nice.  I've got them set on the loosest setting, so it's not due to too much stress on the rubber.  May give them a try again in the future, but for now, it's back to laces for me.
