This product is a heap of junk.  It has severe latency issues which means that you do not receive a notification of a visitor at your door in time enough to respond.  Even though I have excellent WiFi in my house, a short line-of-sight to the Doorbell Cam from my Wi Fi router and a good wired internet connection from my Internet Service Provider to my Wi Fi router (approximately 50Mbps down and 8Mbps up) the Doorbell Cam continually goes off-line.  I have even tried setting an additional Apple Airport Express right up next to the Doorbell Cam to get the maximum Wi Fi signal strength.  The problems persist.  I have made a number of service requests to August with their most recent suggestion being their offer to replace my unit.  I may have a faulty unit.  I will update this review if a replacement solves my problems.Another thing that also troubles me is the stuff that August has on their company servers that relates to my Doorbell Cam.  I am sure that they have this covered somewhere in their fine print, but if you want to protect your privacy, this product probably is not for you.  August's recently promoted video recording service also will be a subscription service (oh yes, yet another internet subscription, to rip you off - how many off these subs can any reasonable consumer bare?  Some of us have to pay for rent and gas and feed ourselves !)Update.After a few interactions I realised the August support crew are doing their best but this product just does not Cut the Mustard. As a minimum it needs a direct wired connect option so the delay can be minimised.  Anyway I finally gave up on this product and returned it.  Don't waste your time!
