Screen was sub par and why would you buy a 7 in phone if not to have a great image? colors dull and inaccurate, in my case screen image was stretched out in so looks fat in vertical and skinny in horizontal. maybe it was a dud but there was no way to fix or adjust it... too bad ! disappointing cause i liked posh titan HD 6 in phone! Im sure the phone works fine but i bought it to enjoy the large screen... so had to return it.
