Item received had broken seal on box.(previously returned?)  Did light up when plugged in. Could set temp with wheel and sensor seemed to reflect accurate water temp. Water level was 1 1/2 inches above the min needed. Clamped on nicely. It just would not turn on.  When "Start" was touched, a loud alarm tone went off until it was touched again to turn it off.  Tried to start using BT but my android phone wouldn't accept Anova's app nor would my Windows tablet.  Left a message for Anova CS. Hoping to hear from them soon.
