I love Misfit, and was super excited for my new Shine. I left my old one at a relatives house which they've since moved out of, so I needed a new one. I was excited by the text and call alerts that the shine 2 offered, unfortunately, despite what I'd read online it wouldn't actually sync with my Windows phone. I used it with my iPad instead and it was okay. Unfortunately I frequently bike, play tennis, and walk all within the same day. But unless I'm home or somewhere else with wifi and my I-pad it's difficult to update how I'm wearing it, and what I'm doing. When I get home I have trouble remembering what activity I was doing at which time, so I feel the app records data incorrectly. For instance, I'll be gone three hours playing tennis, but since I biked there it will say I was biking three hours wearing the shine on my shoe. In reality, I'll have biked maybe an hour, walked for a bit, moved the shine to my arm, and then played tennis before returning home. If I remember approximate times I can change my activities later, but I don't know how accurate the information will be since it thinks the shine was on my foot the whole time.I spent a lot of time debating whether to purchase another original Shine, or a Shine 2. I decided on the Shine 2 because of all the new features. That turned out to be a waste since as previously mentioned, it wouldn't work with my phone. I also feel like the colored lights and all the different alarms and colors were confusing. I was hoping for something a little more accessible. I also miss the action clip the old shine provided. I'm really not sure how I'm supposed to fasten this one to my shoe when I bike. I generally just wear the fitness band around my ankle, but I'm scared to bike too far with it on my ankle because of the items ability to hide. 95% of the reviews on here are people complaining about their shine falling out and getting lost. If you buy a mesh or leather one you won't have that problem, but the fitness band is the only one that fits my ankle.Lastly, I am returning this item because after a day and a half of use my Shine stopped syncing with my iPad. I have tried replacing the battery, removing the shine from the wristband, restarting my iPad, deleting and reinstalling the misfit app, resetting my Bluetooth connection, "waiting" for it to sync, hitting 'sync' over and over again, and restarting and reattempting to sync to my phone, all without any change. It had been four days, and nothing is happening. Super frustrating to me since I've had some really good days since buying this watch. This watch isn't super expensive if you time it right, but I really can't rationalize the $70 I spent on it, especially since it only lasted me a day and a half.Overall, as much as I would like to, I can't recommend this product. It's pretty, but given the choice I'd take the Shine original every time. More color options, smaller, never any trouble syncing.Side note, it's fun to compare steps with others, and you really can't without pulling out your phone and syncing. Also, with my original Shine customer service was pretty poor. I emailed asking a simple question about the app, and it took two weeks to get a generic response that didn't answer my question. I replied to the email, rephrasing my question and got no response at all.
