Worked for 4 days. Now it won't turn on when you press the button. After fighting with it for 2 hours, I managed to get it on, but it wouldn't display the right time or date. Sent a message to their customer service 24 hours ago, with no response. Liked it a lot when it worked, very handy and comfortable. But unfortunately, I will be returning mine.
