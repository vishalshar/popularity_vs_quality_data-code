Judging from the high ratings I must have gotten a bad unit.  The controller is nice and installation was easy but the software is really bad. With the smart watering feature on, the sprinklers ran so long I had to manually shut the main valve off until the program finished to keep from having a $400 water bill. With smart watering shut off and specific times set for all zones, some of the zones run when any other zone is scheduled for that day even though they are not scheduled for that day. I don't know if the problem is in the cloud software or in the hardware.  I've got a help request in with Blossom support so I will update when I know something more.  I can live with some of the missing features for a while, but if the basic control isn't fixed the controller is going back to Amazon.
