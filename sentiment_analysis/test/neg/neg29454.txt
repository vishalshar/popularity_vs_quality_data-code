Found out about these from a positive review online and was a little overzealous in purchasing enough for the majority of my shoes. I regret it. These are too tight for my feet (I have a pretty standard shaped foot, I think, and a men's size 10 shoe size). They seem to cut into the top of my foot and essentially make the shoes too tight. I have experimented with different combinations of skipping islets and only threading these through every other hole, or in some occasions only one or two holes at all, but I just can't find a satisfactory combination. Going back to traditional laces, unfortunately. I really wanted to like this product.
