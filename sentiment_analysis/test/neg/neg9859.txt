I purchased these seasonings because I was looking for a healthier alternative to butter and salt on my popcorn. And while these seasonings are just that, its definitely not nearly as flavorful. I found all but two of these to be completely lacking in flavor. First of all, A lot of the seasonings dont seem to want to stick to the popcorn. The bottom of my bowl would be completely full of the powder, yet my popcorn never really tasted full of flavor. I tried adding it right after the popcorn shot out of the air popper, but it didnt seem to make a difference. The cheese flavors do appear to stick a little better to the popcorn than the others. Unfortunately, I found them all (cheese flavors) to be pretty much repulsive. I love cheese popcorn. I dont love these cheese options. The butter flavor tasted absolutely NOTHING like butter. I dont know what it was, but it wasnt butter flavored. The ranch, while ranch-like, just lacks in bold creamy flavor. I did like the kettle corn flavoring, and the caramel was not bad either. Again, the problem was, those two flavors really wont stick to the popcorn. I was literally resorting to licking the popcorn to wet it, then scraping the pieces against the bottom of the bowl to get any flavor on the kernels. I am pretty disappointed with these options. Healthy, yes. Fulfilling, no.
