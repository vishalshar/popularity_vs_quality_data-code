I ordered this charger for my original Lytro camera, and when it arrived it was the wrong charger. It was a cheap generic USB charger. When I asked for a refund, I was told just to toss the charger and they would ship me out the correct one. Well, the new charger finally came and the plug looks like a 220-volt dryer plug, the kind with the angled plug-in, and I'm in an apartment that doesn't even have one of those. The photo shows a standard wall plug. That's what I ordered. That's what I didn't get. Twice. I am not pleased. Not pleased at all.
