This works very well on the bottom and sides of my feet. My heels seem like they are always rough during the summer, but this helps keep them smoother. I have not had any calluses develop since I can keep them smoothed off.I have found that I cannot hurt my feet by rubbing off too much skin because if I push too hard on it, it stops spinning. The way it works best for me is by starting it up, rubbing a bar of soap on it while it spins and then lightly buffing my feet. I've also used body wash and that works very well.Update Sept 23, 2016  The feet on the bottom of the device fell off. I glued them back on but they are no longer holding the device still in the shower. This makes it impossible to use unless I hold it in my hands~which I have been doing. If you want to use it while standing....forget it!
