Consistent issues with calibration regardless of the location.  Spent hours driving then walking to areas to calibrate.  Unsuccessful.  When it finally did connect once, it only worked for a short time before the interference message stopped it again.  Interesting for the few minutes use I could get out of it.  However, it does have the stability in landing issue noted by others.  Too much time wasted on this one.  Not recommended.  Returning it.
