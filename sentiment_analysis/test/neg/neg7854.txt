I have purchased these in the past and been very happy with them.  This time was different.  I bought these in August, by September one of them broke.  Two more broke in September, one more in November, and in December two more snapped in half.  That's a total of 6 lost in less than five months!  I can no longer use the few that haven't broken because I don't have enough for each shoe.  This is a good product, but for $15, I would expect them to last longer than five months.  Sorry to say, I cannot recommend purchasing Hickies.
