The dongel works well driving around town. Set up was easy and the app UI is simple to navigate. Driving on the highway returns invalid data. Per Automatic Customer service, these are shipped with known bugs.I concur with the other  review were is saying this isn't reliable.  Also the dongle interferes with Bluetooth connectivity with my phone -  streaming audio constantly cuts out and pauses  when using the dongle.  Removed the dongle and audio issues ceased.The app requires location services to be on always so it is constantly using data. 100% disappointed in this app and dongle.  It's sitting in a box in my closet right now; will never use it again.
