I was so excited about this dog food because I breed dogs and I was looking for the best dog food I could feed to all my dogs, puppies and parents. I also loved that it came in a 40lb bag BUT my dogs REFUSED to eat it. I thought it might just be my dogs because they were not used to it. But then my sister dog also refused to eat it. The dogs ate the first bag I bought them but it gave them all diarrhea which I thought was just because I had switched their food and that would pass but now they just REFUSE TO EAT IT AT ALL. So.... there is for sure something going on with either the bags I've received from Amazon or just the dog food brand in general. Such a Bummer. I was hoping this was gonna be my NEW FOOD. But no.. I had to scrap the idea after my dogs said NO WAY JOSE'!!!!
