Very frustrating. I took dozens of photos easily and downloaded to computer with no problem. The problem is how to email or text to friends or print? It's not easy or clear, and aparently can't be done. Any sharing must be thru the Lytro website, but they don't tell you that. Lytro website is confusing.Will update this review if I solve these issues or if software is updated to fix. Until then, I regret my decision to buy.
