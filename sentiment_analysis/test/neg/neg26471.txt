Great idea, great hardware but horrible software.  Very buggy.  Was able to get my Vizio TV synced, but unable to get Xfinity Set-Top box synced.  The app continues to crash when downloading a firmware upgrade, re-installed app on Android (MotoX) several times to no avail.On a positive note: was able to get it synced with Amazon Echo, that worked as advertised.  I'm a buyer once they get their software bugs worked out.Really unfortunate that I'll have to send it back.
