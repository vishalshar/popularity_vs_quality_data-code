Ok. People are raving about these. I wanted to see what the hype was all about. I was extremely excited to receive these and hear the lush detailed sound people are raving about. These people must be the same people that swear Beats are sound quality headphones.Listen, I will keep this short and to the point.SoundThey sound decent. But they are not amazing headphones. They emphasize bass, so that is possibly what has gotten the rave reviews. But details in the actual audio are not separated, and they are not detailed. Sounds at the Tower in Destiny are bundled together. I A/B tested these against Turtle Beach Tango headphones (possibly an unfair test being that they once retailed at $300, placing them in an entirely different pricing bracket which should affect quality). The Turtle Beach Tango has really good separation of all of the sounds going on. Everything is clear. You could distinguish each sound. That is what separates a great driver from a poor driver. With the Lucid Sound LS30, all of the sounds were bundled together. I am sorry but there is just so much room for improvement in the sound. Bass boost in headphones is nothing new and should not be confused with audible clarity or detail. Buy a pair of Sennheiser HD 298 headphones and hear the details you are missing in all of these modern day gimmick drivers with bass boosts. No one knows what quality sound sounds like anymore. What a shame.Volume DialsThe cups are cool. They rotate and I think the concept is cool. It is useful. However due to the shape of the cups, sometimes rotating the volume dials is difficult, as in it is not easy to grasp the dial.The Mic Boom and Voice MonitoringNo way to turn down the voice monitoring. This, to me, is unacceptable in a "luxury" headphone for gaming. It is set too loud. It causes a nonstop hiss in the headphones with or without the mic boom plugged in. Maybe I got a lemon? IDK. But it ruined my gaming experience.ChatNot wireless. It is wired chat. Not a fan of wires, but at this price, this is not something that can be excused. Keep in mind though that Turtle Beach has a completely wireless set of gaming drivers set at about $120 retail. Explore your options.OverallOverall I am tired of typing about a pair of decent headphones with excellent reviews. I believe that either I got a lemon or these headphones are the Beats of gaming. Cool looks, decent sound, but overall a gimmick (though with slightly lower pricing, thankfully). For my ears, they did not cut it. When it came to the quality of the audio, which is the most important part of a headphones purchase, IMHO, they simply did not perform in a $100+ headphones capacity.I would like to assume that the founders of this company had a better listening experience in mind when creating these headphones. I am open to the possibility that these were a lemon. But until that is proven, I have to recommend that the LucidSound LS30 be left to amateurs who are not serious about their gaming experience.
