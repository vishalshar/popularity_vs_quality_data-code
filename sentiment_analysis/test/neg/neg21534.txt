I really wanted to like this camera.  It is the right size and it is designed well.  I found setup using the web gui to be easy.  It had good picture quality and was compatible with VLC.  To be short, this should be a five star review.  However, the video feed on mine randomly gets stuck on white in bright environments.  Per dlink customer forums, a number of people have this issue, and there seems to be no known fix.  I troubleshooted everything reasonable and upgraded the firmware to latest version to no avail, so I am returning it.
