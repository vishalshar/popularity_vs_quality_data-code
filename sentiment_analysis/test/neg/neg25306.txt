I really wanted to keep this lunchbox if it did not have a problem. Only problem I have about this is It is not leakproof. There are noticible gaps in between the lid and the box even after closing the lid completely and that causes leaking liquid. I even pressed the lid down firmly to make sure it closes better. It does not work. I put green thermos part inside on purpose to see the gap better. I normally do not pack too watery food in the lunchbox but i still wanted it to be leakproof anyway as advertised but it leaks so badly. I bought 2 and both of them have the exact same problems. I am so sad but I have to return these cute boxes. I really want this, but I am scared to order again because it may have the same problem again. I give it 2 stars for the great idea!
