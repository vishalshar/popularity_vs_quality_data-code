I purchased this item for my Mom that has Lupus, after a ton of research, because she needed to have a way to contact us in case of emergency. She is unable to work, and on several occasions has been unable to get out of bed or needed a ride to the doctor, but was unable to reach us for one reason or another,, Enter CUFF, I must say in the beginning I was very happy as was my Mom and family.. her because it is stylish, and she loved wearing it, and the rest of the family because we would have the peace of mind knowing she could reach us when needed.I must also preface this with, I researched several other options before buying this, and settled on the CUFF due to the style and options of wearing it, between the band or necklace or leather bracelet option, they all looked perfect for her since I have bought my Mom so many different medical items in the past, only to have her never use them because she didn't like the look, or was to proud to have some medical looking device on her wrist.So yes, the Cuff seemed to be the answer.. but a few months ago, I went to check on it since I noticed it wasn't working and saw that the company had closed! Okay, I should have heeded the warnings of all the people that pre-ordered theirs and were so upset at how the company treated them, strung them along etc.. but I didn't because there were some recent happy people that did get their device, and I really wanted to believe in this company. But now all of us are out $60 plus and we're stuck with a worthless product, and no way to get any compensation. And Amazon won't refund due any of us due to the time limits for return, but it has been less than 6 months and the company and their product are worthless!!So save your hopes, and your money.. I think this was some sort of scam carried out by CUFF, because they duped hundreds if not thousands of women into buying a product that they NEVER delivered on!I think we should start a class action lawsuit against these people.
