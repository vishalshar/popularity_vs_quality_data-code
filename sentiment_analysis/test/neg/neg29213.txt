This is a great concept, but it unfortunately doesn't come through as promised.  The Une Bobine consistently cannot hold up my iPhone, and tips under its weight whenever I try to set it upright.  Even when I form a few loops on the ground (such as in the picture displayed) the phone still falls over.  The charger still works perfectly well, but you're better off buying a cord charger that's at least smaller and more portable than paying for his item which doesn't actually deliver on its main function advertised.
