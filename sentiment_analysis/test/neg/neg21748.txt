This is a complete piece of crap.  I was unable to set up my first tag as the stick (connected to modem) can't seem to find a tag which is 10 feet away.  I have zero confidence that the stick can connect with a door/window tag if your home has walls, furniture, or anything to interfere with a direct line of site connection.  Complete garbage which I will be returning.
