While the audio quality is quite good for a speaker this size the volume is simply too low to really be heard outdoors. I have tried two much cheaper speakers and while the Fugoo certainly sounds better the cheapo's are louder. When you enable "loud mode" you definitely experience some distortion at max volume. For indoor use this would be great but at the price I would expect a bit more volume.
