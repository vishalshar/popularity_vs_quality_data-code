Yes, the picture quality isn't amazing, but even in the worst conditions for it (at night, walking around outside instead of staying in one place) I ended up with at least a couple of pictures from each hour that were worth keeping.While I was using it, there were a few main annoyances:- No desktop app or web app for viewing pictures.- Awkward export process, and exported photos seem to lose proper date/GPS info.- Loose, flimsy clip.This last point is why I say "while I had it". The clip was just way too loose and un-grippy... and one day in the middle of a walk it fell off and I never found it again.Unfortunately, this point pretty much totally overrides all the good points about the camera. Until they redesign it to have a clip that actually grips properly, do not buy!
