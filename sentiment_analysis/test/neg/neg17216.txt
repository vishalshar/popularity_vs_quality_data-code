Unfortunately I have had the same experience as several other on Amazon with this band. It was a gift for my son, he was very excited to receive it, it seemed to work fine for about 2 weeks, then it no longer will take a charge. It appears to be charging and lights up when plugged in but when unplugged, nothing. I have made 2 request to the company for refund or replacement information with no response at all, unacceptable. Between lasting 2 weeks and no response from the company 1 star is 1 too many. I will be happy to update this review if the Company makes it right.
