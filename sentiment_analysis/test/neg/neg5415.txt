It appears that this drone may not be compatible with my 4th generation iPad.  I did download the starlink app from the app store at apple.  I was able to start up the motors and launch but the app says "Disconnected" when less than 500 feet out from my launch area... I lost all telemetry  and video connection on my iPad.  So I hit return home, which the drone did react to the command and landed properly, still showing loss of all telemetry... and the disconnect notice at the bottom of my iPad screen.  I am going to try again for a third time. (got disconnected at about the same point in my first two flights).  Beware that this drone may NOT work with YOUR tablet.  The problem is that if I buy a new tablet, it will have the latest OS loaded which may not be on Autel's list of compatible devices and operating systems!!
