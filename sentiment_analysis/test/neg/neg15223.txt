Useless!  .....Picture quality is decent.  Set up is easy!  Battery life?  Terrible.  The most the battery has lasted with a full charge is less than 2 days.  Every 48 hours or so, the app is telling me "battery is low".  The idea is good but this product is not!  Unfortunately, in the hustle and bustle of Christmas, I can't find the original box and papers for returning this product.  Waste of money and time!
