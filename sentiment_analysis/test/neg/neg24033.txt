Must-have for on-the-goiphone/ipad charging.30/April/2015 UpdateI'm changing from five stars to one star or if possible no star!I was charging my iPhone 6 with a lipstick sized power bank. I placed the setup on a surface about two feet high from the carpet, it dropped and amazingly the Lightning connector broke off!. I never thought the nomadkey could fail woefully in a drop. I'm so diappointed right now because this is the second nomadkey lightning cable I bought-I lost the first and second broke almost effortlessly.I will not recommend this product to anyone except you are willing to be diappointed like me.
