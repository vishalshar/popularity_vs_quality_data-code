The seasoning on these wasn't bad - the issue I had was more with the texture.  I've tried many different meat sticks - pork, turkey, beef, elk, etc. - and I've found that some taste more like 'real' meat, and others taste more like a 'processed meat product'.  These were definitely in the latter category.  The best way I can describe the texture is a Vienna sausage inside a regular sausage casing - firm on the outside but very mushy on the inside.  But taste is individual.  Your mileage may vary.
