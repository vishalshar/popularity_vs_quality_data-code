I have not had it very long, in fact I returned the first one because it plays albums to slow, the music sounds distorted, so I returned the first one thinking there was something wrong with that unit and Amazon sent me another, it did the same thing so I returned it as well.  Chinese junk, spend a little more money and get a better quality player, this is not it.......
