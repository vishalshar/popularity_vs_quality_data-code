This should be the best product. Camera and set up is great. The only massive failing is sound, there is no option to turn off the sound. I used my Oco to share our nursery camera with grand parents, so they can watch our little one. But they can hear every word that is said in our house. Surly its just  a tweek in the app. Research a little online before purchase. Is better options.
