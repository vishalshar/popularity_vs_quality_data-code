Install not so smooth but eventually linked to internet. Worked fine for a while but loses connectivity and then it is necessary to reset from scratch. I found my app was locked in a loop unable to go backwards or forwards as it continually rejected the pin code and even though the correct code was entered 6 times. I have unplugged this and will retry another day when my frustration is not making me want to smack it with a hammer. Would not recommend. I have 3 of these of which 2 may be meeting a lump hammer in the near future.Update 11/15/16 all 3 have lost connection and will not pair. I have contacted  D-Link customer support an requested tech support or refund.I will update this review after i receive a response from D-Link
