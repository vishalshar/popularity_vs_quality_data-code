I paid for overnight shipping/so excited to get started and it won't work. It won't light up. Won't connect. Nothing. I have tried contacting customer service 6 times (there's no phone number of course, so you can only email a generic inbox and keep your fingers crossed that someone reads it). I haven't heard anything back. What's the point of overnight shipping if customer service is the hold up on getting you started overnight. It's so cute and I'm hoping that I can get it working and start to love it, but so far I'm REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MISFIT CUSTOMER SERVICE or lack thereof.
