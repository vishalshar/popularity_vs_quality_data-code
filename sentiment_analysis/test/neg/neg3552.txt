Made with very brittle plastic. When I received the game, two of the corners were cracked and small chunks of plastic were in the box. As I got it  game out and was putting the net on, it cracked a few more times. I did put Gorilla tape all over it to hold it together and the game is fun to play, but the quality of the product is poor.
