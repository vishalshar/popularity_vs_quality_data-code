I have tried on and off for several weeks to make this unit work.  I was successful in only getting it to work once, which allowed all sprinkler zones set to 7 minutes max to run for 25 minutes+ before I discovered there was a problem.  (Wasted water reported by neighbors) I live in Calif. so thought this was the best controller available.  I am past my return date of late November and have no idea what to do next. Their is no Amazon CS center I can call to report that I believe this unit is faulty.  I had my son try and set it up since he also has a Blossom at his home and he also gave up.  This unit is faulty/bad!  Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I have followed the instructions exactly, so please do not refer to them as a response.
