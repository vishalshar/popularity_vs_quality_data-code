These were way too low for me.  My shoe rubbed on my foot and hurt.  If you wear very very low shoes, maybe they would be fine, but for my sperry top-siders, these were way too low.  They also looked like women's socks because they were so low.  I ended going with M&Z's no show socks instead, and bought tons of them.
