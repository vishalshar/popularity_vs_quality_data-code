This mat is called the Anti-Tracking Litter Mat. Somehow it does the complete opposite. It is the Track-it-Everywhere Litter Mat. Have a look at the photo I provided. This is just litter from 1 cat after using the litter box. My cat can't leap, she can't step over the mat, in fact she likes the mat, except it doesn't deliver on its intended use. Very disappointed with this product.
