It is certainly an attractive piece.  However, I returned it because the volume knob doesn't gradually lower.  It plays medium or high.  I contacted the manufacturer to see if it was a defect because I was going to reorder and they told me its the way its made.  The sound quality was good, but I certainly didn't want a stereo that I couldn't play on a lower volume setting.
