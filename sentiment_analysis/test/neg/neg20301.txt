I was very disappointed in the amount that grew and we harvested. It fruited within expected time (a couple weeks or so) but only produced about 5 decent sized oysters the first flush. It did not fruit more on that side so I followed the instructions to turn it over and start other side. That fruited NOTHING. Finally it developed a mold on it. I removed the bag and broke it up a bit, also exposing to more air. That did not help or do anything for it. I finally broke it up and spread it out thinking it might fruit. NOTHING. I know this is supposed to be a good company and this should be a reliable product, but I think this one was contaminated and did not fruit properly. I will consider if I will try them again or just try a different vendor.
