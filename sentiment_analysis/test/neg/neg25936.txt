I didn't have a prop strike with these, but I definitely experienced the loss of lift some other reviewers have reported. It seems like any minor wind disturbs the airflow under the props. The other issue with these is they're difficult to remove and install without feeling like you'll snap the retaining clip, which is a pain if you're using the Solo backpack or other case to transport your drone.
