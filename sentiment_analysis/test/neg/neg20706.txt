I bought this because I was sick of regular Mascara's leaving little dried up broken bits all over my cheeks.  So I thought a lash "tint" would be great.However, I can put this on, and on and on, and on....which I do....  and it never shows up.  It is completely invisible.  Seems to be a very light brown.  It is much like the "clear" mascara's that, unbelievably, some people buy.If you have long lush lashes in the first place, this might be a viable option as it will BARELY add a HINT of color, and I mean BARELY....and no, it does not leave little pieces on your cheeks.You can wipe the brush on your finger, and yes, it looks dark...however, you cannot transfer it to your lashes.  It has no "stickiness" needed to make it transfer from the brush to your lashes.  The human eye cannot even tell there is anything on the lashes.  That's the thing right there.....the "formula" is more of a "conditioner" and your lashes will be soft and smooth, therefore no dried up pieces to fall.  However, the soft and smooth conditioner also is incapable of showing up on your lashes.So it was a good premise, but fails.When I look in my 10X magnifying mirror, I can see that the lashes have some perceptible color to them.  But it does no good when it's not apparent to the unaided human eye.If you have short invisible lashes in the first place, like I do, they will remain that way with this product.It's a joke for $16.95.
