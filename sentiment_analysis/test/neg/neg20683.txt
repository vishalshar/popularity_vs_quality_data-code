Not good for me... I had to return it.... bluetooth was not working properly like the normal iOttie, I had to linked every time... I mean go thru the cell phone--> configuration--> find it and wait!!! I loose many goody shots....The battery goes to fast less than 6 hours (with the normal size was at least 12 hours).... get the normal size is a really good device =)
