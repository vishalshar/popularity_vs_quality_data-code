I am a huge fan of all IoT related technologies inside the home. I was very excited when I found this on Amazon, and purchased it based on the good reviews out there.After using it for a week, to be honest I am quite surprised at how this product received such good ratings on Amazon.Pros:- It's a lock that can be unlocked by your phone- Can grant permanent or temporary access to other users- Beautifully designed and well engineered hardware- good customer service - the customer service rep was very professional and tried to be helpfulCons:- Auto-unlock feature NEVER worked for my wife (who has an iphone). It worked once the first time i set it up. Then it never worked again. (I am a tech geek, so i know that the GPS on her phone is on and all settings are correct).- When the August app worked, it takes 10 seconds for it to authorize. When it doesnt, it will get stuck on "Authorizing" mode forever. and the only way to get out of it is to restart the app once or twice to get it working again. I had to stand in front of my door for 2 minutes looking like an idiot. This actually happened about 50% of the time for me (I have an android).- The Everlock timeout is too long (shortest option is 30 seconds). It should have a sensor to lock itself as soon as it senses the door closed. Every time I leave the house, I had to wait 30 seconds to make sure it closed itself before I felt safe about leaving.- Everlock should not activate if the door is still swung wide open. Why was this not engineering into the design in the first place? I damaged my door frame because I forgot to realize that the dead bolt was sticking out after the door had been open for more than 30s. This isn't acceptable.- Price. $250 is a heft price to pay for a door lock. On top of that, add a new door handle and a deadbolt for another $70, then another $50 for the connect once it comes out. $400 for the entire package after tax that may not even add any convenience to your life.Conclusion:Unfortunately August just did not work out for me. It has way too many flaws that does not make it ready for prime time. It's going right back to Amazon's return department.I'm hoping there will be an improved version 2.0 within a year or so that actually works. With all these new smart lock companies starting up, I wouldn't be surprised if someone else came out with a way better product before August comes out with a new version that works.
