The most recent boxes of this product may have an issue. The safety seal that you normally have to peel off after removing the black cap is missing. Is it safe to drink? The product lot/manufacturing numbers are: GRM12AMZ0052, AUG 07 17, 14:43, 6218P7FPA, 12 X 14 OZ. I don't know who to contact to ask this question?
