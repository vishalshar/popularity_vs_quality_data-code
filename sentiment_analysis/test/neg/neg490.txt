Could not get it to reliably send me an alert when I tested my smoke alarm after installing Roost.  The battery showed up on the Roost app, but when I pushed the test button on the smoke alarm the alarm sounded, but I only got an alert once in four or five tests.  Something as critical as a smoke alarm needs to be reliable, and this wasn't.  Basically the $35 Roost didn't do anything my $.50 9V battery didn't do.
