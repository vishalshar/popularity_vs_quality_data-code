The idea is great.. setup is very easy.. it's the app that's not reliable. If the garage door is in "stopped" mode there's nothing you can do unless u manually push the button to close at your home or garage. Pointless if I'm away. Also the wire they send to hook up garage door opener to device it too thick of a gauge. I don't have the screw type hookup as shown in the instructions.Great idea.. easy hookup.. not reliable. Need to improve product then maybe I'll buy again.. for now this one will be returned.
