The FILTERS might be great.  Don't know because the Mavic gimbal wont boot with the filter on.  And I am not willing to risk the delicate gimbal motors trying to put the filter on the camera after the gimbal boots and tests itself.  Really bummed because I heard great things about Polar Pro.  Not sure what other solution I will be able to find.
