as claimed by the manufacturer: "The FireAnt is Multi-Fuel backpacking stove is constructed of pure Titanium weighing in at just 2.8 ounce by it self or barely over 3 with the fuel plate and case" - this is NOT the case. my reliably accurate scale measured this item (without fuel plate, and case) to be 3.7 oz. that is 26% HEAVIER than claimed. for nearly $70, that is unacceptable. i'll probably be sending it back for a refund.
