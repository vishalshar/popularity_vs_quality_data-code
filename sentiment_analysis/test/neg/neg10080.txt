This is a good idea and makes it easy to tell if Fido's been fed. As long as you use it!  However, the quality of this item is poor.  It is not metal or stainless steel as it appears.  It is more like a silver reflective paper.  It arrived scratched and blotchy.  The buttons are a little difficult to slide.  Perhaps the button will work better after a few weeks of use. I am including a picture that shows some of the scratches and blotches.  - Mrs. Jonathan
