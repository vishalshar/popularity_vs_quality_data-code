Not overly impressed by this case.  Yes it is very thin, a lot thinner than any other case I have seen.  The downfall is how slowly this case charges your phone.  At 0.5amps it is only useful if you're desperate.  However, this seems to be the case with most other battery cases.  The other thing I did not like is that the white buttons get dirty fast!FYI this case does not fit the iPhone 7.
