Very unhappy with this product.  Some of apples in the packages are not baked enough.  I opened two packages and the problem is the same in both.  I have purchased this product at Whole Foods and never had a problem with quality. Because I really like these product I thought I would order a case but from now on I will purchase at Whole Foods.
