I bought this to take with me on a trip to Las Vegas.  My idea was to turn it on and leave it in my rental car and use my phone to locate where I parked, incase I couldn't spot my rental right away.  It didn't work, it kept searching but would not locate my, even as I was approaching my car.  I thought maybe it was because I was in a parking structure but then when I tried it in an open parking lot, it still didn't work.  I was disappointed and returned it when I got back home.
