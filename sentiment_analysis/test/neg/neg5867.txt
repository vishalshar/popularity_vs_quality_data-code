My iPhone 6s+ requires gorilla force to insert or remove; maybe a phone with a smaller screen works better.  The so-called "controller" buttons only line up so as to be usable for some limited content, whereas most available content is for Google Cardboard or compatible devices using different controls.. I was expecting better image quality; often it's a long way from needle sharp, and most content is only a few minutes long and there isn't that much of it that's professionally produced. Overall it was more trouble to use than the results were worth and I returned it to the seller who gave me a refund with no hassles.
