Im actually giving it no stars because my five year old grandson hasn't been able to use it yet! A little bit misleading info on Osmo's part :"*Requires the Osmo Game System, found in any Osmo Kit."You have to read through a lot to realize that a creative set isn't the same as a kit. The kits are too expensive for what my grandson would get out of them personally .I just went on Osmo's site and I must not be the only one who complained. Have yet to hear back but they offered a form to fill out if you didn't get the game system wi your creative set.
