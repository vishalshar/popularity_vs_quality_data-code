Here's the thing, I was hopeful to use this as a firewall for my mom's apartment but I do have her wireless and wired network set up with different subnets. If you're looking to add this to a network with any customization, do yourself a favor and skip this.That being said if you have a basic setup and want some sort of managed firewall and don't mind your ARP table being poisoned, this will work.I'd suggest you do not though as this is basically an expensive subscription for a firewall that does machine learning and blocks "threats" that way. It takes the packet headers and sends them to their cloud.You can watch some videos on youtube to set up your routers firewall, and use end point firewalls on your machines.It was cute looking though!If you're a basic user I guess its ok, but the service fee's add up. I returned this today as it doesn't fit my needs.Theres a ubiquity UNIFI security appliance. theres some work setting it up but google is your friend and for a SOHO solution it works great. It is a managed device.
