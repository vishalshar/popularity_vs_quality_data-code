So I've waiting about three months to make a well informed review on this product and it has gone from 4-5 stars to 1 star. My main complaint is the fact there that it doesn't auto-unlock as I walk up. I've tried EVERYTHING, to make sure it wasn't something on my end. I originally used an Apple TV Gen 4 as the hub to make it work, it would unlock before I got to the door about 50% of the time. I then purchased an August Connect, to put right next to the front door and it was still just as inconsistent as the Apply TV. So I returned the connect and very recently purchased as Mesh Wifi system, which boosts the wifi throughout the house (on a side note, buy one of these, makes a huge difference!). Now I'm thinking with faster wifi throughout the house, its got to work right, wrong, and now it hardly ever unlocks when I've walked up, often times I would be standing there for 2-3 minutes if I didn't just use the keys. Lastly, I opened the app for lock and expanded the "circle" where it starts tracking me coming home. Now I'm thinking "this is it!, this is why its been a crap shoot for so long". Still nothing, and it seems to be getting worse.Second gripe, outside my wifi, I can't access the lock remotely at all. When I first got it, again it was hit or miss, but now, good luck. The app will just keep saying failed to connect over and over again.In summary, don't buy this....
