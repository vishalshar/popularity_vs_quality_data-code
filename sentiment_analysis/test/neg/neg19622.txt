Useless!!! - had it one week, locked the yard and we had some rain and the Lock is now dead. My yard is now so secure no-one can get in even me or my family. The description and their website say it is waterproof but I now have a permanently locked yard. DO NOT PUT THIS LOCK ON ANYTHING IMPORTANT! - you may not be able to access it ever again. Really not much fun.
