My first unit would not take a charge.  I called the manufacturer who sent me a new unit.  The new unit did not hold enough battery life to get through two rounds.  I am returning this device.The new unit came and the cover for the charger was already almost torn off, and broke completely off the first time I used it.  The disruption to my game remembering to tap it was not acceptable to me.  The data that came out took some manual intervention to get it to show accurately.  Way too time consuming and without a mobile app plugging it back into a computer is a pain.  Most of these things are small, but added up makes it a pain to use.
