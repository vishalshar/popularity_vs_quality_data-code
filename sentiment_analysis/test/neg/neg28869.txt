ProsEasy installation:I am a technical person and I have installed many different home-automation products in the past. I would put this one as one of the easier installations. With a screwdriver and some mechanical know-how; one is able to fairly easy install this door lock. I also used a level so that the "a" would be nicely centered at the bottom of the lock.Easily pairs with Apple HomeKit.ConsCraftsmanship:This product is (from what I can tell) made entirely of plastic. It feels cheap and that it will break easily. I knew this going into the purchase... but I figured it was on the *inside* of the door and that it shouldn't be an issue as I only planned to use it for service personnel and deliveries.SensorsThis device lacks sensors that tell it if the deadbolt is truly locked or unlocked. In the case of my device, once it stopped working; it reported *locked* when in fact it was not. I have read other reviews / reports online of others experiencing the same issue.ReliabilityWorked for 3 lock / events and 2 unlock events. After that, it simply stopped working. Thinking the deadbolt was "stuck" I went to the outside of the door and unlocked the deadbolt with a key. Upon opening the door I tried to have it lock the door as I had done in the calibration. Nothing. The receiver didn't move. Thinking that it must of lost its receiver depth settings, I re-did the calibration. It had completely lost its ability to managed the deadbolt receiver.I ended up returning this to Amazon for a refund (thank you Amazon for allowing me to buy in confidence!) and I am back in the market for a *different* lock system.ConclusionSave yourself the time and look for another product. Not only is this product of poor material quality (search the internet for reviews... there are many other reviews that state the same thing);  it also lacks a sensor to truly know when the door is locked or unlocked. If I were not at home to see the status of the deadbolt, I would not know with confidence that the door is locked / unlocked... and what would the point of this product be in that case?
