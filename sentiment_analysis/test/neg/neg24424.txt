We bought the device in December and it worked for 2 weeks, after which we have spent over three month going back and forth with the customer service trying to get it working.  We have spent too much time trying to get it work and we are giving up. We value our free time and don't want to waste it any longer with Whistle customer service.Customer service is incompetent and seem to work off the script and make no sense in the steps they advice to troubleshoot the device.When we gave up on Whistle, we were told that the item is non returnable, since it has exceeded a 1 month return window. I DON'T THINK SO!!!
