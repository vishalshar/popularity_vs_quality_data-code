Bought the car seat for my son to use every day and for travel in my car, and also bought a more traditional booster for half the price for my wife's car. The mi fold is certainly small but beyond that it seems to be inferior to the standard booster in every way.  a few issues we had off the bat. The shoulder strap holder on the back in bulkier then the other seat and because of this (as well as other design issues) it "hurt" (bothered) my son. The seat slides around on the seat and it is hard to position because of this. The side wings(? red things that hold the seatbelt) have a ratchet style mechanism so if you can easily and accidentally push them IN, but you have to pull a release, which is inconveniently located on the bottom of the seat, to extend them out. When you are hooking the child in the seat it is really easy to push these in and then a PitA to pull the latch and extend them again. My third issue with the mifold is the way the hold downs work. they have a bit of a hook to them to hold the seat belt in, but this has the side effect of making it difficult to get your child out. I hope this startup can fix some of these issues in a later revision ( just make the wings lock into place instead of a one way ratchet!) but until then I would only recommend buying this if size is your primary criteria.
