Very disappointed !!!I just bought this item through Amazon. I bought the misfit ray for the same reasons everyone does. It has a nice design,elegant and feels very light on your hand. It calculates your calories and steps while doing different types of sports and it is waterproof and not to mention that the long battery life is plus. However, it lacks the most important component. ACCURACY. All the characteristics mentioned above are nothing without Accuracy. On the first day I barely moved 200 steps but it gave 3864 steps and everyday ever since I got it ,i've been getting similar steps numbers without moving much or exercising. My sister as well as my cousin are also facing the same problem with their new misfit Ray. We r going back to our jawbones. So,if you are thinking of buying misfit Ray.My advice is Don't!!!. Save your money and buy something else like Jawbone or Fitbit.
