Interesting concept. However, the re-usability is hilariously frustrating because the cheap adhesive tape they use highly prefers the paper backing board over the wood blocks. So changing from one maze to another is time consuming and limited because they give you only so many stickers and so many backing boards. The stickers themselves are sized wrong and a total pain to apply.If they had used magnets for all of this it would have been easy and awesome.
