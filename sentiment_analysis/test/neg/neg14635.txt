It was good when it was working, but after 6 months the LED light in the Pebblebee is constantly on and the app is not registering the Pebblebee, so I guess it is worthless now.  Unfortunate because I thought I was buying the best-of-breed and knowing that it didn't come with a replaceable battery I thought I would at least get good performance for at least a year.  It seems this technology is almost there, but it isn't with Pebblebee.  I wouldn't recommend spending your money here, look elsewhere.
