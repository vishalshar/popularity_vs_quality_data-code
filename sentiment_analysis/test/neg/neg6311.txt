I really wanted to like this product and at first I did. I am a nurse who uses my phone all day and was looking for a product to truly sanitize my phone. My biggest problem is that after less than 5 months the product stopped working. The blue lightening bolt on top would light up but the light itself inside just didn't work anymore. This product cost almost $60 dollars to buy and the blue light stops functioning in 5 months? What a disappointment.  That means PhoneSoap 2.0 cost me approximately $12.00 a month  only to stop working in a relatively short period of time!  I could say maybe it was a defective piece but I think it's foolish to buy another one to find out.
