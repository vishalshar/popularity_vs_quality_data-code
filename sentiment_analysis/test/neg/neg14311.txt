Right off the bat, you need a smart plug to use it properly.  More on that later.  So it monitors temp, light, motion, and humidity.  Why would you need that?  If it gets too hot in your home you can set up commands in the app to turn on the air conditioner until the temp returns to 68%.  But you will need the air conditioner to be plugged into the smart plug for that.  Not the smart plug that the Smartmonitor is plugged into.  You will need a second one, because the smart plug only has one outlet.  What if it gets too cold in the room and you want to heat the room up.  Can't plug your heating system into a smart plug.  Maybe a space heater, but come on.  You can have the monitor activate the heat by motion, which I'll explain in my next example.Well maybe you would need this for light.  So you can set up commands to turn lights on at night and off in the day, or you can set it up to turn lights on when it senses motion. Well, you most definitely need to have this facing your door.  And there's no wall mount so it has to be on a table.  Then you will need to have lights that plug in, not the ones controlled by a switch.  Then you will need smart plugs for every light you need it to turn on.  But your damn smart plug already has the air conditioner plugged in it.  Damn it!Humidity monitoring.  You know, just in case you need to kick on your dehumidifier.  The one that's down in the basement.  Guess you won't be kicking it on with motion because your monitor is upstairs. But you will be buying another smart plug.  So how many smart plugs is that now?  Your air conditioner, all your plug-in type lights, maybe your electric space heater, and now your humidifier.  And don't forget the smart plug that the monitor needs to trigger all of that.  You better have a good internet plan for that.  Speaking of wifi...The damn plugs run off of 2.4 GHz.  Seriously?  If your electronics aren't running 5.0 GHz, you are missing out on today's speeds and functionality.  And what's the point of paying those huge fees for high speed Internet if your running electronics on 2.4?
