I liked them for the two days that I owned them Unfortunately they fell out of the sleeve that keeps them with the phone and lost them. I sent them a private message and they never responded. As you can see from the picture they slide very easily into the sleeve. Well they also slip out of the sleeve just as easily. There lifetime warranty is wonderful if you can hold on to the lenses for more than 2 days. I can't believe I am the only one that this has happened to and I mentioned that to them in my message as well. I was cordial and I thought I was giving good feedback that they could use and was very surprised that they did not respond to me. Acknowledge my email at least. I would kill for my customers to give feedback like that.
