On the third use this failed. I used Luke warm water and the sensor registered 85.3 degrees Celsius. I changed to cold water.  Same result very disappointedUpdate 12/3/16:  I called and emailed the Sansaire customer service and their recommendation:  return it to Amazon and get a new one.  They told me that if they (Sansaire) replaced it, it would be with a refurbished unit - so for those of you who elect to go that route, be aware that you will NOT be getting a new unit.Will NOT be purchasing another - too much $$ for a device that failed so quickly.
