I purchased this product because they advertised online that it contain "folate" which is (melthyltetrahydrofolate) but when I received the actual product it says "Folic Acid". These are two completely different components.  For a vitamin manufacturer not to know the difference, is like a  surgeon not knowing the difference between a liver and a spleen.  Not  acceptable! For someone with MTHFR such as myself, "folic acid" is  poison. Obviously their executives are not interested in creating  legitimate  products and have no  qualms with FALES ADVERTISING!  Shame on you!!
