Ordered product when away for work in CT, DELICIOUS!  However decided to buy for wife to try, we live in Fl, after product arrived Saturday she picked up within 5 minutes from mailbox, very excited to try.  Pictures say thousand words for all 3 bags, no need to describe.  Amazon/product company need to address this issue, find a way to ship without product melting.  Returning and most likely will not buy again.
