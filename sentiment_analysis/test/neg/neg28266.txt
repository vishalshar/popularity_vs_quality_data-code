This is a waste of money!  The cards are missspelled, the phrases make no sense, are grammatically atrocious and aren't even hard to say with the mouthpiece in...  it came with 3 decks and there are repeats all through the decks!  So disappointed!  This was supposed to be a great fun family game after Thanksgiving and it was a FLOP!Do not waste your money!!
