I purchased this device for the vibrating alarm feature. Turns out that is only available in the Android app and not with iOS. I have an iPhone for work and am returning the unit.*I also purchased the rainbow wristband for it and will have to pay return shipping for it.It is beautiful, elegant and the packaging is lovely. It was easy to setup and sync. I'm just not able to use the features I purchased it for with the app I have access to.
