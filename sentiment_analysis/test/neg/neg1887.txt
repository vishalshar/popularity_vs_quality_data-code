Doesnt work- the app kept starting over so I'd have to use the calm and energizing vibes introduction over and over.I liked the music during the intro calm vide but that doesnt continue with the other vibe settings. The app constantly closes and shuts me out.I really wanted this to work in order to kick my coffee habit and as a quick fix to help me fall asleep at night. Unfortunately it has 0 effect for me or any members of my family. I have also found that the strips only work once and some of them arent even sticky enough for me to wear through a entire vibe. I dont even adjust my module so theres no reason they shouldnt stick for a full 10 minutes. At $4 a strip it becomes very expensive.Unfortunately it doesnt work for me or anyone in my family at all. I'll continue to try for another week and then send back for their guaranteed refund if it doenst work. I really hope other people have better results.
