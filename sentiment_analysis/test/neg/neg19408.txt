This device is quite interesting until you need support. It does not really work with every device. Their usual support email does not work, so after quite a bit of search I found an thread under Amazon Echo's skill page where the CEO of the company asks to customers to email him for support. I did email him and he worked on my issue but apparently he just stopped answering my emails and abandoned my case. So buy at your own risk and good luck getting any support. Also, there is no clear instruction on how to set up the device on the box or their website. It took days to be able to figure it out so good luck with that too.
