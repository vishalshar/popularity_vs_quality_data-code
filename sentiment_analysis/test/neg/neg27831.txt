I so wanted this product to work!  What a great idea it was and I love to support Kickstarter entrepreneurs but this purchase was an exercise in frustration. First, after downloading the remote for my devices and testing them out of the gate it only worked half the time and some buttons (like volume) would only work intermittently or not work at all.  Second, there is no organization to all the buttons, one would expect the downloaded remotes to at least resemble the physical remote but NO all the buttons are in alphabetical order (?!) and there was no easy way to move the buttons to at least group them in useful groupings. Then after customizing in some semblance of useful order via color coding and shapes - IT DIDN'T STICK! When I quit the app it would loose some or all of the changes.  All in all a very disappointing and frustrating purchase.  Great idea very poor execution. And yes I followed all the instructions and am quite tech savvy so ITS NOT USER ERROR.
