Don't waste your money.  Case does not fit on any Android phone and does not stick to the back of your phone.  I had to cut the credit card part (where the glasses get inserted) and tape it to my phone.  For almost $40.00 I thought it would be a better product.  The only thing good are the small glasses which fold.
