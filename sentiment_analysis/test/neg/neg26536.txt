Went around a bit of a tight turn and it swung my laptop into the car door. There are additional braces I can buy separately though but I didn't want to mess with it and returned it after that incident.There is the semi permanent piece that easily replaces the bolt that holds your front passenger seat to the floor board. Now if this piece fits vertically then you will need additional support. The clamp that is on the bottom of the tube that slides over this semi permanent piece is very strong but it will still swivel on the piece. Depending on how tall your vehicle or rather the pitch during a turn you could have an issue. The closer to parallel your seat bolt is with the floor board the more likely it is that this WILL work for you.I drive an Jeep Grand and admittedly I am a little more hard on my vehicle than some so since my center of gravity is higher and my pitch is greater AND because my seat bolt is nearly vertical/perpendicular to the floorboard... Forget it, the clamp was actually doing its job but it was tearing the METAL semi permanent piece apart.If you drive a cross over or smaller, are nicer to your vehicle and have a bolt that is parallel to the floor board then you are pretty much assured you will be fine. Now that I am describing this I suppose I could have just drilled a pin hole through the device and the piece and dropped a pin through it. That would have fixed it. Oh well.
