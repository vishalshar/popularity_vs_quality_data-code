It broke within two weeks and Gameband has yet to provide us with a replacement despite multiple attempts at communicating with them.It was a birthday present for my 10-year-old son who loves Minecraft and loves this Gameband.  I would give it 5 stars if it worked.I will update my review if I receive an appropriate response from the company.
