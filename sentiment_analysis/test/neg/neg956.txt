I fell in love with this tracker when shopping for one online because of its great styling, versus previous devices that I've used including several Fitbit devices. The device looks as good, if not better than what is pictured online and the materials feel solid and well made. I like the fact that an optional rubber strap is included in case you decide to take advantage of the just-released swim tracking feature.The app is so-so...I keep getting red alerts for I don't know what. I find the Fitbit app to be way simpler to read and understand.Now for the BAD part. The unfortunate thing about this device is that it CAN'T KEEP TIME. Every single day, without a doubt, I have to recalibrate the watch. Within a few hours of recalibration, it loses or gains time inexplicably. I've updated the firmware I think twice now (currently on 1070) and it still hasn't fixed the problem. This is sad because I wanted to use this as a watch first and foremost, followed by a daily alarm and then as a tracker. Without it being able to keep time, it's nothing more than an expensive tracking device.Hopefully Withings is able to address this with upcoming firmware releases. Considering returning it in the meantime.
