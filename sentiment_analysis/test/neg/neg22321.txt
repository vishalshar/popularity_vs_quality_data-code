This thing is terrible. I bought this directly from the manufacturer's website because they were running a pretty good sale. I totally regret buying it now. I have constant issues with it. The screen freezes, or the temperature and humidity readings don't work, or the connection doesn't work....on and on. I have emailed their tech support 3 times now because  of issues. I get the same response, log out of the app, delete the app, reset the monitor, reset the router, restart your phone, reinstall your app, reinstall the monitor...Jesus H....so infuriating. The thing has rendered itself basically useless, we had to go out and buy a cheap $30 intercom. Except for the four days we were out of town for Thanksgiving...then it worked flawlessly.  I've included screenshots of the connection dropping, the temp and humidity read outs not working, and the video feed freezing.
