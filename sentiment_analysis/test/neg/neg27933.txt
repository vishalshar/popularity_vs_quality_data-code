Really not sure about this yet.  I returned the 1st one, received another and had same issues.  I'm still researching and trying different cords, etc.The problem is it works on my neighbor's Fluxmob, but not mine.  We are experimenting with a different cord.  Don't have an answer as of today 10/14/2016.
