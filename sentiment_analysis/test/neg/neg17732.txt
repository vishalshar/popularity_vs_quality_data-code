Ok, so I misplace my e-cig (quit smoking with this device 4 years ago) in the house all the time... it has the tile attached to the battery; I can look it up and it finds it! or make it ring... simple enough! Now yesterday, I take the pet stroller (with my 2 rabbits) and my doggie for a walk to the park about a block away or so... with my e-cig coming along in the stroller.. Along the way or at the park I must have lost my e-cig because it wasn't there. Bumpy ride, maybe fell out. who knows....  then I'm relieved with my thought about "I've got the TILE attached!" Whew, that thing is like $150.00 to replace needless to say the price of my health!! I quickly grab my phone and go to hunting it down. Much to my dismay the app tells me the last time it saw the TILE was the 18th! WHAT????? today is the 22nd and I've had it all along with me !!!  I contact customer service and they tell me the same that it was last seen the 18th...  blah blah blah..... I get the answer of "you must have a misbehaving TILE"  DUH... I can only say thankfully it was just my e-cig and not my dog or wallet as I have seen people use them for. It just completely lost itself!!!  GO FIGURE!!!  So now they try to offer me a free TILE !!! What for????? It obviously isn't crack up to perform all that they say it can! I am highly disappointed and expected more from the company as a customer. I will also add - this isn't my first or only tile! Just don't expect too much from it. Obviously it misbehaves and can't be trusted!!!
