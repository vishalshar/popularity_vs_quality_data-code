The statement on Amazon's description, above, "Three simple steps: open box, mist with water, harvest the crop," is VERY misleading.  Buyer beware.  You have to do bunch of other things, including cutting an "x" on the plastic, scrape the mold, and soak the pouch for 8 hours.  You don't just mist with water once; that is something you are supposed two times a day.I just disposed of my kit after waiting (following the instructions throughout, including misting with water twice a day) for 32 days.  I guess I got a dud batch.Another comment: The instructions call for soaking in a bucket. I would edit that to specifically indicate a CLEAN bucket, because anything getting into the water in that bucket (say, paint residue) will get into the mushrooms, if do you get mushrooms.
