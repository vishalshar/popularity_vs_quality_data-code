Short & Sweetly:  The CEL-Robox Printer does not print well. I have been waiting for this Printer for months. I even followed up with Robox before I pulled the trigger on the purchase. BTW, I am not new to 3D Printing and can unequivocally state that this product is not ready for prime time.It is beautiful. It is well made. It is a total waste of time. And therefore I do not recommend that anyone wanting to enter the field of 3D Printing get one of these machines. As well, I requested Stateside Assistance and received less than stellar support by a person who knows less about 3D Printing and Programming than I do.I am just not willing to take a week of my life to try to sort this Printer out. It's just not worth it and for THAT REASON I am returning the Printer much to my dismay.After mulling the entire transaction over for a bit this is what I have to say.  "You should be ashamed to release this unfinished product with so many flaws both SW, FM & HW.  The time it took to shake this Printer Down and discover that it was essentially useless was time that was stolen from me.  Just the Re-box exercise was valuable time that could have been better spent being productive with my other Printers.  You're just like all the other jokers that knowingly rush your project to market and I'm a fool for trusting you.  OK.  Now I'm done.  No apologies needed.
