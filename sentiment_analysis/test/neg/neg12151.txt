I received the Shine 2 on Nov 12 and ten days later it is inoperable. On Friday the 20th I worked out for one hour in my speed skates at the local ice arena. I clipped the Shine 2 onto my boot. When I was finished with my workout the Shine 2 ceased to function. When I went home I sent Misfit an email and received an automated email right away stating they would contact me "shortly." It is now two days later and I have yet to receive any communication. I decided to put a new battery in it even though I couldn't believe the battery was already dead. The new battery did not make a difference. I went to misfit website and updated my ticket to let them know it wasn't the battery. I am still waiting for a reply. For the past year I wore a Fitbit Charge everyday with no complaints. The only reason I bought the Shine 2 was because of the styling. The first nine days I was adequately satisfied, but now I am sorely disappointed. If only they would have contacted me "shortly" like they said they would, I probably would not have needed to write this review. As Pink Floyd once said, "I'm still waiting."
