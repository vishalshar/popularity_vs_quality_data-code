I really wanted to like these. Love the idea but needs more work. As others have stated, I had to modify the stops in order to be able to fire. And the right trigger keeps falling off in the middle of a match. And way expensiveUpdate- after just a few games with them, they will not stay on at all. Really wish I could return  them
