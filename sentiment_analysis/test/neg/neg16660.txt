I wanted to believe in this product! But the first one I ordered didn't print at all. I requested a replacement and the second one printed a stringy mess! I've never been so disappointed, I just wanted to jump in and start printing. After hours of researching fixes online I discovered the support was terrible and barely existed. The x-axis sensors kept falling off and the Y-axis didn't move smoothly or correctly. This product needs a lot of work.
