This is really poor quality, cheap-looking piece of plastic. I kind of wish I'd read the description and reviews before I ordered, but it seemed so straightforward. The surface is a silver-colored piece of plastic that came scratched. Also, it's not flat; it's like a flimsy, plastic box. It's over a half inch thick the picture doesn't do the clunky thickness justice. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it doesn't claim to be metal or flat, but I really hate it.
