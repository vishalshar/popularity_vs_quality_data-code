I just didnt feel anything for the hostages in this game. The gameplay is boring and almost entirely luck-driven with no mitigating factors at all. Hostages live and die based on unglamorous rolls of the dice. I had really hoped for more since this game was made from ten ground up as a custom solitaire experience. I never wouldve imagined it would be more boring than counting sheep, but its about that bad. I really wish I felt more for this game than regret at having spent money, but thats about it.
