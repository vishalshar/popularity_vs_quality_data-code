Well the great thing about this cam is that it is extremely easy to set up. It literally takes less than 5 minutes; once you figure out that you have to cut off your 5 GHz broadcast on your dual band router. Not acceptable. And then you have to have the camera within 3 or 4 feet of the router to get it to log on to your network. Once again, not acceptable.Picture quality was good, the camera had about a minute and a half delay for the speech to come through so don't even think about carrying on a conversation with someone unless it is your dog. I was optimistic but unfortunately this device needs to mature more before it will be effective and deserve the right to be called a 'Smart Camera.'
