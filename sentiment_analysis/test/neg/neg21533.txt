UPDATE #4: Appears to be toast.  For a while it would work okay without those false alarms on the latest firmware, but it dropped off the network on a daily basis.  Did a complete reset, and while it is active and the DLINK lite app can see it, it doesn't respond to controls, mail alerts or anything else.So in the end I have gone for a BLINK system.  Yes, at first I thought "$100 per camera, that's crazy!" but then I realized it was actually much cheaper because you only need one sync module and the cameras are discounted if you need more.  So it has ended up being cheaper than the dLINK solution.  PLUS free cloud storage of alerts.  And the things run off rechargeable batteries than you only need to charge less than once per year.Brilliant.UPDATE#3:  Okay, finally got a response to the trouble ticket opened more than a month ago.  They recommended that I change the video settings from the usual 60z to "none" as the refresh rate.  I did so and so far three days later, none of the those false alarm flashes!  I hope that this means it is resolved.  I'm revising the start rating in that belief.  (I'll update here if things change.)  Note that this is NOT a viable fix if you have the same trouble with their NON-HD D-LINK cameras, since those don't see to have the option to change the video refresh rate.  But so far this is working for me, so I am revising the star rating to 4 stars.  Not perfect, for the reasons outlined in my original review, but workable.Full Details from the web page where support directed me:Q:  How do I fix the White Screen of my DCS-935L when the camera is pointing outside my Window.  [note that i had this problem regardless of a window being present and my issue was more often that a FLASH would occur based on nothing in the environment, and trigger a motion event;  less often, the image would turn and stay completely white which sort of had the opposite problem -- no triggers and nothing recorded]A:  If you have your camera pointing outside form a window or if you have a room with large amounts of light (direct sun light)  you may have noticed the Live view window will display a white image or maybe a silhouette of some items  in front of the screen, This is caused by the frequency setting allowing too much light.Please follow the steps below to change the settings of a camera displaying this  symptoms:STEP 1.  Log in to the camera configuraiton pagesSTEP 2. Go to SETUP from the top horizontal menu and select IMAGE SETUP from the vertical menu options.STEP 3. Look for the Frequency Setting  and select OFF.STEP 4.  Go to MAINTENANCE,  select SYSTEM and click on the REBOOT THE DEVICE buttonSTEP 5. Wait for the camera to reboot (About 1 Min)  and check the LIVE VIDEO tab to make sure the changes have taken effect.You should now see a cleared picutre of your camera.NEW UPDATE #2:  Still no assistance from D-LINK, more than a month later.  They have posted twice here but have not responded to the four trouble tickets I have opened (three using the link they provide and one directly on their web site).  I will be sure to update the review if they assist me.  For now, the TL;DR summary is:  The motion detection is not functioning.  This is an issue that has caused numerous support threads on their web site.  Support is unresponsive.  If you don't need motion detection, this might work fine for you.UPDATE #1:  Amazon was nice and was willing to do an exchange.  Alas all that confirmed was that this problem was not unique to one unit. The new one has the same issue.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I'm a fan of these DLINK cameras.  This is the third I have bought -- though this is the first of the HD ones I have.Yes, they are quirky, but since I went through the learning curve with the first two, it wasn't too bad.  Here is what I learned on the older, SD models:1.  Setting it up fully to make it useful for you requires accessing it via the IP address of the camera.  It runs a little web server which is the interface to all(?) the settings.  You need to be comfortable with configuring email clients if you want the camera to send you email.  You need to be comfortable setting up an FTP client, if you want the camera to FTP photos and videos. Etc.  And note that the web interface requires that you enable Java.  Literally the ONLY reason I have Java (a security nightmare) on my computer is for these cameras.  You can uninstall it once you have them configured the way you want -- but give it a week or two to make sure you got it right (see item #2).2.  It takes a while to dial in the specifics of things like motion detection.  You may need to adjust the coverage area and or the sensitivity several times until you get it right.  And there will still be some false alarms on occasion.3.  Unique to this model (since the earlier models didn't support AC wifi):  Don't use the fastest wifi setting.  Connect to a non AC source.  Yes, the speed will be slower -- but the range and reliability will be higher.  You don't need AC speeds.  You need reliability over a long range.Once you get over those hurdles, you are PROBABLY good to go.  Why do I say PROBABLY?  There is still strange stuff going on, including one deal breaker:1.  On the older models, when you have them send you an email with still images when a motion event happens, you would get ONE email with five images.  Ideal.  On this new model, sadly, you get FIVE separate emails.  Wasteful and harder to manage.  But not a deal breaker.2. The "deal breaker":  on both of the units I have received from Amazon, several times each day, the video will FLASH white, like a camera flash went off.  This will trigger it as if a motion event, and you'll get a notification, captured video and or stills, emails, alerts, i.e., whatever you have set up based on a motion trigger.  This is annoying and makes it nearly useless from a motion trigger/security standpoint.  In other words, four stars off for that since false alarms make the motion sensing and security features pretty useless.These false motion alarms are a known problem with various dlink camera models going back to 2013 that is still not fixed in some cases, as I have learned.  You can read about it on their support forums, such as: [...]  and on other topics.Changing the sensitivity down to 1% (or 99%) does not solve the problem.  It happens whether in day or night mode.  It happens whether both video and stills are being captured, or just one or the other.  I didn't experience it until getting this particular model, and it has happened on both units of this model that I have acquired.  Factory re-sets and firmware updates (and downgrades) don't help.  My other older SD D-LINK cameras are operating okay and I am using the same setup for all of them -- but of course the hardware is different and the firmware is different.Until this issue is resolved, I can only recommend this camera if you do NOT want to use the motion sensing feature.  If all you need is a way to dial up the view from the camera from another location manually, I think you will be fine.  But I use cameras for security purposes too and this is a deal breaker.
