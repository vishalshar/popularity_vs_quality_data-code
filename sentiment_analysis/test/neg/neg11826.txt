Carabiners on hammock are poor quality. They have rough spots and after setting up they have already started to cut into the ropes. Doesn't work quit as they advertise. For the price there are much better hammocks. returning this hammock. Also had stains on the hammock when opened. It's a great idea and size for a hammock- hard to find hammocks this big but there is a lot that needs to be worked out.
