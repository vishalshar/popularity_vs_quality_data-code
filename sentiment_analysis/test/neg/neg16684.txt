I love many things about this bottle, like the shape that fits well with other stuff, and the bottom that allows for better cleaning, but for some reason the lid isn't designed to seal the contents in. The least tilting/tipping of the bottle allows the contents to dribble out down the side. Unacceptable in my book.
