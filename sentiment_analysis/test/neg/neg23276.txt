So many promises, but just like a politician, it does not deliver.  Alexa is unreliable even when less than a foot from my router or phone.  I have a 500 mb connection, so that can't be it.  My Echos and Taps work perfectly.  I thought that by waiting until Amazon offered it, the bugs and kinks would have been worked out.  Wrong!  Support offers hope and makes promises, but still fails to deliver any solutions.  Pairing with my iPhone (fully unlocked with no restrictions) is hit and miss.  Works fine for awhile, then nothing is working.  I did not know the Bluetooth tethering was still in beta for the iPhone.  Not too many complaints with battery life.  At first, it was dismal because I was always trying to get things to work.  For telling time, it's great, looks good and appears to be well built.  The software leaves a lot to be desired.  Maybe, in a year or so, this watch may be used as I planned, but for now, just an expensive pretty watch.  BTW, be wary of resets.  Every reset causes a new device to appear in Content and Devices on Amazon.  I now have 8, all with different serial numbers, but really just the same device.  Not sure what is going on with that.  At least they are easy to remove.
