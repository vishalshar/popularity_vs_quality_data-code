Below are the negatives, which reviews often like to talk about, but let me start by saying that overall I like the Pencil. I'm not sure if it was worth the money, but it's a fun tool to use if you like to draw on you iPad. I think it's a neat accessory to have. They have a 30-day return policy, so it's worth a shot if you like to draw. As far as notetaking, the only real advantage is a quick eraser.Concerns:In Paper, the Pencil has a hard time recognizing the eraser, especially if you switch from tip to eraser too quickly, resulting in the eraser either performing the smudge function or continuing to write as the tip would. This also happens if I touch the broad side of the tip first, rather than the point of the tip. It's almost as if the app thinks that any large touch point is automatically the finger, thus resulting in the smudge attribute. This is a bit annoying, especially because the rewind tool isn't as precise a function as it could be and because the ability to quickly switch from tip to eraser was a selling feature for me. The more like a true Pencil this is, the more it will set itself apart from other stylus' because it doesn't interrupt the intuitive process needed for creativity.The zoom feature is nice, however the tools should operate in the zoom bubble as they do in full page. You will notice in Zoom that if you're trying to shade a small, precise area using a tool such as the pencil, it takes almost 10 times as many strokes to have the same effect as one stroke would in regular view. I don't know why this is, but it seems counterproductive. When I zoom, I want to be able to keep the drawing tool's performance the same.I also noticed that syncing through bluetooth and staying connected is a bit glitchy, but not too bad. Say for instance I have both Paper and Noteshelf open and I'm jumping back and forth, Noteshelf seems to glitch out with connectivity and I have to "touch to kiss" again, which doesn't always work. I usually have to completely close out Noteshelf and restart to get the Pencil to function properly again. No real issues in the Paper app, however.Quality: I bought the Graphite Pencil, not the Walnut version. I've had it two days and I've already noticed that where the tip and eraser attached, the black paint that covers the metal is wearing, exposing shiny silver. I haven't dropped it, so the quality just seems a bit off for the price tag. That being said, the weight is quite heavier than the Walnut I hear, which is why I ordered the Graphite version. The only downfall is that it's a bit slippery, so in colder temps you need a firmer grip. Also, I've caught myself once or twice wishing it, too, had a magnet so that I could comfortably walk with iPad and Pencil in hand.UPDATE: The pencil tip/eraser recognition issue has become more problematic than first realized, so I've reduced this from 4 to 3 stars. It's almost impossible to push the pressure edge of the pencil on the screen without it thinking it's the eraser or the tip of your finger, triggering the smudge/blur feature. Unless you start by touching the screen with the tip point of the pencil, it thinks it's the eraser. Also, if you transfer too quickly from eraser to point, it still thinks you're on the other end of the pencil or your finger. The result is that it takes almost twice as long as it should to draw. That, paired with the glitchy rewind tool in the app makes it a bit frustrating to reverse the error.Also, the rubber tip begins to loosen up a bit and makes it more difficult to predict the precision point when placing pencil to screen. It's not a very precise tool for writing or drawing extremely detailed images. It's basically become an average stylus that sits in my bag while I use a precision-point stylus to write meeting notes. I use it for basic sketching.Update:This pencil now sits in my drawer. It's too much of a headache to try to correct the glitches and faulty programming. The "malfunctions" as FiftyThree is calling them makes using this as a drawing too only worth twice the effort one has to put in to correct the pencil's mistakes. In the comments you'll see that they are proposing to troubleshoot the issue with me, but I've had no response since I reached out to them.
