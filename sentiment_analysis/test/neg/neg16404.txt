What i dont like about this product:1. I cant use it in the forehead, sunction does not work, i guess its because the tip is not lying flat on my forehead2. sunction is not so great, it does not suck all the dead skin cells, i have to wash my face and scrub it a little bit to make sure they fall off my faceIm buying a different microdermabrasion system which is pricier but has different sunction levels. The one they use most in spas.
