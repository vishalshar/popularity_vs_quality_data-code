I too have to leave a poor review.I am also a wireless engineer with a complex setup. I was using 6 Apple Airports to create a unified network in my home (about 3000 sq Ft)I have now installed 4 EEros. The performance is great when they work. Unfortunately they don't work all the time. And this highlights the HUGE problem with the devices. There are no tools of any kind to do anything to the devices. I can not easily troubleshoot these.I am running the Apple Airport net with the Eeros. (Very diverse channels - no interference between he devices. Eeros are on channels 1 and 36 - airports on 11 and 149). I reduced the airports to 4 units rather than 6. Yet the Airports, while not providing the speed of the Eeros as consistently, they have far less problems. The routers are connected to two Separate internet connections of 130 Mbps each and both systems have different public IP addresses.Granted I have a complex network. I do wireless cameras and home automation so there are usual about 40 devices connected at any one time. I have start remigrating devices back to the Airport side since the Eero side performs so poorly.Yesterday my son was having problems connecting in his room, (12 ft from the Eero). His phone (iPhone 6) showed a speedtest speed of 1.86 Mbps on the Eero net. My 6s was at the same time registering speeds of 60+ mbps standing next to him. Rebooting the iPhones, restarting the Wifi stack, restarting the entire system changed nothing. His Xbox One? Showing speeds less than 1mbps. Sometimes.Of course, since the customer is totally locked out of the router, there is very little that can be done. I have used external tools to do a  heat map of the system and RF flux density is pretty uniform for the Eeros. But the lack of any real tools to change any parameters makes this way too expensive. I understand they want to simplify this but locking us all out negates the advantages.I really really wanted to love these devices. I am out 700$ for a system that does not function as reliably as my old one. I am now stuck with hoping that there will be some automatic software update that might solve the problem.The picture is my phone endlessly trying to get an address from the Eero system this morning. Neither mine nor my wife's phone will acquire a connection. More work with little tools, this is so frustrating...
