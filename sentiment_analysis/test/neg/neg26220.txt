Was SO wanting this to be a fun game. I'd seen so many videos of it on YouTube and it looked like everyone was having such a blast. Last year we played Pie Face and had fun, but this was less messy - so I wanted it to be our Christmas Eve game. Well, we had 5 people playing and maybe once someone had to repeat themselves twice. Otherwise, we could all tell what the other person was saying.I envy families who really did have trouble figuring out what the other was saying but this was a dud for us. :(
