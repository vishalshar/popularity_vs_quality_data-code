Disappointed in cap. I bought 2. One didn't even come with a cap! The other cap falls off constantly and easily. Once it gets lost, which is soon to be soon, the whole kind is worthless. Besides that cap issue, it's fine. Kid screws on and off easily and nothing leaks. However; the cap issue is serious enough that I regret the purchase.
