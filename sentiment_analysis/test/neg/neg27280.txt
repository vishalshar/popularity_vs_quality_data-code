Well, this thing disappointed me so much, it finally spurred me to write my first review...I had such high hopes, and really needed and wanted it to work.  I spent the better part of a day researching, and settled on the Pod due to its great form factor, waterproof case, long battery life - and most importantly, the ability to swap batteries on the fly, instead of removing it from the dog and charging the whole unit.Some of the disappointments, I can live with. The battery doesn't last as long as they say it will, the app is clunky, and there is no option to just turn off the every-three-hours self locates (which drain the battery) and just do locates when I ask.  Also, even though it's collecting locations every three hours, you can't actually GET that information.  No, if I need it, I have to contact customer service and they'll give it to me.  Huh?  Why waste battery collecting data I can't even have...and why not allow me to turn it off?But there's another HUGE problem I cannot live with: the GPS just flat out does not work, about 75% of the time.  This is out in the country, only sparse trees, no other GPS item I own has the kinds of problems this does.  Time after time, I query the unit, it spins the app for 5 minutes, then declares there's no GPS.  Truly worthless.  I wish it weren't so.  The manufacturers need to go back to the drawing board on this.  Instead, they have customer service spewing BS like "it must be the clouds!"  But clouds and rain do not affect GPS.  Stop blaming the weather, and get to work fixing this.  There are many great things about the design, I hope someday it's ready.
