It didn't make a single person aware of anything. It is explained as having just a certain amount of a lifespan and doesn't have an option to change a battery. I wanted it for my mom in case someone approaches her in a parking lot and went and tested it and it didn't alert anyone. So now I have to buy her a taser instead.
