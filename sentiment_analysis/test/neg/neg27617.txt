Worked fine with my iPhone 5s, though the required calibration procedure was a nuisance compared to a standard thermometer.  When I tried to use it recently with my iPhone 6s, I was unable to enable the privacy setting to allow Kinsa to use the microphone because the app failed to appear in the list. So the thermometer was useless.  I tried to contact tech support, but they were closed.  Are we supposed to only get sick during business hours?  In any case, they returned my email the next day, but their suggestions did not resolve the problem.  Life's too short to spend time on tech support for a thermometer.  I'm getting rid of my Kinsa and going back to my old drugstore thermometer.
