First and foremost this is a measuring tape--before you can have all the "nice to haves" you have to get the core product right--in this case accurate measuring. The device claims an accuracy of 1mm but mine is consistently off by at least 2mm. The rest of the product is awesome and the user features are FANTASTIC. They got all the fringe extras right and I hate it that I had to return it; but the name of the game with a tape measure is consistent, accurate results.
