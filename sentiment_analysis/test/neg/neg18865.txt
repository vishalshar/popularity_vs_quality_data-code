This is by far the most frustrating hardware i have ever purchased. The 1st one was defective. It took more over 1hr to get it to connect, than the connect is super bad. I can't get through 1 whole minute without the connection coming in and out. Than the sensors stopped working. I did not respond to anything. The device was terrible out of the box. Amazon sent me a replacement and its now day 2 and i still can't get the dam thing to connect. I want to like this device and had read how its a hit or miss. Purchase knowing you could get a defective product and just have a horrible experience. I am close to just returning everything and calling it a day. These cost tooooooo much money for the frustration i am having. I have missed 2 jogs trying to get this dam thing to work.
