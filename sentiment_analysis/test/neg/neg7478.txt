Do not waste your time or money.  I began to suspect I had a problem when the instructions stated that the tab for the battery needed to be removed to start the unit.  The tab was not present to remove.  This suggests the unit was previously used, returned, and then shipped back out as new product.  I then began to discover why the unit was likely previously returned: It would not consistently  (rarely actually) recognize the "double tap" to activate the device.  Over two days of attempts it never managed to sync with the application.  This includes re-installing the app, attempting to sync on multiple phones, and replacing the battery.  Tech support (only available via email not phone) was unable to provide any other suggestions.  I am very disappointed.  This was a birthday present for my wife and she has not enjoyed the experience.  I am in the process of returning it.
