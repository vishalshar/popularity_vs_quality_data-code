I really liked this concept, but I returned it because of the phone app. This thing wants ridiculous security permissions from your smart-phone. You're basically allowing Korner unfettered access to your device. Why does a door alarm need access to my phone's camera to take pictures and videos, my internet browsing history, all of my contacts, and free rein to automatically add further permissions without consulting me?Part of the reason I want an alarm is to secure my privacy. With this system, you basically pay Korner $98.00 to take control of your phone and record how you use it. It seems conterproductive to try to secure my privacy by signing it away! No thanks! I'll just take my money back!
