Thought I had found what I was looking for, but not to be. I wanted an all in one for streaming Apps Netflix Amazon Prime HBOgo KODI and others. Wanted to run Chrome and Doc's and all the goodies like my phone but use a TV. The newest update removes google play and services and could not get the streaming apps to run a movie. They install and let you search but never play. (yes you can side-load google services but streaming didn't work) If all you want is google doc's and such it works great. I don't want to fiddle with something every other week to try and get everything to work. Not what I was looking for. Back to the drawing board.
