I bought 2 "NEW" scooters as birthday gifts for my grandkids, but had to send one back that came with burnt oil in the reservoir and clearly did not start or stay running as well as the other one. I contacted Amazon who approved the return without a hitch. After the refund cleared on my card I ordered another "NEW" one. When it came the oil was clear but the base of the front fork paint was bubbling and where it had chipped there was rust. Now I have one grandchild that is happy and one that is ? sad. However, Amazon again took it back without a hitch/fee on my part. For that I am very happy these are not cheap machines.
