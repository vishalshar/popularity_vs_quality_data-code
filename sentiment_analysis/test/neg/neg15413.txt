would rather have my SHATTERED screen back, or pay just as much if not cheap to get my screen replaced. I received the screen with minor cosmetic defects but I didnt mind since all I really needed was a functional screen. I followed the directions step by step, and I now constantly have to restart my phone because: the screen doesnt respond and presses bottons without me even touching it. And its not like I totally screwed up the installation; I've been an Avionics Technician for military fighter aircraft for the past nine years and this task was a breeze to say the least.
