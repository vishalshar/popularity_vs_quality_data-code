I can't give it one star, because it does work and show a picture with sound.  However, every few minutes, the screen goes blank.  I have to constantly unplug it and plug it back in, to get it to work again.  My 4k UHDTV is less than a year old.  It's not my TV.  My LG G4 phone is 4 months old and is compatible. It's not my phone.  The picture also has green lines that sporadically pop up for a split second.  I never had this problem with my Samsung MHL adapter with my Samsung Galaxy S5.  I have no doubt this is a good product, but the particular one I received, seems to be defective.
