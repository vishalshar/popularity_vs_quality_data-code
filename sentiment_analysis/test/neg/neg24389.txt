Pretty much same review as expansion pack #1!!  There is nothing adult about these cards...a lot of the cards are stupid and make no sense and several cards are misspelled...for example "Baskerball Tournament" "Butterer Toast" "You Make Me Headache" "Lost Singht of Land" "The Shelver are Really Dusty"  There are several duplicate cards in expansion pack #2 that are found in expansion pack #1!!
