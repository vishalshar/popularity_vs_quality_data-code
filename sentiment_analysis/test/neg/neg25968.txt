As of now I have to give this one star.  After initially charging the unit as instructed I played with the G10 at a performance for roughly two hours, then placed the transmitter back in the charging receiver during my break.  After returning from break the transmitter lasted about another 5 minutes before completely losing it's charge.  Figuring I had not charged the transmitter long enough from the start (although knowing my unit was initially charged for a minimum of 4 hours) I put the transmitter back on the charger the next day.  Well the transmitter no longer took a charge in any way or even lit up with any color to indicate a charge.  Seems like a cool gadget and worked great for the two hours it worked.  *Yes, the transmitter was properly seating in the receiver.  A little bummed.*quick update, spoke to Line 6 and my item was defective.  Hopefully the replacement works and doesn't take another month to get here.  I'll switch up review when I can actually use it.
