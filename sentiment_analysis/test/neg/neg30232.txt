I bought two of these.  The first setup right away, then lost the WIFI connection.  I was never able to get it to work again.  The second one I was never able to get it connected to my WIFI either by the "manual" method or WPS.  I ended up buying the TP-Link HS-100 - which worked flawlessly the first time, and has been working ever since.  BTW - the TP-Link works very well with the Echo Dot 2nd Gen!!
