As suspected, one size does not fit all.  All of the included 'laces' are the same length with no adjustment whatsoever unless you want to do weird lacing patterns and on my wive's shoes they were fairly loose on the lower pieces and way too tight on the upper laces.  Thinking they might stretch, she wore them for a few days, but it was just too painful to wear for extended periods that may loosened the upper bands up.  All they need to do is make some of the included 'laces' a little shorter and some a little longer and these will be brilliant, but as they stand, a complete no go for us.
