THE PROS- Excellent folding compact design for easy storage. It was made with cheep plastic with nothing near the kind of luxury you would expect such an expensive purchase, but it had a very practical designed that I was impressed with. It hardly uses up any desk space.- It might be good at scanning small 3D prints made of ABS or PLA because these materials normally have a glare-free surface.- The software was very stylish, and I believe that the developers were very talented at creating an effective workflow with innovative tools for getting rid of the garbage that appears in the results.- Excellent list of different export options if you get a reasonable scan.- If you already have a high-end video card, and you're already an advanced level 3D designer, you might find some usefulness or fun.THE CONS- It has no built in lighting and typical household lights aren't adequate enough. Lamps or studio lights are required.- Dark colors on objects are incapable of showing up on the scan. They show up as holes. Even with my 100w light within one foot of the object, the dark colors wouldn't show up.- It takes forever to scan. Look at the height of the scanner and divide it into 3 sections. It takes 15 minutes per section. That's a minimum of 30 minutes for objects that are taller then a golf ball, and that's 45 minutes for items taller then an iPhone.- Shiny, metallic, glossy, or translucent portions of the objects will confuse the scanner, and you'll end up with a scrambled mess. If your object isn't bright colored with a 100% shine-free surface, your results will have wasp nests.- If you're not experienced enough to do advanced level 3D editing to fix these dents, holes, globs, and wasp nests that are going to be in your scans, then this device has no chance of rendering you any kind of usable results even for simple objects.- You'll need probably 4GB of dedicated graphics card memory in order to do tall or high resolution scans, which means that probably 95% of common laptops won't be able to do much with this device. I have 16GB of main memory, and I have 768MB of on-board graphics memory, yet the software was incapable of doing any of the high resolution settings, and it was incapable of doing normal resolution scans on objects that were taller then two-thirds of the maximum scan height, and the software won't tell you what your computer is capable of before you begin your scan. You'll just get error messages all over your screen when your graphics card memory gets full.- Surfaces that are hidden from the scanner's view during the scan of it's particular section are not picked up even if when the camera moves to a higher point of view that's capable of seeing it. For instance, if you put a roll of electrical tape flat on the scan surface, the top part of the tape won't show up in the results because the scanner isn't programmed to look downward at it after it moves to a higher point of view. Instead it just moves on to the next section of the scan and leaves the limited point of view of the first section of the scan as-is.I spent a lot of time trying everything I could, but not a single item of mine that I planned on digitizing was scanable by this device. I gave up when it couldn't even scan a golf ball without having huge defects. I get the impression that this is more like a proof of concept rather then a fully functional release candidate. It doesn't even deserve a "generation 1" classification because it's almost completely unusable by the average end-user. On the other hand, I believe that the developers have a really great concept and they'll eventually get it right. Besides the memory management issue, the software was very impressive. It was just the hardware is what is failing to perform. In time hopefully they'll be able to put better components in their device and find a better method of managing memory.
