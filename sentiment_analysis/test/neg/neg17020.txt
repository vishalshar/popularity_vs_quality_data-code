When it works it's an awesome camera. However, I have had constant connection issues with the live camera. I live in a bad neighborhood and had  someone jump over my gate looking for something to steal. All while the I was at work and the camera was disconnected. The only reason I know is because my neighbors informed me. I've contact the support team twice. The first time they suggested that my wifi connection speed was too slow and that is why I was having issues so I went out and bought a wifi extender still having the same connection issues. Here is a copy of the email I received from the support team after I was still having connection issues and emailed them the second time:"Hi Daniel,Thanks for reaching out to us! It does look like your Kuna is now picking up a great wireless signal strength on that FiOS-X1XYC_EXT extended network (hovering around -45dBM).But it does look like your Kuna is currently offline - will you please take it through this setup process to reconnect it to your wireless network?If you run into any issues, or if your Kuna's status LED is flashing a color other than red, please let us know!-NicoleCustomer Success ManagerSo I guess every time I have connection issues I either have to wait for it to come back online which can take several hours, or I have to go through the entire camera setup every time.  This defeats the purpose of having a camera I can monitor from somewhere other than my home.I also bought this when the cloud service was free now I have to pay $58.99 per year to be able to save my recordings for more than two hours at a time. As it stands I'm not very pleased with this product and I really hope with all the money they're making they can develop a more stable device in the future.
