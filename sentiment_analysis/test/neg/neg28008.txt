This looked like a good case by its description, but the product I received was very disappointing. The case was poorly made, showing plenty of surface irregularities and a poor molded finish. The magnet was stuck on an insert that fits into the case and it is covered with a circle of cloth to avoid scratching the back of the phone. But the cloth was applied off center and looked awful. Supposedly this is made in the US, but it looks more as if it was made in a 3rd world country.  Good concept, but poor execution. And while the case comes with a second insert to use the 1/4 turn mount, it would have been nice to include on 1/4 turn mount.
