When netatmo works, it works well.However, it suffers from various issues:* So-so wireless range.  I have to keep my external sensor and rain gauge within maybe 20-25' or so of the (inside) base sensor, or I can get intermittent/dropped data.  WIth my old Oregon Scientific stuff, I could put the outside temperature sensor 40-50' away, and it would work fine.* Humidity sensor readings can vary widely.  I bought a second indoor sensor, and placed it next to the base station (maybe 2' apart).  The humidity readings were different by 14%.  Now, I'd expect a consumer-level solution to differ by a few percent, but 14% is unacceptable.  I bought a third indoor sensor (for temperature readings), and the humidity readings on this third sensor roughly agree with the second one.  So, I have no idea if the base station humidity sensor is wrong, or if the sensors on the additional sensors are consistently different.  (If anyone cares, the temperature readings are consistent for me.)* The weather station requires a internet connection to netatmo's servers, and the servers appear to be having problems recently.  Basically, you need to contact netatmo's servers if you want to see your weather data.  A few days ago, there was a 3-4+ hour outage where the data was inaccessible.  Today, there's been an 11+ hour outage, and it's still ongoing (update: the unit decided to forget its wireless settings -- see below).  When the servers aren't accessible, the netatmo is as useful as a dead squirrel.* When the servers do work, accessing the data is not fast.  The web page can take 3-5+ seconds to load, as well as the iPad and iPhone apps.  Expect to wait to see your data.* My unit came with some "pictograph" installation instructions, which were somewhat wrong.  Unlike what the instructions seemed to imply, I had to physically connect the unit up to my pc, using a USB cable.  I then had to use a configuration program, which was admittedly easy-to-use, to configure the wireless settings.  Note that you still have to use a USB cable, but a different, but still easy-to-use configuration program, to add additional modules (like the rain sensor or additional indoor unit).Update (Jan 12, 2015): it turns out that my latest "outage" was caused by the base unit somehow forgetting my wireless settings.  I had to re-enter the wireless settings several times before the unit finally accepted them (I'd get a "wireless connection timeout", despite the fact that it took me less than a minute to scan for a wireless network, select one, and then enter my password).  On the plus side, the unit does appear to have some internal memory, as it still seemed to collect data despite the wifi not working (the data was then sent to the servers, and so I seem to have lost no data).
