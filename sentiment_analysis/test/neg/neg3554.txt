After having skin cancer surgery requiring 40+ stitches on my face, I bought this hat to take on a week long beach trip.  It did the job of protecting me from sunburn... however, when adjusted to fit a smaller/lady's head, this is one ugly hat!!!  Notice in the photo that the sweatband rolls down out from under the hat and shows all the time ... not attractive ... this will definitely be a "river hat" for canoe trips only ---not a hat I want anyone seeing me wear in public.  Regret this purchase....
