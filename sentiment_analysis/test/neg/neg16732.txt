Won't charge.  When I plug my iPhone 5s in this cable I get a a repeated "charging tone" as if the phone is being repeatedly and continuously plugged in and unplugged from power. It does this with the phone in a case or out of a case.  Nice idea for a product and it seems sturdy but does not fulfill its primary function at all.
