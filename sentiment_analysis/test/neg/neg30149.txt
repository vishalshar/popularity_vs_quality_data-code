As a phone mount it's fantastic. As a phone mount for your dash; I would not recommend it all. It's perfect for the windshield or maybe a hard plastic but, for soft leather dashes I would look for something else. I've had this on my dash for a little over a month and it left what I can only describe as a shiny donut ring.see attached photos and decide for yourself.Removing the mount from dash was extremely difficult and looked as if it was going to tear a portion of my dash of.I have been told that the indentation and ring will disappear over time I will update when it does happen.
