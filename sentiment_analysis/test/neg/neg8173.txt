Purcharsed this product so I could keep a watchful eye on my tire pressure. Downloading the app and installing the tire sensors was easy but the next day both tires were flat. First I thought I did something wrong and uninstalled and reinstalled the sensor caps and again the next day both tires were flat. I removed the caps, filled both tires with air and having no problems with tire pressure. Don't waste your money, stay away from this product.
