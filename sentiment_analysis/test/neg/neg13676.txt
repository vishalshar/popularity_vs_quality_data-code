Okay, first one worked but was off by 10 degrees. In cooking that cost me a lot of time and money, Replaced and worked fine for a month...now I can't use it because it keeps telling me that the water level is too low (not true about the level.).  I want a replacement but this seller is telling me that 'it is too late'.  Too late!  Hey, I didn't make this unit that fails.  I want a refund or another replacement that may fail. Not acceptable! These are not like Bic pens....throw always that are not cheap!!
