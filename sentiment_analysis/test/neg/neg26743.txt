Not worth it. Only works reliably about 40% of the time. Most times it starts tracking/recording drives 10-15 minutes after starting. It randomly stops recording/tracking and sometimes won't track/record at all. The constant beeps while driving are annoying and pretty much tells you when it reboots or stops tracking/recording.Save your $$$, skip it.
