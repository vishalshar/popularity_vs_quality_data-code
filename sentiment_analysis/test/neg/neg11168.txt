GPS does not work! I drive for Uber and a decently reliable navigation is a must. The GPS on this phone does not work at all, in google map it keeps saying searching for GPS and will not navigate even though I have tried all different settings. Good thing you have a uber picture in the amazon page so you can mislead buyers. I cannot work because of the phone, definately will return it. My older phone that I bought from Walmart for $39.99 had better GPS than this. The screen and speed of this phone is good, so if you are not using navigation at all it is fine, but if you ever need to use the phone for navigation I will suggest you look somewhere else, especially Uber/Lyft drivers, stay away at all cost! It does not work AT ALL. Very disappointed since I like the size of the phone.
