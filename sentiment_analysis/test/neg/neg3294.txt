Bottom line, this is a third party product and it'a not guaranteed to work. From my personal experience, I installed the Tardisk (which was a terrible process to begin with) and after a day, my computer started to restart and shut down on its own. The flash disk that was supposed to show me the amount of space I have left never stopped processing/calculating and my computer just seemed a bit slower than usual after I surpassed the initial HD space my computer originally had. After everything, I just reset my computer and cut my 150 dollar loss on this product. I tried to unpair my computer first, but each time I started my computer up, after removing the Tardisk, it would give me an error message and I would have to turn my computer off again.My advice, do not buy this product. Other people have had similar messages on Amazon reviews and I ignored them. Apple made a mistake by releasing a 128 HD comp but their new line always has at least 256. I would advise getting a new MacBook before investing your money in this piece of junk.Just to reiterate, I installed the Tardisk correctly, I bought the specific model for my MacBook model, it simply did not work for me.
