I received the TRAKK GO 6 weeks ago. I charged it overnight when I received it. I played it for about 45 minutes and it went dead. I chargedit again for several hours and noticed that only 2 of the 3 battery lights were lit. I played it again and it went dead after the same period of time.I contacted BrandRack via email regarding the problem. I got a reply asking if the unit was turned on while it was charging. I answered saying it was not and did not get any further reply. I am a little disappointed with their customer service as there was no offer of refund or replacement.It's unfortunate that this has occurred as I was impressed with the sound of it but obviously got one with a faulty battery.
