The concept is promising, the build quality seems good, and they are more comfortable than I anticipated.  However, the Bluetooth range is horrible.  I'm only 5'9" and the distance from my ear to my pants pocket (left or right) is too far to maintain a continuous connection while streaming sound.  The firmware update fixed a lot of the problems I experienced out of the box (such as unclear phone mic), but it didn't fix the range issue.  I'm guessing this is going to require a hardware fix, instead of a firmware fix, so these will unfortunately be going back via UPS.
