***UPDATE*** See update in second paragraph I was a bit skeptical before buying this product. For the same price, you could get a reputable Sony Brand Stereo, however, it does not come with an AUX or headphone port which renders it useless for a lot of applications. When I received this unit, it was well packaged and I had no issues with the IR control. At first, I thought how good this unit sounded. Shortly after, I realized that the right speaker was the only speaker playing because I didn't connect the left one correctly. Once these two speakers were fired up, I raised the Bass and Treble to 3 and man does this thing sound good. It's powerful enough to cover a large living room with cathedral ceilings, and you could still here it well in the next door room. I also like the design of this unit as the other Samsung and Sony stereo systems look too aggressive and futuristic.***Update***This product has failed after I purchased it on January 25th, 2016 (lasted 208 days). I RARELY have any problems with electronics breaking but this radio has quit functioning period. It was rarely used, maybe once a week for about an hour yet it somehow broke. I was impressed with it initially but the components inside can't even hold up to minimal use. You're paying good money for a radio that has a lackluster warranty "90-day labor" and 1-year warranty. Sending it back will be costly and makes it really worth not the time, money, or energy. Therefore I change my review from 5 stars to 1 star. This radio might not even last a year, is that worth risking $80+?  I couldn't recommend this radio, go get a reputable name brand one instead.
