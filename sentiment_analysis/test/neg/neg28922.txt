I really wanted to like these. I usually love sweet potato chips. I don't know if it was the combination of the sweet potato with the coconut oil, but the chips were not crisp or tasty. I can't even describe the taste, too sweet, not salty enough would be the best that I could do. They were well packaged and shipped well from Amazon. However, I'll continue on my search for the perfect sweet potato chip.
