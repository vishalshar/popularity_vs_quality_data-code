I bought these because I was worried that my brushes were getting dirty by sitting in my jar even though I have used makeup brushes for 20 odd years, and I have never had a problem, I wash them when I should, but it just seemed all the press was pointing to covering makeup brushes up. I have invested in very good quality brushes and when I used these covers they would pull the hair ever so slightly causing the hair to pull away. I put the right size cover on and carefully would take them off etc, didn't matter the hairs would still get stuck and pull away and if I kept these thngs on  it would for sure cause long-term damage to the hairs. I took them all off my brishes and threw then in a drawer, complete waste of money.
