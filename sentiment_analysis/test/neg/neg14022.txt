I've had these air trekkers for 6 days now. These things are extremely fun to run and jump around  on. Probably some of the most fun I've had in a while. That being said they have already fallen apart on the sixth day I've had them that being the third time I've used them. So after about 6 hours of running and jumping and walking be aware the bindings that hold your feet on are very likely to literally fall apart. The calf binding is a little tricky to get used to but after you know how to properly use it is very comfortable and secure. The two foot bindings however are nearly worthless. The first time I put them on they looked like the metal grommets might pull free from the Velcro straps. The eventual failure however was the tiny screw that is supposed to hold the foot strap onto the foot pad.
