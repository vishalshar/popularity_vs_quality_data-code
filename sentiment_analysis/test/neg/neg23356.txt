I wanted to like this, I really did. The  only reason it has 2 stars is because I am a teacher and I did get to use it for science. The first kit I got grew an orange mold that resembled dog vomit. I was not impressed but my students got to learn about another type of decomposer. I called the company and they were very helpful in shipping out a new box. I meticulously followed the instructions (I thought I did the last time) but we were learning about a controlled environment so this was also helpful.There was pure elation and joy when tiny little mushroom heads began to peek out from under the plastic. I had 20+ students making sure I gave water to these little mushrooms everyday.  Each day they doubled in size until they came to a point where the tops dried out. They were hard brown stubs. Round 2 was lost to the mushrooms...But wait under the dried out scraggly mushrooms was another batch of mushrooms....so we waited and gave this group and extra boost to prevent drying. Still after a couple of days those mushrooms also dried out and shriveled away.At this point our science unit was over so I tossed the mushroom kit. I gave it 3 good chances, but 3 strikes you are out. I can't imagine using this to try and get any type of substance to eathe, unless you want strange mushroom jerKY. I won't be buying this again.
