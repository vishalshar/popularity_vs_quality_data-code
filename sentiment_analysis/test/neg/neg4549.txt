The app kept freezing and crashing my new iPhone 5, the pictures are not very detailed, tried on slides and film. I thought lomo was a trusted brand, so very disappointed in the quality of photographs, especially since it was a Christmas present for mom.The app doesn't do anything your camera functions don't already do. You still have to manually crop the photos... if you even find them worthy of keeping, which I did not.You're better off buying a regular lightbox and manually just taking pictures of them with your smartphone.
