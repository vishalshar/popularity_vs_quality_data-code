Device works fine ... but the cable that comes with it doesn't fit through the hole to charge your phone.  I brought this to their attention and they keep saying the cable that comes with the device is to power the device not charge your phone.  THEY ARE BOTH microUSB CABLES.  IT IS A LUDICROUS ARGUMENT!!They also got rid of the little compartment that they show on the video on their web site ... so instead of the charging cable hiding inside a compartment it has to sit out behind the device.
