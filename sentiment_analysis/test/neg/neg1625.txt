Terrible, took forever to connect and once it did there was such an incredible delay (when it actually worked) on turning on or off 1 or both connected outlets.  I have a really nice asus router. about 3 months old and an incredibly fast internet connection.  This product stinks!  Stay AWAY!  Wink is losing it bad, go to Smart Things!
