I thought this looked pretty stylish in the picture but when it arrived a couple months late (this is the first and only time my product didn't arrive in a timely fashion from Amazon) it looked and felt cheap. Believe me it's not something you want to put your $300-$900 technological masterpiece of a watch in. Go with the steel bands instead! They are sure to please!
