The Misfit Shine 2 is definitely an improvement from the first version, but there are problems with it that buyers must know before buying it. I will start with the positives. The LED lights on the watch are much brighter and visible in the sun light, this was something the first version did not do so well on. Now they added colored lights which also a nice added feature. It tracks your everyday movements and sleep just fine and since it is waterproof up to 30m and you don't need to charge everyday makes it a very good option for those of you who don't want a complicated smart fitness watch. Honestly when I had mine, I a lot of the times forgot I even had it on. Now to the negatives.They advertise a vibration motor that can tell you when to wake up or if you have any notifications (just phone calls and text messages NOTHING ELSE. This is pretty stupid because I can feel/hear my phone go off and distinguish the difference between a phone call and a text message just fine without the watch.) The motor is strong enough for you to feel you have a notification, but definitely not strong enough to wake you up in the morning. I was late for work one day because I depended on the watch to wake me up, that was if it even stayed on my wrist. This brings me to my next point. The watch band supplied is a bit better than the first version (quality speaking) but it is not strong enough to hold the misfit on in my opinion. When I would leave it on for bed for sleep tracking, more often than not it would fall of my wrist during the night and when I would realize it was gone in the morning I would have to spend 10 or more minutes trying to find it, because of its small size it made it even harder to find. On top of that I found that when I would put on my jacket or take it off or anything that moved the watch forcefully it would fall off. This happened many times! Once I would realize it was gone I freaked out each time because it was 100 dollars and it is so small, honestly its like finding a needle in a hay stack! If you do lose it there is nothing you can do because there is nothing in the app that can help you find it. Overall if you think you want a fitness tracker and a watch this is not the product for you because it really is not a way to tell time which is something misfit should have made top priority because what are watches supposed to do...  Thats right TELL TIME ACCURATELY  and there are much better products out there where you can see you notifications and a correct and accurate time. But if you want a product that is small, lightweight, waterproof (30m), and not needing a charge for about 6 months this is the product for you but just keep in mind that you will be wearing a 100 dollar bill on your wrist that at anytime can fall off and be lost forever. If you are planning on buying this just know the consequences.
