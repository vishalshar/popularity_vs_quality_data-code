I bought these and I loved them.  They lasted about 6 months and they broke.  Thin Optics was great and they sent me a new pair.  The second pair lasted 3 months and broke in the same way with much less use than the first pair.  As others have posted, they also get very scratched up just going in and out of the case.  The idea is great.  The design needs more work.  I'd love to give these a 5 but they have let me down twice.
