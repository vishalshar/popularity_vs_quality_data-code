I put these into my Puma Cell Surin's, and my foot wouldn't fit in the shoe because the elastic laces were causing the shoe to be too tight. The topmost lace actually popped off because it was being stretched too far after I forced my foot in.These are NOT one size fits all! These will likely only work in a shoe that has the lace holes a specific distance from each other. For example, if you have a tall pair of boots that gets laced up very tightly (so that the lace holes are very close to each other on each side), these won't work because there is a minimum distance that they need to be before they'll start stretching and working. Or, for example, if you have a skate shoe that you keep loosely tied, it's very likely that the top lace will stretch too far and pop off, or it will cause the shoe to no longer fit on your foot because the elastic laces are pulling too tight.Make sure you know your shoe is going to work with these before you buy them!Lastly, FYI, there are 14 in a pack (they figure you'll use 7 per shoe), and they give you 2 bands of a different color as a "gift" in each set (you could potentially use these to make your top lace a different color, for a different style). With my white ones, I got 2 red ones as a bonus, and with my black ones, I got 2 blue ones as a bonus.
