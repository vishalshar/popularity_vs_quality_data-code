We've had this spray top for about 6 months, using it for home-made all-purpose cleaner. First off, the trigger part of the sprayer is awkwardly short and sits close to the cap/rim of the jar, so you can't really hold it with one hand unless you have small hands. Not at all ergonomic like a regular spray bottle. I ended up having to use two hands most of the time, otherwise it would put too much pressure on the plastic top and was uncomfortable to hold.Second, you can't adjust the spray to "stream", it only goes on as a fine mist or completely off. I need both for different house-cleaning applications. Almost every spray bottle top has some adjustment between stream and spray. Not the reCAP sprayer.Last (and this is probably due to the poor nozzle/trigger design), a few weeks back the nozzle and trigger completely separated from the plastic screw-on top. They are two separate pieces, not one, so the nozzle and straw popped off while I was using it, dropping the jar and plastic top on the floor. I tried super-gluing the seal, but it still feels wonky.Bottom-line: $8 for a cheap China-produced plastic spray top that isn't comfortable or very functional, and then fell apart, left me quite disappointed. I think reCAP needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. I could probably fabricate my own out of a spray top and regular mason jar lid that would work better and be cheaper.
