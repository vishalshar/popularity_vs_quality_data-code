I had high hopes for this interesting meditation tool when I placed my order with Amazon. Upon receiving the package I was not very impressed. It looked as if it had been assembled in someones garage. The rubber mat was wrapped around the seat and the was then wrapped with some shrink-wrap plastic. The small meditation card was tucked inside. When unwrapped the rubber mat took 3 days to fully lay flat. Based solely upon the cost of this item I was expecting a professional package designed to protect the item during shipping. The whole set was less than impressive and certainly did not seem to be worth an investment of $75.00. My initial thought was here's a company praying on the good nature of Buddhists and meditators, and certainly not following the dharma of Right Livelihood. I rarely return items to Amazon so I decided to try the item out.I've been using this seat and mat for the past 6 weeks so that I could write an objective review of the item based on comfort and design, not just packaging and value for cost. Sadly, I don't find this item to be worth the premium cost. While it does serve its intended purpose it provides only adequate comfort for sessions lasting more than 20 or 30 minutes. I'm a 5'10" man who weighs 175 lbs. and I find that the seat begins to become uncomfortable after about 15 minutes of use. The rubber mat has already developed a depression where I usually place the seat so I have doubts that it will last for much more than a few months. Overall the idea seemed good but the quality , comfort, and value are not up to my expectations.I experienced a similar comfort level using a $30 pillow as opposed to this product. I can not recommend this item as a superior tool for meditation but it does work. If you are looking for a more comfortable option than your current be aware that this may not be your best choice.
