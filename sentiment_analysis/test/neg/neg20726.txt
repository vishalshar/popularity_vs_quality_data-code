This is a really pretty piece of jewelry and I would have been tempted to buy it for its aesthetic value alone, but the added technology was genius!  However, I found out that technology still has some bugs.  The app I downloaded to my iPhone would crash on me and the LEAF didn't always want to sync on the first try... or three.  The step tracker caught only 50-60% of the steps which I logged on another app on my iPhone (and I was constantly wearing the LEAF as opposed to setting my phone aside on occasion so it should have recorded more with the LEAF) plus the sleep analysis was also inconsistent and the app was glitchy when I tried to manually input my asleep/awake times.  I found my current iPhone sleep app offers much more usable data.  I wore the leather bracelet only one day and it was becoming discolored from rubbing against my jeans and seemed to be stretching out from constant pulling caused by the weight of the LEAF.  It also felt cumbersome because of the bulky LEAF design which isn't well supported by a thin leather strap, though I'll confess I'm not accustomed to wearing bracelets so that may have been my perception.  I clipped it directly on my pajama top overnight and I didn't notice it at all as I slept.  I tried it on the neckline of a knit top during the day, but it made it awkwardly bunch and hang low in the front due to the weight of the LEAF.  I clipped it to the inside waistband of my pants but was afraid of losing whenever I had to use the bathroom since it would nearly slide off.  I'd be afraid to clip it to the bottom of a top as I don't see that it would be secure enough, though it is offered as a suggestion in their promotion of the LEAF.  I never unpackaged the necklace so can't speak to that.  I'm thankful for Amazon's awesome return policy, of which I took full advantage.  Hopefully Bellabeat will make improvements and I'll give it another try!  I really do think it's about time for form and function to meet.
