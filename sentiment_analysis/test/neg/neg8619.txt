I bought this flashlight for my husband back in August. He absolutely loved it!  After using is and charging it correctly only two times, it now won't even hold a charge. I sent an email to customer service (2 business days for a return they say). Two weeks later and nothing so I send another email. I sent another email & 3 days later I get a response. The response is a link on joe to charge the flashlight. Pretty crappy for a battery to take a crap after 2 charges!
