I'm not one to normally write reviews but this pitcher is far from the aesthetically pleasing masterpiece that others seem to believe it is. First, contrary to the description at the top of the page -- "The Soma Pitcher is a beautiful glass pitcher," the pitcher is most definitely a plastic pitcher. To add to this, the product's lauded wooden handle has what appears to be wood glue stains at the connection point with the white plastic that connects it to the main body. I'm surprised that Amazon's normally great reviews have let a product that is clearly not going through rigorous quality control without more of an uproar.
