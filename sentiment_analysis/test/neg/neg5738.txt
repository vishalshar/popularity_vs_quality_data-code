I bought a Mevo to record shows while on the road in my car or out of the office; unfortunately I have had numerous interruptions with the live feed and can't seem to get the voice to sync with the video when streaming live or having a recorded show...even when I have a solid connection.  The battery life is short and the control application is a little difficult to use while live streaming and controlling the camera; making the shows look amateur at best.  I really thought I would be able to do more with the camera than static shows in my office (which I can record with my iPhone) but unfortunately it's turning into an expensive paper weight and I'm looking for a better solution.  I really wish I could just get my money back honestly.
