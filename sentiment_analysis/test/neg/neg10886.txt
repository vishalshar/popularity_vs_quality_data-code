Purchased for use on my Samsung Level U Pro. Started out well, but then they stretched out and now won't stay in place on the earbuds. They constantly slip off the edge of the earbuds and are absolutely useless after a couple of months. Constantly slips off the earbuds they're supposed to keep in place when you insert or remove them from your ears. There is no point to this purchase.
