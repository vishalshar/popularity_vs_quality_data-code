I don't see any way of adjusting the focus, everything is blurry (if I hold the Headset several inches away from my face, the image comes into focus.) If the focus was adjustable, it would probably work for me. Because my eyes are not equal, the eyepieces would need to be individually adjustable for me to use it.
