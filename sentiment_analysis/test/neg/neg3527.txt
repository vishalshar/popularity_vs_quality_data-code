Oh so cruel to market this as stand alone product and once you went thru hoops to set up only to find out you need a base which is sold separately. You don't want this happen on the morning of Christmas! I am so upset at this company misleading consumers! $50 for some pieces of plastics that's useless without base and had to watch your child disappointed is not any parents want at ANY PRICE.
