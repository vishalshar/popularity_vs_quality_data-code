All of the bags that I ordered arrived stale even though the best buy date was 2018. When I buy these at my local coffee shop, they are soft and fresh. These seems like they had been sitting on a shelf somewhere for quite a while. Hard and impossible to eat. The Coconut ones that I bought were absolutely fine. Not sure what happened here.
