Installed the fence and went great the first couple weeks. This collar was for a second dog.  One of the metal studs/prongs on the shock collar came un threaded and fell out somewhere in the yard. When I called Petsafe to ask about a replacement I was told by Rosey that this is a known issue and they sell replacement studs with washers in a kit but that I would need to pay for it even though I've had it only about a month. She informed me that the studs should be tightened every night to make sure they don't fall out. ???  Seems like a shotty design if I'm expected to tighten up two studs/nuts every day to make sure the collar don't fall apart. This is disappointing because their over the phone customer service is great and the fence was working very well until the collar fall apart. I'm thinking about trying some LocTight on the studs/prongs to prevent it from coming out.
