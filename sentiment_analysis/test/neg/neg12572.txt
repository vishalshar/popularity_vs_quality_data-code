Received these 5 hours ago.  Followed all the instructions in the videos on their website including the 2.2 update.  Left side stopped producing sound within 20 minutes. I proceeded to troubleshoot the issue for about an hour.  No luck.  I usually have a ton of patience when it comes to technical issue resolution.  Not this time.  If I'm spending $249, I should not have to waste time trying to fix something that should just work.The sound quality for the 20 minutes they worked was not bad.  I would have kept them if there were not issues.  As others have said, the BT connection is pretty bad.  It's true that I had to keep them in my right pocket.  When I walked however, the action of my right hand moving from front to back as I walked would kill the connection.The fit was exceptional.  These things aren't going anywhere once they're in your ear.  If only they would just work as they're supposed to.  Even if my pair is defective, I don't want to waste my time getting a 2nd, 3rd or 4th pair like others have had to do.Refund label is printed and these will be going back tomorrow for a refund.  So sad.
