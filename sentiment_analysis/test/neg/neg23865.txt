bought this in June and in November stopped working.  Set a note to support and they responded back with little to no help.....take the battery out and replace it.  I told them that I replaced it 3 times and the lights blink for about 30 seconds and it stops working.  Responded back to them and have not heard anything back.  Will buy the Garmin instead and this $100 device is a garbage to me at this point.
