I wanted to like this product. I really liked the hub-less idea. But, my user experience over the past 24 hours has been dismal. I'd recommend the old X10 stuff before I'd recommend this.The first thing you need to do is get these moved from their own little network into your home's network. To do this, you need to download their Android (or IOS) app.  The number of permissions that are requested by the app are stunning and disturbing. They attempt to justify them, but what really comes out after you look around a bit is that they are completely unfamiliar with Android development.Get comfortable with the innards of your phone, because never before have you had to become so accustomed to your phone's force-stop features. The app doesn't crash, per se, but it spends most of its time in a drugged-out haze trying to remember the state of the world, and the support documents recommend uninstalling, reinstalling, force-stopping, and all kinds of other indications of an app gone seriously, seriously, wrong.But at least at this point, you've got lights turning on and off.But it all gets so much worse once it asks for a firmware update. The devices ship with an ancient firmware, such that it appears to take multiple steps to get them up to the right levels.  And each of those levels is a nigh insurmountable task.  It starts easy enough: you just click the little upgrade button on the app.  That's when the blinking starts.The blinking, oh god, the blinking.  First it blinks blue. Then green? Or is that amber? Then it turns off. Then it is blue again. Then it is off.  Then it sits and blinks amber for hours.  The documentation tells you that this means that it is unable to connect to your network.  This is odd, since the on/off buttons still seem to function.  Until, they too stop responding.  And then they disappear from the network entirely.So you're left with the one thing you've been told to NEVER DO WHEN UPDATING FIRMWARE... you power cycle it.  And it comes back up, maybe.  Maybe you need to reset it. Maybe not.  But you *might* get it to show back up in the app, after force-closing and uninstalling and reinstalling it.  But you'll only discover that all those blinking lights were nothing by a lie, for it is still stuck at the original firmware version, the blinking lights now won't stop at all, and you're beginning to think that saving the boxes was a prescient move on your part.After hours of fidgeting with this, I'm left thinking that my time is not worth this, and these devices need to go, not back to the factory, but to some third-world electronics recycling fire, where at least the device's burning corpse will keep a poor family warm for the night.If they're able to sleep through all the blinking, that is.---Edit: After continued misery with tech support, they were returned today.  Just in case it will save you time when you have to call them, here's the script from the support people:1. What is the brand and model of wireless router?2. Did you reset the WEMO switches by holding the restore button for 15 seconds without the power and then plug in the WEMO switch and still holding the restore button for another 15 seconds?3. Have you tried using different handheld devices in running upgrade?4. How far are the WEMO switches from the router?5. Have you tried changing the wireless channels of your router and used 1, 3, 6, 9, 11?6. Did you clear cache or clear data on your Android smart device?7. Are you able to disable and enable remote access without any errors?8. Are the WEMO rules created being followed?After answering those questions, these came back:1. Please change the wireless channel of your router and used 1 or 9.2. Make sure the 2.4 Ghz SSID wireless name is not the same 5 Ghz SSID3. Check if the UPNP is enabled on your router.4. Ensure to disable IGMP, VLAN, VPN are other advanced security on the router.5. Port forward or port trigger ports on your router: 3475, 3478, 5228, 8080, and 8443.Nevermind that you can only forward one port to one switch...6. Disable/enable remote access on WEMO app.7. Disable mobile data and connect to 2.4 Ghz network and run firmware update.I don't even know what this means!8. Lastly, disable router firewall temporarily to allow firmware update of WEMO to go through.
