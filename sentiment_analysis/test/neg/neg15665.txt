I bought the Lumo Lift and have tried it for about 5 days. I like the concept. But the instructions and the reliability are not good. It syncs with your cell phone which is great but the sync is unreliable. For example, I wore the device about 10 hours yesterday but on the Lumo Lift tracker, it only showed one hour. It also appears to conflict with the Samsung S Health app and appears to have wiped out the past two years of workouts recorded on my Samsung phone. I probably will return the Lumo Lift if it doesn't get more reliable. I have two emails into customer service and have not received a response.
