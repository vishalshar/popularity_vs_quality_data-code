The hands are much darker gray than they appear on the website making the time difficult to read.  I had to constantly adjust the viewing angle so that the light reflected off the hands enough for me to see what time it was.  It was so annoying I returned the product almost immediately.  The product is otherwise of quality design and materials.  Set up was impressively easy.  While I did return the product, I immediately purchased Activite Pop, which I am hoping is easier to read.
