Dog ripped it off immediately, dog ripped it off the same day.Poor gps. It kept jumping around 50+ft on the map. If your dog DOES rip it off you might as well plan to spend the rest of the afternoon trying to find the tracker.If you do want to cancel, you can't cancel from the app or the website. You have to call, then go through a 30 minute phone call, wait for an email saying you've cancelled, and then when you get that email you have to confirm again that you have cancelled. They only send it once, and if you don't confirm you want to cancel then they keep charging even though they'll send you a survey later asking you why you cancelled.
