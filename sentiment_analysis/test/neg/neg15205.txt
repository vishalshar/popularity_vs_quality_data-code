Really liked this for a day or two, and I so wanted it to work as promised. The concept is great, but it seems IMHO to be a version 1.0 product. The day time images were clear but, as noted by others, not as clear at night, but OK for my purpose. The problem is that it worked for a couple of days then started losing internet connection (I have a strong 4 bar signal and other devices including a Samsung security camera, a Honeywell wifi thermostat, and Kasa internet outlets that are working just fine, all the time, absolutely no problems.)This is our vacation cabin, so we're not there to do the full re-installation that's necessary to re-connect to the internet every time it loses its connection. Yes, that's the solution, a full re-install, as in standing in front of the light with your phone or device. Tried to work with the Kuna to fix the problem, but email support is their only option and it is very sloooowwwwww... as in days to respond.My caution, wait to buy until they get it right, and if they do, it could be a great product... just not right now.Buzz------------------------------------------------------------------------------Today's (5/30/2016) Update.I heard back from Kuna after 3 days, very disappointing response time.Please note that as Laura recommends, the only solution is a total reset, in person. If you are buying this for a remote location as I did, please do not because if something happens (and it will) you have to be physically present to make it work.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Laura Edgar (Kuna)May 29, 21:07Hi,Jumping in for Brighid here - thank you for bringing this to our attention - and sorry about this offline issue! Please power cycle your Kuna (by turning the power to it off, waiting 10 seconds, and turning the power to it back on), and check the status LED.If the LED does not flash from red to green and then to solid blue after one minute, please take it through this setup process to reconnect it to your network.If you run into any error messages during the setup process, or if your status LED does not come on, or stays solid red or solid green, please let us know and we can walk you through the next steps!-LauraKuna Support
