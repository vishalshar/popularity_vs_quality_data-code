I'm just not impressed with this dock. Let me preface this by the fact that I do own several docks for various electronics. I will also add that I'm writing this from an iPhone perspective. This dock and pre-fabricated cables may work great for an Android owner.Pro: Dock is heavy and will definitely stay in place and not fall over.Cons: rubber/silicone dock cushions do not stay in place. I had to remove the factory installed ones and put on the thinner cushions to accommodate phones with cases. The cushions just did not feel secured when I put them in place and move around some.Cable adapter: I installed my certified Apple cable in to the docks. I placed the phones in place and then pulled one out to see how it worked. Much to my dismay, the cable pulled out of the dock a little. Maybe it was me? So, I took it all apart and re-installed the cable in the provided "clips". Pull the phone off the dock and  the cable follows the phone. Best part is my cable broke when this happened therefore costing me money because we know how much authentic Apple cables cost.Cables channels underneath: My cables kept coming out of the channel that they are supposed to be secured in. They just didn't stay in place and that wasn't cool.In the end, I'm sending this dock back because I don't like the way the cables are secured in the dock and the fact that the cushions are not secured on the dock. I have other docks that are far superior to this and I'm going to look at buying more of them for my family members.
