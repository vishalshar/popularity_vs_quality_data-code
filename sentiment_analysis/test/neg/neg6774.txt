I have a PetSafe under ground system and this should of worked but it did not. I thought maybe it just needed a battery because since my dog was in heat, then pregnant and then nursing puppies; I did not try it for months after I got it. But I changed the battery and still didn't work but by then I had it so long, I don't think I could of returned. Just sits in the draw. Needs to be thrown away.
