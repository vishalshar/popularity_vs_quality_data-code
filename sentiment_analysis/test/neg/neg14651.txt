Pkg. Arrived today, the sleeve containing the product clearly taped closed.  Glasses were inside the sleeve but out of their thin carry case, and scratched in numerous places.  Pkg advertises free replacements...fine, one more phone call to make then wait who knows how many days.  Nope, not to be.  The 844-484-4667 number on the package has a recording telling you they can't take your call at this time.  Yes, I tried several times.  Fooey on them!  All those positive reviews are meaningless when you're the one who gets damaged merchandise and they don't answer their published number.  Double fooey.  Out $20 and some time and frustration.  Shame on you thinoptics.
