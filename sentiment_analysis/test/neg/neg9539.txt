First i'm Coming from Logitech g502-Pros :good "basic" designBody Quality is niceCons:same scroll you find in 7$ micefrustrating and high right and left click soundhigh click latency 15 ms, compared to 0.9 ms in G502extremely over-pricedI'm returning this mouse, it's like when you buy 70$ mouse and you receive a polished 7$ mouse
