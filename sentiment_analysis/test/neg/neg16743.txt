Right, so, where to begin...I bought this phone as an alternative to my Samsung Note 3, who had to stay plugged in.It bought it, cleared off the unnecessary junk.Installed Google Now Launcher and everything was running smooth. If you tried to scroll through the apps too quickly, you'd see artifacts, but that didn't bother me. As previous users have commented, the GPS is junk. I don't know how many times I was driving on the interstate and it said I was on the frontage road next to me or a couple roads over in residential areas. I had an issue where I needed to wipe the phone.Then came the troubles. I turned the phone on after it randomly. When I booted, I only got to the Posh logo. No further. So I attempted a restore. Little did I know, Posh does not have a recovery partition. If you try to recover, you aren't getting a *clean* system install. It simply wipes the device and restarts.Did I mention this all happened within the first week? Posh via email were no help. They never responded. I couldn't find anything online as the device has such a small market that I simply had Amazon replace it.This one worked out fine for a month. Then the trouble came. I was awaiting a phone call but I needed to mow with the riding lawnmower.Having had a phone fall out of my pocket randomly and running it over, I put the phone in a ziplock, placed it in my waistband of my loose shorts, just so I could feel that phone call. Done it before many times.zI get off the lawnmower, head inside, set my phone down and as it touches the glass counter, I know something isn't right. It feels... different.Ends up, my phone is now slightly twisted. Visible from the screen by a couple of pressure marks thanks to the twist, battery cover won't clip in one place and only one place. Amazon said they'd replace it, but I fear due to the twist, I wouldn't get my money back anyway.Just remember, this phone is this price because it has a plastic frame and body, and the screen isn't Gorilla Glass. Taking off the battery and checking around, I don't think there is much if any of an metal frame.Update: 2/11/2016 - I still have the phone, still twisted, yet it now sits in my useless device graveyard. Amazon did allow me to return it, but like I said before, I don't think they'd take it due to the unlevelness from however it happened, so I didn't pursue it.A few new things to mention. POSH is a chinese company. Say you have a question about one of their devices. Send an email to their support email and you won't hear anything back. Complain about a phone and tell them to support their warranty, they won't email you back. Trust me, I've tried. So that leaves you with two options.Complain to Amazon and HOPE they will be lenient and support you, or take the risk of sending in the phone via their RMA link, while keeping  in mind that they don't open their emails, what makes you think they'll be prompt with your device...
