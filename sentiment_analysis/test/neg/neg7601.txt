It's clunky and oversized for its purpose and feels cheap and inefficient. I've tried a number of mounts and the best ones use metal in the clamp, thinner and more rigid plastic for the clips, and better button release designs. This product only saving grace is the detachable chassis but what remains is still quite unfortunately large.
