Revised review: Gatekeeper is still highly unreliable with new firmware, but finally survives a lid close. Locked while I typed this review!It will lock up four inches from the dongle, yet not lock from across a large building.  It will lock while you are actively working, with the dongle inches away. And that's with the distance setting two notches less secure!See the photo.  I was typing on my laptop in bed, with my Gatekeeper on the bed next to me. In the pho <AT THIS POINT BANG, IT LOCKS UP!> Yes, while telling you about it locking up yesterday, it locked up again today!Like yesterday, while typing THIS REVIEW, with the GateKeeper right next to the dongle on the bed, it suddenly locked while I was typing. See the photo. That's just now.  The GateKeeper is with my badge on the left, and the dongle is in my laptop on the right. Is the setting too tight? No, it's two clicks less secure than default, for this exact reason. So, with this setting, I can walk all the way across a large office building and it does not lock, but as you can see, it locks a few inches away at home.And that's in addition to the fatal bug it shipped with, where it would permanently freeze when the laptop went to sleep. That shows how poor the beta testing was.How can you trust a security product that was this poorly tested? Will a computer virus be able to scan your USB ports, find the GateKeeper, and get your password? I just don't trust it.
