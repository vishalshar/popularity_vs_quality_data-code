It's a waste of money. My basil grew to the top and got burned by the light. the light doesn't go higher, which defeats the purpose of having an indoor garden. my basil are dying slowly because the light wont let them grow any higher. I am amazed by their display photo because my basil looks nothing like that. I will add photos.
