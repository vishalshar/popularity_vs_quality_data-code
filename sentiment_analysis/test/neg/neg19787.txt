Ugh! This was a gift, and while the flavors were okay, every single jar contained semi solid stuck granule powdery crystals. We could not shake it out. We had to take a knife and breakup the solids within the jars.  Clearly the jars got humidity in them at the warehouse or in transit or were old. Even the free packets once opened began to harden as well. It was insane. Many of the seasoning also cause coughing. once we got them somewhat back to their powdery states and began to sprinkle and use.  We have puchased the large size Nacho at our local Safeway and never had this problem  Will not purchase again nor recommend.
