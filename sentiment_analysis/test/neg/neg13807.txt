Unit was still paired to the previous owner's account, so I couldn't link it to mine. After a phone call, then being called back, I found out that, in order to bypass this, you have to send an email to the support team, verifying proof of purchase for security reasons. I was told that the proof could be a picture or screenshot of the order or receipt. I asked the turnaround time for this kind of thing, and was told that the request goes to a 2nd level support team and they have usually a lot of requests to fulfill (which wasn't very comforting). I was contacted very quickly after verifying purchase and the issue was resolved. I linked it up and wasn't really blown away by the product. It may have been my connection, but the screen was very blocky and, most of the time, I couldn't even tell what I was looking at. Also, the laser pointer was jumping all over the place and pretty laggy. That may not be a consistent performance, but that was my experience, so I ended up returning the unit. It's a great idea, I think, but I just had a very unimpressive experience. Maybe I'll check back for future versions, if the product sticks around.
