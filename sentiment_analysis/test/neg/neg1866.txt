This product isn't what I thought it would be. The jack for charging my laptop doesn't work with my iMac charger port but it is still useful for when I need to plug in a flash drive or use a wireless mouse. it's just unfortunate I cannot charge my laptop when I'm using this device...Broke less than week after buy. I paid good money hoping  it would last but now I have to fiddle with it just to get it to work. it's so annoying.
