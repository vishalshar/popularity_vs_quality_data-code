Made the move to "Posh" because my Blu Studio II 7.0 decided after 6 1/2 months it no longer wanted to power up. Well it did power up but the screen stayed black. Under warranty but never got around sending a .PDF of the receipt. Whatever... Firstly, didn't see the same benchmarks as another person stating as fast as an iPhone 6. Didn't rate as fast as an iPhone 5. Wasn't a deal breaker. It is light and slimmer than the Blu. While the description says it only compatible with 32GB microSD, started with 64 and moved to 128Gb. Both are seen and can move files. For how long I dunno but "very happy." plus plus the device isn't locked down to the point of not being able to move apps. My only quibble is the 1GB Ram, the phoneblet :) still works. Haven't used it to make calls - MetroPCS. 4G and LTE are much much faster than the previous Blu. Impressed. Install Epic Citadel and can run. One other thing, resolution was kind of wourshed out. My fix was to use ADW Launcher with Ubuntu theme. Clears up graphics. Doesn't appear Posh is going to update to Marshmallow and their website only lists a modded version of Lollipop. Overall very hsppy for now. Hopefully it will last longer than Blu - for me. 12-10-16 update... Left the above yada yada yada up "just because." The device (mine) is a glorified piece of junk. Sorry Posh Folks, it's true IMO. Noticed over a course of a few weeks that it was becoming progressively slower and slowwwwwer. Wasn't certain whether app updates did it and was too lazy to confirm. Chrome = Not responding OK or Wait. Actually, all apps received the dreaded "Not responding." Thankfully the Posh was to be used as a commute by train, possible backup phone device. Nixed it and went with an iPad Pro 12.9 with cellular and couldn't be happier. Minus the inability to make calls. Well, there are apps for that as well as FaceTime. Sooo, the Posh has been relegated as an XBMC remote and other. My guess is the low RAM certainly was playing a part. Could be wrong and so over trying to confirm.
