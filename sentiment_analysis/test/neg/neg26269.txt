Very effective for still-life and nature (or well-lit constant light studio) photography.  If you can control the light the options are endless.  This is a great toy but owners cannot do any true editing - you can add effects but you cannot correct for exposure, color, noise or any other standard editing features.If you love to play with technology and take the time to set up the perfect hobby photo (lighting, props etc) this toy will make you smile.  I enjoyed the first 30 minutes of playing with the device, and I really enjoyed setting up a photo shoot using constant lights but if you have a desire to put this device in your purse and capture life with it you will be greatly disappointed.  Your camera will give you better images.  I did not try to print anything but even on the screen I ended up disliking all but 1 or 2 images per outing (as far as sharing quality).  The only 1 (out of a couple hundred) images I loves was one I set up in the bright sun...the images look great with perfect lighting...how often do we have perfect light for our photos?I highly recommend the device if you have an extra $400 and love playing around with taking photos you will have fun playing with it.  It is perfect for hobby and food photography.  Capturing a kid playing in the park or in the home...not so much.
