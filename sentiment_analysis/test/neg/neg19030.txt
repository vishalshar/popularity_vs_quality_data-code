Sleek look and seems to be accurate. However, it does not stay connected to the wifi. The scale connects at first but quickly loses connection and there is nothing you can do about it. This was my second scale after retiring the first one for a faulty low battery message and the same wifi errors. I did one available firmware update but there haven't been anymore.Such a disappointment because the blood pressure monitor works great and the scale looks nice. It just doesn't work.
