I loved the product at first but after using it 5 times the Qlipp sensor no longer connects. Unfortunately it seems as though the button on the sensor is stuck pushed in and will no longer connect. There does not seem to be any warranty or customer support for the item so once it stops working it really is a waste of money. Be careful before making a purchase!
