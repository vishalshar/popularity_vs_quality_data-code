Never fruited never died. Received middle of March, through out when I moved the end of July.  Tried both sides of the box with no avail. All directions were followed then in third and forth months some experimenting. I have 50+ house plants the oldest is over twenty years old. I can grow and clone almost any plant but this mushroom kit beat me.Original Review:15 days no growth.Mycelium still alive but no evidence of change/growth since receipt.  Will continue to mist until obviously dead or mushrooms fruit.As noted on website packaging and material may very,  there is what "appears" to be birdseed in with coffee grounds.
