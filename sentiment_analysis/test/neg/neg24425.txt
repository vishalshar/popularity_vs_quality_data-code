I was excited to get this product on special, but only after I paid for a year of tracking did I discover that the Tagg GPS collar doesn't actually work for pet recovery. For some reason they think that a 3 minute update interval is sufficient for catching up to a lost pet on the move. A dog can get half a mile or more in 3 minutes, leaving a desperate owner little to no hope of recovering their family member. What were they thinking?
