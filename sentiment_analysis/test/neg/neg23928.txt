Not for regular tennis balls. These balls are much smaller. I was hoping to buy tennis balls as needed. Also, it shoots the small balls out so fast my dog which is a good tennis ball fetcher, can't see them as they zip by him, because the balls are faster and smaller. Balls are about the size of a golf ball.
