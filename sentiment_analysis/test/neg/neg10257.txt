Good triggers. they do not work well with battlefield 1 ( modification needed). The game has progressive triggers for firing guns.(different pressures for different types of weapons) I had to trim some of the stops off to get them to work with the rifles and pistols sniper rifles do not currently work I may need to trim off more of the stop. these would sweet if there could be made adjustable.Update 12/1/16  the right trigger falls off a lot the plastic is too thin. I do feel this product is way overpriced for whar you get.
