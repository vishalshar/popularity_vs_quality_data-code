At first I put them on my glove three times because the first try it didn't work got sticky for 10 seconds then it stop. Then I took my gloves home to wash because I thought maybe cause my gloves where dirty. I put some again it got stick for 10 seconds again and then loses grip again. Very Disappointed on this product I guess I have to to buy new gloves now!
