I really wanted this to work. The idea is great! The deign is great! But the electronics don't work. Maybe I should say they didn't work for me on my phone (Verizon Samsung Galaxy S4). It seemed to work a little bit for the first three days then it completely stopped working. I was still testing it and trying to get familiar with it at that point.  On the fifth day I ran a test to see if it could find my keys. I put my keys two feet away. I could reach them with my hand. Then I asked Item Finder to find them. It said my keys were "out of range".  Then I ran a second test. I used the Item Finder attached to my keys and asked it to find my phone. It couldn't do that. Again the phone was two feet away.  I don't know what went wrong. Maybe the battery burned out after three days. Maybe I set things up incorrectly. But I don't have time to try to figure it out.  I am returning this product to Amazon.
