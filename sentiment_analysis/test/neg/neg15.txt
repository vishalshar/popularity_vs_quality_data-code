Updated - 08/15/2016: I went to use the thing today and found that my smart phone had automatically updated to a newer version of the software. The new app is horrible. I had to log on with a username and password (WHY?) to use a camera attached to my phone. It was a very simple app and now it's needlessly complex. In addition to the needless login, it's bloated out with a useless "home page" that seems to only serve to advertise the company. Rather than focus on improving the quality of the images, they have focused on collecting user information via a login and self-promoting their products. I have removed one star from my review due to this app update, and after seeing the direction the company is taking, I can no longer recommend this product. Had I to do it over again, I would have bought the FLIR instead and added an aftermarket lens for closeup work.Original review:I bought this thermal imager for a variety of purposes, including imaging electronic components on circuit boards. For someone considering this camera, the first thing I would suggest is to visit the Thermal Imaging forum over at eevblog. There's a ton of information about various imagers from different manufacturers. I considered both the Seek and the FLIR imagers for my iphone device. I ended up choosing the Seek because I liked the idea of an adjustable focus. Sometimes when I'm imaging electronic components, I like to get close, and being able to focus at a close distance is an advantage. Note that Seek also offers an extended range version, which will give you better performance at distance at the cost of worse performance at close range. The FLIR is considered by many to offer better image quality, even with reduced pixel count.Also note that you can choose either Android or iPhone/iPad operation. I chose the Apple version as I'm an Apple user rather than an Android user. In some ways I regret this decision, as the Android version can be connected via USB to a windows PC and thirdy party software can be used that generates better image quality than Seek's software.If your iDevice is in a case that has any thickness to it whatsoever, then you'll either have to remove your device from its case, or buy a lightning extender to extent the lightning port down a little lower. Amazon has lightning extenders from a variety of vendors. I'm using this camera in an otterbox case with an extender.Generally I've found the device to be quite handy. I've used it for checking electrical components, checking heating/cooling around the home, even looking at cylinder temperatures in an airplane. You may see claims that you can use it to diagnose plumbing leaks and/or see pipes inside of walls. I think those claims are a little exaggerated. I wouldn't expect to see anything but the most egregious leak, and while I can easily see exposed pipes, I can't see pipes inside the wall.
