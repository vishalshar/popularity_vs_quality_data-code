This is the worst review I've ever written for anything I've purchased thus far on Amazon, but sadly this camera earns it. I got super excited a few years ago when these were announced, and once the price dropped I eagerly bought one. As soon as I opened the box, I was disappointed. Instead of the Graphite grey I'd ordered, it was some sort of magenta or hot pink, which I didn't remember seeing as a color option. Ok, so it wouldn't get stolen by any thief with a shred of self-respect. I went through the contents of the box, and the cleaning cloth was missing. That's also disappointing, because I had recently lost mine. Never mind, let's go try out the camera, which was mostly charged and ready to go. I spent two days shooting and getting used to the form factor and functions of the camera. All in all, it's an interesting design, but far too slippery on the body, the hand naturally loses traction on the non-rubberized surface; the lens cap practically jumps off of its own accord; the power button always escaped my searching finger, so I had to flip the camera over to locate it and turn it off every time; and once I got the required desktop software downloaded, the final affront, I could never, ever get my computer to recognize the camera, and thus was unable to access the pictures. I tried different USB cords. I tried different versions of the software. I updated my USB drivers. My computer meets or exceeds all the hardware specs.  I did everything I and my two friends could come up with. I scoured forums for help. No luck. It is with a heavy heart that I return my first foray into the world of light field photography, sorely let down and wondering how any of my pictures turned out. I haven't been this bummed about a product in a long, long time. Perhaps in a few years, when they release an updated model that doesn't have internal memory storage as the only option, I might give this intriguing technology another try. Right now, I'm sticking with my tried-and-true DSLR.
