I just bought two of them and have programmed one and signed up for service, but I haven't attached it to the dog's collar yet. I got a message alert that she left the boundary area tonight, then returned in about 20 minutes, then left again and returned. The only problem is that the device is still sitting here in my office and hasn't been moved in two days. I just now attached it to the docking station to charge it, wondering if that was the issue. It correctly messaged me that her tracker is now attached to its docking station.I really like the interface and the messaging capability. I really want this to work, but what it did tonight doesn't inspire confidence. I guess we'll see.
