Try as I might, I just can't get these adjusted comfortably. I carefully watched all the videos on the Hickies website for the different ways to adjust them for differing levels of tightness, and tried several methods. I even tried mixing the tighter, medium, and looser methods to give more snugness through the forefoot and less over my high instep. But they're still too loose through the forefoot and too tight over the instep. I just don't think this type of fixed-length elastic lace works for feet like mine. Instead I bought the Bodi Hut elastic quick laces, and they work much better. Might work ok for other types of feet.
