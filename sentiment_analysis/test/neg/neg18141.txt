Wear a size 9 shoe, ordered the medium.  The material is nice, soft, I'd say medium weight - the gold toe black over the calfs are thicker, but I don't always want such a thick sock.  The foot area for these fit well, but the calf area is extremely tight - they feel like compression socks.  Definitely tighter than the gold toes.  Unlike most of these reviews, I did NOT receive these for a discount and review, although I wish I did :).
