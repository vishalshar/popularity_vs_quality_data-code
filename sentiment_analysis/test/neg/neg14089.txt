This does NOT work with Dr Brown 4 ounce plastic bottles (the opening is too large for them).  Also, it's pretty heavy.  The Dr Brown 8 ounce bottles are a bit wider and could work, but the large bottle and heavy plastic tool are too cumbersome for our 7-month old.  She plays with it, but can't hold the bottle in her mouth with all that extra weight.
