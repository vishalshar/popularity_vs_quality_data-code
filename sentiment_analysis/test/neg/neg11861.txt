This device simply does not work.  I fast for various periods of time every single day and no matter what was happening this device seemed to want to report the opposite.  If I would fast 20 hours, around noon 300 calories would pop up.  I would say, I didn't eat, but at the end of that period it still showed that I ate something when nothing but water went in my mouth.  On days when I ate about 2000 calories, it would only catch about half of them despite me hitting the button to report a meal.  It's a great idea, but the technology is simply not capable of this at this time.
