I returned this product after one day.I bought this speaker to play Pandora over wi-fi. However, even after several hours of trying I could not do this. I could play the Pandora on the speaker via blue tooth on my phone but the sound would often skip a beat.  The instructions on the Libratone site was not helpful and none were included with the product.  The sound was also not as good as expected based on the other people's reviews. I heard Sonos speakers from my friend's house and those speakers sounded better and seemed much easier to set up.This is the first product that I gave 1 star in my product reviews.If you are good at electronics I am sure you can set this speaker up no problems. But for tech dummies like me, stay away from this crap.
