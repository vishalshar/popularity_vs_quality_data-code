Major problem: 2 words "HomeKit Emabled". This lock IS NOT HomeKit enabled.  On my iPhone 6s+ on iOS 10.0.1 i receive the error "Not Supported. This accessory requires a firmware update before it can be used in the Home app. Try updating it using the manufacturer's app." Do not sell a product touting its ability to interact with HomeKit when it cannot. I even spoke to a customer service agent and explained exactly what i was attempting to setup and how (i.e. HomeKit integration) and he made no mention of any of this. After receiving the above referenced error, I attempted to contact customer support again at August. The first call I held for 67 minutes and the line went dead. Then i called back and requested the automated call back option, which I chose. The call back i received was an answering machine asking me to leave a message. I have since sent an email to August requesting a release date for the firmware update.  If I do not receive an acceptable response w/in a day or two, I am returning tis as I consider the item misleading. As an established smart device manufacturer with tight integrations w/Apple products and software, this update should have been pushed out already.
