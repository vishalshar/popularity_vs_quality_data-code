Here is a summary of the trials I have gone through with this device:1) I could not get it to stay paired with my iPhone. Customer support's suggestion was to take out the batteries and put them back in when it failed to sync. This worked every time but come to find out...2) The batteries died after less than 3 months. When I contacted customer support, they said that the fact that I had to take out and put back in the batteries indicated that the device was defective (thanks for letting me know earlier) and I needed to send it back.3) They sent me a replacement. The replacement will not correctly update itself so that I can use the swim tracking that I purchased for $10 last month (and the main reason I was happy with the tracker to begin with). The new device continually prompted me to unpair and repair it to my phone's Bluetooth with zero success.4) Finally, after an e-mail from customer support asked me to screenshot the issues I was having and send it to them, in trying to load the batteries into the device this morning, there is now a battery lodged sideways in the device and I cannot get it out. I give up. The hardware, the software, the customer support, are all sub-par. I really wish this had been a better purchase.
