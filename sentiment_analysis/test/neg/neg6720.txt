Perhaps it was my phone but the most frustrating thing I found about this item was the fact that to use it as I would like, I had to be connected to the internet constantly.  Not having a data plan brought the use of the Honey to an end quickly.  Also, I noticed that trying to use this as a tracking device for my pets would have been impossible since they'd be on the move if lost.  I placed the Honey on my kitchen table and then proceeded to go outside and "act" as if I was searching.  I fully believe that if I had not known the device was in the house, I would have walked miles simply trying to find out if I was getting closer or further and determining the direction I needed to go.  It might be good for looking for your keys but I can't think of another purpose worth the trouble.  Let me say one thing positive....the customer support was good.  They seemed genuinely interested.
