I purchased this gun safe despite mixed reviews I read online.  I really, really wanted to love it based on the online videos, the sleek look, and the wonderful features.  When I received the safe I quickly plugged it in and programmed it.  It took multiple tries to capture my fingerprint but finally got it.  It seemed to be hit or miss whenever I tried to open the safe and at this point I have given up.  If I had to open this safe in an emergency I just couldn't rely upon it.  I was happy to pay the premium price for this safe because it looked so great, but I just can't jeopardize safety.  I need a gun safe that opens fast the first time, every time.
