I received my Sense Pill today and tried to plug in the USB however it doesn't fit and it appears to be because of the shape around the USB. Seems to be a a MAJOR DESIGN flaw. So I tried one of my own USB cables which did fit but then it was never able to PAIR the device. it only flashed green. I am returning for a replacement.
