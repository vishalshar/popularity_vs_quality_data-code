My biggest issue is the knob for the crown. No matter how I adjust the case the knob will not spin the crown. Then when make it too tight the watch opens the apps. Another issue if you wear it on the left wrist, every time you bend your and back to do something it pushes the knob in. I literally had it on for an hour or two and took it off. It will not be going back on. Save your money
