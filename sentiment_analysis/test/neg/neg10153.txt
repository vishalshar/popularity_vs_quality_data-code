I was NOT taking the suggested dosage but chewing 2 with breakfast, I immediately felt ill and got terrible heartburn. I narrowed it down to these vitamins, but not wanting to give up on them, I tried chewing just 1, on an empty stomach, with a full meal, with hot tea, with cold juice - nothing changed. I take other vitamins with no problems, I don't know which ingredient my stomach hates, but my system just can NOT tolerate these at all, not even at lowest dosage. Don't know what to do with the half bottle, I won't give to anyone I care for in case they have the same reaction!
