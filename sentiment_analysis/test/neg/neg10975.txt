I purchased one of these when they very first came out, they were the worst fitness trackers I ever had. But it's been some time and I seen that they came out with this one. Cool. It's not expensive so I thought I would give it another try. I wish I didn't bother.Right out of the box the charging cable is busted. And the packaging is pretty good so it had to have been broken when they packed it.Terrible product. A company who sends out broken products is not worth buying anything from. I'm not even going to bother wasting more of my time trying to get a refund or a replacement.
