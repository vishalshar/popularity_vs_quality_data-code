As others have said, at that price, you'd want a device that's not easy to lose. It's not the case with the Misfit Shine 2.It fell off my wrist on day 3 or so, but luckily I found it the following day, so now I can return it.It term of functionality, I like that it groups activity by intensity.Sleep tracking is fun and seems accurate.I wish it supported more gestures than a triple tap.Single tap and double seem to handle both time and progress, so only triple tap is customizable.Going to give the Moov Now a shot.
