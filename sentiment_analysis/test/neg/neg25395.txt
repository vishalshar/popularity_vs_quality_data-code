They fall apart too easily.  There were so many times I pulled a club only to find the tag missing or broken with the important part in the bottom of my bag.  They are not designed well enough to sustain the realistic use and its not like I go golfing all the time, perhaps every other week in the summer.  The process of tapping on your phone is also kind of cumbersome and I never really developed a process for it.  I was not loving having my phone in my front pocket all the time.  I really like the concept that they are trying to achieve with this product and the GolfPad app is great.  Unfortunately they fell short in the actual delivery of their concept.  Hopefully they can go back to the drawing board and resolve the shortcomings. Until then, go ahead and pass for now.
