I kept it on my keychain.  The lightning connector broke off in my friend's phone.  He had to get it out with his teeth.Update: Nomad replaced it under warranty.  Now, after a few more months, it's wonky and intermittent and only charges if you hold it just right.  It's a shame; I was really hoping it'd be better.
