Tracker arrived, I charged it up, and it would never turn on.  I am an electronics geek so this is not due to a user error.  The tracker is made of cheap material.  I am returning, and am not sure if I will try another GoBe.  I may just wait for Apple to add the calorie and blood pressure features to their watch.
