1. Do not purchase this if you have a heart condition, high blood pressure etc.2. In the video they show a person walking and opening the front door with the "auto-unlock" feature.  What they don't say is you need to be walking because it takes a few minutes after you arrive at your house in the car for the auto-unlock to engage and that works less than half of the time.  I have literally been inside my house for 5 minutes after locking the door manually only to hear it "auto-unlocking".3. Do not throw good money after bad.  I made the mistake of purchasing the keypad and the  2 aaa batteries that it uses works for 7-10 days at best.  I got the keypad due too the auto-unlock feature not working properly and I didn't want to have to pull out my cell phone to unlock my door. The sad thing is that I had a keypad entry for 10 years and it did not give me 1 problem in all of that time.4. It likes to do software upgrades when you are standing outside with both hands full of groceries.  I am not sure how it knows that but it does.  You are not allowed to do anything while it is upgrading.  That has happened to me 3 times in the 3 months I have had this lock.  It happened tonight and I almost blew a fuse.5. The help section on their site leaves much to be desired. They have another product called "Connect" that is Wifi and if you search their help section for messages that your cell phone displays like "unable to connect to the smart lock" etc., etc.  Imagine the amount of messages that might come up with the word connect in it. All of the first entries under troubleshooting are talking about their connect device.  Here is the help they provide "Personal entry codes for your August Smart Keypad can be created, modified, and deleted from anywhere. Creating, modifying, and deleting entry codes remotely requires an August Connect or an August Doorbell Cam, and the most recent version of the August Home app.Without an August Connect or Doorbell Cam, personal entry codes can only be created when you are connected to your August Smart Lock via bluetooth."It's like you are drowning and they are describing the water.  "young lungs are filling up"  "soon you will lose consciousness".I could go on and on here but it would be like beating a dead horse.  It is sad that they are unable to put a product like this up for sale when it clearly is not ready for the consumer.  I say sad but it should be criminal.  Not only is it theft of your money because they don't even come close to providing what they promise but it's theft of your time and I bet it's safe to say that the majority of the people buying this have some nerd or tech background as do I.Long story short, if anyone is considering filing a class action lawsuit against this company please let me know and I will help to initiate it.  I am shocked that there has not been one yet.  I have searched google at least a half a dozen times for "class action" "august smart lock".The good reviews have to be coming from people that just got the lock and are excited about the technology.  I wish they would come back and update their feedback.I spend thousands a year on tech related items and this is by far the worst product I have seen.
