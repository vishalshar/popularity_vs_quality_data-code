Small it too small and the big seems as if it will be too big and there is no medium. Does NOT include the game license which must be purchased for the PC (not tablet/phone) separately. It pinched my kid's arm soo bad it left a blood blister. It will NOT run on Ubuntu correctly even though it is advertised to do so (tested with Win 7 and it works fine).I've contacted the manufacturer twice, once about the Linux issue and once about the blood blister. Haven't heard back. Customer service and support is LACKING.If you already have a PC minecraft license and the size thing works out for you, this might be a better deal for you than me. And at that, i would buy from a local store so i could try the small and large on and then return if it doesn't work as you expect.
