Worked for about 14 months until I changed mobile providers and changed my mobile phone number. According to Roost tech support, there is no way to change the phone number with my Roost account. Thus, I needed to set-up a new account with my new phone number. However, I have been unable to add the batteries to the new account. I have removed the Roost batteries from the smoke alarms and have deleted the Roost app from my phone.
