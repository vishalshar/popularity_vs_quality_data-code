Convenient, but the price you pay for it slow charging.  I had plugged my iPhone 6 plus at 22% charge through the NomadKey to my laptop and even after 90 mins of undisturbed charging, it only got to 48%...which is miserable..So for convenience it's a nice to have design, but practically, if its going to take that long to charge, it's not worth.
