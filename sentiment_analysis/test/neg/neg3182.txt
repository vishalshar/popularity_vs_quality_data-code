Had for three months now - replaced batteries TWICELike these ... however, battery life is poor.  Have to replace battery about every two months or so ... works as expected.Disappointed in battery life on all three items.  No warning that they are dying .... Would be nice if XY software for Droid would be able to notify that batteries need replacing or going low.The costs of batteries will make this very expensive to use.When attached to keys, GPS is not 100 percent accurate ... WORSE ... when trying to find in a room (living room, kitchen) the sound is VERY LOW - hard to hear unless you are right on top of them.Tried by placing one in glove box of car to see if it could help find the row my car was in.  Then tried to find my car in parking lot - NOT ... didn't find ... or even give me a close proximity to find.I don't recommend at this time .... perhaps it will work in time ... POOR battery life ... POOR soundGood concept ... poor battery life
