When I first received these re-zip reusable lunch bags (sandwich size) in August 2015 I loved them! They were simple and worked well! Just last month (January 2016) these bags suddenly became difficult to zip shut. I have only ever hand washed them, NEVER put them in the dishwasher. I want to patronize companies whose products are environmentally friendly and economical, but this is very frustrating that theses don't really work anymore. They don't looked warped, in fact, they still look like they did when they were new. I don't understand why they are practically impossible to zip now. I was just getting ready to buy the gallon size of these bags, but now I don't want to. And now it seems I'm just waiting around for the snack bag size that I bought of these to do the same thing.
