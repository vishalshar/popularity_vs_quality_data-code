has a lot of features, but with my wifi hotspot I get good connection on my Ipad and Macbook, but really poor quality on the Posh...unless the wifi signal is 3-4 bars, phone quality is pretty poor.Update - well, used it a grand total of five minutes, and the phone quit. Plugging in the charger a screen with an empty battery and a lightening bolt show, no charging, won't fire up, nothing, so basically dead after a few minutes use. It's a cute phone but never charged correctly even new. I'd pass on it.
