I've now owned the case for 10 months. At first I LOVED it. Loved the look and the functionality. Unfortunately, 10 months later, it's broken. The edge of the case is no longer attached, and some chargers no longer work when the case is on. This is just normal wear-and-tear. I would expect it to last for at least one year
