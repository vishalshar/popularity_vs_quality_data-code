I want to love this case so bad.  It's like a BMW... when it is brand new it is the best case EVER, but it quickly falls apart leaving you with nothing but headaches.  If I could find a suitable replacement, I would purchase it, but here I am about to purchase my THIRD case for for the same phone.  At about $40 a pop... do the math.
