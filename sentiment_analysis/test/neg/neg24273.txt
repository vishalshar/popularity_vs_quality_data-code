If I could rate a zero I would. I decided to give this thing a try despite the other reviews. It would fly for a half a second and then plummet to the ground. Half the time the app would crash. The top part was just too heavy for a paper airplane. I even tried to fix it by tape and glue. Neither worked. My dad (who I bought the gift for) is a mechanical engineer and even he couldn't get it to work. I repeat. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's extremely generous that this plane has an average of three stars, it should be in the negatives.
