I really really wanted to like this thing.  It looks elegant and doesn't look like a fitness tracker (and who wants to wear an ugly plastic bracelet?)  I had a Fitbit Flex before that, and I liked the idea of tracking my motion but I hated how ugly it was.  I wanted something that looked good, and I needed a new watch anyway, so this thing seemed to be the perfect solution.  I'm not a big athlete, so I didn't need anything too sophisticated - just something to track my steps and sleep.Only one little problem - it doesn't actually work as a step-tracker.  Compared to my iPhone, it was undercounting my steps by about half.  And I didn't have my iPhone on me 24/7, and the watch was on me 24/7.  According to my Fitbit, I usually log about 150-200 steps at night going back and forth to feed my baby.  The Withings watch did not pick up any steps at all during the night.  I tried putting it on and walking 10 steps - nothing.  I tried putting it on and walking 50 steps - it picked up 21.  And I was careful to swing my arm the way I normally do - it's not like I was carrying a package or something.I will give it that - it was actually fairly good at tracking my sleep.  I wake up multiple times a night for my baby, and it registered every single one of the wakeups.  The Fitbit Flex wasn't actually as accurate at sleep-tracking.But considering how useless it is as a pedometer, I am returning it.  There are better uses for $150.
