It sticks to the counter when you set it down but doesn't stick to the wall unless you clean it every day. Hasn't turned out to be that useful and is sort of annoying. I keep hoping I will find a great use for it, but I don't stick it to the wall because it has fallen off a couple of times. So now I'm nervous about it. Probably should have sent it back.
