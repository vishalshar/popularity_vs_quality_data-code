Wish there was a 0 stars option. By far the most useless piece of crap I have ever had the misfortune of not only coming into contact with but also wasting money on. I was wondering why there were so many mixed reviews and it's because when you are trying it out it and testing it the day it delivers it works as advertised but as soon as your Bluetooth is off and the app is closed (you know like any real situation where it would actually be useful) your phone loses connection to it so when you try to find it by turning on your Bluetooth and tile app it will not be able to connect with the tile until the next time connect to your phone via the tile. Essentially rendering the tile 100% useless you plan on leaving your Bluetooth on and your tile app open 100% of the time. I'm assuming there's something i don't know yet given the fact that they are still in business but whether or not that's true one thing is definitely true it definitely doesn't consistently work as advertised. My theory is that maybe a little more than half of them function properly and the rest are like my case but whatever the case, based on my personal experience, I can't in all good conscience reccomend this product.
