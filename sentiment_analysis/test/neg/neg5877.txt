In theory this device is great.  The issue I found, as a bogey golfer, is that if you venture into an adjoining fairway, it too often starts posting strokes against that hole, and then is forever lost.The other fundamental flaw in the logic is that you often use clubs for other than their desired distance.  If you use a 5 iron to stay below branches, you use a 7 iron to chip onto the green and run it to the hole, etc.  These then corrupt the data for that club.
