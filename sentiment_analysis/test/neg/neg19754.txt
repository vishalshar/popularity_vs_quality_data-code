I was so hyped for these.i got them at 10, let them charge for 4 hrs and then tried to use them, plugged in for an update( a very convoluted, not well thought out process, that includes them disconnecting over and over again and having to use a freaking paperclip to reset them over and over. There's too much room for error and it needs to be simplified.) Well after i tried to update them, they wouldnt do anything, at all, sending them back less than 6 hrs after they arrived at my door, i had such high hopes for this product, sorry bragi, im done with these
