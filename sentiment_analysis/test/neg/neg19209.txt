I bought this without reading ingredients because I couldn't find any pill safe for pregnancy to help with constipation however this was made for pregnant women so I assumed safe .  But it contains inulin which I was trying to avoid - inulin such as chicory root causes miscarriage and FDA says avoid inulin because side effects on pregnancy are unknown.  It seems like none of these reviewers are actually pregnant while taking  and most got it free from some panel. I already ate one before reading but probably won't eat another to be safe. Only 28 chews, kind of expensive.
