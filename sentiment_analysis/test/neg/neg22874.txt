Pretty terrible sound from the beginning but the color suited my bike so I kept it. No one, I mean NO ONE moved out of the way from hearing this bell. Now four months later (out of the return period) and it doesn't work at all, not even a 'ting'. Nothing. I don't think I'll ever buy a bell again without testing it out first.
