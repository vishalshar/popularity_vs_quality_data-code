Sorry, but I have to go below "it's ok" for this.  It seems like a good bargain compared to the DropCam, but the motion detection algorithm is horrible.  There are so many motion detection false positives (Wolf! Wolf!) to render it useless.  I'm not talking about small animals or breezes; simple changes in sunlight seem to cause a motion alert.  I get one maybe every 1-2 hours, even on the Low setting, so needed to turn it off.  If you plan to use this in a room with Windows, I'd look for one with better software.Two other annoyances (although the prior one was the deal breaker) is that there is no feature in the app to do something like dysable motion detection when your phone is connected to your home network (or in your home via GPS), so you have to manually turn on and off motion detection each time you enter or leave.  Even using a third party app like Tasker to do this seemed problematic.  Finally, I found it hard to navigate the timeline in the app, I would try to select areas along the line and the pointer would not move to that location.
