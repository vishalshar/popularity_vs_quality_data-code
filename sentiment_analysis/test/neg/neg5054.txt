Let me start by saying I absolutely love the screw off bottom to clean the entire thing, but the top defeats the purpose of keeping everything sanitary. The top doesn't have a cap, you just have this little rubber thing that you either have to open and close with your hands or your mouth. It would be amazing if the top had some sort of cap so I didn't have to keep touching the mouth piece to close it. I hate that I have to keep using my hands to open and close it, then I have to put it in my mouth to drink the water.
