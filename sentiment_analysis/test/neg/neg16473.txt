I was really excited to get this product.  Ever since I saw it on Shark Tank I thought it was a great design.  To say I was disappointed when I opened the box would be a huge understatement.  I honest to god thought I had purchased a cheap knock off if was so bad.The material it's made of is garbage, it feels like the nylon they use to make lawn furniture cushions; dry, scratchy and prone to creasing.  As soon as I put it on and tried to slide it around to my front, as demonstrated in the video, I knew I had made a horrible mistake.  Even on it's loosest strap setting (as loose as I could get without using just the nylon strap) it rode way to high.  I'm 5''11" (180cm) tall and this thing sat as high as mid-chest.  Which made it extremely awkward to access  The tightness of the strap meant it drug int my neck with it's god awful material in any position.  I am hardly a mountain of a man, at least not one that should need to spend another $10 for an "extension strap."Design wise it's also a nightmare.  When you place a water bottle in the designated drink holder, it obstructs view and access to the font pockets!  The padded neoprene pouch in back feels similar in quality to something you'd get at a discount store as a cheap phone or tablet sleeve.  The padding it offers would offer no protection to electronics stored within.Every aspect of this bag screams low rent garbage, do not waste your money.  It's painfully obvious why they couldn't get a deal on Shark Tank, this thing is a piece of trash!
