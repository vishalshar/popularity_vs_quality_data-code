My concerns:1. pieces don't really stay put on the native mount pates provided with the package2. poor (very) mating plates with LegoThis is major handicap in terms of combining the thing with anything else. Of course, sounds and lights and buzz do keep kids playing with the set for about the week. then kids start wandering around outside of the box of instructions provided and the set fails miseably. Magnets connect pieces electicaly OK. But all physical connections (motor to plate, fan to plate, etc.) just fail after being put down on the table. I don't know if this is due to quality of practic used or something else. I consider stipping off the native mounts and gluing some lego blocks. At least Lego stays put. I'd expect more from the $200 toy.
