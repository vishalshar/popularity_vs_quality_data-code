What a disappointment. Wish I could give 0 stars. Put trakdot in one bag on overseas trip, lug loc in other to compare them. Both worked on trip to Europe from US. Tracdot sent steady text and emails where stuff was. Asked lug loc and it told me, more or less.As luck would have it bag with lug  loc was lost on return. Went to airport counter at 11 pm and said no problem, I'll tell u right where it is. Activated trace. Immediately would not connect gave error and said contact tech support. Of course they were closed. Got my luggage today. Looking at lug loc testing good and app shows my luggage 300 miles away.Called them and they said they have problems. Hey, this isn't a brand new product for them, think bugs would be worked out!!!Stay away. Get a tracdot. I am a very frequent flyer and don't work for either company but know junk when I see it.
