Purchased with hopes the reviews weren't accurate. It took 2 days to get the base to sync to the whistle. Attached whistle to collar and went for a walk to test it. Took about 20 minutes to get a notification that she was out of the zone. Then 3am in the morning home in bed, I received the notification that she was back in the zone. I will be trying Tractive next. Whistle may be better then nothing if your pet every truly goes missing. But it's not quick or very accurate.
