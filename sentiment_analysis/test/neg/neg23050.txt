This was just sorta..blah for me..  No discernible honey flavor.  The bits of pretzel could have used salt to bring a pop of flavor as the PB itself was fairly nondescript.  For the price, I regret the purchase and won't buy again.  I ended up using the jar on a couple of batches of "cowboy cookies" just to get rid of it.  At least the cookies were good!
