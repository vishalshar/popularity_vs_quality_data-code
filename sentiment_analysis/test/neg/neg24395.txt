Like other reviewers, I too received a knock off version...nothing NSFW about it & the cards appear to be written by someone who speaks English as a 2nd language. The cards are misspelled and don't make any sense (ex. "Scientific Enquiry", "Clogging Of The Toilet", "Wear Glasses Guide Dogs", "I Have A Running Nose"). I played the real NSFW expansion with friends & it was hilarious! That is not what I received.
