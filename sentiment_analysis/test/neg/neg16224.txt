Hi CrazyBaby Support,I've sent in a support ticket and still haven't received a response yet about my levitation problem. I followed the troubleshooting guide and did everything to the best of my abilities, including fully charging both devices. However, mine still doesn't not levitate. It makes an attempt but only shifts to one of the sides (on top). I believe I have a broken version. Can you please send a replacement or I'll have to request a refund. Thanks.
