I've used these for a long time, witnessed the price rise consistently, and the quality decline drastically.  All of a sudden, they don't last nearly as long (maybe three days with two cats) and they leak terribly.  I am changing my litter box method.  These are way too expensive to go through them this quickly and not even do what they are meant to do.  Boo.
