My boyfriend had the original Tiles that worked great, but you can't replace the battery so we decided to give these a shot when he needed to reorder new ones. Unfortunately these didn't reach from the living room to the bedroom of a small apartment, and they were not load enough to hear when they did work. We returned them and will stick with the Tiles.
