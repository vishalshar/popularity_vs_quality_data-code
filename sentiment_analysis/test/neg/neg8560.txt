These don't even work! I bought them as a Christmas gift for my forgetful mother and if it isn't glitching and saying her items are across town when they're in her hand, then it's saying they're at home at all times. I tried contacting customer service but I got NO reply and it's been two weeks already. Yet another company that won't help or bother with you once they have your money. I'll be returning them at my earliest convenience.
