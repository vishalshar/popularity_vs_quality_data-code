I have a fairly small phone (a 1st generation Moto X) inside the thinnest and lightest case I've seen, so I was hoping that this could work with the larger of the two metal plates under the case. It doesn't. My phone dropped straight down at the very first bump in the road. I was considering trying it with the metal plate stuck to the back of the case, but because my phone's back (and thus, the case) is curved, and the plate is kinda big (like, my case only barely fit over it) the edges of the plate would be pulled away and sticking out from the phone. In addition to making the phone uncomfortable to hold, the plate itself probably wouldn't stay on for very long. And even when just the metal plate is on the mount, I'm very unimpressed with how the magnet feels. So, unfortunately, I am returning this.Also, while I did intend to use this in my CD player, the description says "Or insert into a dashboard groove to keep your CD player accessible". I've never seen a car with grooves big enough for this to squeeze into. I tried it all over, and there was no spot that would work in my car.
