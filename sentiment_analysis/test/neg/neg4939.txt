Product works, but be aware if in europe you have to deal with a big power supply, multi head plugs etc. When traveling it is nearly bigger than my Macbook air when you have all the accessories, very cumbersome and heavy for travel. Which is disappointing as I bought it for traveling. Have not used it once, it is now a very big paperweight on my desk, and I have already mislaid the multiple plugs, power, cords etc.
