I purchased this particular 3D printer specifically because of the built in scanning feature.  I am absolutely underwhelmed by it's scan quality.  In a word, it sucks.  I've tried multiple objects and have done my homework to understand the limitations of current scanning technology.  Now this thing might scan something with the surface outline of a rock OK but it will not scan other objects well.  I've dusted items white for better pickup by the scanner to no avail.  Scanned objects have consistently had multiple artifacts and blobbing in the scan, to the point that trying to print them would be pointless.  I wish I could give this two rankings, one for the scanner and one for the printer.  The scanner would received no stars.The printer on the other had works right out of the box.  Something to note, documentation for this unit blows.  The online documentation is full of grammatical errors and is basically just a quick start guide with no substantive information available.  They have also made some design changes that are not listed.  On my unit the filament roll had to be installed reverse to how the documentation shows.  They have also deleted the SD slot from the machine.  However printing on this has been easier than any of the units I've had.  Load your file and go.  The print quality is OK.  It's not great but it's not bad either.  However it is very easy to produce your prints with very little user intervention required.The web interface is a joke.  There is a 9MB file limitation for uploading via the network.  That is plain stupid.  If we were still in the dialup age I could understand, with it being on a wired or wireless network with plenty of bandwidth that is just poor implementation.The UI needs some work.  I've had multiple machine lockups on me, especially if you kill a print job and then it just gets stuck and the only thing that fixes it is powering it off and turning it back on.  The ribbon cable that attaches to the extruder is also not a good design.  The ribbon cable already has multiple creases in it from just normal travel of the head.  It will fail sooner rather than later.  The cleaning mechanism for the extruder doesn't always do it's job.  I had to bend the metal bracket that holds the rubber squeegee up so that it would actually rub against the nozzle tip.  Even after doing that, I would have to watch the tip when I started every print to make sure that the nozzle was actually wiped clean before the job actually started.  Multiple times I had to quickly snatch away the plastic excrement before it started printing on the bed or the print would be ruined and I would have to start again.This product is a great idea but it isn't fully baked yet.  It still needs more R&D both on the hardware and software side.  It is DEFINITELY NOT worth the money.  My Microcenter 3D Pro is a much better value for the money as it can print multiple materials, has a heated bed, has dual extruders and really didn't take too much longer to get setup to print.  For $1,700 less, it gives you more options and then you can actually spend the left over money on a Fire3D scanner that will actually get the scanning job done.Oh did I mention that the packaging sucks?  Since when did tape to seal up a box become optional?  The scanner almost fell out of the box when it was being unloaded from the UPS truck.  The plastic tabs that hold the box together had been ripped out.  Spending 10 cents a box to add some tape would have solved that problem and how hard is it to run a blade to cut the tape to open it up?Needless to say, this item has been returned for a refund.Oh I forgot to note that when I first fired this thing up I tried to calibrate the scanner and kept getting error messages.  I finally got it to calibrate and had emailed tech support.  Over a week has gone by and I have yet to receive a response from them!
