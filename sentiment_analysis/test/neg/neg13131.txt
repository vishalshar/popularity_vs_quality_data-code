I really wanted to like this phone, I really did. I gave it a fair shot, but I ultimately sold it for the One Plus 3. I bought a blue one for my wife and a midnight color for myself. My wife is keeping hers so far. Here are my reasons for selling it:1. I just bought a 2016 Honda Accord with Android Auto. This phone never recognized with device. I changed everything: device (my wife's), flashed CyanogenMod, bought official type-C cable from Google play store, removed AA from battery optimization, and anything else I could remotely find online. Could never get it to even show any sign of connection. I finally resorted to Bluetooth, which leads me to...2. I rely heavily on bluetooth. I have 2 BT headphones, OBD2 adapters for 2 cars, 3 lost items trackers, smartwatches, external speakers, etc. The phone fails to connect ~40% of the time to my car, which is unacceptable, often dropping several minutes into the drive. It says it's connected, but audio comes from Robin speakers, not car. I can control the audio( FF, RW, Play/Pause) with car, but no audio through car. I have to disconnect and reconnect a random number of times to get it to keep a connection, anywhere from 2-10 times. It will most times send audio through for a few milliseconds before going back to the Robin speakers. While doing this process, the speakers on the Robin increase in volume immediately after the car BT disconnect. This has happened with headphones and speakers, but not as frequently. In addition to this clear annoyance, when I finally got it to hold a connection, it would sometimes bounce the audio b/t Left and Right speakers. I listen mostly to podcasts so I know it's not in any music.3. While trying to solve problem 1 listed above, I flashed every custom rom I could find in an attempt to get Android Auto to work. I noticed that few existed and all I could find were based on CyanogenMod. A bug existed at the time in every rom I tested: the phone would reboot immediately after hitting the call button.4. The fingerprint sensor failed way too often. It is my opinion that the failures are due mostly to the fact that the sensor is on the side of the phone vs the back or front of the device. It's a very skinny sensor and doesn't have the surface area of the front or back sensors. I "taught" the phone the same finger as 4 different fingers, systematically segmenting my finger into 4 rows for each of them. The One Plus 3 is much better at recognizing my fingers.5. The camera is still too slow, even after the update, and the picture quality is disappointing. It is slow to focus and I still miss many shots of my fast-moving small children. I delete more blurry shots than I ever keep.6. The front-facing speakers did not produce the sound quality or volume that I expected for the amount of volume that they add to the phone.7. The proximity sensor often failed to turn off the screen while on a call, leading me to hangup or go off into random apps.
