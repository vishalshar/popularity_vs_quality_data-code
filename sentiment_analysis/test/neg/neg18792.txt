I got one of these for my little dog, since he loves to play fetch. Everything looked great out of the box, but the iFetch only tossed one ball after I turned it on. I figured out that the little ball detection lever inside was stuck. After some rigorous tapping on the unit, the lever popped back out. Another ball went through, and the lever again stuck. This continued for throw after throw. Every time I moved the iFetch, the cord came out of the unit, so I had to plug it back in and press the power button to turn it back on.My dog, initially VERY interested in this new toy, quickly lost interest after all of the tapping. He finally decided to sit a good distance away and watch me tap on the thrower. I finally got the lever to pop back out most of the time, but by then, my dog was wary of the iFetch. Hmmm...The iFetch went back into its box for a trip back to Amazon. I wasn't happy with the iFetch's out-of-box failure, and I wonder if anyone at iFetch tests new units before shipping (no QC for a product that costs this much?). I'll just have to stick with the old-fashioned way of playing fetch with my dog.
