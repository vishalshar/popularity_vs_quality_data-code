I ordered one of these oyster mushroom kits and never succeeded at growing them. I did get one "bloom" of mushrooms but they were small non edible.  I even had a replacement kit sent to me after 3 months of the first trial and still no luck. That being said I am an avid gardener and I have never failed at growing things. This product is a complete waste of 20 dollars for mushrooms - take your money to a farmer's market and buy fresh mushrooms there and you will get bushels of them.
