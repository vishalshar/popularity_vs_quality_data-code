I bought new pillows in hopes of replacing my old flat pillows that were just not longer comfortable. I seen this pillow had good reviews so I bought 2. That was a mistake. This pillow came flat. Its worse then the pillows i was trying to replace that I've had for years. Once the pillow "Inflated" it was only half full. Nothing good can come out of a pillow that you receive completely flat. I would not recommend this to anyone and or animal. See pictures as evidence. Don't believe the other reviews. Cheers!Stay far away!!
