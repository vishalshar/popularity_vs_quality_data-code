Don't WASTE your $$$ on these; great idea, horrible execution! I rarely write bad reviews, but these have done nothing but infuriate me!!...!!! While on the Cardio Machine, I had to place my phone on the display pad just to get a hope of streamed-from-phone music. Then when I went to mow my acre property, They wouldn't stream from my front pocket.... RIDICULOUS!! Mowing is normally an enjoyable activity for me, but listening to GARBLED music RUINED IT! I don't use any of the other features of this device but I wouldn't put a lot of faith in it. I hope customer care for this company/group reads this, and if you can make it right, I would be glad to UPDATE this review accordingly.
