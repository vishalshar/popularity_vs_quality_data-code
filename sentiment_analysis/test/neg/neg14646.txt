I am really disappointed. I researched to find something that said it was kid friendly and easy to use. All you had to do was tap it and it would sync to the computer after downloading the app. The tapping worked about three times before it stopped lighting up. The syncing never worked. Our child wore it all day and the app said he did not do any activity. I am so disappointed. I wanted simple and it was far from it.
