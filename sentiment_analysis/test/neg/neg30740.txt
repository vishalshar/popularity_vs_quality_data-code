I purchased an 8 pack of assorted colors September 22, 2014 for $22 (Prime) because I was convinced it would be useful for many types of repairs. I stored the package in an unlit area with an average temperature of about 67F).  Yesterday (May 28, 2015) I opened the first package (black) to repair a broken part from a lawn tractor.  The packet content was fully cured and unusable.  The label states "USE BY 02 AUG 2015".  There is no way to determine how long the contents of this packet might have been usable, but it is a fact that this packet was unusable eight months from the date of purchase.  The $22 cost is not the isssue - shelf life is not as claimed.Thanks to youtube instructions, I was able to repair the tractor part with a do-it-yourself substitute - a mixture of silicone calk and baking soda.
