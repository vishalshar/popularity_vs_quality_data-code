Very frustrating.  I've tried all sorts of batteries -- most recently lithium -- thinking that the charge is simply insufficient to kill the mice THAT I CAN SEE under my deck, but everytime I see the indicator light flashing "kill," I check and the bait is gone but the trap is empty.  I don't know if it is because AA batteries just don't generate the charge/zap needed to kill your basic field mouse, but if that's the case then don't sell something that uses them and claims to kill mice.  I'm 0-25 so far.  A colossal waste of money.
