It works fine as a regular light bulb but all the other features very glitchy. Could not get the sunrise feature to work on alarm. Adjusting white light for warm/cool worked once in a while but would go back to default gas station parking lot bluish/green. Needed firmware update that would run for 20-30 minutes but never get past 2 of 5. After several attempts and trying everything to nurse the update through I gave up and returned.
