Very disappointed. I wrote to support and haven't made much progress with them.1. It's slow slow slow.2. It seemed advertised you would get notifications about who opened the door. I have never received any notifications.3. All along the dangled a HomeKit compatible device and said its coming. Now they say you will need new devices. Sorry bad experience. Going with a different product.4. It's a bit bulky5. The front battery cover pops off too easy
