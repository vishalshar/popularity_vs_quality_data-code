After reading all the reviews online from people who got Ollie (free?) for review purposes and watching the videos, I pulled the trigger and bought one. I have a pretty extensive radio controlled device background (quadcopters and battery powered gliders), so I knew there wouldn't be much of a learning curve. Actually, Ollie is pretty easy to learn to drive and has some good quickness to it. If that's all your looking for, then Ollie might just be good enough for you.When you want it to do something "neat", it has a lot of pre-programmed tricks and looks pretty sharp doing them. The problem comes when the trick is over. Every single time you have it do a quick spin or whatever, you have to recalibrate it (they call it aiming), and I do mean EVERY SINGLE time. This gets old fast.At first I simply figured I had a defective Ollie (heck the reviews and the youtube videos don't give you much of a hint) so I returned it to Amazon (have I mentioned how much I greatly appreciate Amazon's return policies?) for an exchange. When I got the second one, I charged it up and went straight to the tricks with exactly the same result.This time, I opted to email the manufacturer, just in case. Their response was, "The adjusting of the aim after a trick is normal.Ollie get disoriented easy and needs to be fixed. It is like this for all Ollies. Replacing the device will not fix this."It may be "normal", but that sure doesn't make it "ok" in my book. For me, it was a quick return of what I most certainly consider a defective device. Thank you a second time, Amazon.
