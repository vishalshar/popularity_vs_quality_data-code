WHY DID YOU ADD THE ALOE BACK IN??? I came across this product almost a year ago, and fell in love. Used at least once a day (often 2-3 times) and paired with my other Rx creams, my psoriasis looked clearer than it ever had! I then bought the MetaDerm Psoriasis Wash and Scalp Topical Spray and added those to my daily routine - and it got even better!!!! Once, I received a single bottle of this moisturizing cream that was causing a tingling feeling and it actually made my Psoriasis worse. After calling the manufacturer, I was told that they had previously included Aloe in the ingredients, but had removed it due to some people's allergic reactions (apparently I was one such person), but that it was no longer an ingredient - perhaps I had just received an old bottle. I tossed that bottle in the trash and ordered another, which was back to normal with no aloe and CLEAR SKIN HEAVEN! Now here we are 4-5 months later and aloe is back in the mix!?! I didn't even notice until I tried my latest bottle and felt that tingling again! I turned around the bottle and saw the aloe right away. Having thought I received another "old" bottle, I jumped on amazon and the company's website and to my horror, discovered that Aloe is back in the ingredients!If people complained about the lack of aloe, then I get it, but you need to release an aloe free version as well! This has literally been the best thing since dovonex (my fellow P sufferers know) and I cannot go back to searching for another daily moisturizer! PLEASE RELEASE AN ALOE FREE VERSION AGAIN!!!!!
