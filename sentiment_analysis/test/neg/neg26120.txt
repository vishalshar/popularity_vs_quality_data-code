Facial recognition my eye!!I have "taught" it 100's of photos of my face and it only occasionally recognizes my face. So as I walk through my house there are constant "Motion Detected" alerts on my phone.And when it does recognize my face it still alerts that I have been seen. Well, DUH!!! Thanks for that!The video is OK but I want something that can notify me reliably without being a nuisance.
