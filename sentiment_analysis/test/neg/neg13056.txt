On the surface, it seemed as though it would work.  Nice screen, initially booted up until I tried to call it.  This product never did work for me.  I tried it several times with existing SIM card and new SIM cards even multiple carriers (AT&T and Verizon).  Then it even eventually stopped booting up.  Not a worthy product of purchase whatsoever -- a real waste of the money spent.  By the time I threw in the towel and tried to return it, I got the message "time for returning this item has expired" by one day.  I wish I had paid closer attention to the small print saying that I had a limited time to return the product.  I would not recommend purchase of it.
