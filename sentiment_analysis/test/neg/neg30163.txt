Really disappointed with these. I purchased do to a skin irritation I was having. Within just a week of hanging in my shower, as directed by the packaging, the soft chenille side was black with mold. My shower is a normal shower. This thing was able to dry out completely. Yet still, the white washcloth section turned black and also smelled terribly. I used it for a week and then had to throw it away.
