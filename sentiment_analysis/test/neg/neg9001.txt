Great idea, poor execution.  It's little on the expensive side, but hey I like gadgets.  Problem is, this failed while using it for only the second time.  It's not the first one that broke either.  I previously had an ember model.  That stopped working too.What about support?  Nope, you're on your own.  I have tried contacting Supermechanical via their app, via email, and via phone.  Communication is  extremely sporadic, and I'm no closer to having the issue resolved.Recommendation: Avoid.UPDATE: I finally heard back from Supermechanical. Apparently they've experienced staff problems.  They apologized and sent me a replacement Coal without quibbling.UPDATE 2: And it failed first time I used it! Seriously. I am so done with this now.  Looking at something from Thermoworks instead.
