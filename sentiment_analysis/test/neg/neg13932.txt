Nice concept very poor execution. The pictures make it look like it's metal and slim it's not. It's thick and cheap plastic. It arrived already scratched and dinged and the sliders hardly work and one was stuck entirely with paint chipping off. The included magnets don't even hold it to the fridge. After abusing it for awhile I got them to slide and decided to keep it as my grandmother has a hard time remembering if she's fed her dog or not and there aren't many alternatives... and frankly it would cost more to ship it back than it's worth. Aweful product.
