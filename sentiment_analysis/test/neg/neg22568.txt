I have bought this before in stores and LOVED it. However, I got the package yesterday, packed one in my bag for work. I poured it over ice into my YETI and there was these nasty chunks in it! I am so disappointed as I was looking forward to this product, and it ended up being disgusting. I'm not sure what the issue is, as it is not expired. I'm going to have to throw the entire package away if they're all like this! YUCK.
