I live in the Midwest, 1 mile from an international airport with a National Weather Service office. The so-called "Smart" software does not recognize when rain has or is falling! It continues to schedule sprinklers when the ground is saturated. I have worked with their so-called support for 2 months to no avail. I no longer believe that there is any back end cloud software and the system is based on the Wizard of Oz principle with a man behind the screen.The hardware installed fine and works as advertised, but the software DOES NOT.ONLY BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A MANUALLY CONTROLLED IRRIGATION SYSTEM THAT YOU CAN REMOTELY MANAGE YOURSELF.
