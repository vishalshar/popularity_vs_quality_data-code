The app had problems finding the item when it was 5 feet in front of me. It needs to always use your location on your phone In order for you to click the key fob to make your phone ring. Very buggy, I got at least seven notifications that I was leaving my wallet behind while I was still seated and eating dinner. Not worth the price.
