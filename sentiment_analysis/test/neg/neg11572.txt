Sounds like a great idea! great features - great concept - BUT poorly executed! the 'touchpad' feels like it is going to peel off and the case feels very cheap and is just plastic - one drop to the floor and this is going to break - NOTHING robust in this product. but the worst thing is that it is not accurate - and is consistently out by 1/16"-1/8" all the time unless you extract the tape very slowly and then it is hit and miss.  I contacted the company twice about this issue and to-date have heard nothing - so 2 star review.
