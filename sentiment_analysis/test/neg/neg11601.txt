This product is a disappointment inside and out. First, the build quality of the devices is much lower than expected for a product at this high price point. The devices are insubstantial and not weighted properly to nicely stand upright, which is a problem for a device that is meant (required) to be seen. Second, the Luma is extremely limited in configuration options. It is suited to be the one and only network device in your home (apart from a modem)it is not designed to work in harmony with other routers, wired or not. The only configuration options are to allow port forwardingif you have any use case that requires you to modify your network settings (even something as basic as specifying a DNS server), you are out of luck. This product will not do it. Finally, the radio power seems to be much weaker than other devices. You will need more Lumas to cover your home than you do of other (even older) routers.For those interested, tech support is hard to come by. I called the 800 for information about configuring the device, waited on hold for 30 minutes and hung up. I then submitted a support ticket and it took the company over a day to acknowledge that I even submitted a form. When I received a response, it was only to inform me that Luma is not capable of the functionality I need.Overall, this is a limited device for a limited purpose. If you fit within that group of users, this may be an option for you.
