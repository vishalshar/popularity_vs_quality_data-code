Do not buy this! The photos are very dark and the app is NOT user friendly. The app is insistent that you post videos to it's page and it is hard to tell if it has done this without your permission. I bought the Prynt case to use at school in my art class and have instant prints to send home to parents. I cannot use it since the photos are so blurred and dark and I am not sure if the photos are going online. Not worth the headache or the $$.
