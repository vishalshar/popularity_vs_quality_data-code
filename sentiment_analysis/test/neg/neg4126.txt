Run, fast, from this product.I own a Misfit Shine, which I love, but I wanted to upgrade to a more updated product.  I had been eyeing the Ray for quite some time, and I had everything I wanted.  Text notifications,  Alarm.  It can be used swimming, which I needed.  When the price fell on Black Friday, I grabbed it.I hate it.First, the alarm was set for 6:30.  I was actually awake, but I lay in bed, waiting to feel the vibration,  And waiting.  And waiting.  3 hours later, I'm still waiting.  Strike one.It also hasn't vibrated for my texts,  Strike two.But it was still alive.  It could hit a home run tracking, which is what I care about.  Or it could strike out, which it did.  I tried a video that I've used many times before, a Leslie Sansone video that claims to be 2 miles.  My Shine tracked it to 1.2 miles or so, about 535 points.  People who use the Fitbit claim they also get about 1.2 miles for it.  So I know how it should track.  This thing gave me 192 points, .6 miles.  Really?  It gave me almost as much (65 points, .2 miles) for walking a block or so to pick up coffee.Its cute.  I still really like its looks.  But its cute junk.Back it goes.Sad I missed the Fitbit sale.
