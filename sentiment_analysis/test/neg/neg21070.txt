I guess it might be a luck of the draw type thing, but I received our Large antler today and was disappointed.  I have two GSDs and they love antlers.  I have always ordered large in various brands and they were all comparably sized.  This one, however, was significantly smaller.  I even had to pull out a ruler just to see.  It was only 5 inches long, so I read the description again to see.  It does say "most are 6-8"," so they did not lie since the description eludes to "some are not."  I can only imaging what the small and medium size would be like.  Overall, disappointed.  Doesn't measure up to competitors.
