THE CONCEPT WORKS: I broke a 40+ year nail biting habit in 2 days. I'm not exaggerating. All it took was 5 zaps before I started using a nail clipper. It's been 2 weeks and my nails look and feel great.THE PRODUCT DOESNT: it worked for 5 days. Then it refused to pair. Or, even after a full charge it died after a few minutes: became 'bricked'. I followed the "Troubleshooting FAQ" on the site and tried:- hard reboot- turn off blue tooth, & turn back on- forget the device & find again- delete app & re-install- pair, unpair & pair again- unplug device for 8 hours, then charge for 5- yabadi, yabadi, etc...Any & All of these fixes worked once or twice ONLY.NEXT: I contacted support via chat. Very nice people who walked me through the same steps to no avail. They offered me to send me out a replacement unit.  I preferred to return via Amazon.CEO: I even emailed the CEO who emailed back. Sweet. Still didn't work.FINALLY: I gave up & returned the unit.BUT: I immediately ordered another.WHY: I have so many habits that await breaking. When it works, this product works! I believe in the concept and the potential to change my life is huge.DISHEARTENED: I'm reading reviews from people who've returned 2 & 3 items.PAVLOK: Please do something. Get another round of funding. Start a kickstarted campaign. I'd donate and promote your campaign. If you guys don't fix this, someone else will take your business away. Because it works. And when it works the product is easily worth $200. I think of all the money it could save me by breaking habits that drain my wallet. I've even thought of hiring an electronics guys to make me a simple manual zapper......AFTERMATH: well i got my 2nd unit and hey, I thought my troubles were over. Worked great for 2-3 weeks. Then the new unit crapped out too. Zapped for an hour then stopped. Tried everything. I'm sick of excuses. Returned this one too. That's it for me.EPILOGUE: I'm using a rubber band. It's on my wrist and I pull tight every time and boy does it hurt. Much more than Pavlok. Works for me.
