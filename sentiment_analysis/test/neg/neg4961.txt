iPhone Users! Please Read: the alarm functions for the Equator does not work on iOS and says as much in the help guide. I purchased this band thinking it's advertised alarm functions were applicable to Apple products. This is not the case. If you're good with not being able to use this for setting alarms or wearing to sleep as an alarm, then this shouldn't matter much. But if you are interested in that functionality this is not the band for you.Cool design...cool concept...syncing took much longer than most other fitness trackers and bands.
