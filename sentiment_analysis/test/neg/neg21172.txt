The grass is cheap and stinks immediately. The clips are absolutely worthless. The grass just sits on top of the basin so it soaks in all the pee as it runs down to the drain, nothing separates the grass patch from the base. I use it because I need an emergency option when I cant take my dog downstairs to go outside but honestly this thing is a much bigger pain than I was hoping for. The only good part is that my dog took to using it quite quickly and the catch tray can last a day or 2 before you may need to empty it but that's only if you can handle the smell that long.I do a deep clean once a week on the grass patch and I spray the spot where my dogs goes with BioKleen immediately each time then rinse with water. The grass is cheap and sinks into the grooves even with the clips on so I am hoping that a better quality grass patch will help with this problem.
