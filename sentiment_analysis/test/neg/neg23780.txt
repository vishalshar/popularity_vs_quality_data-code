I had originally purchases the Innotek in ground system by PetSafe and it works wonderfully. The problem is the receiver collar that comes with it is for larger dogs. In my research I saw that this collar should work with the Innotek system so I spent another 76 dollars to get the smaller collar. It will not work.
