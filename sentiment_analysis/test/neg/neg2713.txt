I really wanted to like this since design was so good, but I cannot. It broke on me not once but three times. The first time it over heated and blew out and stopped working.  The company replaced it quick enough even though I had to pay to mail it to them. The second one the metal plug prong broke off in less then a day. Again had to pay to mail it back even though company was quick to replace it. The third one the metal plug prong broke off again. Just gave up and tossed it in trash. Was costing me more in postage than I paid for the thing. Also when it did work it did not hold a full charge for more than a week. So if you are going to try it have to use it constantly or it looses its charge. Not good for people who just want a back up to toss in bag or brief. Overall there are lots better out there.
