I saw this add on Facebook and ordered them. I have a kid who can't be bothered with tying his shoes. I tossed the laces and put these on. There is one strand for each pair of holes in the shoe and that strap clips together on the top. The strands are a slightly stretchy rubber-like material. Because of the way these hook together they didn't work on all the holes on the shoe. Once they were all on I realized there would now be a struggle for him to get his shoes on because there wasn't a lot of give. We got them on and I sent him to school still happy I wouldn't be replacing his laces all the time. By the time I picked him up, over half of them had come unhooked and were sticking straight out. He didn't have the dexterity to rehook them. We tried again the next day with the same results.  These don't cover all the holes, they don't stay locked and they make it hard to get the shoes on. A very disappointing purchase. If you're still considering these try zip ties first. Those stay closed and have the same basic purpose. OH! Zip ties are cheaper too!
