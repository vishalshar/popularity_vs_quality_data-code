Unfortunately, my micro SD card got stuck and broke inside the device. The device gets extremely warm in minutes of plugging inside my Pixel. Feels very flimsy and could easily damage your computer. Wouldn't recommend for portable use.The device does indeed work with the PIxel 2. Just too many headaches and problems
