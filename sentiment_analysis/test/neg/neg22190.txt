Great cable. i wish it was a little bit longer, say an inch on each side. Every time I use it someone asks me about it.Update:  October 2016. I've had this on my keychain for about a year and a half, its not durable. The black rubber material has worn away from the middle section. They should use something like kevlar to cover it.
