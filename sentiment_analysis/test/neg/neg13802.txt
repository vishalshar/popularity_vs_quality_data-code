I had to return this, unfortunately.  I really had high hopes for this with my special needs cat.  She has separation anxiety and I thought this would help.  She paid no attention to it whatsoever.  I think definitely more suitable for a dog.  It was a tad frustrating trying to set it up - the directions were clear and concise, it just took several tries over and over to get the connection.  And when I did use it while I was at work, I had a very weak connection and would lose it, so this would not work well for me even if my cat did respond to it.  I'm bummed out and was not happy to have to pay for shipping to return it, either, when it was free shipping to begin with, ($10!!)
