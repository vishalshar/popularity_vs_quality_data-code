I've decided to try this case for my iphone 6 plus and there are both pros and cons to it but overall satisfied. To start with, the case itself is of high quality plastic, durable and protects all the edges and allows enough space for the charging port unlike some cases that limits the opening. It has raised up edges and can still fit a clear glass cover which I like. I've dropped my phone a few times and sure did the job to protect it.The sticky part. It works really well for flat surfaces as long as the surface area does not have like small holes. I've placed it on my cabinet in my kitchen while cooking, the fridge, mirrors/windows and it works. Its still new to me so it still kinda leaves me a little anxious as far as sticking it to other surfaces.As others have mention, it does collect dust, hair, and other stuff which could get annoying at times. Also makes it hard to pick up on flat surfaces but not too annoying to rid of it.I've washed the back portion of it to remove the extra stickiness right off the box and it does feel a bit more tolerable to the touch. I think the feeling will be a hit or miss to some people. As for me, it does not bother me anymore after a couple of days.I recently had my phone and keys in my pocket and I guess it did stick to my keys and accidentally ripped off a chunk of the sticky part. I contacted mega tiny about it and they responded quickly (even on the weekend) and will be sending me a new case.Overall for what it is, I like it. I just hoped the rubbery part does not feel like an old tape that lost its effect. Also maybe it wont attract dirt, dust and hair as much.Edit (9/17/2016) I have been responding with megatiny through email about the replacement case but sadly I feel like I just got the run around for getting a new case. very disappointing customer service. They promise a replacement case and even after several emails they still haven't sent me a new one. Even promised me a tracking number but never received it.
