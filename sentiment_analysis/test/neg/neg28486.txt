I agree with many other reviewers that the app is noticeably slow. The auto unlock works great. I love having my Amazon Echo be able to lock and unlock the door, also being able to use Siri. But it is annoying that checking the status takes several seconds. I know, I know, first world problems. The install was relatively simple. I'd definitely recommend.*** UPDATE *** After a few weeks of use, the lock has become very buggy - the app sometimes takes anywhere from 30-45 seconds to give a status or even to lock the door when tapping the green circle in the app. It is so unreliable. I really, really wanted this to work out, I wanted to love it, but standing at my door, arms full of groceries with a toddler in tow waiting for the door to unlock and finally having to set everything down and rummage for my keys is outright painful - that's exactly why I bought the lock in the first place. I really hope that either August steps it up or someone else comes in and realizes there's a market for this product and makes something that knocks the August's socks off.
