As others have mentioned, I can't imagine this is the correct product. It came 2 weeks later than ordered, the box was crushed, and the words are misspelled and phrases don't make sense. It would be okay if they were made to not make sense, but you can tell these are supposed to and just don't. Like they are written by non-English speakers. The decks are repeats of themselves, which was really disappointing. I was surprised that a lot of the phrases were very easy to understand with the mouthpiece in, which made us lose interest quickly. Planning on returning.
