Update on 12/13/16: I watched the video posted in a comment by the manufacturer. I work in a co-working space with about 50 technology-related Startups, so I even had techie people try to help; people who develop applications, webpages, and even higher technology that I don't understand could not even get it to tether to my iPhone 6s Plus OR directly to the Wifi today. I was trying to record a presentation, but ended up just using an iPod on a stick. That's SIGNIFICANTLY better than this thing because I could have live streamed it via Wifi straight from the device. The Bluetooth part tethers to tell me the battery remaining, but that's about it.Update (before I even post it because I've been playing with it while I write): It's updating the Firmware right now after FINALLY connecting after a dozen tries. Now it restarted.... And now it finally works. This still ticks me off because I was trying to record an interaction I had with someone and I looked like a jacktard trying to make it work while they stood there. Somebody somewhere needs to figure stuff out before they push updates and releases and I get out in the wild and have a worthless pile of crap wasting everyone's time and money.It's a small plastic thing with cute lights. And that's it. I used it successfully twice and then it stopped connecting to my iPhone 6s Plus. You have to disconnect from the WiFi in order to connect to the camera, which means that the only way to live stream is to do so via your carrier's 4G data. That's just not feasible. Why can't I connect a cable between the camera and phone to tether it and remain on WiFi? If Apple allowed for two or more simultaneous WiFi connections, that might be reasonable, but I am unaware of what would have to go into that. Or hell, use it as an external computer camera. Nope. Let's tether it via WiFi... which doesn't even work. Brilliant. [sarc]I'm sure I can't return it because who the hell wants this thing back and I don't think I have the packaging because, against my better judgment, I allowed someone else to throw it away because I am supposedly a hoarder. It turned itself off though. Gotta preserve that power for those two lights....
