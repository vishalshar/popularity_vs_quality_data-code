Bellabeat has prioritized style over functionality for this item, and it's a major problem. The LEAF is beautiful and I love the style. However, Bellabeat is flat-out lying about what this item does on the product description. In the product description, they claim that the LEAF tracks breathing (specifically: 'Breathing - by tracking your breathing during breathing exercises, the LEAF helps you manage and relieve stress, increase focus and fall asleep easily'). In fact, the LEAF currently does not track breathing during breathing exercises in any way; I believe that previous models might have but the current version doesn't. I contacted customer service because I thought that something was wrong with my LEAF, but they confirmed that the LEAF currently doesn't track breathing. They claimed that they're working on it and that the algorithms associated with this are challenging; I get that, but nonetheless they shouldn't be misrepresenting (and flat-out lying!) about what there product does. There is also no way to set breathing or meditation goals and the meditation activities-- which, again, do not involve the LEAF-- are about average in comparison to similar free apps online.Other issues: The cycle tracker is just a calendar and super basic. I'll continue using another app for this. Likewise, the function that allows you to input activities is much more limited than other apps, so I'll also continue using another app for this.Essentially, this is a very beautiful pedometer. If you're okay with that, then I would recommend this product. If, however, you're looking for something beyond a pedometer, this is not the product for you.I might have been fine with a beautiful pedometer if that's how the item had been marketed. Given that the company is making false claims about their product, though, I decided to return mine. Particularly given that another activity tracker recently faced a lawsuit for making false claims about their product, I don't expect Bellabeat to be around for long, and I worry that any future updates might be problematic as well given that they clearly do not prioritize functionality.In the end, and despite it's aesthetic appeal, I decided to return by Bellabeat LEAF and purchase a somewhat more expensive smartwatch. While the smartwatch was more than twice the cost of the LEAF,it does much more. And, most importantly, it's by a company that would never put out a product that lacks functionality. By misrepresenting their product and selling a product that is currently not fully functional, Bellabeat is, in my opinion, making really poor business decisions. I would never again by something from a company that is so blatantly misrepresenting what their product does, as this is really shady. In fact, given that the product description is knowingly false (as mentioned before, Bellabeat customer service confirmed the LEAF doesn't currently monitor breathing during the exercises), Amazon really shouldn't be selling this product.
