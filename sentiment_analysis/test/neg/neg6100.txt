Product is excellent, but expensive.  My problem was due to a large portion of the contents arriving in a fine powder form versus larger pieces of chicken.  I feel that this was due to the handling/treatment received during the various stages of shipment, and the product not having the protection it required inside the shipping box.Will not reorder until shipping/quality standards change.
