I really love the concept of this cup, and wanted it to work. However, toddlers throw cups. If they're old enough to know better then they probably don't really need a sippy cup anymore. Ours lasted about a month. It got thrown (not even that hard) and the glass shattered into a million pieces. Bummed. I wanted to love this! But we've had much better luck with our Green Sprouts Glass Sip N Straw Cups.
