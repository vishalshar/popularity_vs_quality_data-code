looks good, but what good is it if it can't do what it is supposed to do.  sure, it can tell time but it can't count steps if it's life depended on it.  after owning this for 4 days, it understates the steps by 25% when comparing to apple's health app.  I've been using apple's health app for the past year and it is fairly accurate.  So when this watch shows a completely different number, it is def annoying.  i have withings scale and i have raved about the product to everyone i know.  unfortunately, this watch is a huge miss and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a watch that doubles as a pedometer.
