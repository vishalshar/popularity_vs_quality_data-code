So... my nextbit robin is dead again. It looks like it's dead for good this time. I'm not going to return it 'cause it's probably too late to get my money back. This phone has problems charging. First I looked in the support forums and everyone said it's the cable. So I got a new cable. It wasn't the cable. Then I read you could reboot the thing buy pressing the down button and power. That worked once or twice. And I verified it wasn't the cable. Then it worked fine for about two and a half months. Then I let it completely discharge and now it just doesn't recharge. I've had the thing for three months and it's dead, dead, dead.The support people I talked with were very nice, but ultimately this is a product that stopped working.----Second Review----Keeping my  review here for posterity... but... after getting a new charging cable and learning about the robin's quirks, it's not actually a bad phone. And... support was very responsive. Hopefully the guys at NextBit will be tackling the cable issue, but if you have charging issues, it may be the cable. Also, the connector where the USB-C cable plugs in *feels* mushy, but it hasn't broken and it still works, maybe that's a feature of USB-C or maybe i'm just sensitive to it.----ORIGINAL REVIEW----When this phone works, it's not bad. The things I don't like about it aren't unique to the robin, but problems with Android in general.But the phone I received does not charge reliably with the included USB-C cable. Support responded within 24 hours (which was in line with expectations) and a suggested fix worked once. Further interactions with support were seemingly useless; they insisted things I was seeing weren't happening. Specifically, the phone refused to charge while turned off. Support insisted this wasn't the case. I was eventually able to boot the phone into recovery mode, fastboot, then explicitly power off and then it started charging.The problem I encountered with this phone is it stopped charging after I plugged it in. The battery then died overnight and it won't charge in power-off mode after you've let the battery completely drain. (or at the very least it's charging so slowly it doesn't have enough juice to power the screen to display the battery icon indicating it's charging while in power-off mode.)Suggestions from the official support account were more or less useless and obvious like "try plugging it in" and "you're obviously plugging it into a charger that doesn't work." I empathize with the support team; many people do overlook simple fixes to common problems. But in this case I don't think it's a simple problem (I double checked my recovery procedure after receiving a response from support.)Suggested fixes on the support forum included reflashing the boot rom with a beta version of the rom. i'm not quite sure this is appropriate for a consumer product.In any event, if they can fix the charging problem I'll change my review. I really WANT this phone to work and I want the small team behind this product to give "the big guys" a run for their money. But they're going to have to build a phone that charges when you plug it in first.
