Under-realized concept at shipping. I bought mine through crowd-funding, received them last week and while the concept is good, they aren't living up to their potential, yet, if ever? If the sensor was fast enough to actually catch me walking into the zone of coverage instead of away, it might be able to capture the burglar. If the system actually sent me an alert on my iPhone, I might actually have a system where I could call law enforcement if my home were broken into away. I've been alerted only once. It's captured images perhaps half the time, if that. I rarely give poor reviews but this one should not have shipped in its present state. I cannot tell if it is the product firmware, Novi's server, or both that is in serious need of improvement. At this point it is a novelty or curiosity at best, but no where near accomplished enough to be considered a security device. I'll jump the customer service hoops and see if they have solutions, but out of the box it is not what was sold.2/27/16 I just did the firmware updates last night and rebooted the sensor and relay station. Now I cannot even capture an image on command to see how to position the sensor. I deleted them both and recreated them in my iPhone, but that was no help. I'm hoping I can return them as they are useless now. I did purchase a second sensor and tried that, but if it is more than 2 feet from the relay station, it cannot be seen. It too will not take a picture to check positioning, not even 6 feet from the relay (base) station. USELESS!
