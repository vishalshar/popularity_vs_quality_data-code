I liked this a lot the first few days.  But after the 3rd day I had a crack on the face of the watch!  Happend during work but i dont know how.  I work at a large member only wholesale warehouse.  Merchandising and working with customers product at the registers.  If your gonna wear casually, then fine otherwise buyer beware.
