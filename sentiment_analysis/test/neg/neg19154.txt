**please read this review**When I first bought this case 5 weeks ago, I though it was amazing. It looks very manly and function to go with it. The Apple Watch is meant to be worn everyday. This wristband IS NOT. This evening I took the Watch off to get into the shower(even though its waterproof), and the the housing snapped in half...Poorly designed.
