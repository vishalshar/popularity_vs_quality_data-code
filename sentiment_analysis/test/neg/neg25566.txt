I wanted these to be amazing and at first I was duly impressed.  I teach 6-8th graders and these kits did not hold up to even the most gentile students using them.  I was fixing what I could but most of the useful pieces are also the most fragile.  I would not recommend them for a classroom as the initial cost is high and they are not durable.  I had high hopes and the kids liked them until there were no parts left to use.  I have 5 premium kits, 1 arduino, 1 cloud and 1 Deluxe kit and I cannot use most of them in my classroom anymore because of broken parts.  They are a great idea for a family or a single person but they are not made for classroom use.  Even the little screw drivers break immediately.
