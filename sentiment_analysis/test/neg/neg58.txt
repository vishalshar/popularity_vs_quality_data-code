99% of the time the fingerprint does NOT work, my whole family has 5 fingers scanned and it simply DOES NOT work 99% of the time.  The numbers to put in a code - you can NOT see them during the day so you can't use that option unless it's dark out.  The bluetooth feature - that works, BUT you MUST walk up to the door and then open the APP first, knocking on your phone doesn't work until you open the app - which of course if you are fumbling with your phone then you can use the app to open the door, but it's no less cumbersome than using a normal key lock.  Of course, if you are going to use the key to open this lock - you best be able to stand on your head to accomplish that feat!  We have had ours 2 weeks and tried to adapt but nothing works and for this price - at least 2 out of the 4 features should work, I will be returning ours.Update:  Ordered a different brand, fingerprint works EVERY TIME, numbers are visible during the day, it works!
