11/29/2016 - This is my third re-write of this review. I will preempt my review with the statement that I continue to be a loyal customer of the Netatmo family of products for the last two or so years. I own the weather station, additional modules, rain guague, the indoor camera, etc. I've not had problems with any of those.That brings me to the Netatmo Presence. At this point it seems as though there are two major issues with the camera:First, and quite concerning, is that all of the product literature I received (and when I ordered) said it included a 16gb SD card, which could be upgraded to 32gb. That's not what I got. I got an 8gb card. I found this out as I had issues with the stock SD card in the unit, so I went ahead and ordered a 32gb card. Upon receiving the 32gb card I swapped out the stock card. The stock card was ONLY an 8gb card. Upon doing a little bit of research online, I'm not alone. Several US customers have been finding 8gb cards despite all of the product literature stating 16gb. I also have come to understand that the company has changed some of their site language now to show 8gb, but that was NOT the case when these initial units were purchased. It's on paper, in writing, 16gb. This is a big problem and needs to be addressed.Second, and even more concerning, the SD cards have failed for me during two rain events thus far, and I've only had the camera installed for one week. It is under an overhang on the roof, so it's not even in a location that gets direct water unless it's a very windy situation. I can say with anecdotal certainty (if that's a thing), that the failure is a moisture issue. Both times of the SD card failure were at the peak of the rain events that were moving through. The camera shuts off and says "Defective SD Card". When you open up the back, it becomes pretty obvious that despite all of the other waterproofing, there is nothing but grease to waterproof the SD card. This is a huge design issue that needs a fix asap, and we as early adopters of this product need some direct feedback from the company that they will take care of this. This rain failure issue is also echoed by others in the product forums, so I'm fairly confident I'm not taking an unscientific leap here.I wrote in my prior review, which is being replaced by this one, that this, when working, is what I consider a 5-star product. I want this product to work, and will absolutely update my review when/if things are resolved. With that said, the false advertising on the 16gb stock card, and the SD moisture failures on an outdoor camera, are huge issues. I still have faith in the company that's delivered quality products several times over, but that goodwill and trust are eroding quickly. There are really no excuses for either of these issues, and I hope that they communicate a plan with their loyal customer base quickly.
