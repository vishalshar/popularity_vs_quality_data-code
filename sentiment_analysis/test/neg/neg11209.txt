This gadget took a long time to get to me. So that is the first negative thing. Then the most serious, it needs a very strong signal to be really effective. Wish I knew about this prior to buying. Called the company tech support because after installing it, it was not working per specs. And they told me that the gadget has a VERY small antenna and consequently needs a very strong WiFi signal to work. Say what? I am very disappointed in this. Now I have to buy one or two range extenders and even then I am not confident that it will work. Very sorry that I purchased this item.UPDATE Jan 8th 2017. I finally removed this and replaced it with RING. Ring Works perfectly.
