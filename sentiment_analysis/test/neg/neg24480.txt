Not suitable for travel, need 'good' internet connection, otherwise hours to upload.  Maybe completed 1 upload in 9 days of travel.  Also need a computer that you'll have to worry about.  Can upload to your computer without internet but 99.5% of pics unusable or need time consuming editing.  The double tap cannot be depended upon, not sure if it even works.  Plowing through thousands of pics is not something most people have time for.
