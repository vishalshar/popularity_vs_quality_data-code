Since I purchased this product about 2 months ago, it has not worked reliably. I have programmed it to turn on and turn off one bulb at pre-set times. It works for a few days and then it stops working and I have to reset the bulb and re-add it onto the LIFX ios app.  I also tried it with the IF app with the same results. Hopefully, future LIFX app updates will resolve this problem.
