I bought this thing with modest expectations and it failed to deliver.Its ability to actually connect to the iPad is erratic.  It fails 2 out 3 times and then I need to restart everything.  I'm on the latest firmware etc and it is charged, so that is not the issue.Also, the tip does not give a decent writing or drawing sensation.  I'd go as far as to say it's useless for actual writing and only vaguely useful for drawing.  I had much more success with the Paper app when I just used my finger.Overall, this thing is not worth the trouble or money and will end up gathering dust in your drawer.
