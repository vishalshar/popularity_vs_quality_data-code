On the surface it looks great, meant for senior citizens, etc. In actuality there are a few flaws in the execution of the design.As many have pointed out, the volume will not go up very high. Many seniors have difficulty hearing and my mother could not hear it "ring" with any of the offered tones. I was able to solve that by downloading other ring tones using Zedge that had better volume than those offered with this phone.The case is totally black (looks gray in photo) and the keys on the bottom to go back, etc are very small & virtually impossible to see  if you have impaired vision.The phone is very small and is clumsy for hands with arthritisNo hard or gel case available for protection, only those pouches. If you have arthritic hands it is difficult  to get it out of the pouch to answer a call before it stops ringing. Those cases do not offer much protection and no other case will fit on the phones.The 5Star is there for emergency assistance, however, if you fall & have it in your hand chances are it's gonna break when you fall or you may be so injured that you cannot get it out of the pouch to push that button. I realize that it will dial automatically IF it senses a fall, I presume that only works if you do have it in your hand and it doesn't break in the fall.I wish I had been able to see and examine it before my mother bought it, very disappointed in the overall design. I think she regrets the purchase also.If you are a senior and want a "smart phone" there are better options & you can get 5Star without it. I would not recommend this to anyone.
