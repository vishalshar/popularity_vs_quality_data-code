Received my Ollie today, charged it up and successfully connected to it on the Android app.  The app then said that Ollie needed new firmware and proceeded to download it.  Now the item has blue led lights on, it won't connect to the app (app keeps saying to wake ollie), attempt to wake it but nothing happens, the only thing it's capable of is being a blue night light.Also a HUGE point to make about the design.  I would imagine a lot of people will want to use this outdoors, the problem with that is that it REQUIRES it be plugged in to a power source to wake it.  Who in their right mind would create an item to be used outdoors, but would need it to be plugged in in order to connect to their phone???  Only a second grader would design something like this.
