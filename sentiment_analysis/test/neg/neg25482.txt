Worked well with an insanely easy setup. The problem was the lack of functionality. The picture was very grainy even with high speed internet. Worked well in low light. Controls were poor. The camera only moves in increments and does not pan in one smooth motion. Because of the incidents, the laser is almost not even worth using. Every time you use the laser, it automatically records the video of you using it. The laser only stays on for 15 second and turns off so if you want to play with your pet for 20 minutes with the laser, you end up with 80 videos.. just poorly done all around and the plastic felt cheap. I returned the product. Get the pet cube, I did.
