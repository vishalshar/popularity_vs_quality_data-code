As with all the Chinese cameras this phones home to China and does not support any other protocol like ONVIF so you are limited to using this with your phone and hoping their servers aren't spying on your data. In addition to that it disconnected constantly. I ended up sending it back.This camera has posts 23, 80, and 554 open. 23 is responding to telnet and shows a "GM Login:" prompt. There is no documented password for this and it can be used to exploit the camera. STAY AWAY.
