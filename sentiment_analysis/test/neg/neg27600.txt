I had to return it for a refund. However, I'm not basing my review just on the fact that the touchpad didn't work properly. Let me just list the problems.1. The sound is awful. I mean it's really really bad. My smartphone has considerably better sound than this laptop.2. Forget about using f.lux, it makes the screen blink uncontrollably.3. The screen has a lot of backlight bleed and the viewing angle is terrible. I mean it's really bad. If you turn this screen more than 5 degrees it's almost invisible.4. It's really wide, make sure to take note of how wide it is because you're going to look silly carrying this around.5. The numpad is just silly. It throws off the alignment of everything. That space could have been used to put in front firing speakers.On the upside, it's very light and looks sleek.And yes, I did have to return it because the trackpad was only registering double-clicks about 70% of the time. I've read that other people have also had troubles with the trackpad but I didn't see anything specific to double clicking so I'm assuming I just got a bad unit. My review isn't based on that but it's never fun to have to return a new laptop because something as basic as the trackpad not working.
