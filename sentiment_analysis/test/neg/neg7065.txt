Loved the replacement collar until we got snow and then it stopped working; lights said it was working some of the time, but it wasn't- put in a bag of rice and removed the battery would work again, but then stop- changed batteries- same thing.  It says its waterproof, but must be the one we got is defective or the batteries are bad.  Frustrating!
