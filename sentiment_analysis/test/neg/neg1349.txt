This is a product I want to love but it's not quite there yet.Often when I open the live feed I have to watch a fully black screen for 10-60 seconds before the video starts trickling in through a pixelated/tearing feed. Often sound works during this period but video doesn't. This is despite the unit being less than 6 feet from my wifi b/g/n/AC 2.4ghz router. In fact the unit nearly has line of sight through our glass front door. So I wouldn't think this is a connectivity issue.Also, unfortunately because my mounting bracket is screwed flush directly into the brick of our house the unit sits almost an inch off the wall creating a sizeable gap between the unit and the wall. Now I'm worried about rain/moisture getting into the unit from the back. Not sure how I'm going to fix that yet - would appreciate suggestions from Kuna.These issues have me on the fence on keeping/returning the unit or purchasing the yearly subscription.
