I bought two of these bags, one for each dog and leash. I love the ideaand it is a much better solution than my current one of tying the filled bags to the leashbut the design is lacking in a few key areas.1) There is no elastic band or bit of Velcro to keep closed the pocket holding the roll of bags. During my first use, I dumped out the roll, which unrolled down the street as I chased behind. I then stood there tethered to two rambunctious boxers eager to continue their walk, while I tried to rewind the roll.2) The elastic drawstring does not stay closed.3) With a single carabiner holding the bag to the leash, it swings wildly and, when full, distracts my dogs.I installed this onto my leather leashes by using a hole punch the same size as the carabiner, since the carabiner was too small to accommodate the width of the leash. This no doubt allows it to swing more than it would if installed through the loop of the handle, but I like having the bag a bit further down from my handespecially because I am managing two exuberant boxers and the leads are easily tangled. My solution to the wild swinging was to purchase two more small carabiners and punch two new holes, which allows the bag to hang from the leash more like a flag, thus stabilizing it. With a drop of fabric glue and Velcro, I have created a closure for the pocket where the new bags are kept. I replaced the drawstring slide with a locking slide, such as you would find on the drawstring of a light jacket.Though I've solved what I view as design flaws,I've now spent another $4 per bag and when added to the original price of $18.99, my thoughts are this product is simply priced too high. Since I sew, I could have made my own bags for far less, but was enticed by the cute videos the inventors made. I wish them all the luck, but think they need to modify their design if they want to be able to charge this much for their bag. Had I not been able to easily modify them, I would have returned them.
