I wanted to really like this as running power to a camera where this would go would be difficult. Setup was easy and at first it seemed to work well. Video was good, the audio both ways was great. Motion detection the first day was when I tested it. When my 7 year daughter did some testing it wouldn't trigger. Night came and the glare of the bulb was horrible. They should close the bottom off so the light doesn't shine right on the camera. Ii walked out to my car that was right in front of it and it never triggered. I went to both sides of the car and the only way I could trigger detection was by walking right up to the camera. Now I couldn't trigger it but when bugs flew by the camera the light reflecting off them would trigger it. So night time (when I really wanted to monitor it ) was useless. Day two it wouldn't come online. Power cycled it and it eventually came back up. However daytime motion detection became weak. Then I tried to use it later that day and it was back offline and has remained offline. I know the WiFI is fine because I have a standard Bullet camera at my front door and it never looses a signal. That camera is further away from the router than this one. I did upgrade firmware. You use Bluetooth to initially configure it, they should allow you to use bluetooth to reset it when it goes offline. It is going back and I'll get another $50 bullet camera and figure a way for power.
