A piece of junk. I tried two Android cell phones, one is nexus 6P. None of them can connect to skybell HD. I'm using Asus 68U router. 2.4G wireless signal is strong and my cell phone is using 2.4G network. When doing initial setup, the red/green light is blinking, but I can not connect to the skyxxxx in the steps. It shows connection is lost and quit. Very annoying. The red/green light is still flashing even I'm not doing anything. Immediately return it to amazon. A piece of junk. software quality is poor.
