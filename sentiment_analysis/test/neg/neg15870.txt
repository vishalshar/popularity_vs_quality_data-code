Neat product. Don't expect pro results. If you want real nice scans, opt for a film scanner.The marketing and packaging design are second to none.The product itself, plastic, flimsy, very delicate gears to roll the film forward. The software is a bit strange to figure out (no direction or documentation) there's no real white balance settings, it's just presets and temperature +/- increments.I was expecting better, but then I remembered I only spend $50
