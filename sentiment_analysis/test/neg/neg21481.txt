I agree with a2zmomma, same experience here:  the product arrived wrapped in a huge clear plastic bag, knotted once, turned twisted, wrapped around, and knotted again.  I can tell why it's wrapped that way upon opening the bag, there is large amount of oil already in the bag from the leaking jar, very messy.  When I turned opened the jar lid, I found the foil part of the seal separated from the base plastic still attached to the jar but leaking not seal tight.  By looking though the leaking clear plastic base seal, the content seemed spoiled with cloudy particles.  The foil seal wrinkled, the labels a little peeled, ... made me wonder if this Peter Lamas Spa Sensual hand scrub had been sitting under the hot sun in some kind of display window for the entire last summer before shipping to me this April.  It seemed dated and unsafe for use.  Therefore, must return.  Very bad purchasing experience.
