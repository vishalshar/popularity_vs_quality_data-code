Very disappointed in these headphones.  I had to have my first pair replaced after the war padding/cover started to separate and tear from the plastic.  My second pair has started to tear as well after about 3 months.  Ask, the metal at the adjustment point is flimsy and has bent.Basically these are trash.  But the Bluetooth works, so that's good...
