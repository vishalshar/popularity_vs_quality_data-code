Very nice looking but does not work with my Samsung Galaxy S5. Would've been nice if they would have made it clear that there were "known issues" with some Android devices, seems like something they might want to put on the product page so people can avoid the hassle. I ended up with a device that is useless with my phone, and as it does not have a built in display that means it is completely without functionality for me. My excitement at receiving my LEAF turned to frustration as it failed to pair with my phone even after I did all of the steps in their troubleshooting. Oh, all of the steps except to try pairing it with another device, what an utterly ridiculous and unhelpful suggestion. I own one phone and I expected my LEAF to work with it, but as it does not I guess I'll be returning it to Amazon. Did not like the app, either - very disappointing all around. I guess I'll be getting the Fitbit Alta.
