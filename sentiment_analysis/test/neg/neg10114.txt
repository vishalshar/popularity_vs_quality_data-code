I just purchased this and did all the required charging of Lumopack etc. The company advertises charge an iPhone in "appx 6 min" to a full charge.Was a little suspicious, but the reviews said its great, works well, "Love it", so thought I'd give it a chance. Well needless to say, I tried to charge my iPhone that was at a 4% charge and an hour and half later its only at 15%!  VERY disappointing. So I rechecked all plugs, cables etc, Lumopack said it was fully charged, etc. Now its been 3 and half hours later, I'm now at 54%. How is that "Fast Charging?" My Mophie charger did a way better job and for significantly cheaper.  The Company does NOT provide any way for you to contact them to tell them about product. They just want their "start up" money, but product is not worth the money. At least not at this time. Makes you wonder about those "reviews" Were they the inventors??I will agree that the color looked nice , but thats it.  My product will be returned tomorrow. VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!!!
