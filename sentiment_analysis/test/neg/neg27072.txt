I wanted to Love this ... I have fairly long lashes but who doesnt like a bit extra  .. this just seemed to make a mess .. it clumped , it dried and it got basically all over under/over as the day went on .. This is not something I could use as I looked like a racoon within several hours :) . I was happy it was vegan and not tested on animals and perhaps I got a bad one .. or old one .. but it was not a pretty site for sure
