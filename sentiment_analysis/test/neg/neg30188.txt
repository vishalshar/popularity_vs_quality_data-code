I like the look of it, but it takes a long time to charge and then my phone loses the charge very rapidly. When I use an apple charger it can get a full charge in under an hour that lasts multiple days.  When I use this one, it takes several hours and needs to be recharged after 2-3 hours of light use.  Nice idea, but not powerful enough to be a reasonable solution ESPECIALLY when traveling.
