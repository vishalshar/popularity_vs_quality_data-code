They did a great job describing all of the features that the products has except it was not made clear that all of the higher end feature require a subscription to a service. If you are looking to use this for security purposes why not add features to your alarm system and pay to have they monitored 24/7. Also, the camera  does not have night capabilities which renders it virtually useless. Very disappointed.
