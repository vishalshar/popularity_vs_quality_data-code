I'm not impressed. These are very cheaply made, not worth the price. I used them just as instructed and a few of the guards started to tear as I was carefully, so I would not damage the bristles of my brushes, pushing the guards up towards them. Either I got a defective package of these, or they are simply poorly constructed of cheap materials. I suspect the latter. I will not be buying more.
