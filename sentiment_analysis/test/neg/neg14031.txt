Talk about wasting money ....  I kept trying to use this camera on a few trips ....  in Sept fully charged it took about 10 minutes worth of boring pics ....  fast forward to my last outing ...  where I wore it all day long ......  I lost the entire day.  Yeah I bought it to long ago to return so it's off to the oven to be melted into nothingness. ..  save your money people
