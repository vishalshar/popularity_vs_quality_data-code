Haven't been able to use it as I have an Android phone. I admit, I didn't realize that the software was only for iOS devices until after I had received it and couldn't find the app in Google Play. I emailed the company and they said that they would be releasing an Android version in December. Well, it's now March and no Android version. Been too long to return now. I'm just going to give it to my bosses kids who have iPhones.
