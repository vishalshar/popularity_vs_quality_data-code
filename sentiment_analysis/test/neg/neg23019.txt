I received these on Oct 5th and immediately placed them in my six year old son's shoes. He was very excited and loved them.However here we are two months later and the hickies have broken so often that we have used all the  spares, his little shoes only require 4 per shoe, and now I have had to purchase shoe laces  to replace the hickies in his shoes.Very disappointed in the quality for the price paid.
