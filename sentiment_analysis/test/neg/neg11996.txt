I emailed CURB to ask if this product  is UL listed and they stated that it is. IT IS NOT. See the attached picture. The typical UL listing is not on the product's label. A building permit should be obtained to install such a device. My electrician and my town's electricial inspector both contend that such a NON-UL approved device does not meet code and should not be installed. I am returning this itemCURB Home Energy Monitoring System (Solar Ready)
