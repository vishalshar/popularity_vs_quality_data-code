Great concept but still flawed. Have had this for two months and now it won't even connect via Bluetooth. The manual lock notification are random and don't log in the access list. Was really hoping this would work but two months in and already having problems. To top it all off I can't return it since its past 30 days. Save your money and don't purchase.
