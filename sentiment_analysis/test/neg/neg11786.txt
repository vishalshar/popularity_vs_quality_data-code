While I'm impressed with the concept and thought put into the design, overall execution was not good.  When this unit arrived I was excited to install it onto my Apple Watch.  Carefully looking at the single picture and 1-sentence installation warning "Do not over tighten screws", I proceeded with installation.  The 2 halves of the watch case have rubber provisions inside them to fit where the original band slots are, which helps make the overall fit-and-finish good.  There is also rubber on the right half to interface the case button and dial to the watch button and dial.  Once I finally got the left half on the watch (very snug fit - borderline difficult to get onto the watch), I installed the right half.  Using all the strength that I had, I finally got the two halves close to each other (about 2mm gap still existed).  I installed the screws and tightened it up thinking the screws will bring the two halves together for a line-to-line fit.  While I did achieve a good fit finally on the case, I then learned that by having a line-to-line fit on the case interferes with the functionality of the dial, specifically pushing the dial.  The case was continuously keeping the watch dial depressed causing the watch to act erratically.  I then tried to uninstall the case from the watch and nearly threw everything out the window as it was nearly impossible to remove.I wanted this band as a rugged solution and for a more casual look with frequent changes to other bands as desired.  While the idea is leaning towards a rugged style and design, the lack of proper fit and nearly impossible installation and removal makes this a bad execution of a good design idea.
