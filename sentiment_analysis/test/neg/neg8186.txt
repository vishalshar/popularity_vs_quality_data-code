I'll admit a great deal of uncertainty in ordering this item based on the reviews, especially those that dealt with installation problems.  However, it did exactly what I wanted and the price was reasonable.  I took a chance.  Installation (via the iOS app) was trouble-free.  I'll admit a few moments of doubt when steps seemed to take a long time, but ultimately everything worked well, the firmware was automatically updated and the unit is operating as claimed.EDIT 07/24/2016After using this unit for a while, I find that the physical unit itself seems to be fine -- no issues remaining connected to WiFi or reporting motion.  BUT ... I have serious problems with the app (using iOS 9.3.3).  When I sign in, motion reports are initially received without any problem.  After a while, the reports stop and I need to sign out and sign back in to continue receiving reports.  That is, the most recent motion report I see while signed in might be hours ago.  If I sign out and then sign back in, reports of motion over the preceding time period suddenly appear.  Also, more frequently than not, when I try to clear the reports, I receive an error message, "Sorry, try again later."  After a few more tries, clearing the list will occur.  Seems like a great physical device with a buggy, annoying iOS app.
