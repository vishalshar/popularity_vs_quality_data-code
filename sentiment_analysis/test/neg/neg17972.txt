Bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it. However, after 2 months the product does not hold a charge and therefore he cannot use it. If the product still worked, I would give it 5 stars. Since it is past the 30 day return date, we are unable to exchange it and are left with an unusable product. The only option we have is to buy a new one, and at the price I would much rather exchange for one that works. I cannot find a way to contact amazon to see if they would exchange the product because it keeps telling me it is past the date to return. I do not want to return, just exchange.
