We have been waiting on this game for a long time and we finally received it today. The box was damanaged.  The advertisement said there were 10 mouthpieces and the box said 5 but there were still 10 in there which I was happy about but why did the box say 5?  The cards felt really cheap and were mostly duplicates and misspelled.  Please PLEASE save yourself the trouble and do NOT buy this knockoff!
