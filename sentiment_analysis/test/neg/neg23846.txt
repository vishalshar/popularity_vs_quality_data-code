Have used this case for less than a week and the first drop of the phone in the holster and the screen protector cracked.  I have dropped the phone the same way getting out of the car multiple times with Spigen case in the holster without any problems.  So far, not impressed with the case and it's protection of my phone.  There doesn't seem to be any lip or gap from the top of the case to the face of the phone.  This was probably why the screen protector cracked when dropped.I did have an older version for my iphone 5.  Didn't have any problem with that product.  That case was raised up above the screen unlike the Crystal Series.  I was wanting the Fuzion, but didn't want to spend twice the money.  I think I may have saved myself $50 minus a new screen protector.
