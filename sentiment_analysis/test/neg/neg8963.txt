Product has a critical design flaw which made me uncomfortable with connecting this device for long-term use. I have multiples devices connected to my network, phone, 2nd network and my personal cloud so my network is positioned on a tall bookcase to prevent little hands from reaching the device. The plug instick cord needed to be connected to the device and the cord was not long enought to reach my surge protector,  so I picked up a new surge protector. Then once the item was plugged into the device the weight of the cord bent the device down (see photo) with this weight eventually will damage the cord' s connected...so with this design issue I could not use this device.  The prototype was original a smaller square device that with the shape and size might have resolved this issue. If you have a lot of connections on your network I would recommend looking for a wireless connnectable system you could place anywhere to the house. Returning this item.
