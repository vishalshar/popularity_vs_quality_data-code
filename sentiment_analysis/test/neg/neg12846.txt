very unreliable.  Would pair, but then could only detect at short range.  Useless for finding a misplaced item.  It would frequently be disconnected and could not find the item even at close range.  It would often not be detected at all.  I re-paired it multiple times to attempt to get it to connect.  It would work again, but only with the very low range.  Eventually could not re-pair at all and returned the item.iPhone 5s
