If you want to use Sphero 2.0 as a remote controlled toy, it's fine. But if you want a robots programming platform, it's a big mistake to choose it as it is the only robot I know that doesn't know its relative orientation in the beginning of the execution of the program so you need to calibrate it for each execution, this is really annoying. The problem is that it uses you as a reference for motion, which is different from any other robot that uses himself as a reference hence doesn't need this kind of calibration. Consequence, kids don't learn to think by "being the robot" when programming but learn a more classical computer programming approach.
