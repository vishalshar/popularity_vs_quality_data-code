I really wanted to love this Bento box but it just didn't work out for my 4 year old.  He's starting PreK this year and wanted him to have a hot/cold lunch to take with him.  I had him open the box several times and wasn't always successful, and it also took a while for him to open it.  The compartments are great and can hold quite a bit of food!  If my son was a few years older, I think it would work, and maybe the price will drop by then  ;)
