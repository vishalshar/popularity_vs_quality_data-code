WE bought this product in May 3025 and within 30 days, started to notice scratches on the lenses. Not very disturbing ay first but within a few more weeks of normal usage, noticed deep scratches that could not be cleaned or buffed out. A nice concept, but poor qualith for something advertised as "Durable".
