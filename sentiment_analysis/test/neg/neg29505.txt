For reference, I have used a Polar, Timex and UA chest strap monitor as well as a Garmin, Fitbit and Basis (Peak) fitness trackers.  The Basis Peak was by far my favorite.  It was the most accurate (steps, sleep and HR) and had the perks of a smart watch. Unfortunately, due to a safety issue it was recalled and will no longer be supported.  I've been searching for my replacement and its big shoes to fill.I thought the Pebble 2 HR was perfect...it had all the features I was looking for (steps, hr, calorie count and sleep).  Plus the price was great and I actually liked the sporty-techy-geeky look of it- some reviewers didn't.  I really really wanted to love it. But as it turns out I am so disappointed and I hate it!! For a smartwatch its great, I would give it 4 maybe even 5 stars. But as a fitness tracker its awful and is only getting 2 stars because the sleep tracking is decent.I've had it for 2 days and have used it for a 3 mile walk, yoga, weight lifting and a 40 minute stair machine session.  I am a fitness freak, healthy and I know during my workouts, my heart rate should be well over 100 at any given time and during cardio should be over 130.  I dont think the Pebble has picked  up anything over 100bpm for more than a minutes time.  I just used it on the stair machine for 40minutes and it was all over the place. EVERY time i looked at it, the number was different...88...62...98..76,...89...58 and when I checked my HR manually it was 132.As for the step count, its as bad as the Fitbit.  I woke up with 80 steps already.  It very sensitive, tracks any movement of the wrist as a step and way over estimates.My other issue is you can start a workout (walk, run or general workout) and it will track/display your HR and time.  Then when you end the session, it ends and its gone. There is no way to go back and look at past workouts to track time, calorie burn during workout, average heart rate during workout. So its pointless to even try to track a workout session.I gonna try it out for a few more days. I hope Pebble does updates and can improve it. I like the way it looks, i like the customization, and all the other features, it a fun watch...but I really didn't want just a watch or I would have gotten one.
