Was so excited to recieve this case so of course took out of package and tried it right away. First time it stuck great to the mirror. Then tried the wall, tv, computer, etc and it stuck pretty well. Then time came to show my family and stuck to the wall and it fell, I tried again and it fell again, this time shattering so now glass chunks are falling out. This was all in a span of 20 minutes. Went from a great to a terrible day...
