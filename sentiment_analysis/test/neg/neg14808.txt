Good sound. Howeverk I wish that the cord unplugged from the headphone. Because the cord does not disconnect one must pull the cord out of their jacket when taking off their helmet. This can be very difficult because most ski jackets have the cord in a zipper compartment that is difficult to remove. Additionally, the clip on the volume control got caught on something when I was walking and ripped the cover off. Not very well attached. If you purchase this product, preemptively glue or tape the volume control box to prevent this.
