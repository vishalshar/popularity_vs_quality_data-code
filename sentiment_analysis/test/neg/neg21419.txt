Initially the cube was great until about three weeks later when it got an unexplained line across it that ruins the picture. During this time it was transported only in it's original box and used for less than 10 hours total.  I emailed customer service and never received a reply.  Expecting to use this for my frequent deployments, I was pretty disappointed that they didn't reply to me.  The concept is great but a defective item with ZERO customer support is definitely not worth spending almost $300 for.
