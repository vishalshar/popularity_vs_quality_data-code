I bought this tripod to take rock climbing videos at the base of the crag with my phone. The tripod legs are excellent for attaching to small tree branches and propping up on uneven rocks and terrain, but the ball and socket joint broke under normal usage. Additionally, the cell phone holder is not strong enough to hold an iPhone 6 plus with case in place--might work better with a less smooth case. Overall I cannot recommend this product unless you are using a smaller phone and are very gentle with the ball and socket joint.More info: The socket part of the attachment is made of plastic and cracked after tightening the twist joint. Now, the joint does not hold the weight of the phone in any direction except completely vertical, which makes the tripod virtually worthless.6/23/15 EDIT: I contacted customer service at RIF6 and they issued a full refund even though the 1 month window for returns had expired.
