I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It has already broken! He used it once and the whole top of the connector ripped off.  I need to return for a full refund; this is not an inexpensive piece of luggage but told by Amazon I'm pass the date of return!  I have been in the hospital for a week and had to return to work immediately, meaning traveling!  Really, can't return my $400.00 luggage????
