This is listed with the apple measurement of 42mm but there is just one problem. The last 4 holes do not have the ability for you to use the clip to hold the wristband down. It really is not useful in this state. I am glad I bought it so I did not waste my money on the actual websites more expensive version, but I will be trying to sell it on ebay. Also the inability to properly press down the clock face accurately is just awful for the user. Also the case does not come together completely when screws are tightened.
