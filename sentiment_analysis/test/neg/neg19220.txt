This product has great potential, but as others have reported the battery is a VERY common problem and the lack of responsive customer service is a deal-breaker.  Not sure how the "Vine" reviewers received such an expensive product for free AND had fully working components, with rave reviews, but perhaps there is a flaw in the program or their products received better QC before shipment.I contacted support four (4) days ago after building the humanoid robot and finding that the battery would not charge and have not heard a peep.  I researched the battery problem via Amazon reviews and other posts on the Internet and found this to be a very common issue.  It is ridiculous that a identified and common issue cannot be addressed within a reasonable amount of time, and hearing that when replacements (several of which were still faulty) are shipped, it takes an additional 7-10 days.  Why on earth is this an issue?  Why isn't JIMU customer service or sales contacting purchasers and seeing if they have experienced this via sales records?  Customer service and product quality are huge factors for me when deciding purchases.  If you cannot stand behind your product, perhaps there is a reason for that.I have emailed customer service at the JIMU support email address posted in response to a previous battery issue a second time and am awaiting a reply before returning the product as defective.This would be a great robotics kit for what is in it, but there are some flaws.  If the battery or controller does not work, you're basically left with a 2/3-scale LEGO EV3 kit and 16 servos for floppy joints (no power, no rigidity).Other areas needing improvement:- Everything is packaged in a nice box, yet all of the multitude of tiny pieces are in baggies within cardboard boxes.  While it looks really nice nice, it will not fair well with repeated use and the baggies make it difficult to hunt items needed in the builds.  Dumping the pieces into the small cardboard boxes would not be any better, as there are holes at the top/bottom for removing from the compartments in the "book."  This kit should have came in a more durable plastic box with easily accessible compartments or at least replace the cardboard boxes with more durable plastic or vinyl boxes.- The LEGO-like pieces are not consistent in shape/fill.  The beams are not smooth all around, but have small hollow areas and many have small holes at one end (perhaps from the manufacture process).- The manual is only available on a Tablet or phone, no physical copy is available.  While I was quite upset with this at first, I found during the build process that it was nice to be able to rotate the model around to see where things line up and fit together, yet a physical build guide is essential for many reasons: 1) if support for the product ends, the app may/will eventually stop working too; i.e., no more build guide, 2) not ideal for a classroom environment as no PC component, and 3) some people like to review all steps in advance by flipping through the build guide, using an app limits this option.- No current IDE for programming the robot from your PC, though pre-programmed applications are available via the app.  Not being able to write and design programs for the robot limits its overall functionality.  While there may be a "rag-doll" mode to program, this leaves much to be desired in the form of learning to program robots.- I did have issues running the app the first few times, as it would crash, but this stopped after the first three (3) times.  I am running the app on a 9.7" Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 with the latest updates, so platform should not be the issue.
