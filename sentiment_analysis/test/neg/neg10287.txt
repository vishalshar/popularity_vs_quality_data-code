First day with Alex and a couple of problems right off the bat.  The software would hang, then crash, on my iPhone 7 with iOS 10.1.1 (while it was "fetching posture data" and making the screen flash in an obviously unintentional manner).  "I'll just go to the website and see if there's something about this", I thought.  No SUPPORT section on the website, no user forum; just an FAQ, a bunch of videos, and a "blog" with a series of short articles on why you should buy Alex in the first place.  HUGE red flag (and the reason for only two stars).  Hopefully they'll fix that soon.After a couple of glitch sessions, the sync process is no longer crashing the software, but it also doesn't seem to be fetching the data.  I'll gladly come back and up my rating if things improve, but initial impressions are not good.
