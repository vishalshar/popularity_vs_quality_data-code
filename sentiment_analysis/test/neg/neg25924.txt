Did not sync with my phone. I had tried every possibility and followed instructions on pebble's forums. My phone is Meizu M3 note. My phone works fine with all other smart watches and bluetooth devices. Since Fitbit has bought it thus I have returned it to Amazon because I won't be getting one to one support.
