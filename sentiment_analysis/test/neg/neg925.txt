Two of these were ordered on different dates. Both received were the 2.0 Classic but were not the XL. I had to return both. Disappointed about receiving the wrong item that was supposed to be a gift. Since both received were wrong, it makes me wonder if this is intentional. As for the Man Pack itself, it seems to be a high quality, useful bag. I'm just going to order directly from Man-Pack.
