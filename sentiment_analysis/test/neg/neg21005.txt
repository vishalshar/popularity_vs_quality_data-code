I would not buy this cooler unless you have zero issues having NO customer service support.  When my cooler arrived, it was obviously used because the wheels were scratched, and the cutting board had old residue from food or drinks from the prior user.  Also, the battery would not charge and does not work.  I would assume this to be due to the fact that these coolers are not selling at anticipated pace, and the batteries are old.  I tried to contact the manufacturer on several occasions, but the website is not functioning correctly and I did not get a response at all, from several emails that I sent (other than the initial automated response advising someone would contact me -no one every did).  I gave them a chance and I thought this was a good idea, but I would not recommend this product to anyone looking to make a longterm investment, due to the lack of support, for such an expensive product. I should have listened to reviews from other consumers, and saved hundreds of dollars.  Consider yourself warned.
