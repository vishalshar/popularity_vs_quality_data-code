If I could give this zero stars I would.  This is my 9th DLink product purchased along with my cameras.  Absolute garbage.  I have tried to set it up on multiple devices.  There is no way to set it up via computer??????????  The App hangs up in setup.  Tells me to login to device, done.  Login to home network, done.........then it says login to home network (did it again), nope............again, nope.  The app is now locked on that screen telling me to login to home network.  I AM!  Uninstalled and reinstalled app on all 3 of my mobile devices!Garbage.  Absolute garbage!  I want my money back.  And I'm not paying for shipping back!
