I was underwhelmed and returned my chipolo.  Over a period of about 5 days I twice lost my phone and once lost my keys.  I found that with a supposedly great way to recover lost items through this technology, I actually was more careless/forgetful than before - and worse, in all three instances I had to find my valuables "the old fashioned way".  For the keys, I was directed twice to the house of my neighbor across the street, but the keys were nowhere to be found.  Then, trying for a 3rd time, I was directed to the public park about 100' away from my front door.  Finally, a couple hours and much frustration and worry later, I tried for a 4th time and it took my right to my master bedroom, where the keys were hiding in a fold of the bedding.The "find phone" feature sometimes worked, and sometimes even though I tested it by shaking the chipolo like a Richter scale 9 earthquake, and from a distance of about a foot, nada.For me, not ready for prime time.
