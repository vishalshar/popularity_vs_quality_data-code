I would like to like this product but I can't, as it does not include a charging cable.Nowhere on the product web page is it started that the charging cable is not included, even though it is pictured with a cable in place. The only place that states that the Apple charging cable is not included is in very tiny letters on the bottom of the box, which you don't see until you have already bought it.So don't do what I did and leave on a trip without opening the box, thinking you can charge your watch with your new purchase. But you can't because you didn't bring your Apple cable and it is Thanksgiving morning and no place to find another cable.So instead of being a great deal, this is just a charging dock with a battery attached. A very expensive battery.This is going back. And shame on Amazon for letting this slip by.And shame again on Amazon for their crappy app that erased my entire review when I tried to include a photo. That made me even madder.
