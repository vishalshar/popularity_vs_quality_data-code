It was pretty dishonest to market this thing as having "AI" and able to learn and adapt. It does nothing of the sort. Cozmo has very predictable and repetitive toy behavior.We've had it for two weeks now and neither my kids nor myself have played with it since day two. Even though it's not too much of a hassle to connect to it, there just isn't any real incentive to go through the trouble after you've seen his very limited trick set. It's now just a zoomer kitty with facial recognition that is a little more complicated to turn on.One last thing, stop the commercials showing Cozmo stopping at a table's edge. As most owner's of Cozmo now know, he falls off edges of everything all the time.
