I really wanted to be good...its just not, at least yet.For some street cred, I am not your average punter when it comes to tech. I would consider a tech expert who has spent roughly $30k on DIY home automation in the past 3 months alone. I have taken chances with kickstarters, spent countless hours rigging my entire new house up with devices for voice command, bought and tested every device under the sun really, and my honest opinion of the kuna lights are that they could be quite good but fail in real world use cases.To start, I have recently installed 2 kuna lights about 15ft. from a top of the line ac router. I I also have higher than average internet speeds (see attached). Upon setup, everything seemed to work fine and dandy until I actually had some one at the door. With the cloud recording trial still active and everything installed correctly, the following situation became a common occurrence:- someone at the door. Kuna app sends push notification- my wife or I scramble to phone to get this push notification- the app opens and we wait for it to load and by that time the person is likely gone- the cameras show a black screen (I.e nothing) and sometimes an error to connect message (see screenshot attached)- the person is gone from the door at this point and we end up killing the app and reloading it- on the second try we may get lucky and the video feed loads or it may a screen with no image again- we review the footage and see who it was at the door- If we weren't at home then we check the app to see who was there. Since we decided to not cough up another $60 or so a year and this product doesn't allow you to use your own hard drive or whatever to store video, then the app is blank if we don't do this within 2 hours.So basically do not expect this product to let you know quickly who is at your door, let alone communicate with them (video loads some of the time), and review the footage at a later date (unless you cough over more money). I really hope they can fix these issues in app/firmware updates but until then they get what is deserved - 1 star.
