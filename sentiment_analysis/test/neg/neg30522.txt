I have Kidde combination smoke/carbon monoxide detector system in the house all interconnected.  The plan was to get one smart battery since all units go off in unison upon activation of any one.  The setup was very easy, but the detector kept reporting low battery (it has speech alerts).  I could not recommend this for anyone with a combination smoke/CO2 Kidde system.  It might work well with others.  Set up was very easy if you have a smart phone.
