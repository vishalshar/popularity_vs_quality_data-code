The fan turns on for a second when CPU undergoes any type of change. Which I wouldn't mind if it was once in a blue moon, but every time I open a new tab or start a program up? Seems a bit much.Specs seemed pretty good for the price I was paying, but the fan noise is unbearable. If I can't figure out a solution definitely returning.
