iBlazr 2s marketing video shows that the flash is timed via bluetooth to fire when the iphone camera takes a picture.  In actuality, the iblazr is on a delay and always fires at the same time.  If you use image stabilization, which takes the photo only when the iphone is steady, then it rarely times the flash and the photo shutter at the same time.There is the option to leave the light on.  In which case you just paid $59.99 for a light that doesnt work as a flash and will continue to shine in your subjects eye.  Keeping the LED on the entire time then makes the Bluetooth feature a moot point and unnecessary.Their support team said, As to returning - due to a Concepter warranty and returning policy, we replace and accept returning on units ordered only via [...] and the other resellers are obliged to replace and accept return by their own.They gave no attention to what I described and asked for a video showing the problem.  I said I would help them by posting a product review on youtube.  That way people will be fully informed on what to expect.  The customer service rep accused me of threatening them and trying to shame them through revenge.  Bottom line, they need to improve their product, tweak their commercial so it doesnt make it seem like it completely synchronizes with the camera shutter, and lastly, work on their customer service skills.
