The tiles don't stay together as well as I would hope.  At times, it just collapses unless you have everything lined up exactly.  Considering that, I think that this is a big task for a 4-year old.  (Description says ages 4-8)  When they say in the description, "15 illustrated StoryWall building panels " in the description, there are 9 are the square pieces, 8 of which have pictures on both sides, the 9th looks like flooring on one side and stripes on the other.  The other 6 are the striped triangles.  I bought it for a 4 1/2 year old.  They just frustrate at it falling down.
