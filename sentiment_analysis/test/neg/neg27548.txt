I thought this was the coolest dog toy I've ever seen but today my dog got hit in the eye by the ball. I think I had it set on the lowest setting, so I'm thankful for that.When he got hit, he yelped and wouldn't open his eye. I took him immediately to the vet and the vet said his eye is scratched. He needs to use medicated eye drops for a few days, but he should be fine.If you decide to purchase this toy, I would suggest aiming the shooter to the wall so that the ball bounces off the wall and goes flying. That is safer for the dog so that he doesn't get hit by the ball as it comes out of the shooter.Also, sometimes, the ball doesn't shoot out of the shooter. The shooting mechanism seems flimsy and I'm not sure how durable it is, or how it will hold up over time.The price tag is a big high for what it is. I feel like this toy should be priced more in the range of $60 or so.
