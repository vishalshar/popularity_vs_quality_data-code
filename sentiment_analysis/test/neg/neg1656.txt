The Lumo Lift worked great for a few weeks.  I wore it every day and appreciated the reminder buzzes.Then after a few weeks, it stopped giving me reminders and would not pair with my phone.  It still charged, and vibrated correctly when I turned it on and calibrated it. But alas...would not vibrate to remind me to stop slouching even if I laid down on my desk. It also failed to pair with my phone after that, despite many attempts, resets, and reinstallations of the app.I opened a ticket with Lumo, and got several rounds of canned "Did you turn it on?  Try turning it on!" auto-replies that clearly showed no human ever read my request for help. Even with the auto-replies, I'd get several emails of, "our support backlog is so great it's going to be a few more days until you hear from us" emails, finally followed by some useless prattle about remembering to charge and calibrate the device -- which I CLEARLY indicated I had done many times in my complaint.See the attached image that only shows the new messages from Lumo -- several levels of reply chains are nested under the seven top-level emails. The visible email is TWO MONTHS into the exchange, and they're STILL asking me if I've installed the app and if I know I need to calibrate the unit each day. ARGHHH!When I finally gave up the first time, I asked for an RMA. They said I had to return it to Amazon where I bought it. Well, guess what -- the 30-day return period had expired by then. So I started all over trying to get the attention of a human for a warranty claim to get a new one. That thread has been going on for a month now, and when I started using a little foul language in my responses, they offered to give me an Amazon credit for the purchase price or send me a replacement unit.The original unit worked so well when I first got it, I asked for the replacement.  I've since gotten two messages asking for my address (which they already had) and promising to get one out to me right away. I still don't have the replacement.  I've held off on posting this review since I'm so excited about the product (not the customer service!) but at this point, enough is enough. I wonder if the "backlog of customer support" tickets is because the company is a part-time basement operation or because they've had so many failures in the field.  Who knows...Aside from those woes, the Lumo really was great when it was working.  Just as described, it gave a gentle nag whenever I needed it. It got to the point that my coworker (who often stands a few inches to my side) would correct her posture every time she heard my Lumo vibration go off!  LOL!That is the only reason this review got two stars, instead of one. I hope I do get a replacement and that it actually lasts for a year or two.The pedometer is not very accurate.  It's a nice add-on, but if you're on the fence for this as a posture coach, don't let that feature sway you.The Android app is useful, but kind of annoying. Every time you start it, you have to wade through pages of fluff until you finally got to the activity dashboard that should have been the very first thing a returning user sees when starting the app.If anyone at Lumo is interested in this review, my ticket numbers are 55339 and 57102. Your system should show about seven emails your system sent me between 2/7/2016 and 4/7/2016, most of which were your, "you'll hear from us in a few days" tripe, and a similar number of emails from me to you. If you have any ability to get my unit shipped, I'd be most appreciative.
