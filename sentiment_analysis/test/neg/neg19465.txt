Maybe my gloves were just too old to be restored, but this actually made them worse.  For a few seconds while the product is drying they are extremely tacky.  However, after about 2 minutes they stop being tacky and instead become slick. The only way to keep them tacky is to spit on them before each and every play.  Not worth the money.  Save a bit more and buy a new pair.
