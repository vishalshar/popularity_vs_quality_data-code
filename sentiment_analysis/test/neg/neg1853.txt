Unfortunately had to return. Return in process as of this review. The horizontal right half of the screen randomly turns solid white. When it's not solid white, there's a subtle flickering of the backlight on the right side of the screen where the white screen occasionally appears. Possibly just a dud.Computer ran fine and performed to my expectations in every other facet. Just couldn't shake having a brand new laptop with such a problem.
