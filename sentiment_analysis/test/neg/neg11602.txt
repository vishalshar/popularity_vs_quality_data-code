Didn't meet expectations at all. Bought it to replace an ASUS rt-66ac with a dying 5g band. The Wifi signal one the Luma may have been better, but the slowness of the DNS to resolve was terrible. You can't set your own dns to overcome that issue. No ability to rename devices. Shutting off wifi is pretty much all or none. Parental controls are a miss. Everything you read in the sales pitch is vague for reason.A good first effort and the hardware seems like it is well manufactured. The app & lack of ability to see what is going on in the network s are the huge let downs.Ended up returning it and getting another asus and a second router to act as and access point on the other side of the house (about $75 less in all)
