Even if you manage to update the firmware which I did successfully it will now be unable to connect to standard networks. Did dozens of tries and resets and just gave up. The network worked well before the update to FW 2.x from the stock that it shipped with.  The bulb is beautiful but the company needs to fix the toxic firmware updates.  Instead of gaining functionality you loose connectivity and turns into a standard bulb.  If you get one of these originals you should not update the firmware it will cripple the bulb.  Tried with android, iOS and Windows to fix the problem with their respective apps and it would not connect and pass the wifi password as it did before, found a lot of guidance in the forums to no avail.  The bulb gets also extremely hot rapidly and it will burn your fingers in the metal body.  Awesome hardware with horrible software, if they fix it I may get it again but wasting a day of life on connectivity issues is enough for anyone.  Leave it at stock firmware and you should be fine even when the functionality will be limited.
