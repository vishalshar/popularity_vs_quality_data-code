Purchased this device as a possible solution to support a lack of internet connection at a intermittently occupied remote facility in Germany. Got it set up and operating here in the US, but was only able to get the initial 100MB of data that came with the purchase of the unit loaded and displaying on the device. Even though I purchased  both a "Data Package" of 1GB, as well as a "top off" of 50 euros worth of data once on site, both of which showed up on my associated iPhone app, the device never appeared to show any additional time other than the rapidly dwindling initial MB. There are effectively no instructions, which is a big problem since this is not a simple product. This situation is even more exacerbated when you attempt to install a local SIM card (not even mentioned in the included instructions), which I tried as a last resort. While after fiddling with the device for over 2 hours, I was able to get the local cell phone provider to recognize the card, as soon as I got the message that it was recognized, this message was immediately replaced with an error message that left me with no additional data. Ultimately this was an expensive (over $120 of now unusable data) and worthless device. I was never sure whether the purchased data may have ultimately rolled into the device as the initial 100mb expired, but with the lack of provided information, Chinese phone support, and the fact that the device was a paper weight until the initial 100mb magically showed up a few days after I set the thing up, I didn't want to take chances. We are biting the bullet and setting up a local data account with a cell phone provider and purchasing that company's hot spot.Thank you Amazon for taking this junk back.Oh yeah, you have to pay for any additional data through Paypal in China.Good Luck.
