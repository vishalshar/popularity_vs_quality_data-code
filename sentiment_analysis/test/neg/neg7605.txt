I really, really wanted this to work.  I even had IOttie send me another one in case the one that I had initially received was defective.  I mounted mine on my road bike.  It rattled like crazy and the top holder would work it's way loose, not enough to make the phone pop out until one day riding across an intersection going about 15 mph.  Just as I went under the traffic light, the phone came loose and was dangling by my headphone cable.  As I eased gently to a stop, it came loose and my phone did a slow mo, end over end over end over end fall.  I feared the worst but thankfully my case and screen cover protected it.  So, that is when I called and received a second iOttie.  I tried it and that one also rattles like crazy.  I just cannot trust this with my IPhone 6.  I really wanted it to work!!!!!!!
