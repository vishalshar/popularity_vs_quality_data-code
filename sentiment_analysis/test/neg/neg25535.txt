Purchased this months ago and then a  6 Month Subscription.  Used its service about 8 times and last time used would not update arrival at EWR.  Keep showing last location (in another country) and finally worked after I arrived home about 1.5 hours after landing.  I kept refreshing the app when landed through the receipt of my suitcase off the carousel and once home tried it again and it work.  Thank you Captain Obvious was my rated G response.  I could expect a lag or delay, but not like this.  I may not renew and try another. I would only recommend if you have a complimentary  system / device and could afford to pay for both.
