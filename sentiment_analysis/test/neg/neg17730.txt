Save your cash and look elsewhere!  Tile has instituted a new model to drive sales where your tiles EXPIRE.  These now have a 1-year life.  I recently opened my tracking app to find a countdown timer on all of my tiles. Tiles older than a year were given two days of life.  The new 4-pack I bought on Amazon was allowed 9 months more of life (a year total).  The tracking app urges me to upgrade to the new gen 3 tiles.  My older tiles, they claim, need to be replaced for "battery life", which is a complete hoax.  I have some of the original tiles from several years ago, which workED just fine until the software change.  I am not interested in buying new tiles every year.  Shame on you, Tile.  I didn't signup for this.
