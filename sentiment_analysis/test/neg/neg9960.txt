Having had this system for about six months I've decided that it was a bad purchase.  It's easy to be taken in by the slick website, the great presentation of the sensor data.  The connectivity for me has been flawless.  However, the accuracy of the sensors is horrific.  Side by side, my sensors do not agree on either the temperature or the humidity.  Humidity accuracy readings over the wide spectrum of temp/humidity fields is difficult for low end systems, but temperature is unforgivable.  My low end Oregon Scientific remote sensors are far more accurate over the entire range, but they suffer from occasional connectivity issues and rather pathetic presentation of sensor data.  At the end of the day, I feel accuracy is everything.  At the price point of the Netatmo I feel their base function is inexcusably poor, at least at the more extreme levels of temperature and  humidity (the accuracy did improve in the room temperature and moderate humidity regions, even though both sensors disagreed by about 10% humidity and more than one degree F side by side at those conditions ... at 100 degress F, the sensors were off by over 5 degrees).
