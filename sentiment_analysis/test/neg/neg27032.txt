this is so hard to use and sync with your TV , Remotes and Alexa , the only instructions supplied are to get the device powered up ,and getting remotes working is very very long and manual. I was really disappointed in the product and would not suggest it to anyone that thinks its a "plug and play" type item b/c its not , it will require a lot of work and set up and even then its spotty at best with Alexa.
