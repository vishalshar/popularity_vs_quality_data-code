I should have read the fine print. Charges have to be auto withdrawal from my account. I don't allow any company to automatically withdraw funds from my checking. I will getting a new phone from another company where I can pay my own bill. In addition there is an activation fee. The next week the funds were taken out for the month's services. Again I should have read the fine print. I was not expecting to pay $80.00 just to get  started. Also they automatically put you on the most expensive plan. I thought this was a phone for senior citizens. Why would any senior send 2,000 texts per month?. I called and requested they lower my plan. Also apps are on the phone AND ACTIVATED which was driving up the cost. I thought you could activate the apps you wanted. I explained when I first called that I only needed a phone to send pictures to email. I text about 20 texts, if that, a month. I don't talk a lot. My family and friends communicate through computer more than phones. This phone is also VERY SENSITIVE. Just touch it or lay it down and something is activated. Also, you "swipe" to answer a call. However, it does not always work. You have to lay it on a flat service. I use the pen they provided. Using your fingers does not always work. I've had the phone a couple of weeks and am stressed out. Getting a new phone. I am afraid of what they will charge me next month.
