I am ready to send these back. You have to download the app, create an account, be logged into the account, and so far, all these things do when you press and hold the right ear piece is record and send an audio text message. The person receiving it, gets no audio notification. You have to open your phone, open the app (provided you're logged in) and look for a message, then tap a play button for each message received. TOTAL GARBAGE! I sent an email to Outdoor Tech over a week ago and have received no response. After some effort, located a customer service phone number which no one answers. There are no instructions on this issue/feature so the feature would seem to be a hoax at this point. Also, the music sound quality is like listening through a tin can, but I purchased two of these for the walkie talkie feature which apparently, they don't really do.
