Terrible which is so disappointing as I have three Netatmo devices. It started the wifi setup process which appeared to have worked however immediately following this it started to update the firmware (similar to what my presence did but worked). After that it tried to reconnect and failed. I no longer can find the device with my phone and the app. Touching the top does not bring up the white glow configuration light. Holding it makes it flash red to reset but still can't connect. Not happy! Takes days to get a reply from Netatmo. A real shame as I love their gear but this is not good. Feel free to help me Netatmo. Thanks
