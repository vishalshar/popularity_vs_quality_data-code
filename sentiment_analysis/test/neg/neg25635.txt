I would give this a higher rating but it's bulls*#t that you can only switch user devices a few times before they want more money to upgrade. I go out of town frequently so we have to switch which phone the app gets used on so eventually are going to have to pay for the upgrade. What if we use a babysitter? Then we are guaranteed a night terror because she can't use her phone to work the vibrations.
