Note: There are confusing size descriptions regarding these belts sold on Amazon. Before you  make a purchse  check the  actual size you want. The belt  shown here is a "travel and passport belt"  and is 7" x 3". There is also another Travel and Passport Belt listed on Amazon that is the "large" passport travel belt. It measures 7 1/2" by 3 1/2". The larger size will accomodate a passport, this narrower belt will not. It will carry a key and a cell phone (but not one in an otter case.)
