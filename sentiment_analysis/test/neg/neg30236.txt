Not sure how anyone got these to work.  Maybe they works if you have a dlink router?  I got them to connect to my WIFI, but after that the install process would always stop with a message on my phone that said "Device not Found."  After spending about 3 hours with these and not making any progress, I'm giving up and returning them.  I reached out to support but haven't heard anything back.
