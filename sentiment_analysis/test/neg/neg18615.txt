I used this arm band once for a 10 mile run and was left with a scratched and bloody arm.  As you can see from the attached picture, the back of the armband has sharp plastic and exposed metal.  It felt like a piranha gnawing at my arm the entire run.  I'm going to try covering the area with medical tape but for the price I paid for this that shouldn't be necessary.  Running is hard enough, I shouldn't have to worry about being injured by my armband.
