We were so excited to give this card to a coworker just to mess with her. She pushed the button and the card turned on (we could barely hear it). She pushed the button a few times, which did make the card louder. She jokingly hit her hand on the table with the card in hand, and it stopped. The whole thing lasted less than 20 seconds.I anticipated it being a little bit more difficult to "break" than just simply hitting the card against a table. The description is deceiving for the cost you are paying for a card.
