The pitcher itself works wonderfully, however, I had to return my first pitcher the day it arrived because it was broken where the handle meets the basin and only a few days ago the second pitcher broke (in the exact same spot) while my father-in-law was attempting to use it! I will be switching to a different pitcher brand.
