My last order, Lot # not visible, I had problems in opening 11 out of 12 bottles, the plastic cap would not twist off. I had to force the caps off with a knife, cutting the plastic cap upward, then pulling the cap off with pliers. I will not be buying this product again. Can't afford any more cut fingers and broken knifes.Â Dream Water Snoozeberry, 2.5 Ounce, Sleep Aid, 12 Count
