Don't buy it from this site. I found it on the New Wallet site for about $20 less than is sold here; too bad I found it after I received it. Bulky and not well made. Looks like it will break easily. Really bad purchase on my part and would not buy again.UPDATE: After first day of use, the thing broke - backing came off the metal card holder. Totally useless piece of garbage. If I could give is 1/2 star I would only for the idea of it. Not worth the postage to return it so I am out. Don't make my mistake
