My brother tipped me off to this due yo my love of gadgets. I saw the video on Shark Tank  and ordered it immediately. When I first received the product I was super inpressed. It worked amazingly well. However, it failed the next day. No matter what tricks I tried to keep the light suctioned to the bowl, it never would. I returned it for a full refund. I expect we'll see the company on After the Tank
