I received this unit in May 2015, in March 2016 it failed. I contacted support and it has been a nightmare. There send a single reply, but when you ask for more information or clarification they do not reply back. I received info to return the unit, but when I asked for return method and info, I have had no reply in over a week.This has been very disappointing as I really liked the unit, when it was working. If they would offer better service, they would get much better reviews...
