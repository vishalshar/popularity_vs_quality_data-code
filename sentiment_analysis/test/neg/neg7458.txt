I am not the type who returns items, even if they are only half what I expect.  This is the first one to be returned because:1.  The cell phone goes SILENT after I answer a call.  I have to manually increase the volume after each call.2.  It did not connect to the web automatically.  I had to manually connect every time, even when I am at home.3.  The camera is truly abysmal.  It took the picture a second or two after I clicked, losing the opportunity to capture what I intended.Sorry for the bad review.
