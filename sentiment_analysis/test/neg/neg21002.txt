The system keeps disconnecting (almost every day now), and doesn't reconnect by itself. I get a notification that the "stick is missing", and there's really nothing I can do to fix it (disarm the system, disable the siren, silence the alarm, change settings, etc) while the system is disconnected, so every time I get into my home the alarm goes off and I have to physically disconnect the stick from the router to stop the noise, and then reconnect the whole system. There is absolutely nothing wrong with my internet, so this is 100% a Korner's problem.And if this wasn't bad enough, I find outrageous that THERE IS NO KORNER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! All one has access to is a list of FAQs, -half of which are useless-, but there's no way to contact them; and on top of everything, they have the impudence to charge a yearly fee to keep the system active.Korner seriously needs to fix this issue. This is not a problem that only affects me; but also affects the people around me. My neighbors have already come to my place to complain because the alarm wakes their kids up when it goes off late at night (sometimes after midnight).I am very dissatisfied with this product and this company.
