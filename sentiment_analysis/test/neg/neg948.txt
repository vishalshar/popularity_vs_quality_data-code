I really tried to enjoy a 300$ spent on wireless earbuds I tried believe me, but these beautifully carved pieces are horrible when it comes to practicality. TOO COMPLICATED!!! not only there's a drop off Bluetooth connection but also in between the left and right gestures it's like studying for an exam! this connects the other disconnects top it with a low maximum volume .... with or without noise cancellation, you'll hear everything around you. waste of money to say the least.
