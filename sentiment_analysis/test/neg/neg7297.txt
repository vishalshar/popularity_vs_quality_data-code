The Piano is OK, but feels cheap.  I knew the keys were not weighted, but I expected more for the price (keys are really light and flimsy).  More importantly, the software is a poor combination of being buggy, frustrating and insulting.  'Buggy' because it crashes periodically, loses connection to the piano and the piano freezes and needs to be rebooted often.  'Frustrating' because many of the songs (Fur Elise and many others) don't work on this piano because they require a full size 88-key keyboard.  And 'insulting' because around every corner the software is trying to sell you more songs and doesn't give you a mechanism for filtering out the pay content.  Conceptually I love the idea of this piano and was hoping this would be the vehicle to encourage my kids to learn Piano, but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Hopefully the software will evolve over time.With all that said, the sound is nice and my 6 year old was able to follow the lighted keys and play silent night on Christmas and that was kind of magical.
