"I don't understand, we have never had problems with toys from Santa" is what my daughter said when this piece of junk stopped working on the day after Christmas."  She played with it all day long on Christmas.  When we changed the batteries on the second day, it suddenly could not balance and stand up right.  It fell on its face every single time she tried.  We changed the batteries again.  We checked the battery compartment with a multi-meter.  We checked the wheels for debris and fibers.  So I got on the WowWee Website.  No phone number, only email support.  I told them everything - how it worked for a full day, how many times we changed the batteries, how we tested and checked everything.  Their first email back:  Keep trying to balance it, it takes practice.  After I told them again that my daughter had played with it all day long and didn't need any more practice, their second email:  Change the batteries and if that doesn't work, return it to the store where I bought it.  Thanks a lot WowWee Customer Support.  How do I explain that to my daughter?
