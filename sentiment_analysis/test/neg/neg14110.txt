Bought mine from Amazon. Tried to charge and the case connector was recessed on one side which did not allow the buds to charge. Contacted Skybuds and they did not want to help. Looks like they won't honor it if it's bought on Amazon.  Returning to Amazon on going with a brand that has some semblance of trustworthy/reliable company
