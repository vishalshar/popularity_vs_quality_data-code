it is helpful when you want to dry  up your makeup brushes after cleaning.. but i dont recommend it for daily use.im using Nars blush and face brush. Its true that the brush guard helps keep the hairbrush intact but it also it also ruins my brush,my hairbrush sticks on its plastic netting glue( for sample a nylons tip is sharp just like this brushguard netting)it didnt work well on my brush
