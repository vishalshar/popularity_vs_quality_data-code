First of all, I love Honey Soles and the whole idea of how it allows me to go barefoot. Unfortunately, after a couple of days of wearing Honey Soles, the top layer is starting to "rub off" leaving me to think that in a month or so, the entire top layer will be gone. It's too thin and will wear off in no time. My recommendation is to stay clear of this product unless you plan on replacing it every couple of months. See attached pictures for youself...
