I sent this back. The claw does not work well, and it's really too short for our needs. I bought this and another cheaper version that is longer. I was going to use both, and thought this would be the one to use in the car. However, as I stated, the claw did not work properly, and the magnet is just an add on. It does not attach to the pick-up tool. It's a handy thing to have, but I already have a telescoping magnet that works well.We tried this under the car seat as suggested in the ad, and in the garbage disposal to pick up a small object.  Don't waste your money.
