These started off amazing. Best sound I've heard, loved the power charging case and the way they "lock" into the ear. However, it's been a month and like a lot of other earbuds I've had, the charge doesn't last like it did in the beginning. I used to get several hours out of them, now 30mins and the case isn't charging either. SkyBuds customer service, while friendly, not helpful at all. Basically "too bad" response. I can post a dozen similar scenarios of the photo posted in this review.
