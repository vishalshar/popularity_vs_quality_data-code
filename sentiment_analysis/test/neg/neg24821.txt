Well, theyve gotta start somewhere, though they (thermal imaging consumer products manufactures)  have long way to go.  Utter disappointment pretty well sums it up after using the SEEK Compact Thermal, Android camera. Image quality and resolution so poor, for the most part you can't come close to identifying what you're looking at even with the split screen.  The parallax error with close ups (1-2 feet, or closer) doesn't help either (Galaxy S5). Absolutely impossible to measure (or see) circuit board components any smaller than a large transformer.This is what I imagine thermal vision would be like with severe cataract disease. The FLIR attempt at consumer thermal imaging with their FLIR One has much better resolution, way, way less parallax error (with its built in visual spectrum lens & sensor) and practically imperative utilization of Canny Edge Detection (of sort) which aids immensely in visualization of inherently hard to decipher thermal images. Unfortunately, Its a DISPOSABLE waste of electronics with its non-user (or even technician) replaceable battery. Looks like well have to give the consumer thermal imaging dream couple of years or so to get it right.  It likely wont be too long before nearly all cell phones have it as a standard feature. Save your money on both.
