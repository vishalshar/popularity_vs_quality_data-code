Returned it. The GPS, which is essential for a responder in an emergency, showed a completely different street and address. We checked to see if the phone it was paired to also had the incorrect location. It did not-it was perfect via Google Maps. So it was the Cuff implementation of GPS tracking that was off.Plus zero instructions in the box and the online information seems incomplete, at best.Struggled to get the device up and running...and yes it did require a firmware update first thing out of the box and it crashed repeatedly before it "took".The gold band on the sport band has no function-it simply is ornamentation. To activate a broadcast, again no instructions so it was "let's try this" until we learned that to activate one has to pinch the encased obelisk. Since it is covered there is no easy way to see if the device light turned green (which guessing again) is an indication an alert has been sent.
