This printer led to a disappointing and frustrating experience on Christmas Day. At first everything seemed to work OK; the printer connected to my wifi network, but then after the wifi had connected and the software told me to unplug the USB cable, the program crashed as soon as I unplugged the cable. I was still able to print, it seemed, but later on the printer dropped the wifi connection and we got the "printer disconnected" message, with no explanation. I then decided to try to use the printer not on wifi but with a USB cable (at this point we just wanted to print anything). Finally we were able to print the first sample project. The second time we wanted to print something, however, the printer kept randomly disconnecting (but would then resume the job). The next problem was that the printer inexplicably stopped extruding filament; however, the printer did not know that and merrily continued, thinking it was printing. So we all spent a lot of time staring at the printer trying to decide if it was actually printing or if it just thought it was printing. So a few times we stopped the job, unloaded the filament, and then reloaded the filament. Eventually we had the biggest problem of all; the filament stuck completely and would not unload or reload, despite several attempts. The online help page was pretty useless, just saying "call us" after the obvious things had been tried. Looking elsewhere online this seems to be a fairly common problem with people using soldering irons etc. to fix it, or waiting several days for New Matter to send replacement parts. I did call their support line the day after Christmas (December 26) only to get a chirpy recorded message that "we're closed and we're all with our families". I could understand this on Christmas Day itself, but on the day AFTER Christmas, when many of their customers would probably be glad of technical support, they don't think it's a good idea to staff their support line? Yes, they can shut down for as many days after Christmas as they like, but this will of course make them more likely to get negative reviews and returned products.UPDATE: when I requested to return this clearly defective unit, Jack from New Matter responded: "Please note that per the New Matter return policy, you will need to pay the cost of shipment back to our offices. Once examined and passed, weÂ’ll be happy to provide a refund for your order." I asked him to send me a postage paid label given the problems with the unit and he refused. Another reason to steer well clear of this company.
