Attractive and feminine fitness tracker. However, it doesn't seem accurate -- some days my Leaf is off by 1000's of steps (compared to my iPhone app and fitbit). And sleep cycles are WAY off. I wish I could return mine -- it was a waste of money!! Basically, it's a glorified pedometer. Not worth it..at all.
