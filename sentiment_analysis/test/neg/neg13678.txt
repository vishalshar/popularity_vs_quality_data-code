First unit worked a few times and then we came home to find the water boiling when we set it for 160F (sensor showed 400F) and our osso buco was ruined. Also, it started turning off before the timer expired. Exchanged it for a new one with no better results. Last night we came home to find the water only lukewarm with the temperature still set to 150F (sensor showed 85F) and the impeller running. We rebooted, set it to 150F for four hours and went to bed. This morning the unit was beeping indicating completion however it was still cooking with both indicators showing 150F. We have now overcooked by at LEAST six hours. This unit doesn't turn off when the timer expires and I have reproduced this behavior multiple times this morning. What are the chances that I received two defective units? Should I try a different brand?
