It is very convenient to use this BUT if you have issues the customer service will not reply.  Data usage is not transparent.  My first top up of EURO 50 lasted me 3 months. Mostly massaging and sometimes on a very low data usage game.  I used up all my data due to my own carelessness as I forgot to log off when I reach my hotel room and proceeded to do more high data usage stuff on my laptop while the GlocalMe was still log on.  My fault.  I then went on to top my credit up again for package 1 GB and Euro 50 again.  While I was in New York my remaining volume was 800++ MB ... and I traveled to Frankfurt ... it fell to 700MB ... I made a few msgs send a google location and looked at my low data game. I switch it off with 700 MB remaining.  Imagine my horror when I opened my Glocalme a few days later in Kuala Lumpur and I have only 100MB of data left.  Data don't disappear like this and I wrote to service@ucloudlink.com but no reply.  Its very strange that 1 GB gets used up for some msgs and a low data game so quickly.  And if it correct usage ... Euro50 for such 1 GB usage is not worth it.  I wrote to them and NO answers so I have no choice but to write a negative comment.  DO NOT BUY UNLESS DATA USAGE IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY GLOCALME.  Currently they are NOT transparent on data usage.
