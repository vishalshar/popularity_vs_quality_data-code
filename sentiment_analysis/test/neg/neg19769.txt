I used this suitcase for the first time last weekend and I didn't use it for the return trip nor will I use it again anytime soon. I was stopped by TSA  and my bag held off for further examination - not even run through the machine a second time.  The luggage tested positive for explosives (the electronic box inside the lining of the bag) which meant that everything in the bag was examined - every piece of clothing, makeup, camera, opened and examined.  They showed me what the electronics looked like on camera and I understand their concern.  Four TSA agents looked at the video and the suitcase - and this was in Orlando, not a small regional airport.  I was padded down as well by a very professional and understanding female  TSA agent - from the waistband of my slacks, to the underwire of my bra. The TSA agents were respectful and apologized for the delay but if I hadn't given myself extra time I would have missed my plane.  There was no customer service number on their website and I did not receive an email response for over 48 hours.  This was one of the responses "If you feel like you may experience difficulties going through security in the future, we suggest that you notify the security agents that you are using a smart luggage and explain to them about how it works. You can show them the app and wires underneath the lining so they can understand when the bag goes through the X-ray."  They want me to open my suitcase, take out my belongings, unzip the lining to show the TSA agents what is inside every time I fly?  I think I will hold off for now.
