This is definitely not worth $200.  Installation went poorly with unknown obstruction in mounting screw hole.  It was not made clear to hold phone within 5 foot of light when programming software.  Security software only gave 14 days of trial before wanting to charge you $4.99 month for prepaid one year plan.  For $200. You should get 1 year free.  When trying to program additional features on smartphone, software declines to accept your preferences.  I would not buy again.
