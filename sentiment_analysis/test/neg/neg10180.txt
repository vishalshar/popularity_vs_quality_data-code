Unfortunately we were very unhappy with this bike. We were so excited, as it was my son's birthday present. It arrived with the front break rubbing on the front wheel. We tweaked it quite a bit but it still would rub once the break lever was pulled. Finally we decided to just deal with it and put our son on the bike. He petaled and petaled but the back wheel went flat instantly. After pumping it again we realized we were sent a bike with a faulty tire tube. Instead of trying to repair we just went to a bike shop and purchased a different bike. This bike was heavy and tricky to handle, and with the tube that needed replacing we ultimately decided this was not the bike for us.
