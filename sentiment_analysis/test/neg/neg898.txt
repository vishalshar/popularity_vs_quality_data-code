Lasted for two months and now it just has a solid red light. Resets et al do nothing. It is a $50 brick. Had problems with this staying connected to the wireless. The two water sensors I use with it have the same connectivity issue every couple of weeks - and there is no notification when you lose connection. A good feature would be to notify you if the connection is gone after X minutes.
