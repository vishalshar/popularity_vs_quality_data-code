I had this less than 24 hrs and it already won't hold on my windshield.  Was using it to hold my phone to the windshield while driving, 1 min later it fell off, by pure chance landed on my wrist, scratched my Apple Watch and cracked my screen protector. I am only giving it 2 stars because maybe I'm just unlucky and I've only had it 24 hrs otherwise I'd give it 1 star at this point.  Will try it on a few more things but who wants to risk cracking their screen every time they stick it to something? Unfortunately I had the Cinder screen protector which isn't cheap =(. I'll update my review in a few days (basically trying to decide if I'm returning this or not).
