I nearly forced myself to try and love this thing. I tried direct wired, bluetooth, connecting to MAC and iPad. Tried using as input for Garageband. As a midi controller, etc. Sadly all were letdowns. The latency was obvious and annoying even when ipad directly connected to amp. (no bt headphones). The software for it seems like a massive work in progress. I imagine at some point this will be truly useful for someone. The 5 fret limit was sooooo frustrating. I though I could cope with it, but alas, no. While there are myriad settings, tweaking them to try and get to a playable/enjoyable action on the strings was near impossible for me.I hope innovators like this can stay in business though. Sadly this one is a pass.
