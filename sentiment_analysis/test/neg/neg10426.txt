Not recommended...  I'm afraid that Dane-Elec now has two strikes against them.  As per several other reviewers, it appears that they have joined the ranks of greedy mfgrs who opt to maximize profits by purchasing cheap poor quality memory devices from China, and in so doing, destroy their own reputation.  In my case however, the complaint is of shoddy construction.  After a mere 8 weeks on my keychain, the case self-destructed when pulling it "closed" - the keychain end detached and the usb plug and pc board with its guts then fell on the ground.  Would never buy this brand again!
