My son wanted one for Christmas so Santa brought him one. We opened it up on Christmas AM, installed batteries, and anxiously switched it on. In blue mode, we started making the recommended hand gestures. No response. We tried near, far, slow, etc but none caused any reaction. We removed the batteries and tested them to be sure the batteries were good. All good there. I installed the MiP app on my iPhone and it connected up just fine. I was able to use the app to drive the robot around for about 30 seconds without issue. Then, it stopped responding. I powered off, checked batteries again, re-connected to the app, but no response or activity in any mode. I returned this one to Amazon because it is useless in its current state. I get the replacement coder model and open it with high hopes. I power it on and it actually responds to hand gestures like it should! I connected it to the app and drive it around for about 60 seconds. Then, it stopped responding to the app, stopped responding to hand gestures in blue mode, and wouldn't do anything in any mode. I power down down and plug it in to recharge all night long. I powered it on and same thing. No responses or activity in any mode other than some funky sounds that it would make. This one is going back too and I'm not even going to get a replacement this time! I gave them the benefit of the doubt once but not again. Absolute JUNK! The only reason I gave it one star is because I can't give zero stars!
