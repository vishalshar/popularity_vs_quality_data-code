These headphones are terrible.  They are definitely targeted at the "i just want to hear bass reverb" audience.  These are worse than a pair of Beats.  I've tried them across multiple devices (Galaxy S7, Macbook, Nintendo 3DS) and the sound is consistently low and muddy.  Doesn't matter how much I futz with equalizer settings, they're just junk.  I'd send them back, but Amazon wound up comping them due to shipping issues.  I guess I can use them to muffle airplane noise when I travel. If you want a good pair of headphones, get the AudioTechnica ATH-50x.  Significantly better sound quality for a small jump in price.
