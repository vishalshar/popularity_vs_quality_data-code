It does not work for me, my Lakeland Terrier eats all the balls and does not play with the machine himself. Initial idea was to let the machine be there and teach him to use it in case he is home alone, so I spent time teaching him and he does use it on his own, but only in presence of a human who plays with him, on top of that he just eats through all the balls so there is nothing to play with ... may be just my dog, but product did not really fit into my need - that is allowing the dog to play with himself in case he is left alone.
