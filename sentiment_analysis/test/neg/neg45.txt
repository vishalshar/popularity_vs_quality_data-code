I installed this keypad on June 29th and it had been working properly until yesterday. None of the codes would work, including mine which is the owner code. Even the button to lock the door would not lock the door. Today, the codes, and the lock button, still weren't working so I uninstalled it and attempted to re-install it. The keypad is blinking like it should, but the app keeps giving me an error and stating that no keypads were found in the scan. I contacted August just now to see what I can do, hopefully they'll respond soon.
