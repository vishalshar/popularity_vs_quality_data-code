These grill lights are said to fit any grill lid handle, the problem is the rubber strap is so close to the handle when the lid is open it does not shine on the grilling area, because it does not extend out enough from the lid handle and is blocked by the grill lid. So when you are cooking and have the lid open, " No Lite on Grill Area". the light it self is bright enough and would light up the grill area if extended out from the lid handle more. I am going to try and fabricate something that will allow the light to focus where i need it to be, the grill area. that's why the two stars!
