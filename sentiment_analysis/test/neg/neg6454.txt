Bought and just received 2 of these for my daughter and wife between a couple of months and a few weeks ago. My daughters device doesn't work now even though it displays a "RED" blinking light!! Scary to think if an emergency was needed for a loved one with no one to receive the signal!!!Tried to return but the policy states "not returnable"!!!!
