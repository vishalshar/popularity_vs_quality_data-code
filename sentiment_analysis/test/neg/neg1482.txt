As an avid gardener and accomplished home cook, I bought this kit with high hopes. However, I had only three nice oyster mushrooms and that in about 18 days after starting and I followed the directions to a "t". That certainly wasn't enough to do anything with so I saut√©ed them in butter and we tried them for flavor. They were tasty enough but hardly something I would do again given the price. I plan to try the back today but am sorely disappointed in this product.. The harvest, and I use the term very loosely, was hardly that shown in the advertising pictures or on the package. I would neither buy this again nor recommend it to others.
