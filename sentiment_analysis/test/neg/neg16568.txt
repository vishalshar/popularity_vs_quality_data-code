I was impressed with the packaging and the initial look and feel of thePencil. After an initial charging it wanted to update its firmware. This proved to be the first of a growing number of disappointments. The update never completed despite repeated attempts. The best I could get was a third of the way through the process. After that failure it now doesn't support any of the smart functions I bought the Pencil for. As a "dumb" stylus it performs on a par with the cheap 5 for a dollar styluses you can get in any el cheapo store.
