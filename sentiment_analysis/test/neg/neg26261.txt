I was very excited about getting this little camera. I had read about, and watched the YouTube videos about the gradient problems, but since not everybody complained about them, I took a chance, and lost! The left, or top 1/3 of the screen (depending on which way you turn it) always showed colder. I took it out to my big cathedral ceiling that is insulated with spray foam, and very consistent in temp. I first checked it with my inferred gun, and it was 60 degrees +/- 1 (I am retired and keep the house cool!). The camera showed much colder on the left 1/3 by about 10 degrees, but was still reading about 3 degrees to high. The sad part is, the major 2/3s of the screen was reading sometimes more than 13 degrees too high! I bought this solely to find any weak points in my insulation, but its was sadly totally useless to me, and is going back. Sounds like I am lucky I got it from Amazon, because Seeks customer service doesn't sound so good! I also had some small issues like the temp readings half off the screen, and having to reboot my phone a lot to get a pic to show again on the cam. Hopefully they will get the bugs worked out over time, because it could be really cool, and useful camera! On the plus side, the packaging was really cool, and so was the protective case. I will attach a pic of my ceiling that was all 60 degrees, and one of the lens, which doesn't look like American quality, but from watching the YouTube videos, probably not the problem.
