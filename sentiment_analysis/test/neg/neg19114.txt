I bought the regular black one and thought this one would be the same, no it is not. It should not be advertised as a mighty cup unless they ad the mighty disappointment cup. Everything about it is a disappointment. It doesn't suction to the same flat surface the other one does. So if you all are looking  for a good cup in this product line, skip this one and get one of the regular plastic ones.
