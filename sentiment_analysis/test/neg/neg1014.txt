I was so excited when I saw this on Shark Tank and ordered it before the show even finished, as I always hated having to turn the lights on and fully wake up just because of a trip to the bathroom. The item though was not 100% as it appeared on Shark tank. It was a much lighter and cheaper version and because of that it wouldn't stay attached to the toilet and would just be hanging onto the toilet bowl by the light bulb being caught under the seat. This cheap version had four suction cups to "attach" to the outside of the toilet bowl and one suction cup attached to the bowl which should have attached to the inside of the bowl outside of the water area. How they assume the suction cups would stick I have no clue. Once you add the batteries (3, not included) the weight is too heavy for the little suction cups as well as the fact that the bowl is cold and can sweat. There was no way it would stick longer than 5 or 10 minutes, and the little bowl and its tiny suction cup never held past 5 minutes.The sad thing was this was not the way it attached on Shark Tank. That item had a much better attachment. And the light itself was assume. You could pick one color to always use, or set it to cycle each time through all the colors. The light was more than enough to see the entire bathroom but at a gentle pleasing level.I had to return the item as it just wouldn't stay attached and if a male used the bathroom and lifted the seat it fell to the floor every time as the bulb being caught by the seat was all that held it there.
