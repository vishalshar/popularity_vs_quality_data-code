I just couldn't get this mic to work at all. I tried it on a new iPhone, iPad, and an HTC smartphone. I even purchased the recommended app for the Apple devices. This mic picked up absolutely no sound whatsoever. I know others have been happy with it, but it just didn't work for me.A word of warning about trying to use this mic with non-Apple devices. Based on some research I did after buying this mic, I learned that that not all three-ring jacks work the same. Each ring conducts a different signal from the mic to the device. But not every device looks for the same signal from the same ring. So you may plug this mic into a non-Apple device and have it "fit" exactly right, but the mic still may not pick up sound because the device has an incompatible ring pattern. My understanding is that these jacks are becoming more consistent across devices, but there isn't universal adoption of the Apple ring system.And the problem is that most device manufacturers don't specify which ring-pattern they use, so it's a bit of a gamble.But this mic didn't work on my Apple devices either, so I'm not sure what happened in my case.You may have better luck. In fact, I can give you a great deal on a MightyMic with very little usage...
