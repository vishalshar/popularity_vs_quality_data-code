Great angle of view with something like 70 degree or more width and a nice clear picture, but the camera disconnects a lot and often won't open to view on the apps or opens slowly (perhaps this is a home wifi or an app problem). Actually this can disconnects most of the time.  I have four other dlink models in use and none have any of these issues.  I just bought an old dlink vga to replace this.  If it had an Ethernet plug it'd work great but this just doesn't stay connected.
