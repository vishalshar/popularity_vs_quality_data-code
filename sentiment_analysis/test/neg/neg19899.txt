I have had noting but problems with this device.  It never works when i try to access it and constantly needs to be powercycled.  Not acceptable at all.  Especially when Its sole purpose is to monitor my kids playroom.  My wireless infrastructure is rock solid (enterprise class) so its not me.I'm so fed up and want to return it, but I am now outside my return window and I'm stuck with it.
