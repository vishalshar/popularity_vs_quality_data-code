Purchased this as an Xmas present for my 8yr old.  He was immediately frustrated by the fact that the remote control only operates when you are directly in front of the robot at close range.  As other reviewers have mentioned it has trouble walking on most carpets and even hardwood floors and it does not turn very well.  As for the different "moods" they all appear to be very similar to me.  The obstacle avoidance doesn't work, it will walk into a corner or object (if you give it enough time to get there) and then stay there unable to turn around.  If you want to make it open its jaws, wag the tail, or roar, as it stands still then this is the toy for you.  My son now plays with it in the off mode most of the time.
