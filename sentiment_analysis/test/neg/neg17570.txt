I really wanted to like this lock.  Initially it went well.  The installation is simple and the hardware is pretty well designed.  But the usage turned out to be annoying.  I wanted a lock that would open the door before I got there so I wouldn't need to take my keys out.  But most of the time, the door would be locked and I had to open the door manually (I could use the App but finding keys is easier than finding an app).  Oftentimes, several minutes after closing the door behind me, the lock would finally realize I was home and would unlock the door.  So it doesn't give you a secure feeling to know that at any time after coming home your door would unlock itself.  Sadly, I have reinstalled my old manual lock and this lock now sits in it's original box gathering dust.
