I have been using the trackR bravo on the following items for roughly 3 months:My car keysMy wife's car keysMy walletMy son's walletI have found that 9 times out of ten, the items are out of range when I try to ping them. What is frustrating is that when I find the said item, it is mere feet from where I was standing with my phone in hand trying to get them to connect. I know what you're thinking, "oh, this is just one review and he is probably not using them correctly and if I get them, I am sure they will work just fine."...stop, just stop. These trackR bravo trackers work 10% of the time at best. I would strongly recommend heeding these reviews and buy another product.....I didn't and now I am stuck with really stylish key chains that just make me mad when I look at them.
