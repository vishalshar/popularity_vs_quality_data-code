The product partially worked the first 3 times used.Bluetooth interface is buggy.  Temperature sensors not correct.But in less than 90 days, the product quit working altogether.The display would not power up, the impeller would turn on/off intermediately. The water would not heat up.I have tried to contact the company, will update if they respond.
