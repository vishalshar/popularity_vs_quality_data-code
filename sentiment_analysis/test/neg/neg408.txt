Thin, check. Power pass-through, check. Sync data, no so check. It does not seem to know what it wants to do when you connect to a computer. But a big (for me at least) design flaw is the volume buttons and the charge port cover yellow after only a few weeks. Looks really bad on the white case.Update : case is too thin. It cracked after a month of use. Buttons started to work in unexpected ways. Case provides only minimal phone protection.
