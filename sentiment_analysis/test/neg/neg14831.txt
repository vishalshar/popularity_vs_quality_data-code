the device is junk.if your dog is a wanderer it can be a nice insurance policy but you absolutely CANNOT count on it to work when you need it.my lab goes on walkabout regularly  (its always close to fully charged whistle as I charge it every night) and it has given me his location about 50% of the time. I've confirmed it's not a cellular coverage issue, it is the device simply not communicating information, or communicating incorrect information. I've spent 10+ hours trying to trouble shoot 3 different devices they have sent me and they have all had the same set of problems and are essentially useless.
