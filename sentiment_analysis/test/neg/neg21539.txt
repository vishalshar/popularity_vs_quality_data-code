The quality of the camera itself is good. The night shots are also good. It's unfortunate that the software in the camera is almost completely useless. The lack of an internal SD card means the only way this records is if you have an FTP server to store your video. A a live "I want to see what's going on" camera it's fine, but for security it's pretty useless. The website for the camera uses java and all of the technical issues surrounding java makes this impossible for any "normal" person to use. If you're not a geek like myself then don't even bother considering this camera. Most of the issues holding this thing back are software related, so D-link could fix all of the issues with a software update. The software looks pretty old so it looks like there may not be much of a chance of that. Like most companies, old stuff get's abandoned as they bring out new products. The mydlink portal is good but it doesn't address any of the cameras advanced functions. The setup was pretty simple too despite the instructions being a bit dated. I contacted support but have not heard back from anyone. From my home network the ability to e-mail snapshots is completely broken. I tried both my gmail and hotmail account using numerous ports and configurations none ever worked. If you're looking for a security camera I'd pass on this one altogether. I probably should send it back but now that I've gone to all of the trouble to configure it and mount it I might just try to figure out how to fix the software issues myself (which might mean I brick the camera and have to buy a new one anyway).
