Tried these on and immediately had an issue with them.  My shoes were too tight.  this system doesn't allow for any adjustment.  They either work for you or they don't.  For me, they didn't work.  They didn't work for my 12 year old son, either.  Maybe a petite lady could wear these.  If your feet are wide at all, I would recommend you skip this system.  Neat idea that didn't work for me or my son.  Pictures included.
