This speaker worked great... at first. After 3 months of functioning adequately, the speaker began to lose its charge. Now the battery won't charge at all when plugged it. This is the second Trakk speaker I've purchased in which this is happening. Given that I have spent over $100 twice on this same speaker, I would say its a product flaw.I would HIGHLY recommend against this speaker. The company won't replace the item because its barely over the return policy period. So BE CAREFUL.
