Set up was easy.  But neither battery would stay connected for more than 2 days. Roost sent an email saying the batteries weren't detected even though the app said they were fine. Then in less than a month, 1 of them died completely. Emails to Roost went unanswered. I have better things I can spend $65 on. Returned.
