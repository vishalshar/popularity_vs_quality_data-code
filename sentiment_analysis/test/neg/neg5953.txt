? i did not receive any discount nor did i get this product for free, i paid full price.My husband has been into making our home automated. From cat wiring to lights turning on with voice. He's an IT Major and he sure is putting it to good use (laugh out loud) He wanted this wifi light control so that we could turn off lights with our voice or from our phone if gone. So he got this one.Well, he was so wanting it to work, but it failed. He says it's not very reliable. Works sometimes. He hooked it up through our amazon echo and it barely worked. It would work great for a few testings, then it would say "sorry, I do no understand that command." But yet it would turn the light on/off. So if you have a huge house, you would think that it's not working and have to walk to check it and find that it was working. After the firmware update this started happening. Before the firmware update, the echo worked fine with it.App does not work well, not easy to set up. Took him 30 minutes to set up, when it should have taken way less than that. The whole set up was just a nightmareSo, I can not give this product more than a two star and the two star is only because it worked half the time, or it would have gotten a one star. Hoping this issue can get fixed.So needless to say, this product is not reliable at all.
