I'm not really sure whey they expected to this to stick to. It surely did NOT stick to a newly painted wall. Nice and flat, used the included squeagy, looked great once it was applied. Came in the next day to find it on the floor. Put it back up sideways this time, two hours later it was back on the floor. For this type of money go get yourself a real whiteboard. Even better, we got a 4x8 sheet of whiteboard material from our local lumber supplier for $18, screwed to the wall and it works great!
