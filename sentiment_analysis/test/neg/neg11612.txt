Had more than a bit of difficulty setting up.  Had to get support help on 3 occasions.  It works fine but does not extend the range as I expected.  The price is acceptable.  However don't expect the plug n play that is advertised.  I had to use a password which turns out to be on the bottom of the unit.  My iPhone and iPad lose connection when 15 feet away and do not always reconnect automatically when near the unit.After using this product for about a month I changed my review to 2 stars from 3,  considering reducing to 1 star.  I lose connection when walking out of the room this is in.  When I return to the room have to manually reconnect.DON'T waste your money by purchasing.  Lots of hype and sizzle but not worth $25.00
