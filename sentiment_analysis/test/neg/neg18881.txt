This seemed like a good idea - we love cheese, and want food to last longer.  However, I don't like that I can't see what's inside.  We tend to have multiple open cheeses in the cheese drawer in our fridge and, when we use these bags, they all look the same.  Also, these bags are huge for the amount of cheese we keep in them.  Bottom line - I won't be repurchasing these.
