This thing won't connect to the phone 75% of the time. You can update all your apps and MAYBE it will connect. I've contacted the company but they give a generic thank you message asking you to contact them via email, and then you get another generic message that leads you in circles. Also, this band gives incorrect information. For two nights I got what I thought was accurate information on my sleep, yet on the third day it said I didn't sleep at all overnight (?? I slept about 7 hours ??) and that I slept in the afternoon (and I rarely nap, and that day I was just on the computer at that time, wide awake). Again, a generic message from the company states that you need to contact them via email and then around in circles we go. This band is going back. Good luck with it.
