I rarely take the time to review things, and others have described this issue in far more explicit detail, so I'll keep it short.  I've owned probably 3-4 of the original model, and lost two of those due to it popping out of the original sport band which was pretty terrible .  I was intrigued by the updated model, new features etc, but...it is an unmitigated disaster, and I strongly recommend that no one buy it until they do something to address the issue.  I've had mine for something like 3 weeks now and it's popped off at least 2-3 times a day with barely any friction or pulling at all.  If you pull on a sweater, this thing will pop off.  If you buckle your seatbelt- this thing will fly off.  Mine just flew off placing my bag in the overhead compartment of the flight I'm on right now.  It's ludicrous- one of the worst designs I've ever seen in a product of this type.  It never should have been shipped.  Unfornately I have little faith that Misfit will fix this, as they've just "exited" and been acquired, which means at least the senior leadership have been rewarded for launching a product that is so ridiculous it might earn a spot in the top ten worst product launches of the modern era.  I can only strongly urge again that people vote with their wallets and not buy this thing.
