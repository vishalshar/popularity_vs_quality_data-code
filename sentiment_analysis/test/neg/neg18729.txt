With the recent iOS update, you will be unable to use the device unless you register and create an account on the the iSeek website.  The terms of use, which you must agree to, is a laundry list of of marketing communications and how they will use your information and images captured with the device.  This simply isn't right, period.  This was not a requirement when I purchased the device and was not a requirement until a recent iOS app update.  Not cool.
