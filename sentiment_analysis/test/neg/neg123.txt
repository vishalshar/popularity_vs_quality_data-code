Disappointing! Just an average trolley with a battery inside that stopped working after just a couple of days, a Bluetooth connection to your smart phone that allows you to "remotely" lock and unlock your carry-on (rather useless as by definition you probably have your "carry-on" with you)  and to "track"  it's position... meaning that you will be able to confirm that the bag you have right in front of your eyes is actually there!!!  of course if the bag is not with you, you want to be able to "track" anything! Needless to say, once your battery all of the above is just wishful thinking. Extremely disappointing,  rather irritating if you can see there the amount of money this costs!
