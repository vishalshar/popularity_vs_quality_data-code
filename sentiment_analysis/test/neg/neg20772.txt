I purchased this mount because I like it's design and because I needed something to hold my ipdad mini while I was driving.  I received this the same day I ordered it (awesome!) and installed it in my car that evening.  It looked great....for less than a minute.  That's how long it took for the adhesive that holds the metal bracket to the back of the ipad to fail and for the ipad to fall face first to the floor of the car.  I tried to re-adhere it several times, but nothing that I do makes it stick for more than a couple of seconds, and the magnets are not strong enough to hold the ipad  with a case on it and the metal bracket in-between.  I was disappointed to realize that the design was not perfect, and I was even more dispapointed when I contacted Mountek's customer service.  First they suggested that I purchase another one of their mounts, then they suggested that I had not followed the installation instructions (um.....there were none in the box and the videos online don't mention how to adhere the bracket to a device), and finally they suggested that I do as many of their customers do (their words) and purchase replacement adhesive myself - at a cost per sheet that is just below what the mount itself cost.  A company that won't stand behind its product is not one that I want to do business with, and since their product does not hold up the device they say it will I will be returning it and looking to purchase a different mount from a company that cares about their customers.
