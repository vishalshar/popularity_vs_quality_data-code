I got this for a female family member because she wanted it. She normally loves Jasmine but she thought that this smelled gross. I gave it a whiff and it instantly made me think of a urinal cake. My family member uses all kinds of natural deodorants but couldn't get through the "detox period" with this -- she said it caused major irritation and the FUNK was like nothing she'd ever experienced and she never wants to experience it again. Very disappointed.
