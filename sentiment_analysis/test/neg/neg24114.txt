1st watch received, A/C charger was bad. Charged via USB on PC until it showed full (2hrs). It would work for about 30 minutes, showing that we left home and arrived at school, but would turn off (Displaying "OFF") and was unable to track my child. This happened 2 days in a row. Requested an exchange. Received 2nd watch, A/C charger works. This watch did not turn off, but was unable to track it after about 30 minutes. Even with my child in good cell service and walking outdoors, it fails. I have to reconnect it to the charger to get it working again. Notifications sometimes reached everyone. I am an IT Engineer. Does not mean that I am the smartest, but I do not see that this thing can be trusted. Hereo does not have a WORKING phone number, only email. The 2nd watch is going back and will wait for another brand watch to come out that does to scream "I'm a GPS Watch".
