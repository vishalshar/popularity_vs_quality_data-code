I was excited to have a mount that would not have to go up on the windshield and reduce clutter. While it works and seems secure by mounting in the CD slot, there is quite a significant amount of rattling that you hear when driving. This is likely attributed to the number of parts in this mount. I am a little OCD about rattling in my car so this really bothered me. It may not bug all of you though so it depends on the person.
