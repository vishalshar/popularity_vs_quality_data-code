This remote doesn't help at all. It work in the app but it doesn't assist like it should during the speech. When you think you are pressing the start it doesn't respond. When you think are backing up in the middle of the scroll it makes the letters smaller. I dont even use the teleprompter I bought because the remote didn't work. Waste of money for me
