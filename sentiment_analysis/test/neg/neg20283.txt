Take a pencil between your thumb and pointer finger. Allow it to bounce off of the strings on your guitar. Kinda cool, right? That's the direction of application that this thing offers. I didn't really find it to be that practical for anything besides this 'raking' back and forth, which creates a sort of messy tremolo effect. Eh. Cool idea, but it's a bit of a novelty. Worth trying if you want a tool to bounce off of your strings...
