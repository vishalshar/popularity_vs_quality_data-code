Just got this set up in my bedroom only to find that absolutely nothing happens when it's powered up.  Nothing.  I mean, the lights come on but the record does not spin.  Even when I touch the needle there is no sound.  It feels light & flimsy and has no dust cover either.  It's going back today.  Price was too good to be true, apparantly.
