Extremely disappointed.  This toy broke within an hour of my 8 year old grandson opening it.  He is not a violent child but impatient and excited as any kid is on their birthday.  I think he was trying all the modes and the delay to where they kicked in frustrated him.  I would never buy this product again, but if you do be sure there is an adult monitoring operation.  I would ship it back however we live in Australia so I would be out the shipping to here and back, more $ than the toy.  Just BEWARE.
