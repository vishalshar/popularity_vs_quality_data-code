I want to love this product.  The concept is awesome and the design is great.  It's small, it replaces my iPhone brick charger, and works like a battery backup on the go.  I ordered one and tried it out, but after a few days and only using it 2-3 times, it stopped working.  The lights wouldn't come on anymore, and the charger wouldn't charge my iPhone SE either standalone or connected to the wall outlet.  I sent it back and thought I just got a random bad one [after reading reviews I did see this issue show up].  I got a second one and tried it again.  It worked for about a week and 5-7 charges, then stopped working.  The lights didn't turn on, the charger didn't charge my iPhone either standalone or through the wall outlet.  This product is an awesome idea and I wish it worked reliably.  Instead of I have to say it's not worth your time, find a charger with better reliability and reviews.
