I've had the same problem as many customers. I gave this case to my daughter's boyfriend and it has separated at the seam between plastic and rubber. Plastic and rubber cannot be bonded, no matter what you do. I had the same thing happen to my Note 4 case from RokForm. Won't be buying from them again. I traded up to the Predator Aluminum frame that killed my bluetooth signal so I'm out way too many dollars to think about. I won't be giving them any more of my money.
