Owned this bulb for eight days before it completely stopped working. I was never pleased with its performance, the app lagged badly, it constantly lost connection with the bulb. I contacted Lifx support and was told the problem was with my router not with their bulb. All of my other smart devices work just fine with my router, this bulb was the only thing that had problems. Finally today it just turned a dull purple color and would not respond to the app at all. Tried multiple reboots and resets but it just stopped working. Not at all pleased with this bulb or Lifx support.
