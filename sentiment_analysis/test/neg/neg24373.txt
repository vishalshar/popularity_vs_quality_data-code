UPDATED: Old review below. Changed to 2 stars due to continuing reliability problems and poor customer support.After several weeks of troubleshooting, including buying a new router, both of my bulbs continue to have reliability issues. They drop off my network several times per day, requiring them to be power cycled to reconnect them. I've followed all of the recommendations on their support site, including trying different wifi channels. Nothing has had any impact.I contacted their customer support, who were very unhelpful in diagnosing the problem. I sent them some diagnostic data and then was told to wait until a firmware update is released to fix the problem. That was a couple of weeks ago, and no updates have been released.Based on posts on their support website, I am far from the only person to have these issues. It doesn't sound like they've had a lot of success in resolving those problems. Very disappointed in this product, as the bulbs are expensive and the colors look great, but reliability and customer support are pretty dismal. I cannot recommend this product at this time.OLD REVIEW:I recently purchased a pair of these for my bedroom ceiling fan. I was immediately impressed by the vibrant colors and brightness levels, but I've had some issues with wifi reliability. This may be due to my networking hardware, and I will update this review soon, as I will be upgrading in the near future.PROS:- Excellent color selection (16 million colors, a few dozen white bulb temperatures, and 1-100% brightness control).- Unlike Phillips Hue bulbs, these do not require a bridge, and work on your existing wifi network instead. This brings down initial costs considerably.- iOS LIFX app works fairly well, and the setup process was quick and simple.- Just plain fun to change the color of your room on a whim. The app includes various effects and "Scenes" to change the colors to different themes, or animate the lights. The effects include customizable sliders for things like animation speed and color change intensity, so you can set the lights to do pretty much whatever you want.- While I've yet to use it, LIFX provides an API for controlling the bulbs on your local network. Phillips Hue bulbs are locked down, by contrast. This makes the LIFX bulbs very hacker-friendly, in that you can link the bulbs to scripts or software of your own choosing. For example, there's a script out there to allow the lights to sync to a Kodi media center to match video playback. Very cool!CONS:- Wireless reliability is an issue. I've had to power-cycle these bulbs every morning. I've yet to wake up and successfully say "Alexa, set bedroom lights to 30%". So far, she's just told me that the bulbs cannot be found on the network. I have verified that this is a networking issue and not a software hiccup - I am unable to ping the bulbs when this happens, so they are not on the network at all (you know that you're living in the future when you're doing a ping test on light bulbs!).- These bulbs only support 2.4 GHz wifi, and not 5 Ghz. I will be upgrading to a dual-band router soon in an attempt to minimize interference in the 2.4 GHz range - hopefully this will improve reliability.- These bulbs are a bit wider than a typical A19 style bulb, and wouldn't fit inside the glass enclosure on my ceiling fan. I ended up having to purchase a longer threaded rod to allow the glass to hang a bit lower. You may want to check the clearance wherever you intend to install these.- Alexa integration is a little bit tricky. Alexa responds well to some commands (once the LIFX skill is enabled) such as "Alexa, set bedroom lights to 60%" or "Alexa, turn off bedroom lights", but you'll need to invoke the LIFX skill to change the colors, I.E. "Alexa, tell LIFX (pronounced "Life-ex") to change bedroom lights to blue". It can be a mouthful sometimes.
