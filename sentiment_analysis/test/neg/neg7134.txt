Waste of money because the Amazon.com did not disclose a major limitation for this product, and Amazon.com will not allow me to return the product after GreatCall's day trial period.  The limitation is that the fall detection feature requires wearing the device on a special lanyard only provided by GreatCall (for a fee, of course).  That lanyard places the device directly over the sternum, but it is extremely dangerous to have a cell phone type device that close to a pacemaker implant.  Amazon.com does not disclose this very important limitation, and GreatCall does not mention the limitation on their own website.  It was only after purchasing the GreatCall service with fall detection and receiving a package from GreatCall several days later that we learned that fall detection only works if the device is in a specific location.  Fall detection does not work if the device is on a belt clip or in a pocket (there are some products from other companies that do).  Amazon.com will not allow us to return the device despite their failure to disclose this limitation regarding usage with pacemakers because the amount of time it took to receive the device from Amazon.com, order service from GreatCall, wait for the service to be activated, receive the fall detection package from GreatCall and then discover the limitation exceeded the allowable return time.  Buying this GreatCall Splaxh cost us the money for the device, non-refundable startup costs for the GreatCall service, non-refundable one month of service, money for the fall-detection package from GreatCall, and money for shipping to fall-detection package.  A little bit of honesty from Amazon.com would have saved us a lot of money.  If I had purchase this directly from GreatCall, I could have at least returned the device for a refund after the trial period.
