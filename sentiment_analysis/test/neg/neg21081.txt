Wished i read the negative reviews vs the positive ones amazon sorted to the top first.  I purchased this to build with my nephew.  We worked on just the motor for three hours only to discover the motor will not run from the solar cell.  The trigger and transistor in the kit were different than the instructions which I suspect is causing part of the issue.  The solar cell is generating power but while assembled all we get are high pitch squeaks from the electronics.  Motor works by battery so that checks out. Solar panel works when checked against volt meter.  So the problem is somewhere in the electronic parts.
