I had great hopes for this controller bur the rain sensing is looking at weather data just before a watering cycle starts and skipping if it is raining at that time, not if it has been raining or if it is going to rain, just right at the time of the watering cycle.I could almost have been OK with that but there was no provision for me to look ahead and see rain predicted for the next week or so and skip watering for the next x number of days.The temperature compensation is to increase watering by a programmed fixed percentage if the temperature exceeds a programmed value.  While better than nothing, a sliding scale increase would seem more desirable.I liked the construction and configuration of the controller but the lack of a weather look-ahead and no watering skip ability were deal breakers, returned to amazon for credit.
