I really wanted to lIke this tank but because of its poor design and moldy plants, I threw in the towel after a month.First, it's impossible to do anything within the tank because the plant tray sits on top. Now, it says you don't have to clean the tank as often as a normal tank but from day one, my tank was a mess. Plants get sucked down into the tank to rot and the water never cleared up like it says it will. So you have to remove all the plants and the ill-fitting tray to get into the tank to clean.Also, there is a small cover on the plant tray that you can open to feed your fish. Beware, this cover very easily slips through and into the tank. Then you have to remove all the plants and plant tray to get the darn cover out. This happened to me at least a dozen times.Worst of all was the mold growing on the plants. No way I want that in my house. That was the end of this tank for me. Now my Betta has a traditional tank and both he and I are so much happier.
