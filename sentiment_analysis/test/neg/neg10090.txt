I work at the state Capitol and we run on coffee, I was so excited for these to be good and work but unfortunately in the words of my boss, "imaging black licorice, charcoal, and two day old coffee died in your mouth." The taste is beyond pungent and it not only leaves a bad aftertaste from the cubes, but Im starting to doubt the other products they sell as well, which I was also looking forward to trying. After this I dont think I can justify it.
