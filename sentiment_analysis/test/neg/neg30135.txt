It has been impossible to pair Pencil with the Paper app or any other app supporting Pencil. Either QA control is really poor or they are just playing with customer desires as part of a financial business. I exchanged a series of emails with FiftyThree support, and believe me, they are just having a blast while they read customers emails suffering to make this fraud work. Just and example, when asked about how the device name should look in the Bluetooth configuration, their reply was I do not think it is a discoverable device if you are support you should know right!!!. And continues with but unfortunately I am unable to check since my Pencil is connected. I just dont care if his Pencil was connected!!! A better support agent would have had disconnected his Pencil and give it a try to give a proper response.Before buying this garbage browse their support site and you will see that there is lots of people having issues connecting Pencil. STAY AWAY FROM IT!!! I really wish I had bought any of the Adonit options which are for sure a more serious company.
