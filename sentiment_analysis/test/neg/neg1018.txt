I was so excited to get this product.  I hook everything and it works great. Next day batteries are dead.i thought that was weird so I put in 3 more and the same thing next day. Now grant it, it didn't turn on if you walked by the bathroom either.  You had to walk into the bathroom because our toilet is to the left.At this point,I thought let me go buy some Duracell batteries since I was using Publix brand.  Tried those and the same thing, next day dead.I emailed the company twice and no response.Done!
