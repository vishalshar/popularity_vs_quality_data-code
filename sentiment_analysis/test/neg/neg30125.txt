Stella said we should give it two stars, I don't agree.  We both agree that we would rather go on a hunger strike that to have this stuff put on/in our food.  At least we will eventually give in and eat when that stuff is not in our food.  Mom told us that there was positive reviews, but we  don't know why.  Sorry Mom.  Love Stewie
