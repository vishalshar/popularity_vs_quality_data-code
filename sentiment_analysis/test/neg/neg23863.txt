If you do not run at a minimum of 6 miles/hr for 2 minutes during the calibration process, it will not calibrate.  Without calibration, it will not give you distance or pace info.  Even if you did run fast during the calibration, the distance and pace measurements will be inaccurate if your exercise is primarily jogging or walking.Also had a couple of times where the TickrX lost the bluetooth signal with my iPhone.  I have several other bluetooth gadgets that never have this problem, so it is likely a TickrX issue.Since my exercise is primarily walking on a treadmill at a steep incline, this heart rate monitor will not work for me.  I will be returning it.
