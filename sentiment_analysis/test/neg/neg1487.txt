This looked like a really fun idea. I purchased the mushroom kit for a friend as a present. He followed the instructions to the letter. We got a few mushrooms to grow on one side. We tried again with the other side and got nothing. Overall a really expensive and disappointing experience. You certainly don't get enough mushrooms to make anything resembling a meal. Next time we grow mushrooms we use the old tried and true method, get a fresh cut log, some spawn, and you will have mushrooms for years.
