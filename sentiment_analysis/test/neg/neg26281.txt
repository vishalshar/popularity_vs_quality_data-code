A Waste of Money! We installed it just as described in the accompanying instructions and in the online video. It looked great, after we used the tool provided to get rid of the bubbles. Within 2 hours, I came back into our home office to find the Think Board on the floor. So, we tried it again - this time following the online suggestion to dampen the wall in order to help with sticking. This time it lasted maybe two hours before I could hear it slowly crumpling as it peeled off the wall, landing on the floor again. I'm not sure what to do with the useless sheet of plastic because it is non-refundable.  Shame on the sellers for this gross misrepresentation and for not standing behind their product enough to offer a refund!
