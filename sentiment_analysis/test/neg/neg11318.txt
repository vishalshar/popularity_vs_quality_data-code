I took the GlocalMe on a vacation to Europe, and tried it in Rome, Venice, Geneva, Copenhagen, Paris, and London. It worked great in Rome and Venice, and I got solid LTE 4G speeds of 10 Mbps average speeds, sometimes more. You do have to be careful about turning off automatic updating of Apps, and background App activity, else you will bleed data from the unit. Note, that when it came time to replenish the 1 GB of data package, it was maddening that there was no USA country option for my credit card in the app that they provide for your smartphone. How was I to buy an additional 1 GB? Well it turns out that if you use the Marshal Islands country code (while in Italy or in Switzerland), than your USA credit card or even USA debit card will work. When I got to Paris however, the language for the app auto changed to French, but there was still no "Etats Unis" (USA) country option, so I again tried Marshall Islands to replenish the data package. When I arrived in London, the language changed, and this time there was a USA option, but now I couldn't use my debit card! Maddening! So I had to go back to using the Marshall Islands country code.The other thing that is not clearly explained is that you can actually buy a cheaper data package for 15 Euros that will give you a 1 GB package for just Europe. This is far better than the 30 Euros they charged for global coverage for the same amount of data. But again, it's not advertised, and you have to hunt for it in the smartphone app.GlobalMe did not work very well in Paris or anywhere outside of a major city in the countries that I visited. I took the train from Rome to Venice, and LTE service just stopped outside the city limits, and dropped to 3G. But 3G was pretty bad, really unusable, until I arrived in Venice where LTE picked up again.While in Switzerland, I stayed in Geneva and about an hour's drive outside the city in the French countryside. Again, LTE service was non-existent, and 3G service was unusable, even though it did say it was connected, I had to rely on the WiFi in the house I was staying. In Paris, there was LTE service, but I stayed in a building with 4 foot thick stone walls (many of the buildings in Paris are like this) and could not use the Internet inside. I would have expected some decent coverage outside the building, but no, it defaulted to 3G and even then the speed was terrible and intermittent. Sometimes I couldn't get any data at all. This was especially true in crowded parts of Paris where there were lots of tourists. Maybe LTE service doesn't work well when throngs of smartphone equipped tourists are all updating their Facebook pages with pictures such as for example at the Eiffel Tower, but in my experience, I couldn't use my phone at all with GoogleMaps and ended up having to switch off the GlocalMe and use the SkyRoam (with 3G speed). The SkyRoam was far more reliable and never cut out anywhere that I was in Paris, and was indispensable for using Google Maps for navigation. LTE and 3G sometimes worked in the Metro, but not always.In London with GlocalMe, LTE service was terrible and unreliable.  I ended up using SkyRoam for most of the time that I was in London.Based on my experience in Rome and Venice, where GlocalMe worked quite well, I'm guessing that they are contracting out their services to the cheapest LTE service providers in Europe. That would explain why the service worked in one city but not another, because I don't think it was the hardware that was at fault, it seemed to be a function of where I was, and which telecom was providing the service.Bottom line is, if you decide to buy this unit, be forewarned that in some cities you will get crappy LTE service, and even when it drops to 3G, it will still be unreliable. In some cities, you will get blazingly fast speeds (like Rome). Be prepared to have a backup Internet service if you really need to have connectivity, as I did by carrying around the SkyRoam. It was nice that I could use the GlocalMe's Lithium Ion Battery to keep my SkyRoam going all day long, so I wasn't displeased that it didn't work in some cities.Also if you plan to take trains anywhere in Europe, know this: the WiFi on board most trains is crap, and you really need to have your own data connection. So if your plan is to rely on the GlocalMe on the train, think again, it's optimized for LTE service in major cities, not out in the sticks.
