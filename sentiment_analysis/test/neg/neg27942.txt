The quality of these balls are not good. My dog was able to destroy it in less than an hour. The unit for the balls is amazing yet the quality of these balls are horrible. My dog puts them in his mouth and was able to split the ball in half in a few minutes.  I tried crazy gluing the ball back together but it no longer worked in the unit.  The ball material needs to be of better quality.  At $3.00 per ball at it last less than an hour will cause me to go broke.  I have a wiener dog who loves to play ball so I am so disappointed that the ball does not hold up better.
