Have purchased this Foobot in September 2015 and it seemed to work well for the first few months. However, since about January 2016, I find that it constantly shows incorrect readings for SPM. In the beginning, the SPM reading reading used to remain at about 10 ?g/mł (reasonable accurate), but now under similar conditions, it indicates 70 ?g/mł. Actually, it never even goes below  60 ?g/mł now.When I contacted customer support, I have been told to clean it by spraying with compressed air, and I have done so for several months without any improvement in performance. When reported again, I get told that 'its readings are not meant to be taken at face value, but it only indicates relative changes in SPM and I may wish to use another EMail account to reset it'. Despite doing so, it still indicates the same readings. Seriously? I wish they were kidding. The device has only one job, and that is to measure air quality. If its base line keeps shifting progressively, and indicates 60 ?g/mł instead of 0 ?g/mł within a few months, I wonder whats the point in even buying it, especially if the manufacturer does not stand by their devices and honor the supposed warranty.It would be better if the manufacturer makes it clear upfront regarding the capabilities and the reliability of the device. If I had known early on that it would barely last a few months, I would have looked for something else.
