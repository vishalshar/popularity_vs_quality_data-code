The features and promises are really great. And when it works, you can do great stuff. However, here is the catch. If you want to use it in a conference environment you will be in big trouble. Most of the times wifi in meetingrooms is to weak. This means you will keep loosing connection with the camera. And you will not be able to operate the camera. Of course we solved the problem using the wifi-connection of the camera itself. In 4 out 5 times the iPhone 6 will not recognize the wifi. So no connection either. In our case we finally succeeded to get everything to work after several times of rebooting everything, including the phone. When the speech that needed recording started the camera totally froze. So no recording, no live-stream, a lot of stress and a totally lost opportunity. And a failed test to use the system for a big conference coming up a few days later. We go back to old-fashion camera's so at least we will end up with footage. Waste of money.
