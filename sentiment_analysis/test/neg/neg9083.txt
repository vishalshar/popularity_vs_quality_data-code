I do not recommend installing the August Smartlock in your home. I am writing this review to warn you of a significant problem.I installed one on my door, using a compatible deadbolt. When I tested it with the door open, the application successfully locked the door. When I told the app to unlock the door, it withdrew the deadbolt, but then claimed the lock was jammed. At this point, I could not relock the door, even with the key.My deadbolt works perfectly well without the August Smartlock. Perhaps I could get the August Smartlock to work with it by adjusting the lock. Even so, I will not use the August Smartlock because this experience illustrates its critical flaw: if the electronics become confused, it holds the physical lock in its present state.I absolutely need my door lock to work under all circumstances. If thereÂ’s a fire in my home, I need to be able to unlock the door immediately to escape. If I need to take a loved one to the hospital, I need to be able to lock the door when I leave. Other keyless entry locks use manual control to operate the lock so the key will always work on the outside and the thumb latch will always work on the inside.If you need a keyless lock, make sure you get one that will always work in an emergency.
