I've been trying different natural deodorants. Toms did not work for me at all do I bought this lavender version. At first it was great, it didn't last all day but it did a better job then the Toms, however after about 2 weeks my armpits turned black. I mean black. I've never had armpit discoloration issues before and rarely shaved because I was afraid of causing discoloration or irritation and now they have huge black stains. I don't have overly sensitive skin and have never experienced anything like this. I honestly wanted to love it but I can't recommend.
