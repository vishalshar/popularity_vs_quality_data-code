2 stars...Only because I don't 'hate' it, for the idea you have but 'I don't like it' for the following reason... I followed the instructions to a tee...Cut it, Scraped it, Soaked it, found a nice bright sunny spot without direct sunlight, daily 'splash' of H2O, but the package stated I would have 'baby mushrooms in 1 week' ... Really? I have nothing after a week and a half.  So disappointed, thinking I would have fresh mushrooms to cook up but not even a little nub of any type :-(****UPDATE**** - I continued to be vigilant, giving more time as instructed in your email response, even tried the 'other side' - I got a total of 7 mushrooms and that was the end of it, nothing more... Sorry.... I wasted my money on something I thought would be great, but alas, it was a real let down... 7 mushrooms.......Not worth the price.
