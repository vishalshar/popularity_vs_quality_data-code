I bought this for my mother, who is 85, and we finally got around to setting it up over Thanksgiving, because she couldn't figure out how to set it up herself.  First, it wouldn't set up correctly.  Secondly, it tips when you get off and on - REALLY?  I can't trust that my mother won't end up on the floor every time she tries to get off the thing - I almost fell off of it....  No instructions were included, so once I figured out that there were batteries that needed adjusting, at least I got it to talk to my phone.  Then it wouldn't connect with the wireless, which I know was working and had the correct password, because I had just connected my phone.  Since my mother has a pacemaker, I didn't realize that she could only use it in weight-only mode (may as well buy a cheap scale at the store).  I continued to set it up anyway, using the instructions on their website.  She couldn't get on it for set-up because of the pacemaker, so I got on it and set the scale up (except for it connecting to the wifi, which it wouldn't).  When I finally had it set-up, it wouldn't recognize her as the user.  The website suggested I set myself up as a user and then tell the scale which one of us was which.  Well, that didn't work either.  I am so frustrated with this product....
