Worked really well for about a month and then just stopped working. This was not ever used in the shower itself but was stuck to the mirror in the bathroom so it never got water directly on it. A friend of mine also has one of these and it stopped working after a few months as well. It seems like they just cannot stand up to being in a steamy bathroom which defeats the purpose. I would buy another one if I knew it would last.
