Update: After contacting the Think Board group directly, they told me to go through Amazon. Amazon quickly replaced it. Once again, when I took out the mini ziplock bag which contained the marker, velcro dots, plastic card and spray cleaner bottle I could see that the spray bottle had leaked. However the mini ziplock was sealed and so it did not get the board wet. I won't bother contacting the Think Board group  to let them know because they weren't really that interested in my good customer experience nor were they enthusiastic about my having been an early adopter/supporter of their product.  This is a great idea but needs some refinement. We tried to use a blue Expo brand dry erase marker [same brand, different color than what is supplied in package] and it stained- did not rub off the board. I realize they suggest sticking with the black marker in the package- but come on-- are you promoting creativity or not?  Black marker, wow lots of fun.  The blue marker we tried had no problem erasing from a conventional white board we have in the house.  They need to work on the idea of promoting innovation through creativity- as long as it is ONLY with the black marker provided. A bit stifling isn't it? By the way- one of your marketing photos posted here on Amazon and the Think Board website show someone using blue, green and red markers.  Hmmm. Also,  this does NOT adhere to a textured wall. It fell off the wall twice and unfortunately now has hair and lint stuck to the back. Very limited options for where to place this item. Two photos attached.Our first package:We literally just opened the tube that the 30x30 came in. The board was rolled and in a plastic bag. It came with a dry erase marker and a bottle of dry erase board cleaner [liquid spray bottle].  The marker and spray cleaner were in their own smaller ziplock baggie. However.....the spray cleaner leaked out of the baggie and soaked the white board. It is all wet one one entire side. Returned the item back to Amazon and they sent a replacement.
