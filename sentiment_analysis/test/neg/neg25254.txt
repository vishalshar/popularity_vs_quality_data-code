The mug does not spil very easily when bumped.  The top of the mug is horrible.  After drinking from the mug some of the drinkis left on the top,  Not that bad except the drink tends to spill down the back of the mug making a big mess.  I would not recommend this product.If the mug top would slope toward the front this would not be an issue.
