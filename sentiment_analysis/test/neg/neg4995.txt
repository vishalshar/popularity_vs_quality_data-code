First of all, it stinks that you have to pay a subscription fee to view your recordings, however, the biggest problem is the connectivity of the think. Works less than half of the time. I already have the august smart lock (best on the market) and purchased the August Connect and Keypad so I figured to keep everything in the eco system. I have outstanding wifi signal  (running Apple Time Capsule Extreme upstairs and an Airport express extender downstair. Set it up to 2.4 GHZ as recommended. Then I purchased one of their "tested" wifi extenders thinking it is a hardware issue. No luck. Long lag time (viewing on iPhone 6 and iPad pro). I am returning it after I installed the Sky Bell. Much better product and NO subscription fees!!!!!
