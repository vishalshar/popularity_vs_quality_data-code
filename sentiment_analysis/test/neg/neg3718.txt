Great idea and gift for mushroom lovers but I must've received a dud because after following the presoaking  instructions carefully, it took double the wait for one side of the mushrooms to finally appear. They were abundant and wonderful when they did finally arrive but I couldn't get the other side to sprout no matter what I did.
