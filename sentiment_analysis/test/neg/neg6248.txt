I was hopeful that this product was all that I was wanting. Unfortunately it was not. As many reviews say and I would certainly agree, it is very awkward to put up and nearly impossible to get the air bubbles out. I do think it is fair to mention that the wall I had this on was not completely smooth and did have a little texture which makes it extremely difficult to adhere properly. After 3 months of being on the wall it fell down and due to the adhesive backing it stuck together and I was not able to peel it apart without ripping it.  I would say that if you plan to put this on a wall and there is any type of texture, don't be disappointed when it fall and is no longer usable. After all, they aren't the cheapest product and in my case I only got three months use out of it. I was very dissatisfied with this product.
