Nobody wants to lose a pet, which is why gps pet tracking was created. But if you're looking for a product that actually works, avoid Whistle at all costs.We were excited to try this out, especially since we have a cross-country move on the horizon. Anything to make us feel like we were protecting our pooch from getting lost was a good thing. Whistle had to offer us at least a little more confidence, right? Nope!We noticed that the GPS tracking was inaccurate almost immediately, but we gave it the benefit of the doubt...for a while. Growing frustrated, however, I decided to track my pup after he was dropped off at daycare. The Whistle app showed my location perfectly (just outside the building), but showed my dog almost a quarter of a mile away. I figured it was because the GPS coordinates had yet to update, so I waited (people say you can force the Whistle to manually update. This is false. Any time I'd try, it would show the same location as before. My husband, who is extremely proficient in all things tech, also couldn't get this to happen.) Finally, the GPS updated and...my dog was still two blocks away? I don't think so!On top of that, just yesterday our activity tracker totally quit on us, rendering this device absolutely useless. And the Whistle app isn't much better. Poorly designed. Not intuitive at all, with tons of glitches.We read harsh reviews of this product before we decided to go ahead and give the Whistle a shot anyway. Some people overreact or expect too much. Unfortunately, in this case the harsh reviews are completely en pointe. The Whistle is a danger to pet owners. It makes you feel as though you have a backup in case your pup gets lost or runs away, but in reality it does no such thing. I truly pity the folks that find themselves relying on this thing if they find themselves in the awful position of searching for their dog.Buy at your own peril.
