Waiting for a return/replacement or something to satisfy... got this for my dad for Christmas the box was damaged we wrapped it not thinking the cooler would be damaged. Opened it up today and it was. My dad loves it but would like a replacement or possibly a gift card or something so it would be worth to keep it or else we would just like to replace it. Please contact me. Didn't want to call on Christmas...
