I like the camera and love how it would work if it wasn't defective.  Setting it up was very difficult and required a call to the support desk.Unfortunately the camera loses it's connection to my router daily, so that makes it worthless. (It even loses connection if it is in the same room as the router).  The only way to re-connect is to unplug the unit and then plug it back in.  The support desk was not able to fix this issue so I had to ship the camera back.I also bought a model 942 camera.  It works great and I will keep it.
