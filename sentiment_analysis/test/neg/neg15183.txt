DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINEI was very excited to get this. Since accepting a promotion at work, I went from being active and on a dock to sitting at a desk all day. This means I've put on several pounds and since I'm not active during the day, keeping said pounds.I'm having issues with it. I've charged it as instructed, and had paired it with my phone, but now it acts as if it's completely dead. I pedal it and there are no lights on the front and my phone will not connect to it any more. It still works, but without connectivity to my phone (not an issue, but it'd be nice). For something like this, which resides under my desk at work, I'd prefer it to connect to the computer and have the usage stats available in a program there.I also cannot tell the difference on the resistance settings... 1 is just as easy as 8 and vice versa. I was hoping for a more physical difference in the resistances. I expected "1" to be very light resistance and feel almost like gliding. Conversely, I expected "8" to be very stiff and rigid making me use more muscle and effort to use. But it isn't. I have set it on "1" through "8" and none of the settings feel any different to me.All that being said, I am still giving it the "It's Okay" rating as I do still use it, and am somewhat satisfied with my purchase, but for $350 my expectations for this device was very high (especially with all the "rave" reviews). I am not happy with the fact that it literally only worked the way they said it would for not even a single day. But it does do what I need it to do. Were I to do this again, I would definitely do it differently and go for something a LOT cheaper without all the bells and whistles. It's a great concept, but the execution is a bit off I think.UPDATE: I've lowered my rating because it's not with the money. It doesn't work. The resistance is too low, the electronics have never really worked (except during the first 5 minutes or so), and it doesn't really do what is intended for. It's literally a $350 paper weight. I'm extremely upset by this.Oh and trying to contact the manufacturer is more difficult than climbing Mt Everest. I've sent then multiple communications from their website (no email or phone listed), never a single response. I'm fairly positive that all the "rave" reviews for this are fake or paid for.AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!
