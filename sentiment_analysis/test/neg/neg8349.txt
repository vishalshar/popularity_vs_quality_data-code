I have an Apple Watch and I bought the Withings Go to use specifically for swimming.  I did my normal 1 hour cardio class and the steps did not even come close to any Apple watch in the class or even other folks Fitbits.  We are all doing the same routine so it should have been close.  It erroneously registered 8 minutes of swimming (probably because I was sweating).  I then did 1.5 hours of swimming and it only registered 28 minutes (8 of those was from cardio class).  Needless to say, it's not doing what I need it to do.  I am tracking my sleeping, but I have no device to compare it to, so I am not confident that it is correct.  Fortunately, the device does not feed to the Lose It app or the Health app so my data will not be corrupted.
