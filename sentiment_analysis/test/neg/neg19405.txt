Not really sure that the hype is about. I find it has problems sticking to things and breaks easily. Also, they say you should wash your hands immediately after use and to not use it on food stuffs. For example, I tried to make a cable management holder, but it fell off the desk after a day. Also, once you open a packet time is ticking and it feels like a waste if you only use a small portion.
