You have to download an app on your iPhone to use this device.  Unfortunately, the app crashes when you log into it with the latest iOS 10 upgrade.  Which pretty much makes this device a $100 paper weight.  They really should have anticipated an iOS update and now every user of this device has to wait for them to upgrade the application before they can use it again.  MAJOR FAIL !!!
