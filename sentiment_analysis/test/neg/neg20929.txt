So, I just got my Belle-V Scoop today. I bought Chrome version.Box is amazing. I open the box. Scoop is beautiful. As I spin it around in my hand, I notice something. In the back of the scoop there is a visible (what I am presuming to be) brass weight that is inserted into the scoop for weight and balance.OK, I understand the need for the weight itself, without it the scoop would feel too light and would not be balanced. But why was this executed with such low visual appeal is beyond my grasp. The whole scoop is a solid piece of chromed metal, and then at the back of it is like a punch in the face visible brass weight. Mine even shows signs of glue used to keep the weight in place. Why? Why this sloppy execution? Why couldn't you hide the fact there is a brass weight inside the scoop? Why not inset the weight, then cover the hole with more aluminium and polish it? This now feels like a beautiful women, just awesome in every way, only in the middle of the forehead there is a huge inflamed zit. Yes, the woman is beautiful. But you cannot stop looking at the horrible inflamed zit.And what probably hurts the most is the fact Belle-V is hiding this. None of the product shots show this. None. And in all written advertising material they are constantly stating how this is a single piece of metal, etc. Nowhere does it say or show that there is a big inflamed zit in form of brass weight that is visible.The weight would perhaps not be a problem if it was shown on product images. At least then the expectation of a product would not be that it is a flawless piece of polished and chromed metal. But the expectations set by all the advertising and all the product shots are simply too high, and any glitch dispels the magic.As the scoop was delivered to my work, I opened it and showed to my coworkers. And every single one after seeing it and rotating it in hand stopped and looked at the back of it. The magic is ruined. I have no idea why a 50$ scoop (that is double the price of other SERIOUSLY good scoops) isn't flawlessly executed. Who was the guy in Belle-V that saw this and said "yeah, this is good, let's produce it"?
