I have several types of printers. The mod-t is a great beginner printer and would recommend other than after only a few weeks of use the hot end has failed and after numerous attempts to contact customer service to try and get a new hot end i have never been able to talk to an actual person and when leaving a message for a call back there has been no call backs in 3 days. Good machine but from my experience NO customer service.
