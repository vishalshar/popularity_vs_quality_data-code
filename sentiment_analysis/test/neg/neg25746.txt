I was very pleased with the phone until I found out after purchasing it that it did not have coverage in Puerto Rico and 2 hours into purchasing the phone, I could not cancel the order. This phone would've been great for my ailing Mother in Puerto Rico to stay in touch with loved ones on a simple to use phone. Letters, numbers, commands and monthly payments are perfect for ailing Seniors. Downfall, no coverage outside of US grounds. I still do recommend this phone here in US
