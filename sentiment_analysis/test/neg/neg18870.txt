For years I have dreamed of this type of wireless headphones.  When I first heard about The Dash I was ecstatic.  They looked beautiful, had all sorts of sensors, could get wet...on and on.  And then they arrived.I read many reviews and decided to place an order despite the mixed reactions.  Unfortunately my experience turned out like most.  The Dash can't handle the most basic task of keeping a faithful connection to the device it is connected to when there is any sort of blockage.  It is as if it needs line of sight to stay connected which defeats the purpose of wireless headphones.  I couldn't stand in my office with my phone in my back pocket and listen to music without it completely choking.  The distance from the right ear bud to my phone wasn't more than two feet.While all of the advanced features are really cool they don't matter if it can't keep a solid connection. You can spend a lot less to get the same low quality result.I sincerely hope that Bragi will continue to improve its technology.  They are on to something incredible but gen 1 just doesn't cut it.
