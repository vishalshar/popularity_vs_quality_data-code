This unit arrived with the operating system not functioning, which required the company to have to send me a thumb drive to load it.  The spool holder was too short for the width of the spool feeding the filament.  The print was less than desirable with chunks of plastic here and there.  And the scanner is slow and inaccurate due to the rendering.  Many of my attempts were horribly disfigured.  To get a good scan you must use a powder to cover the object, which is messy and does not guarantee the rendering will put the object together properly.  Finally, the homing switch for the table failed.Just a few other interesting observations.  The print will continue despite the front door being open.  The filament loops around inside and appears that it could get caught on protruding hardware.  The unit appears to be a good idea but not commercially ready.Customer Service was good at getting back but didn't seem to really have the urgency that I think is important in a company these days.  The option was given to either send back or do the repairs here.
