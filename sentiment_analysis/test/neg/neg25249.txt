Att: Android users.Before you purchase this item, you should check the product website and assure that your Android software version as well your specific model of phone will work w/this product.My son's phone, my phone, and my tablet could not load the software to run this product.This was my "grand-finale" gift for my son among other lead-in stocking-stuffer gifts.This turned out to be a Christmas-fail and I returned it ASAP, (I'm still waiting for my refund to process. I can hardly wait for that.)This was a big disappointment for the above reasons.However, on a lighter note my son and I had fun making this foolish product the butt of our holiday jokes. We replaced the word, "MIP" for the work "sh*t" in all our sentences and had a lot of fun in that respect.i.e.: "I have to walk the dog....he has to take a "MIP," etc.Your results may vary depending on your phone.Note: This item, most likely, works perfectly if you have an iPhone product. it appears that it was geared toward them.
