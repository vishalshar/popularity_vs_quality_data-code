Am using a Nexus 5 phone.  The initial pairing with the watch (after installing the Android App) was fine.  The watch has some good personalization features as to which notifications it shows and how it reacts.  BUT, if you walk away from the phone and out of Bluetooth range, the phone/watch pairing was never re-established when you walked back into range.  Had to turn off and then turn on bluetooth and sometimes had to restart the app.  If it worked better for me, it would have been a keeper.  It's a good looking watch that is well priced for its feature set
