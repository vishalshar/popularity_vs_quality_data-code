We followed the instructions to the letter and ended up with:1.Seeds fell through the cups and into the tank where they sprouted and clogged the filter. (The cups need the larger slits to allow roots to grow down, but the holes that allow water to flow into the tank are open and allow seeds into the tank. Design flaw.  Perhaps a piece of mesh over the holes would help?)2. The seeds that did sprout in the cups molded before maturing.3. Most seeds didn't germinate at all.4. Within a week there was mold growing at the water line.  Week two brought algae.5. The plants require sunlight. Aquariums should not have sunlight.  Finding the balance is a nightmare.6.  Poor quality of the materials.  The lid is warped and the tubing is cheap.  The suction cups on the filter arrived warped and are useless.7. The coolness of a great conversation piece isn't worth the headache. We now have a $65 plastic fish tank for a $5 betta.  I was really rooting for the creators of this clever product, but alas, needed to give an honest review.  :(My husband is determined to make this work, and it's requiring a lot more money and effort.  Extremely disappointed.
