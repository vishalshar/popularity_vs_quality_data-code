I got this laptop yesterday. I like the slim design and keyboard worked fine. From the moment I started using it, I heard the buzzing sound from the laptop. I think its the fan sound. The sound occurred randomly and I think the fan turns on and off randomly. I did simple word processing, browsing and the fan started making sound. I contacted ASUS customer support and they said, their notebooks are pretty quiet and I should not be hearing sound. On a positive side, this laptop is fast enough to boot and runs the tasks in speed. I am disappointed on receiving a defective item that makes sound. So I am returning and requested for replacement.Updated - Nov 3, 2016:I received replacement laptop. Again I am having the same issue of fan sound. From the moment I started using the laptop, the fan turns on and off and makes the sound which is annoying. So I thought it might lead to further defect in future. So I am returning it and requesting for refund. It is really bad experience with Asus .
