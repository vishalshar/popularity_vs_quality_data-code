Had no problems molding the ear pieces which fit well and stayed put. Both bass and treble were good for in-ear headphones for the price. The problem with this product is the cord connection. Within two weeks the right ear stopped working all together and a few days later the left ear stopped as well.  I contacted Decibullz about the issue and they were very helpful in sending another pair out free of charge.  Unfortunately not a week later again the new pair of headphones lost sound as well.  I can understand this issue after a few years or even a number of months but happening to two pairs within a months span calls out a quality problem.  Hopefully they fix this in future generations.
