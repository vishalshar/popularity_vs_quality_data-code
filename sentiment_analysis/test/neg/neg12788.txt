I gave it two stars only cuz it's pretty and I like it as a piece of jewelry. It tracks steps-very poorly. Tracks sleep-even worse.. Doesn't track breathing or cycles at all!! I waited on their waiting list for 5 months before finding it on amazon. I'm really disappointed. Going with a FitBit instead..
