I purchased this projector, mainly for its cool factor. I needed a traveling projector that was still good enough to play a movie if I wanted, but more importantly display presentations. To bad coolness doesn't carry the load.-- 5 stars for coolness.-- 1 star for only being useable on battery and not functioning when plugged in or being able to charge while using.-- 2 stars for short battery life and needing a battery pack sold separately.-- 1 star for the mini usb charger that is poorly attached which is now loose some where inside the RIF, which has now made it a cool paper weight.-- 2 stars for the 'must have, in order to use remote'.-- 3 stars for picture quality document, presentation and movieOverall, for the price there are better projectors to select from on Amazon.Sorry RIF -- I had high hopes, but it just didn't measure up to the other ones I've used. It would have made an excellent device for traveling.On to another purchase I suppose....
