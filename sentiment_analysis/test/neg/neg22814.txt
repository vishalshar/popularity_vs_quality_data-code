Dear Bare Team,I recently placed an order for a case of your Organic Cinnamon Apple Chips through Amazon. When I received the shipment, I was surprised to see that every bag was due to expire in just over a month (April 2015). The chips are stale and I am really disappointed.Furthermore, I regularly purchase the 85g Organic Cinnamon Apple Chips at Whole Foods (at least 2x a week), and comparatively these do not even seem like the same product. The chips in the 85g gram bag are thicker and crispier than the 63g bags, and have a far superior texture and flavor. I have attached images showing which product I received through Amazon, as well as the chips from Whole Foods for your reference.As a loyal customer I just wanted to share this experience with you.
