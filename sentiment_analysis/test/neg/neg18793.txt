Thought this was a wonderful idea, especially for outdoors.  I wanted to keep my dachshund interested in playing by himself, so I didn't have to constantly throw the ball for him.  Didn't even get a chance to teach him because it broke in the very first day.  The mechanism didn't seem very good, it made a horrible sound. It was also very expensive to chance on. I didn't feel it was even worth replacing it.  So back it went.  I think this product needs some more engineering thoughts and better quality control to improve it.
