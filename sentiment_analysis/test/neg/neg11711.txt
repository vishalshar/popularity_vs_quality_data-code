The devise arrive in a a very short time. The package was great.After opening the first minor issues was that I had to charge the battery.Then I needed an hour with several connection errors to try the welcome calm session (it was really unnecessary that I had to watch the opening video 10 times).The session was interesting but I couldn't say if it really works after just one session.When finished the first session I came to the real overview of different sessions at this point the app informs me about the firmware update.Unfortunately the installation fails and after a Bluetooth error a reconnection wasn't possible.I hope after a longer tryout period I will have a better experience report how this product works.
