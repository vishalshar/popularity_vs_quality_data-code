Perhaps I misunderstood what this product was supposed to be used for.  I ordered it as a mascara, however, there is little to no color.  You can't even tell that I've applied it.  It may be good for your lashes, which is why I am continuing to use it, but I really don't know.  I would not order this again for a mascara.
