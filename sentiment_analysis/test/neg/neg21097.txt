really interesting concept, but cheaply executed. For $300? no, I will not recommend this to any one. for $300 it is a premium price paid for an alarm clock, I'd expect to see a very polished product, but instead, I feel like I am still a beta tester, everything is still in trail and error period of product phase. I love the concept, and idea of smoothly waking up, (and it works!) but don't feel like it's worth $300. Couple important points need to improve:1. The app, is so complicated to use. Took me a week to get used to the app. The learning curve is high. Not user friendly2. For $300, you would think you can play any music you want from the speaker while falling in sleep right? nope, only preset music, or you have to pay extra at spotify in order to play your customized music. That is really really lame. My old $30 iphone alarm could do better than that??3. Those are the two major problems that made me give them a low review score. beside those, it is just a buggy design, sometimes it connects, other times it doesn't, had to restart the app, sometimes alarm is not on.. some times alarm is on, but cannot shut off, just weird, felt like I am still in beta testing phase of this product.For instance, this morning the alarm woke me up, I was supposed to double tap to turn it off, but I missed it, I only gave it a one tap so now it's snoozed, but the blue light was still on. I tried to double tap to turn off the blue light, but it just wouldn't turn off. I assume it's waiting for snooze program to finish? so now I had a blue light on that I cannot shut off. I had to open the app to turn it off, and it just happened my app crushed at same time, I had to restart the app, after about 2 minutes fumble with it, I finally turned off the light. Yes, by then I was really awake, so it worked in that sense lol. but come on, for $300, this shouldn't happen right? It should just work!I thought about returning it, but I still like the fun and cool factor of this product, and the smoothly waking up part really worked on me, besides, I was looking for a night stand lamp for over a year. I guess I will give it another try, hopefully they will update their software make it better, and please let me play my own music from my phone.
