Not a bad phone at all but not a great one either, it offers some nice features and powerful enough internals to do most tasks smoothly, the only things I can complain about and fairly are the camera which flat out sucks and the boot loop, I cant turn the phone on while its charging or it enters boot loop which is a nightmare because 9 tries out of ten the damn thing will ignore the fact that Im holding volume up and power and just keep rebooting. I spent 30 min trying to get it to stop last time. Last but not least is my concern on its durability, theres clearly visible seems between pieces of plastic on the phone if water were to so much as splash on it, the phone is dead and videos on youtube prove this devide to be easliy bendable.
