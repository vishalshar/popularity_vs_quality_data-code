I rarely give low ratings for Vine products because I order products that I find interesting or useful based on the photos and descriptions.  This MisFit was dissappointing.I ordered this mostly to use  as a fitness monitor and step counter.  Currently, I use a 10-year-old monitor 6 days a week, afor 60+ minutes a session and it  is on its last legs.  It still tracks perfectly, but I've had to Crochet a band to keep it on my wrist.  Guess I'll have to break down and buy a new band because this activity monitor is useless.First, the software that you must download to use the MsFit is not user friendly.  I tried to enter my sleep hours and it would not allow me to enter data indicating I started sleep at night and woke up in the morning.  So, when I woke up, the monitor stated I slept 20 hours, 2 hours light and 5 hours restful.  The only reason I gave the monitor two stars was it did differentiate between light and restful sleep.As far as counting steps, I tested the MisFit against my free steps app, my $10 pedometer and my regular HR monitor.  The MsFit was off count by at least 1/3 --just counting actual steps during my workout.I also wore it to a baby shower the next day and when I got back in the car, it was laying on the car floor mat. Apparently, it had popped out.  Thank goodness it was in the car and not at the party on a carpeted floor.Everything that this item does, I can do with free or low costs apps on my IPhone-excepting the sleep monitor.I really don't see the need for this and can't recommend it.
