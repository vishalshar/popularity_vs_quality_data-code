First of all anyone who reads can see most of the 5 star and good reviews were written by people give "sample products" (freebies) or compensated some how.  Knowing that I took a chance on it anyway for the price.The main reason I went with this product was for the separation alarm feature to prevent me from leaving my keys behind in the first place. Well that part doesn't work well, which is disappointing because that was the selling point for me. If you understand the rest of the product you would expect it to not work real well to locate your item. The way it works is by others who use the app and have crowd GPS enabled and get near your product. Relying on a network of users of the product leaves a lot of coverage gaps. I understood and accepted the limitations of the product going into it, but was expecting the separation alarm to be my savior.The problem is the separation alert false alarms A LOT. Like multiple times a day to the point where you either ignore it or turn it off. I keep my keys on me and my phone, both on my body. Going about routine tasks this morning I bet it went off way over 10 times. Sometimes it's just the phone alert, sometimes it's the phone and the device both alerting, when all the time they are both on me, phone in my pocket and keys clipped to a belt loop.If the product worked as advertised I would rate it higher. I felt some people gave low ratings because they didn't fully understand how it worked (crowd source gps), so I thought I would give it a chance, but it simply malfunctions.Things I did like was the build quality of the aluminum shell and the user serviceable battery.Overall might be OK in metropolitan area with large user base (if there is such an area) and not rely on separation alert because it's faultyEDIT: less than a week in it went from malfunction to no function. It quit working all together. Phone won't find it at all. Absolute junk. Listen to the one star reviews. AVOID. Would give zero stars if I could
