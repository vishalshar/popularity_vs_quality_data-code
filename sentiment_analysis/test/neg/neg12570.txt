I really want to love these because theyre unlike any other earbuds in the market. I'm a designer myself and there's so much love that went in to these earphones, you can immidiately tell from opening them up. With that being said there are so many flaws I thought would have been addressed already through firmware. I first saw these being reviewed on tech sites from it's first proto I believe from CES. I couldn't wait to get my hands on them but the reviews then weren't so good so I decided to wait and see if or when bragi fixed those issues.These earbuds are far superior than most wireless earbuds in the market that basically copied this very earbuds.I am an audiophile. I heavily rely on my shure wired earbuds on the daily. Given the iPhone(3.5mmJackless)7 and SHURE's reluctance to come out with a dac for it's earphones, I decided to maybe take the plunge with wireless and give it a try with DASH knowing it flaws and okay sound.The sound is pretty terrible for these which is an absolute shame specially given its price point.But that isn't even the last draw for me.The smart functions are absolutely amazing but I imagined them being more useful, so far it's just there.Here's where I draw the line and for anyone looking to buy these, I say hold off until Bragi redesigns these earphones.The sound is okay at best, the 2.2 firmware really needs to be fixed because the max volume is terrible.**The biggest issue with these is its Bluetooth connection.BELIEVE THE REVIEWS! There is no other way to say it, the connection absolutely sucks!When they say these earbuds need to be in line of sight for good connection with your phone, its absolutely, absurdly true.With my phone in my jackets hand pocket, they start to go in an out pretty badly.With my phone in my jackets chest pocket, they still go in and out sporadically.Unfortunately this IS NOT firmware fixable. With a year now on the market I wish bragi stopped trying to sell these in their current state because they're continuing to ruin the appeal of these otherwise amazing concept earbuds. Or at least offer a .1 redesign of the hardware.**The other big issue is definitely battery. First day of use, I got about 4 hours.Charging was a bit of a headache, I had to reset them because they just wouldnt charge, three hours into the case and they were still blinking red.From then on it would charge fully with blue light lit for full and then go to green in 20 mins of use.I too am usually skeptical of online reviews and these in particular has been a bit confusing for its mixed reviews.This product and brand has had a lot of clout for being one of the first with these earbuds that many company went on to copy, such a shame that Bragi has been really slow to redesign and upgrade the hardware on these otherwise far superior earbuds.
