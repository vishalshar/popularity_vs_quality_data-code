Interesting concept for attaching a sensor on the racquet string, replacing the dampener. However, I believe the design is flawed as the unit only worked a few times before it malfunctioned (short recording of about 10 strokes then stopped on its own), probably due to high impact to the device because of its mounting location. The device design probably needs to be ruggedized to sustain the high impact force of the tennis strokes. Also, the lack of clear usage instructions made it a challenge for me to get the unit to work properly when I first received the device.
