it works great on my cheeks but on my chin and forehead; angles and areas of little tissue , it doesn't work at all. I got both the pore extracting tip for blackheads ( i bought separately) and the regular tip that came with it. I am disappointed. The regular tip that came with it also bruised and scratched the pimples on my face too leaving them raw.
