I hardly ever leave reviews...but had to on this one.  I purchased the Gameband on Sept 8th. My son received it for his birthday on Sept 14th. He loved it and was over the moon excited about it. As of Friday Sept 23rd, it is not longer taking a charge. I have tried pugging it in to the USB on the computer to charge and a USB wall charger. The display works because it displays the charging image while it is plugged in. As soon as it is unplugged, we can't get the time to display. On the rare occasions that it does display the time, the time is usually several hours off...even after syncing with the Gameband program on the computer. When the Gameband did take a charge, the battery was dead before the day was done at school. I am very disappointed in this product. It didn't even last two weeks...and he hasn't even been able to use it most of that time because the battery dies so quickly.
