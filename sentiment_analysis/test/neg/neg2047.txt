I simply purchased this for my 10 month old as I was told by her daycare they are not allowed to warm the children's lunch. I followed all the steps prior to packing her lunch. When lunch time came around and her teacher went to feed her and she informed me the food was cold. I tried it at home over the weekend myself again to see if maybe I did something wrong. Once again her food was not warm at all. This was very upsetting and a waste of money.
