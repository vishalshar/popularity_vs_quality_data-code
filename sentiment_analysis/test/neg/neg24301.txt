I ordered these as part of my in-ear monitor system.  I'm a drummer and backup singer in a dance band.  I followed the instructions, but the sound quality, noise isolation and the ability for these to stay in my ears are all disappointing.  I ended up using my Samsung Galaxy 5 ear buds, and they are a four star compared to these.
