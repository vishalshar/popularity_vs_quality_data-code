This was a great idea but the brush handle doesn't stay in the curler tightly, so it's constantly coming off every time you try to pull the section of hair tight. Comes with 5 curler/rollers, but only 3 clips that don't even hold the roller tight to the hair, and it comes with one handle would be fine if the rollers stayed tight. I purchased other clips (that Amazon recommended with this set but they are crap. The ones that came with the set are better). Should come with 5 clips since there's 5 rollers, wouldn't you think? Lol
