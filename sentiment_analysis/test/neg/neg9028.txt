This phone, that is supposed to be geared for the elderly and their fixed income, has a quite expensive monthly plan!  And it is not adaptable to any other servers like Verizon or Cricket or ATT.  It's quite a disappointment.  The phone itself seems nice but before you can really try it, you must buy into one of their plans. The advertising "come-on" is $18 a month, but call minutes are quite low. The "normal" plan considering minutes for calls is about $50 with this phone!  I don't recommend this for seniors living on social security.
