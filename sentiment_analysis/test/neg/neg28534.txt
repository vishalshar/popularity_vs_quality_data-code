First, it failed to connect to my Wi-Fi network the first few times I tried to set it up within the same room from 10ft away. It finally worked when I was only a couple feet away from my router. Once I got everything up and running, I was disappointed with the LIVE stream and quality. It took forever to load and kept coming up with some message that it was adapting to my network connection. When the video finally played, it was pretty choppy and blurry. It only played for about a second or two and it came up with this spinning wheel to buffer the next video feed. Restarting my router, iPhone, and webcam didnt fix the problem. My Internet connection is strong and Ive owned another IP camera before which didnt experience these issues.Im going to have to return this product. Not a happy customer :-(
