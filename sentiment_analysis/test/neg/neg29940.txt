Got my Core this morning (Saturday) plugged it in.  Connected it with my iPhone.  Everything worked for an hour.  Then the sound cut out and an occasional clicking could be heard, but no music.  Disconnect iPhone.  After several attempts connected with my iPad.  No joy, connected but no sound, just an occasional clicking noise.  Reset the device.  No joy.  Same result.  Told iPhone and iPad to forget device, then reconnected.  Same thing.Went to Mass Fidelities website.  No joy.  Called their help desk.  No one is at work.  They are only open taking calls when I am at work.  No weekend hours.  Now I have an overpriced, heavy black box sitting in my living room doing nothing.I paid a lot for this POS and the lack of customer service.Thank the lord I got this through Amazon.  They already agreed to take this defective POS back.  Sending it back Monday.  $600 speaker system that just crackles..no response from the manufacturer.  No way to do business.
