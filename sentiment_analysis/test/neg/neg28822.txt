This is probably the biggest waste of money. I've spent about $150 on this product and related products and my dog refuses to even step on it. The grass is so fake looking/feeling, I don't blame her. It's like stepping on a Christmas tree. It's a nice idea but why does it cost so much if the grass is so obviously fake. My dog isn't stupid.
