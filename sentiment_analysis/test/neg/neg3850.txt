I rarely write reviews, even with products I am dissatisfied with, but never before have I been so disappointed with something I've bought.This product is a little deceptive because it is not just a printer. I was hoping for a simple device that I could print pictures, and I feel like it was advertised as such, but this is not the case.  It requires you to use their app. It stores the pictures that are printed on its cloud server, and it forces the user to either record a video or choose a gif with each picture printed. I value my privacy and it is just ridiculous that I need to go through this whole process just to print a picture.  I will absolutely not use this unless there is an update in the app allowing just simple printing without storing (even temporarily) on their servers. I will go with a simple bluetooth printer instead.  (I would return it if I could, but alas, I threw out the packaging. All I can do now is hope for a software update.)Please do your research and know exactly what you are getting before purchasing this.
