Having now used the product three times, I am astounded by the predominance of positive reviews here. The concept is a good one, but the current outcome is inadequate.I needed six full packets to light the first fire in my wood stove. Only the exposed granules light. To keep the product going you must move it around to expose the granules underneath.It does not get as hot as indicated, and does not stay lit for more than 15 minutes, even when moving it around as described above.Used all 17 bags on three fires, and that's simply not cost effective or time efficient.
