UPDATE: TO ONE STAR: 12/24/16: The first headset broke after only two months as the USB charging dock broke on the first unit. I contacted Lucid and they replaced the set on 9/20/16. The new ones worked for another two months then last night at around midnight the headset just DIED... no lights no power, the whole unit just failed. There is no way to get power I used two different charging cables as I have an old broken pair of Sony Gold headphones, but the headphones had a full charge at the time I had just taken them off the charger so that was not the issue. Bottom line these things are a rip off people. I ordered another pair of Sony Gold wireless headphones today and I am going to try to get a refund on these. $160 for these headphones is a ripoff they are poor quality, made in China and I would rather spend $69 for the Sony set every six months to a year (as they are prone to breaking) then to spend $169 on a crap pair of headphones buyer beware this is a really, really bad product.Update 9/20/16: I made contact with the company over the issues with the headphones and their customer support was excellent. They issued an RA and sent out another set of headphones via fedex that day. I received the new phones and returned the defective ones. It has taken me a few days to update my review as I did not open them right away.The headphones so far are working well. I was able to switch the sound features on my PS4 to Dolby 5.1 and the headphones really do pick up the sound very, very well. They are still a bit clunky but the sound quality is good. I mentioned to the rep at the company when I called in that after these broke I went back to my Sony Gold headphones and thought they were just as good of quality and actually were more comfortable, he was very surprised by my comments, as I was about putting on a $79 pair of Sony phones as apposed to this $139 dollar pair.I am upgrading my review to four stars with this observation. I don't feel that the construction on the headset, as seen in my photos (the USB connector broke off) and fell into the unit making the first one unusable.I think that the engineering of the headset as a whole from mother board to the components that operate the phones were poorly thought out.  I feel that the USB WILL break again as there is no support for the unit in a hollow body like this. There needs to be reinforcement behind the USB as well as the microphone jack as these two units get daily wear and tear. As long as the company continues to manufacture their product in China and doesn't look to improve the quality of the product by by fixing these design flaws I believe they are going to start getting more negative reviews and lose business.All of the wireless headphones that I have purchased ALL have one solid plastic body with the components reinforced in one solid piece of plastic with strong backing to make them secure. Any one who games and has to charge their units daily knows that there are times when we have to fish around for the jack and then will press the charger cord in wrong and have to pull it out and twist it around until we get it to seat. The fifteen hour battery life is good, but I game between six to eight hours a night. I have progressive MS so sleep eludes me almost every night so what do I do?  I play games until I feel sleepy. So I have to charge the unit daily, so that's seven times a week, thirty times a month or 365 days a year that this unit is plugged in by me to charge. I will update this review after I use the headphones for a few months. The last set had the USB start to fail within three weeks of purchase we will see what happens here.********I purchased these headphones on July 10, 2016 for $139 to replace a pair of Sony Gold wireless headphones for my PS4. I started having charging issues with the head set in mid August, the charging USB insert for the headphones was getting loose and not making a connection. The USB charging insert on the headphones finally broke free and fell into the headphones making it impossible to charge. See photos of the headphones, you can see where their is a hole where the charging doc is supposed to be.I have reached out to the manufacturer who has not responded and the time to return the headphones has expired. Stay away from this company and their products. I just lost $139 to these guys for headphones that are shoddily manufactured and not great quality.
