I don't ordinarily write negative reviews, but decided to warn future potential buyers of this product. I will start with saying that despite some of the unfavorable reviews on-line, I went ahead and bought the iFetch for my fetch-obsessed Jack Russell Terrier.  It looked like it had potential so I figured I'd give it a go. BAD DECISION!. Although it arrived in a timely manner, It was packaged in a extremely dirty and damaged box. Didn't think much of it at the time because the product inside looked fine. Within minutes of turning it on it spontaneously turned off. After about 20 minutes I was able to restart it, but it continued stopping suddenly just when the fun was starting. This on and off again business made it impossible to train my very smart dog to use it. she loved fetching the ball once it was working, but it rarely stayed operational for more than 15 minutes at a time. After a few days of trying to use it everyone in the family was frustrated, including the dog. I should have trusted the negative reviews on line and saved my money. The real kicker is that when I re-packaged it in the original, dirty, damaged box that it came in to ship it back, I peeled off the "ship to" sticker so I could put the return address sticker on and found a previous "ship to" sticker with someone else's return label! Leads me to assume the iFetch people shipped me a previously returned, damaged product. Burned me up!!! Especially because it cost me my time, as well as $15.00 to pay for return shipping (which they refused to refund).  So essentially, I paid $15.00 so they could ship me a damaged product that frustrated my entire family and wasted my time.It's a shame that the product didn't perform the way it was designed because it has real potential to be a ton of fun...My warning: think twice before you purchase the expensive iFetch and don't dismiss the negative reviews like I did. WHY??? Because you'll probably end up with the broken one that I returned!Now please excuse me... I have to go play fetch with my dog!
