The Netatmo Welcome should be and could be a great product, but isn't right now the software is weak to be generous, it is lovely to look at but it doesn't function as good as it looks. It's slow to load the video on the web the app while at home is fairly quick.  The sound quality is poor it buzzes in the video when there is no sound in the room and there is no setting to adjust the sensitivity of the microphone something just about every one else does.  There is no digital zooming like dropcam and others have. You cannot define motion zones like dropcam and others made a decade ago. Their web page says new features to be added soon but no details about what they are.  To be honest I'm disappointed 50% in the product and current software as it is today.  My experience with tech support on the weather station and my original Welcome (it was defective) is awful they really just are useless very slow to respond and don't really provide answers to your questions. I am going to keep it however since each of its faults can be corrected with firmware and app updates and improvements, and since the Weather Station is such a great product all around I know they can get the Welcome where it needs to be also. I will update this review as they improve the product. Should you buy it today yes but only if you are prepared to wait several months for updates to fix its faults or shortcomings. If it did everything as advertised flawlessly it would be 5. It does do what it claims today just not well.  And some of the obvious missing settings are needed for this to be a great product.  Microphone Level, Adjust night-vision sensitivity, are two big ones that are missing.  Things like motion zones are wishes but should be there.After s couple of months with the welcome I have to say. I'm completely disappointed with its performance. It just stops working and needs to be restarted once a day. The video had a buzzing sound in it.  And the motion zones aren't a mere luxury it is missing they are required my welcome can see the TV. The continuous face detection of people on TV is annoying to say the least. Netatmo promised improvements on the web page for weeks sadly the did not mention what improvements would be made and as far as I can tell none have been made. I would never suggest purchasing the welcome after using it for a couple months. Netatmo dropped the ball on this one. The weather station is awesome definitely buy it but say clear of the Welcome for now it's far to unreliable and missing some very necessary features for it to be truly useful. I still hope Netatmo makes the changes needed eventually it does have promise.
