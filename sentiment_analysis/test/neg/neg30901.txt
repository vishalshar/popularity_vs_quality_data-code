I ordered and received two of GreatCall Splash. My problem is it appears is a piece missing at top of both. Because of this I can not add cords made for these.I ordered  cords direct from Great call to make sure would fit the splash. I wonder why these pieces are missing on both of them. I thought it was me but two other people said appears a piece if missing from the top of the responder where cord is to go. Having to wear in pockets or my purse is  not what I wanted.
