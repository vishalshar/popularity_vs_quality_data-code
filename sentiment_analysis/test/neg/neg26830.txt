Really dumb design. The  clear plastic portion of the case is very easily scratched.  In fact it came out of the package scratched from shipping but that's not the dumb part.  The dumb part is the magnet.  It's embedded  in the lower third of the case.  This means the phone constantly tries to spin upside down.  Real convenient in the car!  Big disappointment as Rokform has made other terrific  cases for iPhones.
