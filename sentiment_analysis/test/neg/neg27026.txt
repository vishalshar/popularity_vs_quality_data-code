I had high hopes for this item, especially since it made it through SharkTank. What a flimsy product, broke right out of the box and couldn't be fixed. I bought it for my 90 year old mother who has frequent night time potty visits. First I had to convince her what it was supposed to do, then I had to explain that it was a piece of junk. Don't waste your time or money.
