Ok I have had this for 3 days now.  Sadly my spray bottle was cracked inside the box and there was no pieces of plastic in the farm box which makes me think it was packed with a broken one.  I followed the instruction and am waiting to see if it grows...  update...... sadly all I got was four good mushrooms.  I had tons of mushroom at the start but the four took off faster than the others.  I clipped the four ready to harvest and kept misty 2 to 3 times a day.  Instead of more growth the other mushrooms just wrinkled up and haven't grown anymore.  Do not recommend at allUpdate ... did other side of box, went exactly via instruction and got 2 small oyster mushrooms and that was it.  No other growth.  Got six ok mushrooms out of it.  Waste of good money and time.
