The iOS app is needed to access any of the settings on this amp - but the Bluetooth keeps on disconnecting, and the app itself keeps crashing on my iPhone 6 and iPad mini first gen. Also, why do I have to login every single time on to the app??? And why can't i connect my Line 6 POD HD with it in Stereo?What a waste - they should have at least made a desktop/mac app to make this amp usable. I'm going to sell this and stay with my Line 6 POD HD500x and set of JBL studio monitors.Giving it three stars because the sounds themselves are quite usable for recordings, when the app works. But nothing close to a real amp. Practice amps shouldn't be this difficult to use.
