So bummed to write this review, but we were really disappointed with this product.  It is a great idea in theory, but the current iteration has two fatal flaws: 1 - the box itself is way too heavy (even without the insulated cup).  My daughter has pleaded with us not to send it to school anymore because it makes her backpack too heavy (she's 5 and pretty strong).  (In hindsight, I should have acknowledged this concern when we first received the box.  It seems designed for older kids - it has a huge capacity). And, 2 - the box warped the second time we washed it.  It's still usable, but even when latched shut, there is an obvious gap and bubble on one side.  Really wanted to like it, but instead I just feel like I wasted money.  And I bought two :(.
