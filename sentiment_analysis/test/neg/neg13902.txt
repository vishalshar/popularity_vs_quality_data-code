Update nov. 23: I received a replacement from Amazon very quick and no questions asked BUT the metal badge w/ adhesive still did not stick to my phone! Let me assure you the install is done perfectly- The phone is clean and dry, the badge is pressed onto the phone for ample time and I have yet to use the mount because the badge will not stick. The badge from the snap+ had no problems attaching to the iphone6. So it's either the adhesive used is complete junk or the black iPhone7 won't allow it to stick or maybe both but that leaves me still unsatisfied. Can anyone that has an iPhone7 matte black (not the gloss) leave a comment whether they were successful?Reason I purchased the airsnap was because I have been happy with the snap+. I got a new phone so I needed a badge for it and I didn't have a mount for the work truck so it made since to get this which answered both problems.I installed the badge (black) on the new iPhone 7 (also black- no case) and it looked great. Waited for work the next day and noticed the top/bottom edges of the badge had started peeling from the phone. I take a closer look and the badge is bowed/curved! I tried contacting mountek direct and not so much as a response- very displeased w/ their lack of customer support/service.I'm not going to install the white badge on the new phone that's black. I will only change my review when I can get a replacement badge- if that doesn't happen, I will return this and never buy from them again.
