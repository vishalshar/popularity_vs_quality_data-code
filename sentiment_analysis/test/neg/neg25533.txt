Do not buy this item! I have had it for 4 months. It worked out of the box while testing it but typically when trying it for real it returned messages saying it could not communicate or bag is in motion please try later. Unfortunately if you do not have have Wi Fi, roaming will cost you more than the trace subscription. Their customer support is very good and once they agreed it was not working they said to try it again next time I travelled and gave me free traces. It did not work again and I tried it in multiple cities all over the USA during the duration of my vacation. To be honest I have never actually lost a bag and have been travelling for 20 years. Only once did my bag not appear but once I showed my tags which they gave me at check in they located it within minutes. I think the airlines have this covered in this day and age. Do not waste your money on this gimmick you do not need it!
