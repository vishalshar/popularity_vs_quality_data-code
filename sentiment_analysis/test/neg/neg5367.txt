I also have the Rode VideoMic Me, which costs the same and is superior to the MightMic in THREE ways.#1. The MightMic records very quiet sound, so you have to turn the decibals all the way up in your video editor.  This is not the only review here that points this out.  The VideoMic Me records audio at a more normal loudness.#2. The MightyMic lacks a brace to prevent gravity from making it move and point down to the ground.  The VideoMic Me has a brace so it's always pointing in the direction you want it to.#3. The VideoMic Me comes with a GIANT wind muff.  The windscreen that comes with the MightyMic is so thin it's worthless.The only nice thing about the MightMic is that it's *Slightly* smaller and lighter than the VideoMic Me, but it's not worth the trade-off for what you lose.  Don't bother with the MightyMic, it's a waste of money in comparison!
