I usually love the barely popped kernels but these were the worst I've ever had.  Not just the flavor but the texture and mouth-feel were all unappealing to both me and my husband.  They had the feeling of freeze-dried astronaut style food with the consistency of a rice cake.  The flavor was bleh, boring.  They left my mouth feeling like a coating of greasy dust was all over my tongue and teeth.  The only thing I did like was how fresh they seemed to be but it is hard to make freeze-dried food feel stale.  The after-taste didn't linger and they didn't leave hulls in my teeth.  I had high hopes because I enjoy this brand's seasoning line but this was a mistake.
