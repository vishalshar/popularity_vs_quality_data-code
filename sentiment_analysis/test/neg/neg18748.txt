Even after reading all the negative comments and reviews, my son still really wanted to take a chance on this toy. The concept is wonderful, but the fact that my son wasted all his money on this thing is disappointing.  The dog has a hard time following the simple commands outlined in it's programming.  It can't find it's charger unless it is literally 2 ft straight behind him.  He also can't fetch properly, which was very disappointing to my son.  He simply goes toward the ball with his head turned and circles it.  So awful.  Do not waste your money on this pipe dream of robotic technology.
