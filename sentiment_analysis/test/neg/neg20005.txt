We purchased this with high hopes of convenience of allowing access to my home for family and friends when we aren't home.Sadly both times I've needed to do this, it didn't work. I ended up having to drive 30 minutes home to let my mother in law inside. Since then we've gone old school and gotten keys made.The only reason I give it two stars is it works only when I am at home!
