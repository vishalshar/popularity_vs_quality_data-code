I love this blanket sooooo much!  Talk about warm and toasty!!! I really want to get the Queen Size next ?  ONLY ONE BAD THING 'The Quality' I've owned my puffy blanket now for just (3) days and the threading in the corner of the blanket is coming apart ? But in general it is a really comfortable blanket!!!
