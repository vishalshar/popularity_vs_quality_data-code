I wanted to love this item but find that it lacks so much functionality that is available via other sources I am disappointed.  You get 2 hours of video storage provided with the purchase of a light.  That means that a video is recorded and stored on the Kuna server and deleted after 2 hours, NOT that you can keep up to two hours of storage on their servers.  Big difference.  If you purchase additional lights, same thing.  They have monthly service plans that allow you to store at additional cost.  If you get the cheapest monthly plan it applies to a single camera so if you bought more than one camera you will have to purchase the next higher costing monthly plan in order to keep recordings for more than 2 hours.The device cannot record to memory.  The device does not have the functionality to take snapshots and e-mail them to you.  I have had cameras that do this and there is no cost to do so but not Kuna.  The device does not have the functionality to send any notifications other than to your android or apple cell phone.  The device cannot be managed via a windows computer.After a little over two weeks of use the camera failed to restart after an internet interruption.  The device lost all settings and had to be re-set up from scratch.  The internet password was erased so had I been away on vacation or something the device would have been useless until my return.  There must be more reliable solutions available that have more functionality than this.  The idea to install it over your existing electrical system is great but Kuna could do much more to build in the missing functionality.  I am reviewing other solutions before I put more money into this.Update 10-31-2016 After having these cameras for about a month I can tell you RUN AWAY do not waste your money on this.  The cameras go offline randomly and then won't connect until some random time later if at all.  Sometime you have to re-set them up which is a drag and can only be done by one administrator with their phone.  If that person happens to be away from home, those who are at home are helpless to set them up again.  I have had to set them up so many times it is almost laughable if I was not out my money for this absolutely worthless junk.  I am surprised Amazon would even allow such junk to be sold by them.  Just awful.
