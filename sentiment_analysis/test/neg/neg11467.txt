I bought two of these and have never actually gotten them to reliably function.  I had a few months where everything worked pretty well and I'd get a text notification whenever the closet door or the desk top was opened.  But for the most part, all my cell phone received was "disconnected" and "reconnected" notifications, dozens of them, completely clobbering my phone notifications and telling me nothing about the security of my property.  In the many months since I bought these things, I've reset them twice and upgraded the firmware, but frankly, I've never gotten the service I thought I was paying for ---> Notification Alerts when a closet door or private desk is opened.  Can't recommend these, although it's been a year since I bought them and maybe the latest versions have the bugs worked out.  My impression was, after I bought these, that DLink really intended these to trigger turning on a smart switch when it detected motion, like to turn on a light or your favorite music when you walked in the door.  That's not what I bought these for, so I consider this to be money wasted.
