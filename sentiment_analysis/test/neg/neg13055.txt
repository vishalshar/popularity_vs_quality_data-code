It doesn't work with Tracfone. I purchased two Bring your Own Device GSM SIM cards and the device couldn't detect any, always saying "SIM 1 not detected", "SIM 2 not detected". Plus, it connects to the WiFi but cannot access the internet. Email doesn't work, chrome doesn't work, facebook doesn't work, the application store doesn't work.We'll have to return it.
