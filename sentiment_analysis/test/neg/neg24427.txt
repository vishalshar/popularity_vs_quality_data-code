I highly do not suggest that this is used for tracking your dog that runs away. If you want to track the activity of your dog and know about how it gets to sleep for 20 hours a day while you barely manage to get 7 hours of sleep, then this is the device for you!Why shouldn't it be used for tracking your run away dog?Let's run through a scenario. Your dog runs away.1. It only pulls your dogs position every 12 minutes. So 10 minutes passes, your dog is now a mile away before the device warns you that your pet has left the whistle zone.2. You see your dog get loose, but you lose site of the dog. The device only updates the location every 3 minutes. Your dog will be in a totally different place every 3 minutes so good luck!3. I have yet to even test the GPS because whenever I ask it to track it just says that it's near the base station. Even when I walked it over to my neighbors yard and told it to track , it just says near base station. I asked support and they told me it takes up to 12 minutes to detect the location.So to recap, if you try to track your dog with this device it will take up to 12 minutes to get your first reading and then your location readings will be 3 minutes old. If your dog is too close to your house you will not be able to even track them because it will just say it's near the base station.I previously had a Garmin GTU, best device ever, amazing accuracy, quick at pulling location and all. But garmin discontinued it this year, of course.I also purchased a Tractive device, which i tested along side Whistle. The Tractive is by far superior and has great accuracy and the correct tools for tracking your run away dog. You can choose to see a live view, which i tested last night, as i walked around my yard it continuously updated every like 5 seconds and showed the trail i walked and kept it updated with my live location as i moved. So I say go Tractive if you need to track your runaway dog. And go Whistle if you want to know how long your dog sleeps while your at work....
