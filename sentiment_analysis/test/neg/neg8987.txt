Makes a buzzing sound and just sits still while it's supposed to be "roaming."  Doesnt follow hand commands.  If you battle with a MiPosaur they only occasionally randomly register hits and then the robot loses very quickly to the MiPosaur.It does balance things on its tray and will drive around pretty well with the app but not nearly worth the price for how finicky it is in general.We also bought two MiPosaurs and those are very frustrating and don't do most of what they are supposed to do.Disappointing toys.  We liked the REV cars but these robots need a world of improvement to be functional, easy to use, and fun.
