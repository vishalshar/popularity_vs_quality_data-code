Why would you give your kids vitamin B12, 2233% of the recommended values?The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that young children not consume excess levels of certain vitamins, including vitamins K and B12, thiamin, riboflavin, folate, pantothenic acid and biotin. (Infants should not consume excess levels of most vitamins.) The IOM, part of the U.S. National Academies, is a national nonprofit that advised the nation on health.I'm returning this thing right away.[Edit] Answer to the manufacturer:Hi Ali and thanks for your answer.However, I don't think you're interpreting correctly what the IOM is saying. What they are saying is that 100% is enough for preventing deficiency, and that higher doses should be avoided, because we don't have enough data which shows it is safe. This is their official text:"No adverse effects have been associated with the consumption of the amounts of vitamin B12 normally found in foods or supplements. This does not mean that there is no potential for adverse effects resulting from high intakes. Because data on the adverse effects of vitamin B12 are limited, caution may be warranted."I have to say I find it not great that you copied only the first sentence of this IOM statement as your justification. The part you didn't copy is the most important. You should be transparent with the information you provide to your customers with regard to their health.Also, your explanation doesn't justify why you're putting so much B12 in your product, we all agree that a number of people need Vitamin B12 supplements, but there is no rationale about why you're putting 2233% instead of 100% which is just what is needed.Thanks,David
