I would give this 0 stars if it was an option. This is the worst purchase I've ever done. The tracker would constantly loose connection even when the device and phone are in the same pocket. As other reviews have noted, it mostly doesn't work in the way the advertising suggests. They advertise fake claims that you can track anything through your smartphone through GPS. However, this is just a Bluetooth receiver that the phone app can pick within the range of Bluetooth. In order to track anything beyond that range, you require other users of TrackR near the range of the device. In essence the tracking is dependent on other customers subscribing/using the device and his/her phone sends the location to the other user. You are out of luck if there is no one around your TrackR device with the similar subscription. I tried this to connect to TrackR from living room to the bedroom and it could not find the TrackR.Trackr device is disconnected from the phone and cannot be found even though it's just around a corner, well within the 30 feet/9 meters. And 9 meters, even if it worked perfectly, is not exactly impressive. But it doesn't work perfectly. For example over two stories of a house, or just between two rooms it doesn't work. Sometimes it doesn't work even with straight line of sight.Please STOP the false advertising.
