Loved them at first. The headphone wire never actually worked, but i overlooked that. After the first month i noticed that they would cut in and out when I'd walk through busy areas (times square, specifically - part of my daily commute) i thought it must have been some weird interference. It was a small nuisance so i didn't think much of it. About four months in the cutting in and out got a lot worse. Then they just altogether stopped working properly.In short, they were a decent short term investment but didn't last the test of time.
