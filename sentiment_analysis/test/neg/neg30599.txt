I was looking for a device that would help me monitor my breathing so that I could learn to use my breathing as a self-regulating exercise. This device claims to do this. I have not found this to be so.First of all, the device doesn't recognize when it is on my body or when it is in the charging device. While it is charging, I'll get notifications that I have been sitting too long.Secondly, I doubt the validity of the "streaks". The device claims to measure periods of time (streaks) when breathing patterns reflect calm, focus, tense or activity. In the activity streaks, it will count steps and calories burned. During to events of my life that I believed to be very stressful, the device did not record a tense streak. Interesting, maybe my breathing patterns are better than I thought. But then, I also noticed that it was recording activity streaks while I was commuting (I drive an automatic, so I don't know what I could be doing that could be mistaken for activity/steps). Conversely, I'll wear the devise when I am playing hockey so that I can get my activity streaks recorded and hit my activity goals and I'll have no activity recorded during that hour.I have contacted Support under the possible assumption that these inconsistencies may be a matter of user error. I received an acknowledging email indicting that my message had been received and that someone would be in touch with me within 48 hours. I have heard nothing, so I'm left to my own assumptions and interpretations.I am VERY disappointed as this device is not giving me useable data, therefore it is not worth the money.
