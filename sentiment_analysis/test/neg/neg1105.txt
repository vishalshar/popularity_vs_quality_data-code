I was disappointed to discover that this plastic cap is not as inert as you might expect a plastic product to be.  After keeping a closed cap screwed on to my clean Mason jar for a few weeks, I removed it and was greeted with a petroleum-like odor.  To me, it's clear that this item off-gasses.  So it's simply not acceptable to me for long-term storage, or even short-term use.Keep in mind that the gasoline-like smell of the recap is not noticeable or barely noticeable when it's in your hand.  However, the odor is effectively magnified when closed upon an empty sealed container for many days.
