I really wanted to like this smart lock, but in the end, I could not justify keeping it.  I have to believe the decision to use Bluetooth, a relatively horrible and inconsistent wireless protocol for most applications, makes it impossible for this product to be as reliable as one would want a lock to be.  After using this lock for two weeks, I was never able to trust it to work as it is supposed to.  Specifically, I had the following issues:1. Auto Unlock worked exactly once - the day after I installed the lock.  After that, I was never able to get it to work again, despite several sessions where I implemented all the suggested fixes on August's website.2. HomeKit support, away from the home, was unreliable enough to give me no confidence in the lock.  I would say it worked about 2/3 of the time that I tried to control it via my iPhone's Home app.  Other times, the lock showed a "No Response" status in Apple's Home app.  I have an Apple TV (4th generation) extremely close to the lock, for out-of-home control, but it didn't matter.3. Control of the lock via Siri, outside the home, almost never worked, despite two weeks' of trying.  Only on one occasion was I able to get answer to the question "is my door locked?"  For all other attempts, I got the answer "Sorry, I didn't hear back."  I never could reliably lock or unlock it using Siri outside the home.4. The lock is extremely slow to update its status (in other words, to get itself in a state where you could control it).  I attribute this to the fact that it has to connect via Bluetooth.  Only when I was in Bluetooth range did it respond relatively quickly.I have other HomeKit accessories, such as Philips Hue lights and Incipio CommandKit outlets, all of which work much more reliably and promptly.  For the price of this item, and based on the fact that it is a lock (part of my home's security), I needed to feel confident it would consistently work as planned.  This lock did not inspire anything close to that level of confidence.  Even so, I liked the concept enough to try for two weeks to increase its reliability, before finally giving up.One other note: although not a showstopper, this lock is much bigger than the pictures would have one believe.  It wouldn't have been enough to dissuade me if that were the only issue, but it would be so much nicer at about 2/3 the size.If August ever released a WiFi version of this lock, I would definitely try it; again, I suspect Bluetooth is at the heart of many or maybe even all of this lock's problems.  However, until then I suppose I will wait until someone releases such a product (I know of none on the market, currently).
