I think the product works as advertised, but I had a hard time incorporating into my pre-swing routine, so I didn't get  a lot of use out of it.  I prefer my Garmin Approach G8 because I can track my rounds in real time, it has a distance measuring function, and I have reliable pre-shot data right in front of me.
