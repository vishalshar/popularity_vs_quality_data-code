I really wanted to love this thing. Seriously. I was so hyped I even paid for one day shipping. What I got was a disappointment. There are good things about it, but the cons for me are more than a little aggravating.PROS1. It is very pretty. I have gotten compliments on it and I do enjoy it. The bracelet isn't all that amazing but it does look good. If I decide not to return it I will probably need another bracelet.2. App is nice. It is glitchy as hell, but it is aesthetically pleasing.3. No charging. Ever.4. Nice variety of ways it can be worn, and it looks good enough that I don't forget to put it on.5. Inactivity alerts. I love these. It reminds me to stay active in a nice and gentle way.6. Alarms in general. I prefer waking up with the leaf, however only way I can feel the alarm (since it stops after a couple buzzes) is if I wear it on my wrist at night, but I can't because I have to wear it on my shirt to even hope this thing will catch my sleep.CONS1. The glitches within the app. There are some days it boots and crashes in seconds. I'm using the latest version on OS and I can't seem to get it to not crash or freeze more often than not. Also, from what I can find there is no guide on how to use the app. You just kind of have to explore until you find the right thing you were looking for.2. Sleep tracking is way inaccurate. I have tried wearing the Leaf on 3 different places clipped to my shirt to get this thing to pick up when I'm sleeping and it doesn't no matter what. I have always had to enter my sleep manually (I can do that myself with a notebook or even a different app that at least gives me a monthly graph to look at)3. Yes you get some fun info with the tracker, but there is no way to export it and no way to examine it other than day by day.4. Breathing exercises aren't very good. In their promotional video it shows a woman doing the exercises with the Leaf worn on her lapel. IN real life the leaf must be worn right up against the stomach in order to work. So I have two options. Clip it to my jeans where it will stretch out the clip or root around in my pants attempting to clip it to my undies. This doesn't help me if I'm having a stressful day at work. At all. It becomes more stressful trying to get it on.5. Menstrual tracking is in its infancy at best. Date and cycle length is a bad way to track it or predict it. The app also doesn't allow you to track other things that go on with reproductive health like sexual activity, mood, and BBT (all of which can be found in better menstrual tracking or women's health apps).6. The activity tracker and pedometer only record steps during "active time" which means it really isn't counting your steps accurately.In conclusion, I will probably be trying to get my money back on this one. It has disappointed me at every turn and $119 for something that is essentially a pretty pedometer is a little too much. It needs a lot of work and a lot of additional features to really become competitive when there are so many other activity trackers on the market that do all the same things plus more.
