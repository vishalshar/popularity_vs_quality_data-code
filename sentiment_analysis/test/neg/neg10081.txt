The quality is quite horrible... like Johnny G. said (I should've listened to his review)... the front is all scratched up due to no protection on the simple low-quality metal-like sticker finish, not to mention the horrible paint job for the green indicators that is spread all over some of the tabs for the sliders on the one I received. Also, the included "magnets" are COMPLETELY useless. Definitely a regrettable purchase. Will be looking into returning this item.
