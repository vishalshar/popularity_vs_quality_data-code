Going by my experience, DO NOT buy this item. I purchased one as a gift and it functioned for less than 24 hours. Customer service told her to reset it, shake it, even bang it on the counter (which she refused to do). Nothing worked. They even told her that the 'trees were interfering with the signal'. She lives on the Front Range of Colorado near an airfield - not a tree-ridden environment. They never even offered to replace it. Amazon gave me a refund - minus a restocking fee (why would you ever put it back on the shelf?). Next move? Trying to get my years subscription refunded...
