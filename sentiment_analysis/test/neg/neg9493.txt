No prior issues with filters for phantoms. Loved and trusted this brand for my drone filter needs. For the Mavic very different story. Tried filters today for the first time after having them for 3 weeks and got a gimbal load error message, took them off and submitted return request. I preordered this product therefore no reviews were available. Very sad. Do not buy these filters. Too heavy for the mavic. I will now check the other products out there to see if others find such an issue.
