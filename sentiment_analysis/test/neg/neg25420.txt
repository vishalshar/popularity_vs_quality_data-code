As a blind individual; I wanted to love this product. For years I've had an audible thermometer that has different beeps. Depending on whether you have a fever or not. However, if I was running a fever... I needed sighted assistance to give me the degree. With the Withings Thermo and Thermo app. This should no longer be an issue. That would have been the case if the app wasn't riddled with accessibility bugs. I created account just fine. However, when creating profile I couldn't proceed to next steps. This was due to the app not working properly with voice over... This is the Apple screen reader for blind individuals. The thermometer might work well for sighted people. I however cant recommend for blind consumers. Until accessibility issues with app are corrected. The even bigger disappointment... I contacted support and the CEO's email; I haven't received a response from either. I wish you all good luck with the product. However, with app related issues and apparent unreliable readings. I don't think this product is a fully capable product. Especially with the serious task it is meant to perform. As for Withings... The Thermo iOS app says it was developed using Apple Swift coding. If this is true.... Accessibility related coding issues are unacceptable. Apple provides all the necessary accessibility tools to develop your app. What's even worse... Your a company that is attached to Nokia. One of the first leaders in accessibility for the blind. This should never have happened!
