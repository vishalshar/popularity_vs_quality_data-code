I'm one of those professors who swore she wouldn't wear Birkenstock sandals because let's face it, they're crunchy and ugly. Plus, I never wanted to be confused as a "comfortable shoe wearer." But after distance running for 8 years, my arches were falling faster than a blindfolded  nun on rollerblades. So I caved (as my feet were), and bought my first pair of not so hideous Gizehs. And I'm on my 6th pair. But the problem is WINTER. I'll wear the damned things March to October, but then I'm relegated to my crossfit sneaks. Socks with Birks are just begging for a Bernie Sanders bumper sticker, so I got a pair of Birks insoles to the tune of 80 bucks. Problem is, they didn't fit in any of my shoes, and only my cloddy type boots like galoshes.Then I saw these! I really took the "feel like your favorite flip flop" line to mean Birk-like given the cork staring me in your face, but oh-no. These are about as close to Birks as those shower-flops you get at the dollar store. They are thin, floppy and have little to no support. Plus, they're cork, and given the ONLY shoes I've ever had get stinky were my Birks, I'd imagine these would last about 3 months in my Tom's, as they'd go unnoticed in anything with more native support like Born.Are they comfortable? Yeah, I guess. But so are my Dr. Scholls at 8 bucks a pair. I bought these on a lightening deal at $25 bucks and the only way I think I'd keep them is if I was some batty, old hipster trying to stop the foam industry.They are the most aesthetically pleasing insoles I've ever seen, but as granny used to say, "That's about as useful as tits on a bull."
