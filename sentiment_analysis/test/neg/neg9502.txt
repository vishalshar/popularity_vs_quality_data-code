My mom had her iPhone plugged in charging through this device while running the app. Not even a minute later, the OEM cable started smoking and melting. Scared and panicked, she pulled the cable out and received second-degree burns which caused pain and blistering on multiple fingers. I don't know how something like this could even happen. I would expect a fuse to burn out or the circuit to shut off before it begins to melt the cable. I guess not. Burn photo from about a week after the incident.
