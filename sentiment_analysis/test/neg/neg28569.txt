I purchased enough of these to outfit my entire house with them, I thought these would prove to be an elegant system that could automate all of my lighting.  This solution is not sophisticated enough to plausibly work in a large scale installation.  I have a very high end wi-fi network with many access points all connected to a single gigabit ethernet network.  My network can handle hundreds of simultaneously connected devices, on both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands using A/B/G/N/AC.  These switches would be much more useful if they had a 802.15.4 6LoWPAN radio transceiver to talk to each other; this would guard against outages in Wi-Fi that can occur.The dimmers problems begin at the most basic level, they can't handle any load connected that cannot take a variable voltage; I wanted to use these on some ballasted LED retrofits and it caused such a nightmare.  Another issue encountered with the switches need configuration for them to begin working which just causes issues when you want to use these on multi-pole switching scenarios.  These are not ready for primetime especially at the price they are going for; for this price they should be able to detect how they are wired to other switches and modify a PLC (Like the Nest Thermostat does to adapt to different ).  Don't buy for now.
