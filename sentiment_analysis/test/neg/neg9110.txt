they might consider fixing the horribly broken android app; just sayin'.  crashing a dozen times a day with no software updates in 6 months is a bad sign.  also, when these guys finally expire from bad customer support, all us customers have bricks, since the software is cloud only. finally, no tablet support on android? what do they have, 2 software guys?
