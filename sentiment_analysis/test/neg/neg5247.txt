Product has not worked out of the box. I purchased it to work with my Amazon Echo. The Anymote app and the Echo work just fine. I can get the tablet Anymote app to control entertainment system just fine using the IR Blaster on the tablet. Connect the Anymote ( which connects to the app just fine) and use its blaster in the app and nothing works.I have been working with Color Tiger support by email for over a month with no success. The support dept will not reply to several requests for status even after sending them complete information on what was setup and what didn't work.  I would really like to get this to work. The problem is that the respond rate is been so poor that I have passed the time I can return the Anymote to Amazon.
