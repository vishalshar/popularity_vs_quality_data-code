This Product is completely fine in  appearance. It looks good It truly does however everything else about the phone is undesirable after using this product. The top portion of the case constantly pops off. I have had to drive from home to a gas station because the cover popped off in the parking lot without me knowing. The case will never and I mean never get your iphone up to a full charge. By the end of the day if you have been on common apps snapchat or youtube for at most an hour your will find yourself a dead phone and to my surprise a constantly dead case. All of this wouldn't be awful if the case at least protected the iphone. Waste high drop caused my phone to crack in more than on spot and the piece as I am use to popped off and I had to go hunt it again. If you lose the constantly falling piece you wont find another and worst the phone will slip out of the case without the top piece. I purchased this product based on a youtuber review. Most reviews will be positive because these people do not use the phone for daily use at least as it appears to be since they didnt get of these problems. this is my warning to anyone curious about the case..dont get this product as it now. For the price and poor build quality that does protect or charge a phone for long this is a bad product.
