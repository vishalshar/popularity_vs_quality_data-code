I really did my research before I purchased this product, but I assumed the risk and bought it in July 2016.  Three months later, all I can say is that the concept is brilliant but the product is cheaply made and winds up costing more money to make up for the difference.  This is EXTREMELY messy to clean and maintain to give fish (in my case, 4 neon tetras that have thrived for three months) a healthy environment in which to live.  The tank isn't the issue, it's the garden on top. The growing medium gets filthy within days of sowing seeds and sprouts make their way into the tank despite use of all types of meshes and coffee filters.This photo shows the tank one week after sowing. I bought a separate 7 watt heater, a cleaning magnet, and various hydroponic/aquaponic meshes (not visible).  I've tried various plants and herbs, some transplants and the only successful crop are the radish sprouts.
