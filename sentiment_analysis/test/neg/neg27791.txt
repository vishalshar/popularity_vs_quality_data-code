The lithium ion battery lasted on its initial charge about 2 hours and has not accepted a charge since.  We are going to return this unit for a new one since it does seem like a cool toy if the battery is not defective.  I thInk I'd rather have the eight rechargeable batteries and swap in and out - less complicated.
