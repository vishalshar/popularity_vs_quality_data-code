This worked fine the first time I paired it with my Wi-Fi. After I had problems with the modern and replaced it this product no longer pairs up. I went through the set up from scratch to make sure there aren't any issues and nothing. There's no customer service from D-Link and now I have a useless plug adapter that's a complete waste of money.
