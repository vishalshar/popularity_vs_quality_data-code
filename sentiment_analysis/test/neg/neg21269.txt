The Gunbox is well built and and provides secure storage for my handgun. It keeps inquisitive fingers away while providing quick access for me. The RFID option works every time and the fingerprint reader while initially finicky, now works every time. Just required some practice on my part. I am completely satisfied with the product itself. Why am I only giving a two star rating? I have sent three emails to the customer support email address and have not received a response. This is totally unacceptable! At over three hundred dollars a pop I expect my questions to be answered.
