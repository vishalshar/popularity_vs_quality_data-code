After 2 months I bough this item I was really sad to realize the connection sucks I don't mind if I have to have my phone close to the earbuds so they don't desconect but I hate when I am about to start my work out and they won't comer to my phone , 2 days ago they are not even connecting so I been 2 days with out music at the time I work out ... I want my money back... the concept is really cool just work on the connection
