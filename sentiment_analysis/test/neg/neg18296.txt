Worked fine during setup, Siri was able to Lock/Unlock using voice commands and also thru the August App, but once I went out of range, just have not been able to connect to the lock since then even when standing right next to it(tried turning bluetooth on/off, resetting the app, restarting the phone etc). Extremely unreliable product. Do not ship something that doesnt work out of the box. What's the point of a smart lock if you cant even connect to it.
