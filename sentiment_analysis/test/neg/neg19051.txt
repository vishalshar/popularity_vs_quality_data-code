I Have used iCracked products since the iphone 4s. My current screen is just over 30 days old and the screen immediately began to detach from the frame, which I was okay with, all of my icracked screens have done this. I have it in a case and I figured for what I paid it wasn't a big deal! However now the digitizer has started blacking-out, I have been able to recover from it each time with the power button. But when I contacted their customer service I was told that I need to fill out a claim online with pictures and proof of purchase, that I understand. So I immediately went to the link that the Rep gave me and I got a picture of a grumpy cat stating that he has let them know there is something wrong with their page. I do believe that iCracked is trying to produce a quality product at a less expensive price (I appreciate that) However the adage you get what you've paid for seems to come back around.
