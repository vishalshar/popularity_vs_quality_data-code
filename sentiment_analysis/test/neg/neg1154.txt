This review is for the iPhone 7 Plus version.Item received was for the iPhone 6/6s Plus despite specifically ordering the iPhone 7 Plus version.If you aren't aware, the earpiece opening is larger on the iPhone 7 series to accommodate the stereo sound output; this means it won't fit properly.As for the product itself, it is packaged well but omits guide stickers which are very useful for applying the protector.I may be nitpicking a but, but I don't like the way the home button cutout is implemented, I'd much prefer if it followed the curvature of the button.Overall I was very much looking forward to using this, if I had received the correct item this would be a 4 star review; I'm using an inferior product instead for now.
