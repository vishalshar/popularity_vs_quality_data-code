It a complete waste of money! Now I wish I bought the pebble!I bought this for my iPhone 6 Plus as I wished that it will help not having to look at my phone very frequent for the the new notifications. However, I found that it more exhausting to use the watch!First of all, I had to remove the back cover and reset it with a thin pin every while because it simply hangs and stop connecting to the phone at least once a day if not more!Finally after a few weeks, the notification screen stopped working completely and it doesn't connect to the phone at all! Every that I tried pairing it with another phone with no use!The mechanic arms are still working, but I'm sure that I didn't pay this money for a cheap looking watch like this one, without any additional function !
