I am very disappointed with the Misfit Ray. I have used a Misfit Shine for a couple of years with no issues. If I walked 2 miles, it tracked 2 miles. With the Ray, if I walk 2 miles, it may track anywhere between .6 miles and 1.3 miles. I am very sorry I spent the money on the Ray before they worked the bugs out. I will stick with my Shine.
