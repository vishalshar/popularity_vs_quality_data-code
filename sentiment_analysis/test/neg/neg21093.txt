Listen to the other reviewers!!! I love withings and own the scale and blood pressure monitor and use the health mate app daily.  I pre-ordered, I couldn't wait.  I should have waited...The Aura is simply not ready.  We are forced beta testers.  My setup process went like this:  read poorly written quick start manual (please abbreviate minute using "min" withings), followed it and then waited for the calibration process.  Now the trouble starts.  What is calibrating? What should I be doing? What is the status? Nothing.  So I go watch Big Bang Theory and come back.  Is it done? Let's assume it is.  Ok let's join it to the app, ok download firmware update, ok...crash! Error, red X.  Restart app and now it can't even find the aura device, so I unplug and restart everything.  Now it can find Aura but can't connect, so I unplug and restart everything.  Now I get all the way through the process, but when it crashed originally it was only part way through the update and it didn't start again.  Did it finish? Did it recalibrate? How do I set the aIarm? What sleep program is on? Where are the settings? I have no idea.Current status: Right now it's stuck in military time.  I can't change it.  It says Sleep pulse, not aura in the health mate app.  I can't change it.  The alarm is turned on at the wrong time and way too early;/ I can't change it.  What program is active? I don't know and can't change it.Finally, I have a king size bed and the sensor is just way too short to reach where I sleep, so I put it on top the mattress and under the sleeping pad so I could slide it over but now there is a hard plastic lump on the edge of the bed.  Is this a problem? I don't know.  I can't change it.Why don't I know any of the things listed in this review? Because there is no instruction manual, only a worthless quick start guide that assumes everything will work perfectly.  That might be fair if the Aura was Apple like and just worked (like my other Withings products which I love), but it doesn't.  I haven't tested the sleep accuracy as I just got it today, but I'm not expecting much.  At least I know I will be waking up early on my day off and getting things done, because the alarm is on outrageously early and I can't change the time.Summary: Wait till people start posting great reviews before buying!Withings...Fire someone! Fix Aura, and learn from this.  You had me as a customer 100%.  Epic Fail.
