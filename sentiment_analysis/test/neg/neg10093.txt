They're not the most horrible thing in the world. The caffeine is amazing and works great, but the taste is pretty horrid. Not the most disgusting thing I've ever tried, but they are still a struggle to swallow. If you're running late for work and need a quick boost they work amazing. I wish there was a smaller amount to purchase so I could have tried them instead of going all out with 20 packages. I honestly don't know if I'll be able to finish them.
