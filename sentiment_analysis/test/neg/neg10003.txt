Really not a great idea.  I thought I could use in a smoker for thanksgiving and suddenly the Bluetooth stopped.  I opened the lid to find it in the condition of the photos below.  Needless to say,  I glad it didn't drop on my turkey.  The packing says leave it in and watch the app,  but if it can't take smoker temps then I would not recommend it at all.  I'll be returning it shortly.
