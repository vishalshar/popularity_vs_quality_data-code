Literally every single day I have to completely turn the unit off to get it to start tracking steps again, it seems that the unit does not 'reset' correctly after I wake it from sleep tracking mode each night. The heart rate measurement is reasonably accurate, however it can pretty much never report my oxygen saturation. Overall I'm very disappointed with my Pulse Ox, and I would not recommend it to any of my friends.I have a Withings BP unit, and Withings Scales, they both work flawlessly. This thing is a disappointment.
