Unreliable outside the US. For some reason it works for a few days and then doesn't connect to the Internet (WiFi itself works but no Internet). Tested in Germany (airport) -- works; tested in Switzerland (airport) -- no luck; tested in Croatia (airport) -- worked the first time, but not after that; tested in Croatia (coastal city) -- worked for 3 days without a glitch and then never again (for 8 days) from the same location. Using International worldwide package. Reconnected again with no problems upon return to the US at San Fran airport. Basically, the thing is promising, but as of now it's highly unreliable -- take some additional backup connection (I used my ATT phone connection with extra international package -- surprisingly that works from all locations I visited).
