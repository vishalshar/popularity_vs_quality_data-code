Looks great.  Other than that, it is terrible.  It won't connect to wifi, so it's useless.  I have a OnHub router 20 feet away and it still doesn't connect.  The product came with no instructions whatsoever and was missing hardware.  I have never been so disappointed in a product I ordered through Amazon.
