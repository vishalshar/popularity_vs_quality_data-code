Broke my micro SD card from my GO Pro so lost a whole hiking trip worth of photos and videos. The card got completely stuck in the hub port and it split it in half. Heats up to the point it burns your hand when trying to remove it. Sent an email about the issue and they sent me out another one right away and a usb to usb-c cable (that I will never use). I had asked them if it was normal that it was over heating and if they could replace my micro SD card however my questions were simply ignored. Trying to return the product all together but for some reason amazon does not give me the option to return it even though it is within the return date. Do not but this product. It is all looks but is a terrible piece of technology.
