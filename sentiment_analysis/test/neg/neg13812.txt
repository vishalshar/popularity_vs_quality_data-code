I received my kit as promised.  I started the growing instructions, January 10, 2013.  I soaked, misted, misted, waited and then read previous reviews.  Others spoke of using a grow light, of which, I don't have.  I continued the mushroom instructions, to no avail.March 1, 2013 I ordered another kit from Burpee. It arrived, well packed, plenty of instructions.  The kit was a different kind of set up.  I followed the instructions and presently there are more than a dozen mushrooms sprouting and flourishing!I used the information from Burpee and applied it to the Amazon kit.  I peeled off all of the plastic that enclosed the grow material and found.... TA DAAA....mushrooms  plastered to the inside of the packaging!  Yes, I did cut the plastic as instructed when I started the Amazon kit in January, however, the mushrooms could not find their way to  the opening in the plastic.!!My advice....make the slits real big, pull the plastic back and hope for the best.
