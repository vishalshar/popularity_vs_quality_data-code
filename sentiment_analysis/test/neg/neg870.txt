Great idea, but several issues.  As noted by many others, the balls are tiny and frail.  But, not my issue.  The machine has to be near a plug, the noise is scary to my otherwise pretty outgoing terrier, and the reason mostly for the one star is that it is cheaply made and jammed in the first hour.  Could not get the ball out not matter how I tried.  I had high hopes, but disappointed.
