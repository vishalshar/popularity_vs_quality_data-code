Bought this about a month or so ago and it set-up very quickly.  Would love to give it more stars but it has very poor operating instructions that you have to get online and I can't  see any of the activity videos I set up to record.  It's recording to the card as that data always changes but there is no way to view the recordings as the activity page always show up blank.  What good is a recording function when you can't see the recordings?  It stores videos to My Gallery but only those that were recorded when the laser was turned on not when motion alerts was triggered.  Also, there is no way to delete those videos from my phone as I now have 65 videos that were recorded when the laser was activated and no way to delete them!  Good images and quick set-up is about the only things this camera has to offer.Here is the response I got today from ifam Customer Support in regards to the camera not recording to the SD card. ...."This is an issue that we are working with our technicians on at this point in time, and I will be updating you with new developments as soon as they become available. I understand that this will be a point of frustration for you, and I thank you for your patience in the meantime. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Have a great day."So it appears they knew about this problem and released the camera to the public anyway.  They didn't even address the issue of not being able to delete the files that are now taking up a large chunk of my phones memory!
