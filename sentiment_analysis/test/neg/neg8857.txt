Video compression is worthless. If you don't have a connection that offers at least 3Mb/s upload this camera will not work for you.I used video conferencing on my connection on a regular basis and I have no issues however this camera cannot even push a  still over my connection.  I have a standard DSL connection 6Mb/s download .75 Mb/s upload
