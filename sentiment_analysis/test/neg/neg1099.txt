Does anybody ever test the crap they sell?This product, as simple as it is, seemingly can't be made right.I finally thought this one had it right. It doesn't leak, and you can pour from it without dribble down the glass.The "minor" problem? The flip top lid doesn't stay up and you need to hold it open while pouring.Not a deal breaker, but an OBVIOUS, GLARING, and SIMPLE thing to fix.The MAJOR problem? Even if you just BARELY tighten the lid enough to keep it from leaking, it borders impossible to get it off!I am a 44yr old 6'5" 235lb retired Marine and I struggle to get the lid off.Even when we apply a light coat of veggie oil to the rim, it takes all I've got to get it off.I regret buying 4 of them.UPDATE.....Not being one to waste things, I've continued to use these lids.I've dropped a star, to one. Does not even rate a single star.
