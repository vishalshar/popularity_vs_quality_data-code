in comparison to other bluetooth speakers, this products makes it complicated to connect with the bluetooth. Sound quality too is mediocre and with the price tag you could get more quality audio from normal brands such as bose etc. Definitely not recommending it to anyone and worst is the levitation serves NOTHING ELSE than just esthetic purposes. I regret making this purchase!!!
