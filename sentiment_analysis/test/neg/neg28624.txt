There are major limitations to this lock. I bought specifically for the purpose of having the auto unlock feature, otherwise I would've purchased the kevo touch lock.  Anyway, the lock does not work with two phones set for auto unlock. So every time you come home, you have to pull out your phone, wait for the app to load and connect with the lock, then unlock the door. This defeats the purpose of the lock, since I was trying to be lazy (being honest) and not have to dig in my pockets for keys. It actually takes longer to use the app, then it would to use a key.I emailed August about the issue, and was told it is not a bug, but a known Bluetooth limitation. This is something August should be telling people when they purchase the lock. I have TWO of those locks at my house, and as a result, I've got $400 worth of locks that don't work as intended.MAJOR disappointment.I'd love to return them, and just get KEVO since I know the kevo lock works great. Should've went with my gut, instead of listening to a recommendation from my brother.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS LOCK.
