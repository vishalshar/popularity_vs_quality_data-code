This just doesn't work very well.  Bluetooth does not connect quickly, generally have to turn it on then go to other apps before I can get an actual reading, if I can get one.  The thermometer itself takes temps fine but does not record them well at all.  I upgraded from their other wired product as it didn't work well either.I'm very dissapointed in this line of products
