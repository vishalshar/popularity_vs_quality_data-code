While the alarm is loud and useful, I find that when it accidentally goes off while I'm pulling it out of my purse, no one stops to look around. I would recommend this product if you need to to scare off animals or are ever in a large crowd. BUT, if you're using it while being harassed/attacked in a parking lot/garage- no one is going to come running. It sounds like an atypical car alarm.The construction is helpful though, very easy to activate by just separating the two pieces.
