Received with a bad z-axis step motor. After several hours of troubleshooting I called the tech who gave me the same diagnosis. He told me to fill out a part request and they would send me one. Went ahead and did this on a Friday. No weekend parts support which is forgivable. On Monday morning however I got an e-mail suggesting I check the electrical connections from the parts department. This would be an acceptable suggestion if I weren't a tool and die maker and if I hadn't already done this and if their technician on the phone hadn't also already made the suggestion. I proceeded to send an e-mail response which was undeliverable. I tried again. Also undeliverable. I proceeded to call their parts department and followed all the steps to talk to a human being. Then I got the recording about higher than normal call volume and I can press 1 to wait. Pressing one immediately returned me to the main menu. I tried again about 17 other times. I also tried all of the other departments with the exact same outcome. This whole process of waiting to talk to no one and e-mails that were undeliverable pretty much sealed fate of ROBO 3d in my eyes. They did eventually try and call 8hrs after I left a message on their website but I was already done by then. The excitement I had who I ordered this machine is more than I can explain. I left the awesome world of machining many years ago and there has been a deep longing ever since. I miss getting my hands dirty and creating things. This was going to fill that longing. When it arrived in the Mail instead of UPS or fedex I was skeptical. When I unboxed it and it didn't work I was heart broken. When I struggled to figure it out I was frustrated. When I lost the entire weekend I was pissed off. When my issues we're in the process of being fixed by mid Monday I was done. This dream was dead, my longing will continue. The only way I would ever give ROBO 3D another try is if they sent me a free unit.
