I loved the idea of this, but the large board was so difficult to put on that the paper peeled at a sharp angle and put a large tear right down the middle of the board.  I'm sure if I could have gotten this on without the tear I would have loved it, but the tear is unsightly and I can't write on it.  I liked the idea so much I'm tempted to buy another one and try again, but it isn't worth the 30 bucks to risk it not working out again.  Disappointed.UPDATE: I was considering cutting the board in half to salvage it despite the tear.  But, as I was writing this review, I heard a strange sound upstairs.  Went to check it out and saw that the sound was the board peeling from the wall, rolling up on itself, and falling on the floor.  I tried to unstick it from itself, but it was no use and seemed to be damaging it even further.  In the trash mere hours after it arrived at my house.
