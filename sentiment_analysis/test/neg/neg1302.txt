Lightening end of cable broke off in less than a day. Probably because cable is heavy and puts stress on connector. Also the Amazon listing says "lifetime warranty" but if you go to the sellers website it becomes "limited lifetime warranty" which "will not cover product failure because you broke it - any defect or malfunction caused as a result of misuse, failure to follow directions, abuse, or use with improper or faulty equipment. It doesn't cover incidental damages or damage caused by trying to disassemble, repair, or alter a product yourself" The listing is misleading. YOU ARE A LIAR ! I WILL NEVE EVER USE YOUR STORE TO BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS
