Mixed success on getting the batteries to connect through the app.  The connection process is really annoying since they use a loud obnoxious sound to transfer the data from the phone's speakers to the battery.  Similar devices which require pairing will establish a temporary wifi connection, which would be easier here.  I ordered two packs of two batteries.  I was able to connect 3 of the 4 batteries after multiple tries through the Roost app.  The 4th battery never made any sounds, and it took me a few minutes to realize the multi-year battery was already completely dead upon arrival.  Being a new company their reputation took enough of a hit with the dead battery, that I will not be ordering the other eight I would eventually need to replace the batteries in the rest of the smoke detectors.
