Unpackaged the drive and plugged into mac USB 3.0 slot. Drive shows up in Finder as expected. Started coping 212GB of files. Mac has SSD drive. Copy was fast to start, then slowed, and copy operation failed after 103GB of file transfer (~8 minutes). Drive died/crashed and dropped connection from USB. The drive was very very hot. Unplugged drive/replugged into USB. drive appeared. deleted all files and started copy again. dies a second time at after 100GB of transfer. tried again after reformat died again. each time the drive got very hot. I suspect it overheats and temp circuit kicks in? Maybe the drive has bad flash? Either way just on how hot it got I suspect it is junk. On to find a better quality drive...
