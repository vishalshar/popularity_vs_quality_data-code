I got hickies became I hate tying my shoes. I got some for my trip to Japan because I would not be able to wear flip flops everywhere. When I got them they were way too tight. After reading the guides I heard they would loosen up. While they did loosen up a little it was still really tight on my feet. After a week of wearing them  on my flight home I took off as many as I could. Only to find my feet had swollen really bad and it kept me from walking comfortably for a week. I'm only a size 12.
