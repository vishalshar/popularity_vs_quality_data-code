It's a piece of junk, with awful customer service. I bought the phone for its 5 Star application, and spent countless hours on the phone, on several occasions, with Greatcall customer & technical support. Not once were they able to connect my phone to 5 Star, and they didn't even know why.The battery on the phone doesn't hold a charge for more than a day, even with minimal use of phone.Data keeps running in the background, for operating system tasks one is unaware of, and this quickly increases one's bill.I returned the phone in less than 30 days and am looking to Consumer Cellular instead. I don't know that they will be any better.
