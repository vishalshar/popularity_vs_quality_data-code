Hardware..OK. Software..not finished, not ready for prime time.  After discussions with several support people, and one of the company founders, and after receiving a spreadsheet showing the back-end database entries for my Blossom controller, I determined that the software running in the cloud wasn't finished and the connection to local weather was imaginary or wrong. BTW, I'm a software developer.  They had a entry during one day for 1.5 inches of rain that occurred, when only 0.27 had occurred ALL MONTH. As a result, Blossom didn't activate the sprinklers for four days. When it did, it flooded the yard. The company promised a software update 16th...didn't happen. New promise for the 22nd...didn't happen.  New promise for 'next week'...hasn't happened. Support suggested I use it on manual, not smart watering. Hmm.. why did I buy this? While I think they have a good idea, their execution is a myth. I sent it back to Amazon as I worry they will be soon out of business as they also appear to be underfunded. They shouldn't have begun shipping until they finished the software, but I guess cash flow rules. Too bad.
