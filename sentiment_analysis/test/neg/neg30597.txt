The Spire is a neat idea, but it doesn't really do a whole lot. The breath tracker kinda works, but provides little actionable information. The other metrics, like steps, just mirror those already available on most smart phones without an extra device.The device has a one year warranty, thankfully, since mine stopped charging after about four months. Luckily, Amazon did refund it.
