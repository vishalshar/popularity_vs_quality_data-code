The filters come in a very handy plastic case and are clearly labeled for reference. The clarity of the filters is also great. And these are about the only good things to say about them. First of all, the filter housing is not small or thin enough to allow full range of motion of the gimbal. This leads to being required to perform initial calibration with the filter off. Then, once calibration is complete, you must install the filters while holding a very angry, uncooperative powered-on gimbal motor? Finally, they fit so tightly, that the force required to remove the filters poses a very serious risk to damaging the gimbal. And you have to remove the gimbal every single time you need to power the aircraft up. Really, Polar Pro? And you let these out the door like this? Catastrophic fail. Wait for improved design before you order from them again.
