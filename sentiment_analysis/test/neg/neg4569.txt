Way tooooo tight!!  Squeezed my foot so bad I literally had marks across the top of my feet.  I wore them to a football game so there was no way I could take them off until I got home four hours later.  I did slide my feet out of my sneakers several times to give them a break and stood on my sneakers in the stadium.  When I got home tried to double the Hickies elastics but they were too loose that way.  Would not buy again!!
