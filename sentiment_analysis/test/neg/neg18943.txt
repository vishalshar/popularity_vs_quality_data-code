I was very happy with my NomadKey. So happy that I decided to buy a second one for my wife. However this week, soon after I had been delivered the second key, I noticed that the first one was almost dead as the plastic was cracked all around the usb connector... It is less than 4 months (I bought it in April) of all but "not tough" use. I am working from home so I carry the key only once in a while when I go on business trip.Well, I am very disappointed...
