Contains "Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein" !!  May cause serious irritation if you're sensitive / allergic to this.  Very disappointing as the color & consistency were nice, I just had to stop using this because of bad irritation & wasn't eligible for a refund because I waited too long.  I thought it was allergies to something else but once I actually read the long list of ingredients & stopped using this lash masque my eyes felt & looked better!
