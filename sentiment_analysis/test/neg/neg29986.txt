Where to start?Setup is a frustrating thing.  I'm a tech guy and I know the systems and gear very well.  I followed the instructions exactly and it took about 5 to 10 tries to get the lights to sync.I am shocked that the lights get so hot being LED lights.  I mean they get so hot I don't know how they could possibly last very long.And finally they keep losing  connection to the Wi-Fi so far every day I have had to reset them.  And it has nothing to do with the connection.  I have a xbox and a playstation in the same location as the lights and they have never had a problem on the Wi-Fi.The options are limited atm with the hue system or Lifx.  Both seem to have cons.  But I would take a solid connection over colors any day of the week.  I may consider going with hue.  I was going to get a bunch more of these but so far I just can't recommend them.Edit:  I have decided after using the lights for under a month I'm going to return them.  The loss of connection is to big of a problem for me.  Going to try something else.  I hope they get better one day.
