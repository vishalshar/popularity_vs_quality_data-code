Definitely wanted to do a better review for this product, because it has such great potential.  And I did post a negative review about ten days ago.  I had been in contact with Spire's customer service, but had received no appropriate response to the problems I was having with the device. It worked great for two days.  I loved it!  But day three...1)  It wouldn't hold a charge (I believe the charge cable or pad was defective and it wasn't getting a full charge; 2) It wouldn't record activity; even when I was in the middle of a 45 minute walk a message popped up and said that I had been sedentary for longer than 30 minutes;  3)  It would "disconnect" throughout the day, and data regarding anything going on during these disconnect periods was lost; I'm now averaging about 10 to 20 disconnects per day;  and 4) even after doing everything customer service said to do (typical, canned troubleshooting instructions, which I followed to the letter) it wouldn't work.  It didn't appear that anyone was really listening to what the issues were, because how many times can you uninstall and reinstall the app and expect it to work, when it didn't work the previous four times?  Then I got promises of specific solutions, and that the situation would be "made right."  I was put off day after day.  Now I've waited for seven days with no word at all.  So, after having the Spire for 18 days I'm figuring the experience a total loss and waste of time.  I really wanted this device to live up to it's marketing information, because I have a granddaughter and a husband who both have social anxiety, and I saw great potential for benefit for them.  UPDATE ON 5/16/16:  Request to support was as follows...  I have not had a response about this problem, which I reported over a week ago  Now the device is no longer recording tense moments either.  I had a major anxiety episode today (missing wedding ring). I spent two hours tearing through the house looking, had to take anxiety medication and spent a solid half hour crying.  Not one blip on the tension streak.  This Spire seems to have more defects than the first one had.  The tutorials still won't unlock (and yes I know they don't on the weekend, which is s stupid bit of programming). But I have listened to the first day tutorial from start to finish every single day for 10 days. I've listened to most of the boosts and other audios and the app still says I haven't completed any of them. Something is wrong!!  At this time it's hard to tell if the problem is the app or the device.  Do YOU know or can you determine if it is the app or the device?  Or both?  Can it be fixed. I just want a device that does what you say it will do.  Otherwise I am about ready to toss in the towel.  Is the reason your "support" is so unresponsive because you are dealing with thousands of similar user problems??  Please, please at least make a reasonable recommendation.  The answer I got...Technology products are complex and are bound to have issues (otherwise known as bugs). If the bugs are causing you too many issues I completely understand not using the product.  Thank you for your time and the energy youve invested. I wish you the best.So much for the company's commitment to their product and their customers. All I wanted was a product that worked.
