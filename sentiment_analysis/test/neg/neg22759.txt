I have olive skin tone and first time of 30 min use as per instructions gave me big brown patches on both sides of my nasolabial folds. When I contacted them they said it will go away but 3.5 years and $2000 of skin treatment like Spectra laser has not been able to remove that brown patch this instrument created. Dermatologists call it PIH!!I've never cursed anyone in my life as much I did to this company because they did not mention it's not for olive skin tone.
