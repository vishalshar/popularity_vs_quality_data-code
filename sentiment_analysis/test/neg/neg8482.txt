I am actually very disappointed in this. I am a huge fan of Line 6 in this does not add up! 75 watts, come on now, 10 watts maybe. For instance I have a line 6 spider jam 75 watt amp and when that is on level 3 it drowns out the new amplifi! It can pass for a private practice amp if you live in an apartment or maybe in a bed room but that is about it. If you play with a band forget about it! To be honest I also have the ILOUD and when both are all the way up they are neck n neck. The ILOUD is much more compact and portable, when combined with an app like jam up it also has much better tones and options.  Now the features are pretty cool, assuming a lot more will be added into the tone cloud.  My suggestion would be if you want to play with a band get a line 6 amp, if you just want to practice look at your options. The amplifi is cool and may be perfect for you but please try it before you buy it!!!!! I'm actually upset I did buy it, I play with a band and also have a practice amp already. I have no use for it, from the adds I thought I'd be able to be heard with a band. Nope!
