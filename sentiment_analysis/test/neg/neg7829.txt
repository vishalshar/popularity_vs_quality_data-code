I gave up.....To many unanswered calls to Blossom Support in trying to keep the unit connected to my WiFi.  My ability to return the item to Amazon has passed, so it is hitting the garbage can today.I just returned from a 8 Day business trip to find that the unit lost connection with the WiFi system the day I left.  I live in Phoenix and the temps were around 110 everyday that I was gone.  I returned to a dead yard and 80% of my shrubs dead, due to lack of water for 8 days.I would like to know why the system won't work if it's not connected to the WiFi?  If my iPhone is with me on business trip, does that mean the system won't work?Ultimately this thing just cost me thousands of dollars in lost vegetation.Rather than making another attempt to work through their Support, I purchased a new Rachio Smart System which Amazon will deliver today.  From the reviews on that system it appears to be superior system to the Blossom.
