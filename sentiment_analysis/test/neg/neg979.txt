I love cold brew, I have been having cold brew for a long time and over this time I have acquired a certain, albeit snob like, palate for this delicious beverage. And Bizzy is NOT a delicious coffee beverage. Now common wisdom dictates that I shoudl not argue over such trivial matter of the heart like the taste of coffee but gosh darn it I cannot sit idle while this "stuff" is being sold as "ice coffee from concentrate". If you have any love for Caffeina (the goddess of coffee) you will not buy this coal sludge and will make your own like this drink of the gods (office jockeys) should be made and had! If you are too "bizzy" with other things in your life to make your own cold brew, then read no more, go drink this apocaliptic waste. But if your taste buds want to relish in the joy that is cold brew use this: https://www.amazon.com/Filtron-Water-Coffee-Concentrate-Brewer/dp/B0001GSSIOFresh beans (medium and dark blends), cold filtered water and 12 hours of brew time in the fridge will yield one and a half of these pieces of shellacked juice they call Bizzy. Use your beans again and you now have 2 liters of actually non-bitter and actually decent tasting coffee.Needless to say I do NOT recommend this black-piss to anyone with taste-buds and hope you will do yourself a favor and make your own.
