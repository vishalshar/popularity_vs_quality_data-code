Love the concept but this product executes it very poorly. I purchased the Skybell HD after reading it's many reviews and thought those who had trouble must not be very tech savvy or had trouble following instructions but this item really is that bad. I've returned it for a refund because: Initial setup was nearly impossible and the unit failed after 2 days. I also found the required adapter for my electronic doorbell did not work as advertised. Helpful hints for Skybell: Put in your directions somewhere that the users WiFi Router security MUST be WPA2! Even though the setup allows you to select and enter a WEP key the Skybell WILL NOT sync using WEP security (I found this out after a day and a half of frustrated twiddling with the thing). After finally getting it set up it was glorious! For 2 days. On the second evening my wife exited our front door within range of the motion detector and all hell broke loose, the unit began emitting a screechy static noise that would not stop. Thinking it might be interference with another phone app I closed out Skybell on both our phones, still the noise continued. I finally disconnected power to the unit but guess what? The noise did not stop because after 2 days powered up this thing had a fully charged battery and the racket continued unabated for another minute until the battery died. A note about the electronic doorbell adapter: the instructions (a picture on a piece of paper stuck in the bag with the adapter) don't even match the product and the wires attached to the adapter have no designation on them so maybe you hook it up right, maybe you don't. I am certain I followed the picture correctly but found that even though the Skybell was powered when the button was pushed my doorbell did not work. I also note the adapter circuitry is not insulated in any way... shorting the unit out is a definite possibility depending on if there are any metal bits inside the housing of your doorbell. To summarize, $200+ gadget that worked out to about $50 per day of frustration and aggravation... do not buy if you value your sanity!
