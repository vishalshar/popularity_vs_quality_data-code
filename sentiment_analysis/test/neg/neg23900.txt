I will unfortunately be returning this product as it does not work as advertised.  I had a Nifty Drive already - thought it was time for an "upgrade" so I pulled the so called trigger.  Well, this product does NOT work in early model Retina MacBook Pros as it says it will, sadly.  Thankfully, the 200GB ScanDisk I purchased as company to this product works with my old Nifty Drive so not all is lost!!Please do not read this as if I am "anti-Nifty Drive" because the opposite is true.  I am very much pro the Nifty Drive Company and think they provide GREAT products.  Just the product description was a bit off for this particular item.
