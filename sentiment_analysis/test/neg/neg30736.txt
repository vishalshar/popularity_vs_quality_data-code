It's a disappointing case that's all there is to it. It's still better than otterbox but not by much I will probably buy a ballistic case to replace This waste of money. First it doesn't have a built in screen protector, or water resistant covers for the many exposed areas. Then when you get the screen cover you have be a professional to apply it and if you're not careful you can smudge it on the sticky side and it's impossible to get off.. Just a bad case!
