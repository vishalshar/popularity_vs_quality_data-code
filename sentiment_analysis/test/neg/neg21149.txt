I like regular Soylent and often mix the powdered iteration with cacao so I was excited that Soylent decided to handle the process for me. Unfortunately this tastes neither like Soylent nor cacao (nor like a mix of Soylent and cacao). It's sickly sweet and essentially undrinkable. It tastes every bit as artificial as it is. It's as if Soylent and Yoohoo had a baby and force-fed it Nutrasweet until it died, and then bottled and sold it. I really wanted to love it but I couldn't even endure a single bottle. And the aftertaste is scary bad, too.
