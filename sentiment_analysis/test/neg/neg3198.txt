How intelligent people can be so regressive with a formerly fine product is beyond me. With no volume buttons or on/off light up button that you can feel, these otherwise simple tasks you perform many times a day, are next to impossible to perform in the dark or with your finger tip..... I have to use my fingernail and push hard to get them time work.Golly Rokform.......fix this stupid design!
