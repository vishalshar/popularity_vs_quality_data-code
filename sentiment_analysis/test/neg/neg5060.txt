REVISED due to longer testing of watch/smart features:APPEARANCE: The style of the watch face is minimal and very pleasing. The leather strap is comfortable and stylish also.BLUETOOTH: This feature lacks simply because the disconnect is constant regardless of how near or far your phone is from the watch. When you open the Nevo app, you will have to connect your watch every time and then wait some time for the sync to occur.STEPS/RUNNING: This very optimistically calculates steps. In fact, as tested, the watch can be on the counter and still manage to calculate over 500 steps without being worn. How optimistic is the calculations? On a 10,000 step day (actual steps), the Nevo watch will record almost 15,000. Definitely a mood booster (goal completed  YAY!); however, completely inaccurate.SLEEP TIME/QUALITY: The differences of light sleep, deep sleep and wake time is completely erroneous with this tracker. Over weeks of sleep and getting only light sleep as a measurement, I left the tracker on the nightstand with the thinking that perhaps it was very sensitive tracker so any movement showed as light sleep. But, even with absolutely NO movement, there was only light sleep again.NOTIFICATIONS (calls/texts/emails/daily goal reach): This again goes to the Bluetooth connection. When the connection is not there (consistently), there is no notification of any types.ALARMS: Three alarms can be set and these seem to work with consistency. I do like the visual (lights) as well as the vibration.TIMEPIECE: Keeps time well and with the design is very easy to read with just a glance to your wrist.BATTERY LIFE: In the month of testing, the timepiece battery continued. The watch came with two batteries for the tracker; however, both were less than 50% charged, so I bought a new, 100% charged battery for testing. This battery lasted almost 3 weeks before completely drained. This far below the 6+ months as advertised.NUTSHELL: Design is beautiful. Steps are over-calculated. Sleep time and quality are incorrect. Bluetooth constantly disconnects. Notifications typically do not register because Bluetooth is disconnected. Battery life for the smart features is 3 weeks maximum.
