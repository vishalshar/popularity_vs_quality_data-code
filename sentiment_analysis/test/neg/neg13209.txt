We noticed very little difference in taste between the beer out of the bottle and the beer after using Fizzics. It was not creamier, nor did it taste like tap beer as advertised. It added a lot of air, which created a head, but actually made it taste more flat overall, as if all the life had been sucked out of the beer by adding the extra air to create the head. We sent it back.
