Really cute and light, but it didn't come with a tripwire or instructions... I'm not sure what the round button-like thing in the middle is for. The pin doesn't pull easily so no worries about accidentally setting it off. However, it wasn't as loud as I thought. I first tested it outside, but it's not even loud enough to startle my cat. I'm mostly angry that I didn't even receive everything it says.
