I've purchased filters several times over with Soma directly. The ones sold on Amazon taste disgusting. I soaked my filter for over 12 hours and ran several batches of water through it before filling the pitcher for good. It was in my refrigerator for about 5 days before use. The water tastes disgusting, like plastic. It was so strong I had to dump the water out and refill. Still have a faint plastic taste. I'm wondering if the taste will get stronger and stronger the longer it sits. I have one more filter to go and if all is well with that one then I'll update.
