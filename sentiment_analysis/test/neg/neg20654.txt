The Anki Overdrive Launch kit is a pretty cool concept; but did not perform as well as I would like.  In order to get the most out of your launch kit you will need to have a good straight away before and after the jump in order for the cars to get up enough speed to make it across.  Most of the cars do well enough to get across, but Big Bang tends to have the hardest time getting the speed needed to clear the gap.  The problem I have had with the jump kit is that when battling another car in front of you it's very easy to slow down the car in order to keep them from making a successful jump; which tends to happen on every other lap.  This takes away from the experience when you have to constantly reset cars, making you lose focus on your own car.  I find my self now skipping the launch kit when putting a track together in order to avoid the hassle of constant resetting of cars. I would suggest skipping the launch kit and invest in other cars or track pieces.
