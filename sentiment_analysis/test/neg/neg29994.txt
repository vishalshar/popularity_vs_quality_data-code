Here are the Pros and Cons for this bulbPRO:Easy to Set upColors are GREATIntegrates with my G-Home for voice controlCON:Bulb Update process is unclearDrops off wifi several times a dayLIFX support is slow to respondUnfortunately the cons of this bulb outweigh the pros.  I like that there is no hub involved but the wifi receiver in the bulb seems to be pretty cruddy. I have to manually reset the light by toggling it off and then on at the switch several times a day in order to get it back on the wifi and be able to control it with the app or voice commands.  It wouldn't bother me as much if this was even once a week, but i literally go through this every time I want to control the light.  This makes it no better than a regular lightbulb!It's also very frustrating that there is no phone number for LIFX support.  It seems that all issues are resolved via email during normal M-F business hours.  The problem with this is that the response time of emails is VERY slow. I understand that I bought this bulb during the holidays so they may be overwhelmed with support requests, but in the 7 days since my first support inquiry, I've gotten 1 response from a human.That being said, my initial inquiry was about updating the bulb.  It came with firmware version 1.7 and clicking update in the app didn't seem to do anything.  Turns out that the updated version is 1.2.  WHAT??? In what world is version 1.2 a higher version than 1.7? Ugh.Update: while writing this review, they have responded to my request again by simply asking me if i've power cycled the router/phone/bulb.  I understand that they have to ask this but come on.  Offer some real help!
