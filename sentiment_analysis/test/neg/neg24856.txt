I would give 4-5 stars but the bottle was barely half full when it arrived. I didn't realize it until after my first use when the bathroom light showed all of the empty space. Very disappointed! And, there doesn't seem to be an option for an exchange so I'll have to return it. Other than that, it does smell good and has quality ingredients. Surprisingly, it doesn't have as many micro crystals as I had hope so you don't really feel only a exfoliation at best. I'm also disappointed that the seller never responded to my question (in the Q & A section) about the half full bottle, but appreciated hearing from other customers.
