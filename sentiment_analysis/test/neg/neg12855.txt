I hung in there for a month and a half while this deodorant wreaked havoc on my pits. I was referred to the website after having terrible burns/rashes under my arms. The website said it was just your body getting used to the baking soa and to stick it out. I stunk to high heaven the first 3 weeks but after that I had very little odor even without the paste. Then I developed a ton of ingrown hairs (keep in mind the rash was still present. I couldn't shave after that. Then came the painful lumps. My lymph nodes were so swollen and hurt so incredibly bad that I had to stop. The website said it was just detox, but my arms hurt. I gave this stuff a  good try, but it did not work for me.
