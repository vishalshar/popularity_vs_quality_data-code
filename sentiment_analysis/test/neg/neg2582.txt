If I could have got this thing working on any of my devices I would have loved it.  It's a great size, comes with a keychain clip (I guess if I needed something portable that would have been great to have!) and plenty of sticky options to post this little guy wherever needed.  However, I was unable to get this running on my android or iOS devices.  I wrote the company and they said they'd get back to me in a 24-48 hours.  It's now been over that, so back to amazon it goes.  I could have waited longer for a reply, but if you're going to say you'll do something within a time frame - you do it.  Simple as that.  I purchased also purchased "SensorPush Wireless Thermometer / Hygrometer for iPhone / Android - Humidity & Temperature Smart Sensor with Alerts" on the same day fearing one of the devices might be better than the other.  Sure enough.If you can get the peanut working, it seems like a great option.I love my SensorPush and I couldn't be happier with it.  Well I wish it it were as small as the peanut, but I'll take a working device over a small paper weight any day.
