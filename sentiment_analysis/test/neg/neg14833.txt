So it does have a good app and it does send out alerts and it does give you a position on the map but its nowhere near realtime. It will take 12 minutes after it has left the zone you programed to tell you that it gone because this is how it saves battery. It wakes up every 12 minute and checks in with it location. If its where it is supposed to be, it goes back to low power mode to save battery. This is a great feature but in 12 mintues, my dog is going to be miles away.Once you have select the refresh the GPS position if you are outside the area or have the tracking mode activated. It refreshes its position every 3 minutes. This does put a good point on the map at that very moment but does not do real time and honestly without real time and having an very active dog, you will probably have a long search and rescue ahead of you.This was explained by the rep when I called to cancel my service with them and found that their website is misleading in regards to the timing it takes for the updates.The battery life did hold up pretty good for me as I live in a big city and it was only down to 87% after 3 days but that was also with it being in the zone and being in low power mode.Overall, if you have a slow and lazy animal, this might work but if you have a fast animal, this is going to always leave you 3 minutes behind.
