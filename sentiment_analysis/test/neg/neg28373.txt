Good looking device, seems to be solidly build. Fairly easy to program, including fingerprint scanner. Did not have any problems to recognize fingerprints of 3 people that tried it.Unfortunately the lock died after 2 days after installation. Seems that direct sunlight fried it. Black front panel was quite hot. And it was still winter.  Had to send it back and pay for shipping. Plus wasted time to install and remove it. And my door now have an extra hole I had to patch.
