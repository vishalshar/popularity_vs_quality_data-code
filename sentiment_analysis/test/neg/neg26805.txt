I really wanted to like this product. Unfortunately, didn't even get the chance to actually use it due to connection issues.First I needed to upgrade ios to 10.2. I found this out after testing with other iPhones. Then there was an upgrade to the app the following day and it stopped connecting again.  I must have spent a total of one hour just trying to make it connect.I gave it 2 stars because customer service was responsive.
