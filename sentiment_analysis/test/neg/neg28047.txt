For the price point, I was expecting a lot more. Save your money and get an Oculus Rift or Vive. I had high hopes for this product but couldn't be any more disappointed.Firstly, as someone else had pointed out in a review in the "black" version.... the experience feels as if you're sitting in the back row of a movie theater. Nothing immersive about it. Terrible.Secondly, the item I received was missing parts including the manual and was absolutely a return. Not only was it missing components, the film that protects the glasses had been removed and was stuck to the bottom of the box!Allegedly, this has media cast features. I spent hours trying to get it to work with my iPhone but was not possible. It could be that I missed a step somewhere (possible, but how would I know without a manual). I have an iPhone from which I was trying to stream. It did not detect the Royole-X... but easily streamed to my jailbroken iPad with running Kodi.Thirdly, I don't believe this has a head tracker.... it doesn't describe it in the prod specs.. but for $700 it better damn have it.I connected my macbook hdmi out into the headset which worked. But the screen is so tiny hardly anything is legible.I will say the sound and picture quality are superb... the image quality does not make up for the tiny screen. Build is great and so are the aesthetics.I am returning mine... quite sure I got the return that the reviewer of the black version who mentioned buying the "red" version and returning it.
