Initially I was very impressed with these readers, very convenient to have attached to your phone, you never leave them behind. But now after a few weeks the "indestructible" claim hasn't proven true as one of the nose pieces broke off making them unusable. Also don't try sticking the case onto a leather case, it comes loose very quickly. I was going to order a couple more sets but hesitating now..
