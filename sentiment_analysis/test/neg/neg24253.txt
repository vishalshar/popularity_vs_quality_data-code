I bought this product to track my dog's location in case he got out. This solution seems more like Facebook for dogs focusing on their activity for the day and learning about other dogs..The device only updates every 3 minutes and does not allow you to see is history of where the dog was on a map.This would be a much better product if they focused on the primary goal of tracking your dog and getting close to real time feedback, not every 3 minutes.
