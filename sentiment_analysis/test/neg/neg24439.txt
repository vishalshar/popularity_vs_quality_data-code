I paid for the 15oz bag but received the 5oz one, which lasted my mastiff mix about two seconds. The seller refused to help resolve the issue and even went as far as to say the listing I purchased was the 5oz bag. This is ridiculous since I have the receipt in my purchase history that clearly says I should have received the 15oz bag! The seller is terrible. You don't get what you pay for. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
