I wanted to like this product, I really did.  I researched four or five different trackers and concluded that MYNT was the best one so I went ahead and bought them.I bought one at first to see how I liked it and how it worked and everything seemed to be perfect.  It worked flawlessly and I was very satisfied so I bought a 4-pack to track more things.  This is when the troubles began.  Two of the four trackers in the four pack had issues.  When I would click to make one of them alarm it would alarm for a split second, immediately stop, and then the tracker would be "lost" / disappear from my phone/app as if it was out of range.  Then it would come back online after 20-30 seconds.  This happened repeatably every time I tried to make a tracker alarm to locate an item.  After a few more days the trackers disappeared completely and would not come back.  Clicking the button showed no red light on them meaning their batteries were dead so I put in the spare battery that comes with them and that made them work perfectly and I was satisfied again... until... more dead batteries and reported battery percentages dropping an an alarming rate.  I've only had them for like a week and have no more spare batteries remaining from the included ones.  So either my shipment contained old, dead/dying batteries or their claims of whole-year battery life are outright lies to get you to buy their product after which they can gouge your pocket for the very expensive battery replacement afterwards (more in this in the next paragraph).When I looked online to buy more batteries I was truly shocked -- the company that makes these MYNT trackers is pretty much the only place to buy the special CR2020 batteries and they are charging $20 freaking dollars for just 5!  Larger CR2032 batteries can be had brand-name for less than 50 cents a piece but these MYNT batteries are $4 dollars a POP and they last less than a month.  Even if they lasted a year, this is clearly a rip-off on the batteries.  Sells like the printer company business model where they sell you the printer for cheap and then charge you $35 for an ink cartridge that takes 2 bucks to make.  If these batteries truly are that expensive to produce (they're not, these just have insanely high markup) they should have designed the product to use different batteries instead.  I believe this was an intentional design decision to control the market for batteries for this product.I kid you not, at this point it would be cheaper to just stop worrying and pay for replacing my occasional lost items than it would be to keep buying batteries for these trackers.  Save yourself the money and wait a few years until a tracker comes out that doesn't suck.
