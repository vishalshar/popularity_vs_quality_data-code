Just to be fair, I funded the Sense alarm clock on Kickstarter and have enjoyed using it for a while.  Unfortunately I lost a sleep pill (i.e. forgot to take it off the pillowcase) and had to order a replacement.  Once i received the new sleep pill from Amazon, pairing was simple and it worked the same as my previous sleep pill.  My issue is that it comes with a battery that is basically already discharged, so you immediately have to go out and buy a new battery.  If Hello Inc is listening, I would recommend either putting a film over the battery that requires removal prior to use (and keep the battery separate from the sleep pill during shipment) or simply indicating that the sleep pill comes without a battery.  This would prevent misunderstandings and some of the product complaints that I (now) see on Amazon.
