From the start, the camera was pretty poor quality and everything would freeze as soon as I'd try using the laser until I'd restart the Petcube. I ignored the problems until recently, but I now have a kitten and would have liked to use the laser. The last time I tried the laser, the Petcube just completely stoped functioning. I tried to restart it many times to no avail. I am very disappointed in this product and do not recommend anyone to buy it.
