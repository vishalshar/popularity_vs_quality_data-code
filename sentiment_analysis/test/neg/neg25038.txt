This is a pretty bad product. I REALLY want to like it but I'm giving up. I think the Prynt people are (maybe?) on to something but this isn't it. The camera "case" is SUPER bulky and not very high quality (although I didn't really expect it to be, I was hoping it would be of similar quality to the new little polaroid cameras...it's not). The picture quality is really poor and the editing functions are laughable. Since I purchased extra paper I'm now using it basically as a photo printer (but I could have purchased one of those for about the same cost or less and gotten better quality) to print my old photos. When you do that you HAVE to choose a "video" (from a catalogue of gif's) to attach to the photo. Generally I'm a fan of gif's but these are BAAAAD. In addition, it takes me FOREVER to get a photo to print. The device continuously tells me I'm out of paper (I'm not) or there's a paper jam, or I've disconnected the phone, closed the app, blah blah blah. Bottom Line: it's not working. I thought the "re-live video" thing would be cool but it's not at all. No one I knows wants to download the app so they can see ten seconds of a poor-quality photo/video.
