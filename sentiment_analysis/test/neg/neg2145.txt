The original version worked perfectly so I bought the new, improved version.  They all leak, top and bottom.  The bottom leak can be stopped by coating the seal and threads with Molykote 111.  Then tighten as hard as you can.  The top can't be helped.  It doesn't even have a sealing ring anymore!  The revisions have ruined a very good product.
