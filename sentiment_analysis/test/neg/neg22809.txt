been ill ordered this product which I had on my wishlist for sometime, figured it would be a good way to pass the time and transfer my old 33s to disc for the car etc.  when I received the item it was damaged and upon checking the paperwork, I discovered another party purchased this same item on the 27th of December 2015 and had returned it, her return barcode was still in the box.  I called amazon and got a rep with an attitude, told me to stop talking so he could work on my claim.  the product was not ordered used, it was ordered new, according to my return slip I will not get the price for a new unit but a used one,  happy mothers day to me, I don't cry a lot but I cried over this. everybody makes mistakes but admit it and don't disrespect a 77 year old who is trying to recuperate this item is bee backordered and I will have to wait six weeks for another, thank you amazon for showing your true colors I feel I was disrespected by the rep who would not put a supervisor on the line, and I would recommend turning the smile on the box upside down.
