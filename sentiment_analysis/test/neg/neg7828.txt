I *want* to like this product, but unfortunately it's not quite ready for prime time on the software side of things. As just an analog sprinkler timer, the device works perfectly fine and couldn't be easier to install. However, this is a "smart" sprinkler timer, and ironically it is the "smart" feature that makes this product dumb.There is far too much overthinking that went into the design of the brains of this product, when this 1.0 product should have abided by the sage mantra of KISS. (Keep It Simple, Stupid. Or in this case: Keep It Simple, Smart!) The whole point of this device is that I should just be able to "set it and forget it" -- however the algorithm and percentage sliders and buckets seem to have a mind of their own. Here is all this product, imho, needs to do:1) I set the baseline watering time for each zone. If it doesn't rain that day (or if the forecast doesn't call for rain later that day) then the system waters for that baseline time.2) If it rains long enough that the zone has gotten the equivalent of my baseline time's worth of water, then the system does not water that day.3) If it rains, but *not* long enough to be the equivalent of my set baseline time, then the system waters for 50% of my baseline time that day.4) If it is a *super-heavy* all day downpour, then the system can also do a 0% or 50% watering on the next cycle as well.And that's it! That's all I need! And I imagine that's all that 99% of users of this product need! However the watering time calculation is all over the map, for no reason. If my baseline calls for all my zones to be watered in 40 minutes, then there is no reason for it to water for 56 one day and 12 another. It should be 40...40...40...light rain? then 20...but then 40 again...40...now heavy rain? then 0...and so on.Right now it unfortunately makes more sense (and instills more confidence) for me to use this thing with the "smart" features turned off and manually turn the system off and on if it rains...and that's just dumb. It defeats the whole purpose of why I bought this product to begin with -- if I had wanted to do that, I could have stuck with my $40 analog box in the garage.So please, Blossom -- be smart, but not too smart for your own good. You're not trying to win the Nobel Prize for Agriculture. You're just trying to water my lawn in a way that a) doesn't waste water when it rains, b) doesn't underwater/forget to turn the sprinkler back on when it stops raining, and c) saves me a little time by not needing to think about any of this. Please do us all a favor in future iterations of your app and just Keep It Simple.
