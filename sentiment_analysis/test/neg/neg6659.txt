Reading these reviews one would be lead to believe that this is the best bike that money can buy for your little one, so NOT true.  The bike has features that are great such as the full chain guard and hand brake.  However, I seriously question the quality control process.The first bike we received had a tire that was leaking right out of the box.  I contacted Amazon asking to send me a replacement wheel/tire but the customer service rep told me that was not an option.  I had to return the old bike and get a replacement.  This was a huge inconvenience, having to put together two bikes to get it right and then disassembling one of them to send it back. The replacement arrived in a totally banged up box and this one had a handle that would move no matter how hard I tried to tightened the bolt!  So ended up using parts from two different bikes to get one functional bike.  My advice to any potential buyer would be to check all the parts carefully before you discard the box.
