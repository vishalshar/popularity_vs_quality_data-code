This thing is great honestly. Ive had this for about 6 months now and i think that the temperature reading is a little off but ,the color schemes still seem to be accurate as to what is hot and what is cold , only issue is with the temperature reading it says that a flame on a lighter is only 90 degrees F which is definitely wrong. Its worked great for finding things though ,ive found the exhaust leak in my vehicle almost immediately and i found a hornets nest in the wall of my friends house. still for 300 bucks itd be nice to get the temp too.
