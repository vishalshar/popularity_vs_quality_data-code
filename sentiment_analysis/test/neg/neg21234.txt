We got this card as a joke to give to my grandparents and we couldn't wait to see their reaction.... Within about 1 minute, my grandpa saw the slit where the tab was pulled from and stuck a piece of folded paper in there and it shut off.  We are quite disappointed with the card and were hoping for a lot more... especially since it cost $16.
