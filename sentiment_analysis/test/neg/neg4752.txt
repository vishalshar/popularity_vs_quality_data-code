***UPDATE AS OF 8/22/16 - Very sad...we had to send this back.  Found that we sent hot soup again with our daughter and this time it leaked bad because her box was sideways in her back pack.  I guess as long as it sits flat it's fine, but turn it sidways and all the liquid comes out.  We even tested this theory at home several times and made sure the lid was on right and still no luck!  We really really wanted to like this product, because it's a great idea, but the thermos section will need some re-engineering before it's ready for prime time.This thing is FANTASTIC!  We bought it for our 2 year old daughter to take to school and man does she love it!  Not sure what some of the negative reviews are for...unless your kid can eat a whole cow, this things has plenty of compartment.  We've sent her to school with Hot soup on the thermos container that it comes with and mac and cheese another time and happy to report that when she got home she said her lunch was nice and hot still!  The best part is you can always remove the thermos and it opens up a huge section big enough for a large peanut butter and jelly or turkey and ham sandwich for the kiddos!  Thanks for a great product!
