I took awhile before I decided to write a review, because I was hoping for an updated app or that the product would be improved. Unfortunately, the updates haven't occurred.Pros:- Control it over WiFi and it tells you when its running at the exact moment it is running.- Setup is fairly easy.- They do communicate that they are getting your issues when you report it.Negatives:- Smart watering is bad. Ideally, it should know based on your location how much to adjust the watering. However, I have had numerous occasions where it significantly overwaters when it has been cold/rainy. I've also experienced bugs where it reports that it has watered when it hasn't (this is one that has occurred a few times, and the customer service response has been "we'll get back to you").- When I first got the device it would significantly overwater when in "Smart water" mode. I had set it up correctly and only set it at 10% for each zone so when it says it should only run for 4 minutes per zone it was running 15 minutes per zone when it actually ran so I had numerous zones that were flooded. The solution from customer service was to change the type of watering, but it produced the same problem so I ended up having to avoid smart watering for a long period of time.- If you avoid "smart watering" and do the timer based it does not turn off the services even when it rains. This is incredibly silly, and would take a few minutes to code so I'm not sure why this wasn't implemented at launch especially since this is how "smart watering" works so the functionality is already implemented.- It is also missing features that I would deem necessary that are provided by Rain Bird controllers such as running multiple times a day to maximize soaking, or not taking input from a rain sensor. Like many other reviews have reported, it does occasionally run when it rains.- After waiting for almost a year, I'm done waiting for any new features to be added and going to switch back to my Rain Bird controller or jump over to a different wifi controller that is going to provide better support.
