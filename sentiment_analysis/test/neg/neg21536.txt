Like other reviewers have said, stay away from this one. I bought my first d-link camera, the dcs-932, a week ago, and I was so impressed I wanted a couple more. I then ordered one of the pan and scan ones, and it works ok, although it loses connection sometime. Then I wanted to try one of the hd ones, and this one was at a warehouse deal, so I got it. I got it, plugged it in, hit the wps button on my router and on the camera, and it worked great. The picture was super clear and very wide angle. And then, the next day, it just lost connection and it hasn't worked since. Even right next to the router, it won't connect with wifi anymore, and the "connect" button stays lit up solid green. Not sure what that button is even for, but it just won't work anymore. I hate to say it, but all three of them that I have seem a little iffy, but at least the other two will reconnect. This one won't. What a disappointment.
