Thirty bucks for a strip of plastic and a screw? I must have been out of my mind to order this thing. It might solve "jingle" for people without car keys, but your big auto fobs will still dangle loose. It actually makes my small mailbox key harder to use. And most of the time my keys don't even stay tucked in. These folks got a lotta nerve selling this thing for more than 3 bucks.
