Bought this on a knee jerk reaction whe I saw the YouTuber "Sail Life" saying he was given one of them. I should learn to not watch TV with my IPAD that close.First thing. In sub 5-6 kt winds I have to start the thing myself. I have to tap it with my fingernail and then it starts reading. Ive always kept it in the bag that comes with it.the clip broke third time I used it. It is just a little plastic tab that goes on the front or the back of your phone. (That way it gives you precise wind direction)  Just got an email from support."You abused it" Here is a coupon for 10% off the next one.That is absolute nonsense. It snapped off right as I was inserting it. I wasnt inserting it fast or at a strange angle. The clip just fell off.I had spotty results with getting the unit to work too originally. There was an IOS bug apparently. Then there was IOS settings on the phone that stopped it working completely. (Make sure the device can use the microphone) Sometimes the device could not be detected.As of late is has been detecting perfectly however.***Price also increased 30% since I bought it.If I buy another wind meter. I will spend the money on a stand alone meter that doesnt have to use my 400 dollar phone around water.
