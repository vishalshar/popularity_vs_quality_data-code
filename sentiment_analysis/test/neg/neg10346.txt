This thing fell off several times a day...and then one day it was just gone.  Luckily I found it after awhile and made sure to make adjustments so that this doesn't happen again.  Most of the time the results are a little off - I feel stressed, it says i'm not, but its primary use is to remind me simply to Breathe when i'm playing guitar or driving - and for this it's still only so helpful-  if your breathing isn't consistently stressed or diffuser or can for two consecutive minutes, it's not logged.Update:. Android version sucks. Undeveloped, it never smart connects, I have this thing on and I'll open the app only to see it didnt record the last four days.  That's ridiculous.  It should always open app when data is coming in, it should save 24 hours of info in-between app acess, it should let me know when to charge it well in advance.  Integration into my life has been frustrating. Lost, not charged, not paired, not in range, not accurate....  Plus when I'm tense it shows me a big ole red screen = making me more tense.  Not to mention it shows me  nonsense like I've been active 8 minutes, sedentary for 2 and somehow managed to take 5,000 steps and burn 2,400 calories.  Really Stupid.  Android version is like trying to exercise in a sleeping bag. Oh, and changing settings is a sliding scale, so say I want 5000 steps to be my goal, well I hope 5,101 or 4,982 works for you because it's impossible to set it accurately. What idiot set that up??? Don't recommend 5,000 steps and then make it utterly impossible to set it.  When I double click it should adjust to a she number/recommended setting. I should be able to type it in as well.  Not to mention that, inexplicably, I have to be stressed for two while minutes, uninterrupted, for this thing to be useful.... I don't want to be tense for more than a minute, why the hell isn't 30 seconds or a minute an option???  Two minutes!!! I'm pretty sure I don't need a device to let me know that. I need something that senses it immediately.  Really sucksUpdate-. I wear this all day and get two hours of data out of it. Pairing is a pain.  Got a free replacement and still think it's a bum deal.  Don't recommend All in all, cool idea, just not ready for Android. The iPhone version was better. But still a half baked deviceUpdate: I've worn a charged unit for four days and it recorded less than ten hours of info.  This happens all the time.  These things are junk!!!Always be on and connected. Notify me of dying or dead battery in my phone and unit.  Forget two minutes minimums, ten seconds of stressed breathing - I want to know.  If I hold my breath unconsciously - I want to know immediately!  And account for all the time wearing it - not these two minute little pockets scattered throughout the day.
