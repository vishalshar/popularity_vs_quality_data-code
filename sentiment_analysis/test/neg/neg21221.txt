Unfortunately I couldn't get it to work outside of a wifi signal. The camera would connect for a few seconds and then disconnect. I decided to buy a different camera from a different manufacturer. Not a treat cam. This other camera works flawlessly. No problem with disconnections. It was proof that the Petzi camera had a poor signal. Decided to send the Petzi Camera back. I can't say that other's will have such issues. Mine may have been flawed. Don't know. The concept is neat. I do wish there were more sound-effects, a two-way speaker and anything else that would increase the quality of interaction between me and my pets. The "doorbell" sound gets old pretty quickly and the camera's inability to tilt, pan, and zoom leaves one looking at the same static image. Furthermore, while it's great that the dispenser hold several treats, it also spits out too many for my small pets. This review is completely authentic and is meant to help other's make informed decisions.
