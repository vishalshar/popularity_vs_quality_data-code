The phone is almost slippery, and there aren't many case options available.  The lack of a hardware "home" button on the front is difficult to get used to.  The camera is slow to respond.  There are horizontal lines on the screen.  Apparently, this is not a defect, but it can be distracting on light colored backgrounds.Fingerprint sensor responds well, when the phone doesn't slip out of your grasp.  Performance (aside from the camera) is great.
