So, I was very excited about the idea of the petcube, given the price I thought it'd be good enough, but...1) iPhone app is slow and sometimes could just crash, happened ~10 times in the first evening of having it2) Sometimes camera just freezes, even after I reconnect I see the old frozen picture, only rebooting the device helps3) Video quality - they claim "HD". They say "poor video comes from poor internet speed" - so I have 100mbps and I tried to play with the cube from home connected to the same wifi (yes, I even double-checked with speedtest.net to be sure that my internet is Ok) - but the video quality was not better than my Sony Ericsson K750 (yup, 10 years old phone), my cheap $30 webcam gives MUCH better video quality, and it gives 30fps while petcube sometimes gives ~2 fps.4) Ping time is really bad. I've compared with video-calls and the cube sometimes gives several seconds delay (usually ~2 seconds)5) Laser pointer is very slow, when I started to play with it from my phone at first laser almost wasn't moving or was moving in chaotic directions, after several minutes I've got that I have to move it really slow for it to work, otherwise it just can't catch up.6) Laser isn't smooth at all it looks like it catches several points and then just jerks from point to point7) Calibration is very weird. So I can start with the fact that given their construction - calibration in general isn't possible at all because laser and camera have different points of view. People solved that problem decades ago with one-way mirrors / beam splitters (cost way under $10). But even without beam splitters calibration for fixed cube position should be possible, nevertheless even among ~10 calibrations the best result was ~10 inches off. Fortunately that could be fixed with the firmware update.The main question is why smartphone twice as cheap as Petcube records video way better? Laser itself costs under 1$ and servo isn't that expensive - so why such poor results?I suggest to install the app and try some nearby shared public petcubes before you decide to buy it.
