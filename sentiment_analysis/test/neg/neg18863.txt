Want to love these, but just can't all due to the connection issues.  They fit great, stay put(have no idea how).  However, the Blutooth connectivity is awful!!!  I use them for the gym.  I can't have my phone in my front short pockets as it will just do nothing but cut out.  I have them paired w/ an iPhone 7+.  I either have to set the phone out on the ground next to me or if I happen to be wearing a hoodie, and it has the front pouch pocket I can keep my phone in there and it will play clear 90% of the time.  Very disappointed in the connectivity.  I mean that is whole purposed of having wireless blutooth headphones.  I have tried pairing and repairing and resetting them up numerous times, but still same result.  Very disappointing!
