I would not recommend this product to anyone. There seems to be some kind of issue with the relay that is used to switch the power on. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Also the button on the unit doesn't work sometimes even though you hear the relay snap on. Had three units and none worked correctly and continuously. Returned all three units for full refund.
