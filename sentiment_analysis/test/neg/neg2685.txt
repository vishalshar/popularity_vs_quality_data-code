Do not waste your money on this until you start to see consistently good reviews.  This is a great piece of hardware but the software and firmware are currently junk (on android).  It is good enough if you are simply looking for a backup to open a door, but if you are looking for convenience look somewhere else.  There are many issues that need addressing.  Mainly the auto unlock feature (the only reason I bought this).  It takes a good ten seconds before my door opens.  I could have my door opened with a key much quicker.
