I truly cannot believe any positive or more than a feedback of 1 for any August product.  I think that Microsoft got everyone used to people paying good money for a product that was not ready for the marketplace (Every Windows Product Ever).I purchased the smart lock and for the first week I too enjoyed the newness of it and had fun while totally ignoring that did not work more than 20% of the time.  If this was your only means of entry into your house then you would be locked out a lot.  I purchased the keypad a while later (that's what I had before with zero problems in 12 years).  It is literally throwing good money after bad.  It was wishful thinking on my end.  Common sense would say that given the types of problems that the lock had the keypad would only serve to escalate them and that's exactly what it did.  The 2 AAA batteries lasted less than a week.  The second time I put them in I tested them (both times they were strait out of a new pack). and they were both above 1.57 volts.  Again less than a week and it was dead.  Just read the other reviews for all of the problems.  THEY ARE REAL! In the 3 plus months that I owned this we had no less than 50 issues.Picture this scenario.  You buy a car and within the first week it stops in the middle of the interstate and you pull to the side of the road.  You pull out your smart phone to communicate with your new smart car and are told to download an update to continue.  After 30+ minutes you are allowed to start your car again.  The next day you are leaving for work and it won't start...  You get the picture.  NOBODY would put up with it if it were not tech related.  The fact that they have not pulled all of their products from the market should be criminal and if they were a car company you can bet they would have.  I truly feel as if I have been victimized by this company.
