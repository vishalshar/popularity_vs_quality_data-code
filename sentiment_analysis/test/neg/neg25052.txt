Biggest piece of junk, i have noting but issues with this machine You think its making coffee then when you go get the coffee theres nothing there, but you have a meassage on your phone that says "Error" and then some number. The fix they provide does not work and you cannot reset the machine. The lateset error i am getting is error 86, and I have been getting that for 3 days. And can not get past that error, so the machine does not work ive un plugged and pluged it back in but i get the same error or a different one on a message telling me to callibrate the machine. I an very dissapointrd in this machine as i've only had it 90 days, it cost over $200.00 and i have to pull out my old 30.00 coffee maker to make coffee this morning. As it is more reliable than this machine. I will be throwing this one away so if someone wants one, its in my garbage
