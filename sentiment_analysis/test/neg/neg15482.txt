What a piece of junk, and even borderlines on false advertising, it won't notice my dog leaving for about 15 minutes when he's already over a half a mile away. My Whistle zone, the zone where your dog is not track and the Whistle has no provisions to help you to locate your dog with in this zone, unfortunately the zone is as big as my entire neighborhood and it doesn't help me one bit. They must decrease their unmonitored zone they call the Whistle Zone and increase their response time for a, tracking your pet and b, alerting you to it. Once my dog was a mile away before Whistle notified me.
