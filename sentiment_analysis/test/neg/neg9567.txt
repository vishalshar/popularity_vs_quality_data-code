I was very pleased at how well the product stayed in place when mounted in the CD slot, however I have encountered endless difficulty getting it to hold my phone (Samsung Galaxy Nexus) reliably. It couldn't hold the bulky case, but that's not unreasonable, so I've been using it without the case. Still, over several weeks' worth of use the phone has started to slip out of the mount an intolerable number of times. Now the side pieces that click inward to adjust to the size of the phone immediately spring out every time I try to tighten them to hold my phone. A product like this should last longer than one month.
