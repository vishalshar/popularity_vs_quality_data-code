I wanted to try this new scent and it had a completely different texture than I was used to with this brand. Instead of being smooth and a consistent texture it has balls of white hard pieces in it. It was also very soft almost like a lotion instead of a balm. The other scents I have received were balm like and easy to apply. This one left white balls all over me and didn't work. The smell is nice though. I recommend this brand just not this scent.
