The 14 ounce bag (organic) was disappointing. I've been buying the individual 2.2 ounce bags locally and expected an equivalent product, but did not get it. The 14 ounce bag had apples cut much thinner than the ones in the 2.2 ounce bags, thus the bigger bag was full of tiny shards of thin apple pieces. They are useful for adding to oatmeal and such but they don't deliver the same satisfying crunch I was used to. Won't be back to Amazon for these and will keep my dollar local instead. Bummed!
