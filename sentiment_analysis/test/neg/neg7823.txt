Doesn't work well enough for me at the moment.I'm giving this a one star review mainly because I want Blossom to improve their product asap. Here are my issues:1. On a day where there was a lot of rain and my lawn was flooded, the smart schedule was still set to run. This is not cool.2. If I set the time to 3 minutes, I expect the thing to water for 3 minutes... not 5 or 6 or 7. There is no way run a fixed schedule on this -- keeps changing its mind every day.3. As a result, I am not using smart watering. I have to remember to set my sprinkler manually every time I want to water plants. Well at least I can sit on my couch and do it.In summary, I want a fixed schedule that turns off when there is some rain. I don't like "smart watering". Fixed watering is so much easier to implement too.
