I really wanted to like this product.  I am a huge fan of Fitbit and felt that this could be an addition to the collection but allow me to focus on my stress level.After receiving the product, it was very easy to set up and sync to my app on the phone.  After wearing it for a few days, I felt like it was not accurately measuring my breathing patterns/stress levels as it always had me as "rested".  After working multiple hours at the hospital, I am sure that I was not "rested" for the amount of time that it had me listed.This project was returned to the vendor and I received a refund.  Just wasn't for me.
