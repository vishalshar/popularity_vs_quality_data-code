Meh. Doesn't really focus that well. Had better luck with a clip on lens. Main issue is that it depends on sticking to your phone lens like a bugger - & sometimes falls off. If you're planning to take photos outside, expect to be digging around in the grass trying to find something about the size of a contact lens.
