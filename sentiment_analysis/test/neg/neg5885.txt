I was excited to try this product as I was trying to stop using aluminum based deodorants after hearing about the horrors of metal based deodorants. First off, the lid was broken when I got it in the mail. I noticed the first day I used it, it didn't hold up AT ALL because I had the worst BO! I have never had bad body odor from using Secret so I was very embarrassed to go to work smelling like a pig...The lemon scent smells great in the jar but it doesn't help at all with eliminating sweat or body odors! My arm pits have also turned extremely dark from using this and my skin feels like leather.. For the price I paid, its such a waste of money and I'm very disappointed..i would say to do your research and try out different aluminum free deodorants that include probiotics.. That way the smell beneath your arms when you sweat gets eliminated immediately.
