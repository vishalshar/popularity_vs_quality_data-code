This review is for BOTH the Gimbal guard AND the Landing gear.Pros: Lightweight. Matching color.Cons: Doesn't attach securely. Doesn't have enough strength to protect during a realistic fall or strike. May fall off during landing, causing drone to stumble, potentially tumble and require new props, or worse....The product needs to be substantially stiffer to protect the camera and gimbal from anything more than a scratch. It also needs to have a MUCH more secure method of attachment. It clips on with an interference fit, but the fit is very very poor, like it was made for a different size drone???I attempted to use this on Phantom 4 Pro ( all dimensions identical to Phantom 4 )
