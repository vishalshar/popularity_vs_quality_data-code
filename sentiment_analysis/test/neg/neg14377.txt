Do not buy this phone! I purchased this phone for my husband. I was mainly attracted by the screen size. My husband LOVED it. It wasn't long before the picture became distorted and had a cracked look to it. It was no longer usable. We returned it and were sent a replacement immediately. The second phone lasted a very short time and the picture was as bad as the first one we returned. My husband still loved everything about it, so we returned it and got a third replacement. This time we were not able to hook it up with our service provider, and spent countless hours working with them. He was still able to go online.  You guessed it! The picture became as bad as the first two phones we returned. We returned it for a refund and ordered another make and model. Still waiting to receive that one and hope it will be trouble free.I gave it one star, and that was for the ease we had dealing with Amazon.
