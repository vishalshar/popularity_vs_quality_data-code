Expensive and useless -- tried to fix a charger cable, glasses stem -- melts on your fingers, not on repaired object.  Takes an eternity to harden and then breaks right off, leaving your fingers filthy.I wrapped the opened packets tightly, and stored the entire order in the fridge as per directions; a couple of months later, both opened and unopened packet contents were hard as a rock.  Useless, useless.  And did I mention expensive useless?
