Way too much development money was spent on packaging and the colored plastic electronic components (all of which are very attractive), but too little money spent in actually developing something that will keep kids' attention long term and that they will learn from. It is impossible to even reverse the voltage because of how it is designed! There is no learning to be done by this kit - the electronic bits go together with magnets with no explanation of what each piece is or what it does. Then tape the various plain paper and cardboard pieces to the cardboard box, and you have a flimsy "game" that everyone ends up frustrated or disappointed with. Oh, but wait, there's more...  plenty of advertisements in the instructions of how to buy more sets and "improve" your projects. Going back, and we'll opt for something more challenging, better designed, and with more learning opportunities.
