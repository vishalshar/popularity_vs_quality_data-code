I wanted to like it. I really did. I bought this to replace an existing flood light, and get a cloud camera for night and day recordings (as a "bad guy" deterrent and to keep an eye on things). The light looks great. This thing is ascetically pleasing. I dig the design. The big problem (and why I am returning it) is the camera is abysmal at night, with the motion light on or off. They really need to fix this. If you fix this one thing, I will happily buy your product. Put some IR around that camera, set the light to not go off - something.  During the day, this works great. At night, it is the worst.
