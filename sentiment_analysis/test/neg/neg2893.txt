Since a lot of other people seemed to have really liked these.... maybe I just had a bad interaction.  The "molding" portion of this was ridiculous.  They completely lost their form and once that happened.... forget about it.  There is a reason they sell the moldable pieces by themselves.  Because you will need to buy more.  The sounds quality was beyond terrible, save yourself money and spend $20 pair of skullcandy earbuds.
