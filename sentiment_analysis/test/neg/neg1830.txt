I cant begin to say how unhappy I am.  Three months ago I paid $750 for three Canarys with a plan that provided me with 7 days of cloud video storage and 50 permanently saved video clips.  Since then, the Canaries have preformed fairly well with a number of know issues such as many false alarms due to lights switching on and off, pet movement, etc. The iPhone software has been buggy, to say the least, especially the most recent update, But now, the coup de grace.  A mere three months since my purchase Im advised that the company is providing us with great new Premium Plans for the recording and storage of video.  The net result to me is I either get 12 hours of video storage (which is a complete jokeif you don't get notice of an event alert within twelve hours for whatever reason the video is gone......poof) or I get to pay you another $120/year every year (on top of the $750 initial cost of the Canaries) to have a system that is of any real value.  This is nothing short of abusive.  Twelve hours, really? That is absolutely ridiculous and quite frankly smells of a company with insufficient capital to maintain the infrastructure necessary to provide for reasonable storage time.  What's next, the company goes belly up?  I have no captured video after twelve hours following a recorded event unless Ive decided to pay the equivalent of ˝ the cost of a new unit every year just for the privilege of being able to make any use of it. So, unless you are willing to essentially pay 50% of the cost of the unit each year after you buy it for $249 just so you have a device that is useable for it's proclaimed purpose, you might want to consider doing something else.I dont know that I have ever been so pissed about a new product I have acquired.  Here is an example of a competitor's plans:"All Arlo systems come with a free Basic subscription plan that includes 7 days of cloud recordings (up to 1 GB of cloud storage)".UPDATE:  The folks at Canary have now reduced the retention of videos to 6 hours unless you buy their $120/year "premium plan". So let's see, I'm away from home and my home gets burglarized at 1:00 am. I wake up that morning and check my phone at 7:01 am. POOF, all the video is gone. Yes, they say, but we sent you an email that motion was detected at 1:03 in the morning. Well, the email "ding" from my phone didn't wake me at 1:33 am and even if it had, I'm not sure I would have looked at my phone as I've become accustomed to many false alarms.
