Just got mine today! It took a sec to find a good mounting point on my bike. (Fz6r) its seems okay, holds my S6 edge. Also, it sits pretty deep within the tabs to secure the phone found that kind of annoying... Definitely NOT worth the price material wise IMO. However, I don't have much experience with phone mounts..
