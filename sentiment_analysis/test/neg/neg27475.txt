Really neat in concept but as you're holding it and it spins up it just naturally jerks your hand since it's getting resistance from the pins. Fitting it to the tuner head is also a jostle every time and eh...using it is just an awkward experience. The app is cool how you can profile devices and it trains the strings and all but honestly I find myself just flipping up a clipped on tuner every time now, it's way faster. I sometimes the Roadie as a spin up device when changing strings but for the price that functionality can be had way cheaper. I'd pass until they make this a less clumsy experience.
