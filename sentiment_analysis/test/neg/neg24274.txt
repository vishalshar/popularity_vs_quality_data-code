Don't waste your money on this one.  I have been flying RC for over 2 years and yesterday, I was flying indoors with my fellow RC friends.I tried to fly the Powerup 3.0 for several flights and with different folded airplanes designs.  But I could never get it to fly the length of the gym.This unit is severely underpowered.  When I tried to get it to turn, it would hit the floor.  I've tried to fly it outdoors and that was another disaster.
