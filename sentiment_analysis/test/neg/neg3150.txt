I don't usually write reviews but feel it is necessary in this case.  I bought 2 of these in Oct.  for Christmas gifts for my kids.  The reviews,at the time, were high and it sounded like it would be a fun time for my kids.  Unfortunately, This product has taught me a lesson...immediately try the product upon arrival.  On Christmas morning the kids got these in their stocking, neither worked.  I had to wait for a store to open so I could replace the batteries which were completely dead (a firmware path was pushed for the one that ended up working to minimize battery drain).  One finally started working with the new battery but the other never did.  Then there is the app...I was seriously disappointed.  How can there be so positive reviews...I read multiple reviews that adults thought it was great and wanted to keep them for themselves???  The app only plays a very short riff of a song, over and over again.  My 8 year old got tired of it in less than 2 minutes.  I tied it too and understand why,  it is not challenging, very repetitive, huge delay in stroke to actual sound made...just disappointing:(. Now I went to see if I can return them and it is outside the 30-day window...guess trying to get your Christmas shopping done early on Amazon is a very bad idea!
