I liked the silver band on ring.  I ordered the white "stone".  The "stone" on the ring is white white (I thought the picture with the description tried to make it look a little pearlized but it is not).  The "stone" looks like a piece of chewing gum.  The color notifications appear in the middle of the "stone" which was fine with me (with other smart ring makers the color notifications appear on the side).  The ring has a short range of maybe 30 feet so the out-of-range notification came on frequently but it did work each time.  The ring had a strong vibration when it was connected.  Which leads me to why I returned the ring.  The ring would unpair from my phone several times a day.  The description states it is dust and waterproof but whenever I washed my hands with the ring on, it would lose connectivity with my phone and I would have to pair it again.  I never used it so I can't speak of the functionality but the emergency call feature seems like a great feature that other smart rings do not have.  I did like the wireless charging box.
