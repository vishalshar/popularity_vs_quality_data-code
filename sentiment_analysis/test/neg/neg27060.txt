Customer Service on this Gramafon is the worst I have ever experienced.  They don't answer your questions directly if not superficially.  They expect that you know more than they do.  I have asked them specific questions to which they never answered and used their dialog for you to look up your answer.  In that dialog that they provided, I never found a question like mine to be answered.  As for the product.  Sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't.  More work than pleasure.
