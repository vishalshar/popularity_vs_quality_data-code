The idea of this seemed useful. Its really unnecessary. The fact that you have to have bluetooth turned on is a real drain on your battery and the app is pretty much beta they haven't really thought this product through. Its a hassle turning bluetooth on and off on your cellphone. This product would be better off as a key tracker.
