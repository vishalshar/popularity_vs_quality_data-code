This was dead out of the box.  I bought it for my dad for fathers day and didn't have a chance to install it on his grill for a month because of vacation and then it didn't work.  I went to return it and it was one day past the return day.  Bad experience all around.  Pretty simple device if it worked but this was DOA.  The screen lights up but no weights display.  Worthless!
