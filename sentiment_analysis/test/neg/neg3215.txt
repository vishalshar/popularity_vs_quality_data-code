Product is very solid and attractive, but would not work for me.  After many unsuccessful attempts over several days to program a fingerprint (used different fingers) I called cust. serv. Was told to use lotion or moisten finger.  That did work to program a print.  However, when attempting to open it 10 minutes later it failed.  Not much use to me as a self defense device. Returning for a refund.  Another annoying feature is the blue on light.  It is so bright that is makes it difficult to see the scanner light upon awakening with eyes unaccustomed to the night light intensity of that light.  I am very disappointed that it would not work in my case because we have 2 grandchildren that stay with us often and are getting to the curious age.
