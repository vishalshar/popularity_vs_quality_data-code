Like many others, I was interested to test out the immersive screen and sound experience. Unfortunately, the former was disappointing and did not live up to the hype. Sound quality was great but it's pretty pointless to have it without being able to enjoy watching the movie.The build quality was fine. I had some trouble adjusting the lens. The lens also fogged up regularly (likely due to incorrectly positioning).
