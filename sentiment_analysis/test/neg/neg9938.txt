Not gonna lie I was a little disappointed. The vanilla isn't strong enough and it's not as sweet as I expected it to be. I really just wish it had more vanilla flavor as I bought this for my "bulletproof" coffee. I think I'll just stick to grassfed butter. I can see it being useful in baking but I have yet to try that!
