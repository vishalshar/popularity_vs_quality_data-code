Ordered this game oct 7, didn't receive it until nov 4. Upon opening it I noticed it had a strong chemical smell, the box was smashed, there were no instructions, and the items inside weren't packaged in a way to make me thing they were new. I immediately contacted Watch yo Mouth to let them know and started the return process. If i was able to give no stars I would have. If you plan on ordering this make sure it is a legit game (qualifies for prime, etc) otherwise you'll get a knock off like I did.
