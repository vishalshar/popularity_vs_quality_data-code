I purchased this Great Call phone from Amazon.  Phone is appears easy to use unlike many of the Android phones from the other companies.I liked it.  I have never been able to use the phone more than making 2 trial phone numbers.It is important to mention that Great Call's customer service is abysmally poor.  The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.After 10 years with another well known Company, I decided to change companies because of my preference for Great Call phone.  I switched toGreat Call Customer Service because using Great Call phone was not permitted with the previous company.I purchased the phone from Amazon with the intention of inspecting it and when my phone contract came to an end I would then have myprevious number transferred over to Great Call.  This situation was explained to the 5 persons at Great Call Customer Service.Inspite of the aforementioned, I received 3 bills from Great Call's Customer Service with the threat of Collection Activity.  I had also been toldthat I was given a Port phone number which was definitely not the case.  There is a big difference between area code 561 and 954. Had I beenasked to use a phone number with area code 561 there is no question I would have refused to do so, as my contact with ATT had not come toan end.  I was also given a 30 day suspension notice by Great Call.  Despite an apparent well made product, the individuals in Customer Serviceare in need of extra brain cells.  DON'T USE THEM.with the
