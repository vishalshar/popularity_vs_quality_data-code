Welp, I've just ordered a Rachio Gen2. Like I said in my original review, I really really wanted to make this work. And not just because I'm out $200. Sunk costs; move on with life.It worked fine as far as I could tell last season. I set it up and mostly forgot about it. The lawn and stuff stayed green, and it didn't run when it was raining, so that was cool. This season, as I've been bringing up the system, I just can't reliably get the controller to start zones. Why not? I have no idea! The app doesn't tell me anything about why the zone isn't running. I've tested with a multitester and verified continuity and resistance. The bottom line is: Sometimes the zones go, sometimes they don't.I recognize the limitations of the controller technology -- it's only as good as the wiring and valves in the ground. But it really bugs me that I can't bypass the cloud and manually drive things. I would have more confidence that the problem is local if I had that capability. As I am a DIY irrigation operator for now; I've been willing to suffer with the vagaries of a Cloud-controlled device, but if I eventually decide to cede responsibility to a professional, this configuration won't work. The Rachio allows for local manual operation, and gets better reviews. Onward and upward (I hope!)...------------------ Original Review -------------------Blossom, I want us to communicate more. I feel like I don't really know what's going on with you. You look great, don't get me wrong. And you seem pretty smart, but I just can't seem to get past a superficial relationship with you. Maybe we're not meant to be together, I don't know.Please, open up to me. I know you can. We can make this work. I really want this to work.Joking aside, the installation and setup were brilliant. And then... Well. I think my lawn is being watered. If I get up early enough I can still see some evidence of moisture on the walkways and lawn. But is it dew, or water from the irrigation system? Not sure. Did the system decide not to water this morning because there's supposed to be a shower this afternoon? Don't know. When was the last time zone 2 watered the rhododendrons, and for how long? Don't know.Are you seeing a pattern? I know that there are rumors of an updated app, but even the company is fairly tight-lipped. No blog. No periodic emails to let us know what's going on or what to expect as far as new features and improvements. I'd expect this from a big multinational like Toro or Hunter or Rain Bird or whatever, but I thought you guys would be different.
