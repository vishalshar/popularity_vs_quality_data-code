This projector did not quite perform as expected. It is small and compact but just is not bright enough to be practical.  The software interface is clunky and is not all that seamless with Windows 7. After hibernate or sleep the interface has trouble reconnting with control function. When running Power Point the text size has limitations and projects text distortion. This is a function of distance away from projected surface, initial text size and brightness.  Over all this projector is not worth the money and complicated effort to use it. Thumbs down.
