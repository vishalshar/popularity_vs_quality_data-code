Although this model has a excellent finish and works well with both fingerprint and numbers, it has some drawback.  Need professional carpenter or handyman to install.  There is no knob to keep unlock when not needed.  The door handles keep coming off if pulled hard. The manufacturers are aware of it when contacted.
