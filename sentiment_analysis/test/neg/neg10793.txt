ruined my expensive dress!  I put on Primal Pit Paste in the morning.  A few hours later, I went to a dress shop for a fitting on a dress I planned to wear to my son's wedding.  I only had the dress on for about 15 min.  The Primal Pit Paste had left a white mark on the dress.  The very problematic thing is that it kept getting worse and worse.  The Primal Pit Paste was actually taking the color out of the delicate fabric,  like a bleach would.  The dress is totally ruined.  I wrote to Primal Pit Paste asking for compensation for my dress and they refused.  They offered to send me a verson without baking soda.  Which makes me think they realize that the baking soda can damage clothing.  This did not help me or in any way compensate me for damage done to my dress by their product.  I now use another brand of natural deoderant which works great and doesn't ruin my clothing...Deodorant Cream by Meow Meow Tweet...also available on Amazon.
