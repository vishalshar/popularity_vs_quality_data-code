I worked hard for weeks with my cat to get him to use this. I even sprinkled his urine over the top and left some in the tray. I left it by the litter box for days, I sprinkled his fav litter ontop. I placed it so he had to crawl over it to get to the litter box. I tried praise, training, treats and encouragement. I tried leaving him alone to figure it out. He will use it to lay on, he will use it as a launch box to climb onto the counter, but he wont pee on it. This would probably work better for a dog who can more easily be trained in bathroom manners. Dogs have owners they wish to please, Cats only wish for their owners to please them. This was a fail for me.
