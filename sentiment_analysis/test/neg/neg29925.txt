Got this for my daughter for christmas and it doesn't work. It appears to work at first but then a quater way through every strand of plastic it stops. I then have a very hard time getting the plastic strand out because the reverse feature doesn't work very well either. I am beyond disappointed in this product and I'm really upset that the main thing my child wanted and recieved doesn't work.  The picture shows just how far I can get into the strands before the pen stops working.
