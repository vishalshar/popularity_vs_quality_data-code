Upgraded to ver 2....and now I have more issues than ever. Won't get into it here, but I will get a hold of tech support. Major issue is that this device doesn't log all my trips for the day on my cell phone. I shows in the driving mode, but then no trips listed. Then after a day, I will see the trips on the phone and computer. Takes that long to register the events?  Really considering to send this back to Amazon within the 30 day window if I can't get this Automatic working correctly.
