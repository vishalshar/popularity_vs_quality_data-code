Great design. It's sleek and stylish. It fits on a key chain. Sadly, it is waste of money.The only time it ever worked was when I initially tested it. For the past several months, I've been thrilled with the purchase, just knowing I had this spiffy remote in my pocket. The problem is... it never gave me any benefit... and now that I've had some time to devote to trouble-shooting, it looks like it simply doesn't work.I read the "instructions." I watched the videos. I tried everything. It said it was paired but not connected to my iPhone. The documentation suggested "forgetting" this device and re-pairing. It will not pair again. To rule out my phone, I tried to pair it with my husband's iPhone. Nothing.Perhaps the battery was low? I invested in new batteries. I tested. Nothing.I did note, that the inside didn't even really look like the one in their video for changing the battery.I just tried to return it, but Amazon won't do returns after 30 days. So I'm out about $40 plus another $5 for batteries that were not the problem, anyway.I wish the folks at Studio Neat would make a remote shutter device. I bet theirs would work.This one is cute. But other than looks, it is a complete failure and waste of money.
