I read all the reviews, I really shouldn't have gotten this robot, but alas, I did.  That was first and not last mistake.  So worked through support with all the connection issues we've had, went through 4 different devices trying to get and stay connected, nothing would stay connected.  Once in a blue moon, maybe you got to play for 10-15 minutes, but that was very recent and in the end it wouldn't connect at all.  I got this for my 7 year old, he was so excited and talked about it for 2 months, so it was a big deal to him.  So this whole ordeal has been educational for him at least, I explained no matter what you hear or read, you have to do your homework about the toy.So we did the troubleshooting with support, they were OK, but definitely not technical, which unfortunately, I am.  I've done my scanning of the networks, it's on channel 1, which is awful, but still the signal was strong, I can see that, but will never keep the connection.  I know this isn't on my side, I have at least two devices that provide this same direct wifi connection, they never have issues and they pump just as much if not more data through.After support, we (support rep and myself) decided a replacement, I used Amazon (which is fantastic BTW) to return and replace.  I got my replacement, my wife started the process, she said everything was working fine, of course our first one had the same result, the initial use seem to work ok, but then it slowly got worse, makes no sense to me.  So I've spent another good 3-4 hours, watching the signal, channel, power level, etc, it's all there, but never can stay connected (if I ever get connected).  SO DISAPPOINTED!  This is my 2nd device, there has to be something really wrong with the method they create their connections, I really don't understand why so many issues.  Mind you, it's not just me, so many others have these same type of connection issues.So I gave my wife & Son a deadline of another day or so and then we are finally returning this for a full refund.  NO more Anki toys/robots for this household.  I'm sorry mostly for my Son, it was such a huge dream to have this robot and he worked hard to earn it, which was the worse part of this failure.I'm really trying to keep this from being emotional, but seriously, I've spent no less than 10 hours trying to troubleshoot these issues and I'm not new to any of this tech and the worse part, I have to be the mean Daddy and send it back.  Otherwise it's just a $200 toy that just sits there and does nothing.  (sigh)I hope this helped someone in their decision.  Maybe Anki will get their act together and have some sort of firmware/software update to fix these connection issues.
