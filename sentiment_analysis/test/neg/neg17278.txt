The Pebblebee Finder has absolutely no range. I am only 10 feet from it, and I am out of range. So much for 150 feet range. Or was it 200? Also, the phone finder worked once--phone and pebblebee right next to each other. And never again. The software definitely needs work. This item should not even be on the market yet. It has the potential to be a good product, but needs a HECK of a lot more work.Most people are not going to walk around with their bluetooth on, draining their battery.  So if someone lost their keys, they would have to turn location and bluetooth on, then hit the refeshkey on their pebblebee app,  and walk around the house HOPING they are within the 10 foot range to sound the keyfinder.
