Once I received the lock, I opened it quickly and installed it only to find out it was a dud -_-Two days later I had a free replacement from amazon.Overall pleased with the lock but it's still not the ideal "smart" lock. While it does auto unlock as you approach, that's only when you're returning home. If you step out to walk the dog, you'll come back to a locked door leaving you to pull your phone out, open the app, wait for it to find and connect to the lock, and initiate the unlock. Some more features and options around auto unlock would be nice.The lock is also surprisingly big. On the August site they make it appear very elegant. While it does look good, it is still large.Setup was ok but I struggled to keep the deadbolt straight so it would slide in and out easily. I ended up having to loosen it quite a bit to get it to work properly.The app looks nice but has some menus that are not so intuitive to locate. I spent some time just swiping in the app and came across new things.Overall an auto lock that works less than every time has lost my trust. Coming home to a lock that never locked behind you is terrifying thinking about leaving my home unprotected. Please fix this asap.I'm looking forward to what future software updates bring and hoping for ifttt.com integration.
