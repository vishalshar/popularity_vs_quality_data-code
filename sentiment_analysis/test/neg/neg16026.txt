This product is very hard and uneasy to make it function. I downloaded the app three times and spend more than two hours trying to make it work without any success. The product never connected to my Wifi nor the app found the device. I went and got the Belkin WeMo switch and it only took me 5 minutes to install and make it function. I really like my WeMo device it was very user friendly and the phone app worked right away. Difference in price between WeMo and D-Link is about $10.00 difference but the convenience of having the product working right away and the easiness of installing makes it worth purchasing the Belkin WeMo.
