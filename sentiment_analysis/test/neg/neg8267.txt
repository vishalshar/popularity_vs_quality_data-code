The product is very portable and the actual projection is great but the external output sound (when I plug in some pretty excellent speakers) is highlyyyyy diminished from those external speakers themselves. Picture having a movie ready to go but only being able to hear it an inch away from the inserted speakers. Can't figure out why?I also add files to a microsd card and the device does not even detect it. Can someone recommend an sd card that will for sure work? (I wonder if it's because I transfered the .MOV and .MP4 files onto it via a mac. So I need a non mac computer to transfer the files to an sd card?
