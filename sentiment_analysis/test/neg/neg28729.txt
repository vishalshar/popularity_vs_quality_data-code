The frame of the maze is really cheap crafting wood and was broken when it arrived.  My son tried to make it work with the app, but the maze kept shifting on the screen.  The wood frame is being glued now, if that doesn't fix the issue it's going back.  I will update the review later.  Overall, disappointed in quality.
