I bought this lunchbox mainly because it has a thermos built inside. After trying it for 3 days straight, I have to say that I'm disappointed. I heat up my child's food really hot in the morning, seal it tight, and after 2 and half to 3 hours the food gets cold or less than warm. It's not even about the money, it's the fact that it doesn't work well. I would rather use a regular Thermos to keep his food warm. I love the idea of this lunchbox but this product needs to be improved!
