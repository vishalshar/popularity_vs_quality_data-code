I am totally disappointed with this product. First it would not connect to my router, and I have a powerful system. I had it installed by a contractor. First it connected, then it wouldn't stay charged and disconnected from the Wi-Fi. Their tech help said that it wouldn't connect to my system because it was a digital doorbell system....I totally do not understand. I LOVE the August door lock but am very dissatisfied with this. I am returning it to Amazon. A waste of money and time.
