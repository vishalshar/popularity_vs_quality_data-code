I got it work from 4 feet away. Tuned on/off the power on my TV and my Verizon Fiber box. Kind of expected more than that? This battery operated device is made of plastic and only works with Echo on Androids. It would not set up with my Echo and IPhone and it was "Alexia" that told me it was not compatible with my iPhone. With no directions, this device will leave you frustrated. For the 99.00 price tag it will leave you feeling Ripped-Off!It is truly amazing what I can do with my Echo and was attracted to this device because of the compatibility with Echo. Buyer beware as "Compatibility" (only with Androids and Echo) is not specifically defined here.....They said that they are working on making it compatible (IPhone and Echo) but not available now, and for 99.00 I did not want to wait. They should have stated it was only compatible with Android from the start and that it does not come with any directions! Makes you feel like you've been scammed....
