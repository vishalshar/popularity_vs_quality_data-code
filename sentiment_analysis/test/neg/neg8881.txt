To start with I have a doorbell on the side and purchased the wedge adapter, so it is not facing directly ahead.  It appeared from reviews that this would not be a problem.  When I got this I was expecting a device that would immediately alert me when someone approached my door and allow me to quickly connect to the device to talk to them.  I have been VERY disappointed with both of these expectations.1.  There is a VERY long delay in video capture both when someone presses the button and when motion detected.  Out of over 50 alerts I have seen the backs of 3 people, the face of 2 and more that 45 captures of nothing but my current camera view.2.  There is an EXTREMELY long delay in connecting to the camera through the app.  I have yet to be able to chat with someone through the app as the connection time is slow in my home (no problems with any other device connections) and even slower when away on a 4G phone.Something definitely needs to be done about the terrible video capture delay and the slow connection to the device.  I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a doorbell camera.
