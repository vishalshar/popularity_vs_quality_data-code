If  you can't hear it sound off, it is worthless.  My three XY3  key finders arrived with very faint sounds. I bought new batteries thinking that would fix the problem.  The new batteries made  only a slight improvement.  If you are standing right beside your keys and they are out in the open, then you will probably find your keys. I wasted my money on this product.
