Ok: this is definitely my last review of this darned thing.After only a few months of use the bracket that holds the battery broke. Let me say this again: the bracket that is meant to hold the battery of the electronic device that's meant to help me locate my pet in an emergency broke. In other words, this device can't and won't provide peace of mind. I don't think this is material fatigue but a fundamental design flaw! If the break happens when your pet is out and about or in danger the device suddenly becomes a worthless piece of plastic hanging around their neck. It's better not to have it. (See picture)This is a brief update on my experience with Pod Tracker. I first used Pod Tracker earlier this year and for my cat and his hiding places it was less than ideal. PodTracker as a company made every effort to help me out. Today I received the update of their latest Beta Software. It makes me feel proud that I gave as much feedback as I did to them (I'm sure they might use other words than "proud" when reminiscing on the long email exchanges I put them through) and now to see the outcome and the beautiful new software they've delivered. Seeing this much progress in such a short time puts this company above and beyond their competition. Where before I had some reservations about recommending them I now give them a whole-hearted thumbs up!
