First one never linked with my Verizon Router. Tech support was unable to get it to work either.I ordered a replacement and it had the same result.THIS ITEM IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME.Sooooo disappointed with D-Link. They should remove their name and put as much distance as possible between them and this thing.
