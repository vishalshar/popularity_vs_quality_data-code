I've been living with two "smart" locks for over 6 months and I am now considering removing them.These devices do not work consistently.I loved the idea of them and so purchased two of these locks when I moved home. Plus a connect.Pro's1. Simple to setup2. Auto Lock works a treat.Cons.1. Connecting to them via bluetooth at the moment only seems to work 50% of the time.2. The Connect add on only allow control of one lock ( which is rubbish )3. The iOS app also only seems to see the locks 50% of the time.4. When the batteries run down the locking mechanism becomes weaker.5. We've had to replace 4 AA batteries 3 times in 6 months.6. 3rd party integration is inconsistent.7. Firmware and software updates don't seem to fix anything and cant be scheduled and are sssslllllooooowwwwwwwww.Overall owning these locks has been a frustrating experience. When they work they work well. When they don't they leave you high and dry. Especially if you forget a key to get in. If august can release firmware updates that fix the connectivity issues/reliability then these locks would be 5 star. At the moment though I can't recommend them.
