I researched these sheetsbefore purchasing them, but am sorry to say that I am not completely satisfied with them.  It's a great concept, but fails with the zippered part being too baggy.  If it were tighter, it would be too hard to zip, but it just looks sloppy in the crib.  They are a good material and nice and thick.
