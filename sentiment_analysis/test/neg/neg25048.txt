Good idea, bad app.  makes great coffee, but the remote application is archaic: 7 clicks to turn the machine on from bed!  Don't bother purchasing the wi-fi version until they modernize the app (had been promised for Feb/April and now it's May).  It asks  "did you remember to add water?"  Seriously!  If the app was intuitive and allowed one-click programming, I'd give it 5 stars but I am so disappointed by paying $100 extra and still have to go downstairs at 4 am to turn it on.
