I got this lovely clock due to its design and promise of loading my phone as well as playing my alarm directly from the phone. However come to find out, it does not pair well with the new iOS10 on my Apple phone. So at first the Bluetooth did not recognize the device. On my second attempt I linked it with a USB cable, and it recognized the device on the app. However 3 hours later, when I opened the app to set my alarm, the app could not identify my the Beddi device. I reinstalled the app 3 times, again connected my phone directly via USB cable to the back of the clock -- and still no luck, when I opened the app, the Beddi device still did not show up so as to be able to set the alarm. Very sad and have to return it.
