I had high hopes for this, despite some of the negative reviews. Right from the beginning it was just too floppy for my iPhone 6 on the roads I drive during my 90 minute  commute. Even when it fit snuggly it still bounced. Another huge problem with it is, that since it's not firm, any time I tried to use the touch screen it would spring backwards. This meant having to grab the back of the phone with my fingers and do my touching with my thumb; not very safe.But then the thing popped out completely, fell on the floor and lost one of it's adjusting screws. Rather than combing the floor of my car I decided to retire the device. Great idea. Needs work.
