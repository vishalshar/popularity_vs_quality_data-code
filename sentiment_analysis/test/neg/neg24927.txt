Read through the product description and details,  watched the video.  Placed my order.  Received the item.  Looked the package all over.  No where,  no where,  did it say the one I purchased would only work on grade 2 hardware.  Nothing I work on is grade 2.  Do you know where I finally figured out after the fact that it only works on grade 2, the pictures.  I'm not in preschool.  I learn from reading,  not looking at pictures.  You should really include this important information in the product description.  I called customer service Thursday morning,  was told I would receive a call back later that day.  Well here's Monday and no call back.  What a waste of $40.
