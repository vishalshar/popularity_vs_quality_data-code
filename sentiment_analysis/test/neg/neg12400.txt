UPDATE 4/2/15I originally gave this product a 5 star review.  Here's the reason why I changed my mind to a 2 star review.  I'm convinced that the problems I am having is not due to an installation error.  I received my first screen and the installation, though taking some time, was pretty simple.  About 2 weeks after I've had the screen on I noticed that the display was not going black when I held my phone to my ear during calls without applying an unreasonable amount of pressure to the sensor.  This led to the very annoying accidental mute press on absolutely every call.  I thought maybe this was a installation error so I decided to take the screen back off and try to reseat it back into place.  when taking the screen back off I noticed that the bottom bezel was separating itself from the glass.  I contacted customer support stating that I believe this was the issue and that it was allowing more light in which was faking the sensor.  They sent me a new screen which I received and installed yesterday 4/1/15.  After going through all of the Home Button, Digitizer, Camera, Microphone, and Sensor tests, everything was working perfectly and I was very pleased.  During my very first call of the day this morning, the sensor did not react to the phone being held against my ear once again.  I have attached a photo of the original screen I ordered from Amazon.this is a great product!  Replacing the screen is not a simple 5 minute task.  iCracked has great instructional videos on YouTube, but the kit does come with all of the tools and a pretty comprehensive set of paper instructions.
