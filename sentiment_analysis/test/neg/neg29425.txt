Pretty fun. Alot of stuff to get out every time though. Because of that we've used it only twice since christmas. Also not compatible with older devices like oh say hand me down tablets you've given to the kids. So not only plan on buying them this, but also a new device unless you like giving up your phone and getting it back with the battery dead, just in time for an important call.
