I was very excited about these glasses. I'm an avid rider and was looking forward to have all the data the glasses provide without having to constantly look down to watch my computer. I unpacked the glasses and went to the web-site to update the firm ware, add my information and so forth. The system froze on me multiple times having to restart the glasses every time. I was able to sync my cadence, and speed sensor however my heart-rate sensor didn't sync. I decided to still give it a go while I went on a ride, I ended up having to taking off the glasses. The screen was blurry even though I adjusted the glasses to be able to wear it comfortably and see the H.U.D. While it did track the activities I had to really focus on the HUD taking my eyes of the road for a long time.  I think this product has made great progress in the the wearable technology sector however its too early to buy to be able to enjoy the product fully. I would recommend to wait a bit more until they improve a bit more.
