Frame is put together well, but that is where the quality ended.  The engine is terrible.  The packaging of the oil container left oil leaking everywhere after shipping, and once you put oil into the engine and get it running, it has issues staying running for long enough to break it in.  Once you do get to that point, check for oil leaks as soon as you attempt to ride it.  The one I got leaked oil terribly bad, started smoking from hot oil slinging from tire onto exhaust, and left oil on our driveway.  I didn't have it for a couple hours and I'm sending it back for another product.  Sad because this has such good promise for convenience.
