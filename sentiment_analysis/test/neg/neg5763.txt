The charger works amazingly. It has a small form factor and holds enough to get an iPhone 6 to around 40% from dead. The ability to charge the device while charging your phone is killer.The only issue is that ours broke after two months. We have not heard back from the company that makes it for our warranty and the charger is out of stock at Amazon. So I guess I have to give it a one star review.
