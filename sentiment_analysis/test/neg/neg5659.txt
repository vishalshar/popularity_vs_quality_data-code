Received 2 bulbs today - Dec 31 - hoping to use for a New Years Eve Party - BOTH bulbs DEAD ON ARRIVAL - not detected via BLUETOOTH, NOT ABLE TO RESET MANUALLY, NOTHING...called support - I need to fill out RMA for them to send me a label to ship bulbs back, then they will resend me replacements... AMAZON - This is not what I am used to from you...
