However I hope there could be a 0 star as a choice. This stuff never successful works! I tried and successful linked it with my iPhone, got the software updated, but still it cannot play the music on my iPhone, nor can it be used to make phone calls via skype.All in all, this thing is just a expensive toy, which can play music only stored in the earbud itself, and can somehow track your heart rate. That's all!
