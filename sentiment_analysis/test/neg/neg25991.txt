I would consider myself a tech enthusiast and an early adopter of technology; so this review is written from an early adopter's point of view with the 2.1 update installed. I will break down the review in several parts to deal with all the features of the headset. Here is the TLDR version: Bragi Dash over-promises and under-delivers at a relatively high price point.The first impressions and aesthetics: The headset is beautifully packaged in a booklet style box highlighting all the features on each flap. Once you unpack and remove the packaging material you have to connect the headset case to a power source to activate the headsets. The case provided has magnetic connectors that connect to each headset. The magnetic connection is nice and secure. Once connected to the case, the dash headset will pulsate a light in various colors to indicate the power level. Blue means full, green means high, yellow means medium and red means low. The case itself has an LED as well to indicate power levels. On the case the green means high to medium and the red means low. There is also an aluminum cover for the case with a slit on the bottom to show LED pulse on the headset. Other accessories include different size fit sleeves and a 6-8 inch micro USB cable, along with the warranty information. The headsets are aesthetically pleasing and snugly fit in the ear with the correct sleeve.Bluetooth range: Something that I was worried about before getting this was the Bluetooth range that I have seen many people complain about. I can personally live with the small range that the headset provides, though I would still describe it as very poor. The right side earbud has the Bluetooth radio so I can place my phone in the right pocket of my pants and still get an uninterrupted audio most of the time; though, not without occasional interruptions.  However, if I put it in the left pocket the quality deteriorates immediately and forget about walking away from the phone more than a few feet. In comparison, my Plantronics Voyager Edge headset stays connected for several feet (I would estimate about 25 feet indoors). I must also mention I haven't tried running or any other activity with the headset yet other than listening to podcasts while I stand still.Voice quality: The voice quality on the Bragi Dash is as good as you would expect on a decent headset. Audio quality is clear during the phone calls. The bass and treble have a decent profile when listening to music. I am not an audiophile so I can't say if I am missing out on anything when compared to other, similarly priced headsets.Other features/ sensors: This is perhaps what brings this headset to it's current price point. The headset offers several features other than audio, such as sensing head motion, audio transparency, touch sensors on the individual earbuds, and being water proof. You can shake either earbud to show battery status. Shake your head in yes/no motion to accept or reject phone calls. Tap and slide on the earbuds to control activities such as running, swimming and cycling. I haven't tried the activities yet other than activating them a few times by accident.The audio transparency feature lets you hear your surrounding with amplification. It works great if you aren't really listening to anything. If you are listening to something there is enough noise in your ear already for you to notice and make sense of external sounds. Don't even think about running heavy machinery like a vacuum cleaner or microwave with audio transparency on though, it makes a really loud, amplified clanking / grinding noise and feels like the headset is about to explode. It's actually painful to listen to it. I have also used them in the shower as they are waterproof.Prepping the headset/ Update Process: The headset I got was running on an older firmware and the 2.1 firmware supposedly fixes Bluetooth connectivity issues, though I didn't notice a significant difference in Bluetooth performance from before and after the update. The update process is simple enough. I found their updater program to be useless though. It couldn't update my headset. I used the manual method of copying and pasting the files in the headset's internal memory and letting it update automatically once it's disconnected from the computer. The instructions are on their website in text/ video format and easy to follow.The disappointments: At a price point of $300 this headset lacks a very basic feature of multi-point Bluetooth technology. This allows headsets to connect to two phones at the same time and calls can be taken from either phone and music can be played from one at a time. I use two phones on a daily basis, one for work and one for personal use. With my older headset (Voyager Edge), I could seamlessly switch between the two phones; with this headset, I have to manually disconnect from one phone and connect to the other before making phone calls. This process is not always smooth and adds extra stress in my life.Then another failure happened a couple of weeks ago. For some mysterious reason, my audio stopped going through when making phone calls. I can hear the other side but they can't hear me. At first I thought it could be the mic, so I recorded a voice-clip on my phone. It records voice-clips without a hitch. Next thing I did was  delete the device from both phones and paired it again - still no audio. Sent Bragi an email and they replied two days later with instructions on resetting the headset using a different method for updating the firmware. I was already running the latest firmware but decided to follow them anyways. Did as they say but that didn't fix it. And that's where I currently am waiting for Bragi's response (to be fair, I just sent them my reply a few hours ago). I don't know if there are two mics and one of them failed but it has become a really expensive listening only headset.If I had these problems with a headset at a lower price point, I would have been less frustrated. At $300 this is a luxury-priced item with a mediocre experience so far. The Bluetooth connectivity issues, lack of multi-point support and mic failure are three strikes against this super gadget. I wanted to like this headset and I still do. I will follow up with an update if the mic problem is solved. If you are an early adapter and an enthusiast, this might be worth it for you. Not really great for an average user, given how many caveats there are.
