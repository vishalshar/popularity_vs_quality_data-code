I wanted to like this. I really did.  The premise is great, but man is the execution lacking.  Constant bluetooth drops (although its been better since firmware upgrades) - and it still sounds super digital.  I was hoping that maybe in this day of technology, we would be closer to tube then ever, but it isnt.  Great idea, and great look to it. Built solid, but it just doesnt sound great.
