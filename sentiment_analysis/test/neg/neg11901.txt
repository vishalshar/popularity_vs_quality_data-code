I purchased this vitamin powder because I had horrible morning sickness during the first trimester and thought a drink would go down easier. The product smells nice but I could not handle the taste and texture . Too gritty and difficult to take when nauseas. It may work for someone without morning sickness but it wold be great if they would could single servings to try before buying a box.
