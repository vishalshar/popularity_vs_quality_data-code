Bought it as a secret Santa gift. Arrived with a dead battery, which after some Googling, I found is a problem with some of their units. Followed the company's support instructions to request a new battery be sent. When your job is to make an electronic device where the battery is a vital element and not a common household size, it would seem imperative that the item ship with a working battery. Who knows if it is fun to use? All I know is that it was about as anticlimactic a moment as possible once we all discovered the battery was dead on arrival.
