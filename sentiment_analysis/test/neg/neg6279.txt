Very very disappointed in the performance of this product altogether. It never stands on its own like the advertisement claims. It also does not stay in place once you place it on your body. It holds far less than your average size book bag or backpack. it's fabric & style is the best thing about this bag. Now I know and understand why the investors of the show "Shark Tank" wouldn't invest in this product.
