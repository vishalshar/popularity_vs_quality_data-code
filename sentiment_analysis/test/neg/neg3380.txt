I still use this product but grudgingly so and only as a backup for my security system. We bought several of these units and all failed to install using my iPhone. It was really a nightmare. We would get to the pin code and the add would fail each and every time. After numerous calls to tech support the desperate agent asked if I could borrow a android phone and try to use it to install. WHAT? I did use an iPad to install them all successfully. Even if the install had gone 'by the book' it is a cumbersome and slow process. After installation the devices would routinely and constantly disconnect from my Wifi. Tech support tried every excuse (or rational) to explain this and none were the issue. I finally accidentally discovered how to stop them from disconnecting. My Wifi network changes channel when it detects interference on any particular channel. This is normal but this product can not handle that. I had to configure my network to stop changing channels and now the devices stay connected. The app is slow and often seems unreachable. The time from event to notification is slow often. Rules created can not be deleted easily.
