I have two of the Whistle units for my two dogs. I purchased the units in February of 2016. It is now late July of 2016, so I have had a bit of time to evaluate these collars; it has been a decidedly mixed bag. Neither collar is phenomenally accurate, though they can get me to within about 1/4 - 1/2 mile of the dogs, when they work. When they work is the real rub. One collar has approximately the battery life advertised and one is a piece of garbage that burns through the batter every 1.5 - 2 days, never gives accurate battery indications, and as such might be worse than useless. I have been through at least a half dozen support calls which have always been pleasant and have resulted in their "resetting" something on their end. Finally last week, after 30 minutes on hold, I explained that I was tired of all the false readings, bad battery issues, and general frustration. I wanted them to replace the unit (something they started bringing up after about my 4th support call - they acted like this was some sort of nuclear option). They agreed and told me a new unit would be sent right out. I still have not received notice the new unit was shipped. None of this would torque me too much if I hadn't had to leave a friend's cookout when I got notice from my (very good) home automation system that a sliding door had been opened. Upon checking household cameras, I noted the dogs had pushed open the door and taken off. No word from the Whistles; one was docked on the charging station (no problem there) and the problematic collar was dead again after a day and a half. If Whistle had sent out the collar the next day, I would have it by now and feel like they were at least responsive. Instead, I am angry, and have no intention of paying annual fees while I look for more reliable alternatives.
