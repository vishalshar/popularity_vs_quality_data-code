I bought this based on the claimed lifetime guarantee and alleged bullet proof build quality.  I had hoped this was the last mirco-usb cable I would ever need to buy.  However, like the other reviewer, mine was loose and stopped working consistently within days (intermittent charging).  I contacted their customer service directly and after much documentation of the problem (video, pictures, order number, etc.) they agreed to send a replacement cord (which I haven't received yet)....Admittedly it was a hassle.  More concerning was the "1 year warranty" offered through the company and posted on the website.  The cord itself seems plenty durable but the connection left a lot to be desired.I wouldn't call this the "worst charger ever" but I will say the one that came with my phone has been alot more reliable.
