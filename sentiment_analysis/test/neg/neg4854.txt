I wanted to find out that I was tense before I knew it. The few times spire buzzed me for being tense were false alarms -- I was bending over and putting pressure on it so it didn't think I was breathing. The few times I was very tense, I knew it before spire did and started to deep breathe, so it registered me as calm! The one good thing I learned from it is that talking to people makes me calm. This is consistent with the research on social relationships preventing stress, but I never thought that research applied to me because I'm an introvert. But now that I see that I do get calm having conversations, I am putting more effort into that. However, I did have one tense conversation and it still showed me as calm, so am not even sure about that. I didn't have any of the problems other people mentioned, except it did drain my phone battery.
