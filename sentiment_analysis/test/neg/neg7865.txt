I thought I would like it , it had the old jitterbug that worked fine, now this one has a poor signal, even after charging it 24 hrs, still poor signal i took it out side and gav e me a good signal only for a few seconds, then back to pooor, could not get it to change, called tech, they saidi still could use it, but words cut out, I sent it back, will look for another brand now,
