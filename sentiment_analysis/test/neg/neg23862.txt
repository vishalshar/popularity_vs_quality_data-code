There are a couple major things wrong with this. First and foremost, the apps are awful. There are three Wahoo apps you can use for non-biking exercise, and they're barely integrated despite all being Wahoo apps. For example, if you record a run in one app, the other app will pick up the basic info from the monitor (the phone-free workout feature), but it has no idea what you did and doesn't show the map, meaning the two apps aren't communicating at all.There's confusion between Fitness and Runfit because they overlap, but both are mediocre. The heart-rate test in Fitness (a 12-minute run to set your "burn" and "burst" HR) didn't work at all for me despite doing it several times. It failed to record. The similar test in Runfit did work, though I had to keep opening the app to get it to move on to the next phase (slow, medium, fast). It also said I had a max HR of 201 (I'm middle-aged, btw) and I definitely didn't feel like it was that high. I set the double-tap to skip to the next track, and that feature worked during my first activity but never again after that. Also didn't vibrate.Since the apps are so bad and the added features don't really work, the TickrX isn't worth the extra money. I'm returning it for something else.All that being said, the monitor connected to everything I tried -- Endomondo, MapMyFitness, Runkeeper, Runtastic, and a Garmin Vivofit 2 -- instantly and without a hitch. Never dropped the connection as far as I could tell.Also, this is my first strap HRM, though I don't think that had anything to do with the problems I experienced.**UPDATE**So it's been a few days since I wrote this review, and I figured I might as well give it another shot just to be sure it's not a fluke.It's not a fluke.I came home from work feeling energetic and decided I would go for a short run. After writing my first review, I uninstalled the Wahoo apps and reinstall them just in case there was a glitch. Unfortunately it's the same story. Fitness would not save my burn and burst heart rate. Runfit kept having trouble re-connecting to the heart rate monitor, which was actually a new development, because it didn't have that problem initially. I spent about 10 minutes sitting outside my apartment fiddling with the app trying to get it to connect, then maintain the connection while I started the heart rate test. Again, no problem connecting to other apps, just Wahoo's own.I was actually going to return this and order the mid level heart rate monitor, since most of the features I had problems with are only in the high-end model. However, after completely taking the wind out of my sails, I have no desire to give them any of my money. I'm going to return this and look for a different brand.
