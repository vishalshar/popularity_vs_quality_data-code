I heard great things about this product and did my own research; however, I don't know what this product has that I haven't given my Shih Poo before because it made my dog sick! My dog stool immediately turned very sticky and later turned into diarrhea. So, I made him chicken and rice for a week until his Blue Buffalo Wilderness arrived, now his stool is normal again.
