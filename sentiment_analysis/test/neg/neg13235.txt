*Meh* I have had it a few months now. Near as I can tell it is a Bluetooth clock radio. Your phone has all the smarts. I bought it because I like the from factor, the built in charging and at the only things on the front are the big bright clock numbers. It has two charging ports meaning two places to plug in cords that will dangle and tangle. There are a lot of technical misses: No automatic DST adjustments, finicky buttons. Most of the "features" are your phone. Traffic, weather, news, yadda, are on your phone, it has nothing at all to do with the BEDDI device. The only difference is you have to go to the cluttered BEDDI app to see them. It is an expensive clock radio with a Bluetooth speaker. Period. I have three echos and my house is automated with smartthings switches and plugs all over the house. This has no home automation features on this what so ever. It does the basics, so I didn't send it back. I put this under the heading of "I buy crap, so you don't have too."
