The taste is fine, but when it says to knead and squeeze... well I don't think it's humanly possible to knead and squeeze enough to make everything one creamy consistency.  Luckily I bought mine to blend in smoothies so it's not too troublesome this go around.  Will probably try buying a jar next time and see if that helps.
