The product was great until 2 months later when the wifi stopped working. I tried contacting LIFX support, I exchanged emails with them a couple of times and they gave me instructions on how to reset the bulb, but when the interventions they sent me didn't work, I was left hanging in the air. I emailed them a couple of time still with no more reply. Very Disappointing. Safe yourself the headache and don't buy this item. Now I'm stuck with a bulb that is only good as a regular bulb that cost my $60.
