I have been using this brand of dog food for a couple of years or more. I got it here on amazon the last time because it was a little cheaper, and I had no problem. When time to buy again, of course, I get it from Amazon. When I opened the bag it smelled weird. I was so disappointed.  I think it was old or spoiled, I don't know. I gave it to my little boy, he ate it, but I had to purchase another bag from the other company I originally got it from, I could not get past the smell.  Also my little boy's bowels got pudding like and I don't know if it was from this smelly dog food or not.  He's fine now after changing his dog food. This food is not cheap and I had to throw away a whole bag of dog food and that is not good. Will not buy this from Amazon again!
