i work a lot with papers and i was hoping that the slice 10548 can replace my xacto blades....but this blade failed miserably.I like the way this cutter feels in the hand when we try to use it. and the textured handle feels good. and i like that this cutter comes with a capI've used ceramic cutters before and this blade is nowhere close to being sharp. the tip if the blade is intentionally blunt to avoid accidental injuries, but that is a BIG no-no for a cutter.this cutter does not help with the intricate cuts. you can use it for straight cuts and for opening boxes... but for the price, i would've expected more.a pocket clip would've helped, and they could've atleast provided this with a hollow bottom to store spare blades.
