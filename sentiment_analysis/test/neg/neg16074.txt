The bulb works well enough. The range of light options is a plus, but the minimum light level is not low enough to use as an alarm clock (the lowest setting is still quite bright). The major problem: the bulb only works when very close to your wifi router. Even with a clear, unobstructed path, the light could not function more than a few feet from the router. I sent it back.
