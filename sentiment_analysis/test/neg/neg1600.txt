This worked the first time, love it!  Learned to use the pizza peel and oil it first.  The oven will also keep warm, whatever you need to warm, while cooling off.  I put the pizza, on the pizza peel with oil and a little corn meal.  Only took five minutes, AFTER the oven reached the zone.  Take the time to let the oven get to the flare mark first and you are good to go!
