I was a naysayer of other reviews; I had a large version I used on popcorn and loved it. It sticks to the popcorn and tastes great. I thought I would get this sample pack to see if I like other flavors. Everyone complains it doesn't stick, but I just rolled my eyes. Shame on me! For whatever mysterious reason, this sample pack does NOT stick to popcorn. I don't get it, because the store large ones work fine. Since this is sold from Kernel Season's, I don't think it's a knock off. If it would stick, there's some good flavors I like in there.
