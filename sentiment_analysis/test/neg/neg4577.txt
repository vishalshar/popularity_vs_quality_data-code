First off, I believe that this device is incredible. I can see it benefiting my life and aiding me in some bad habits, as well as those who share similar difficulties and this uplifts me greatly. It was practically an instant buy for me (notwithstanding my pretty dire financial situation as of late). Unfortunately, considering the fact that my obvious lack of stars betrays the notion that I'm not indeed satisfied with the product, I feel I should at least be truthful in my intentions with this review. The first time I was able to put the Thync to use was when I borrowed a friend of mine's Iphone for a weekend. I take full credit for this mishap, though it did not help my mood when I first engaged the energy settings. I listened carefully to the voice  and remained determined to have a good first experience, ignoring the over-the-top pressure that was being applied to my upper temple. The sensation wasn't horrible, until about 30 seconds in when I began to feel sharp electrical stabbing both on the site of the module and the extension behind my ear. I held on for a good minute more as the pain rose constantly before uncontrollably ripping it off. This was both traumatic and led me to continue feeling sharp pressure at the two points of contact for the next 3-4 hours. At that time I gave it another shot, cause I'm not kitty cat. The calming mood this time. Far less shock and far more cranial pressure, therefore you can imagine my strain in forcing myself to try and relax.In closing, I understand that the product will not work for everyone. I can also assure you that I did try it numerous other times with varying successes, but none resulted in anything that was described to me. Living in Canada, the final price was far greater than I expected (which again, is my fault only) due to conversions. I don't believe that I can continue my relationship with this product given all of the above and the fact that I'm down 489$. Thank you for leading innovation, you have no idea how horrible I feel that I could not be a part of the success of such a wonderful product and invention.
