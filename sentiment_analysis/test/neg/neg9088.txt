Does not work. I purchased both the lock and doorbell together and they worked intermittently until the firmaware update came out. At 2 or 3 in the morning it would udate saying that the "system is now online."  Who can say how long it was offline? The customer service number requires a great deal of patience with a robot answering the call and a good 15 minutes to get to talk to a person who can't tell you why the system is on line, getting consistent power and wifi but not communicating with itself. Even though this sounds like a great idea, they have no consistent way of remotely unlocking or loking the door in an emergency and I ended up having to leave work to let someone in who should have been able to enter A) using the passcode on the app on their phone B) by me remotely activating the lock or C) activating the lock through the doorbell. This is money thrown away. Pictured is the error message on my phone.
