Seems like a solid, well built device.  Connected to my network easily.  It does register motion events via the IOS app, but...as other reviewers have mentioned-no push notifications yet.  Hopefully they will get this fixed soon, but for now, 2 stars.  I'll update when/if this changes.  Given the quality of other D-Link products, I fully expect they'll fix this.  Odd that they'd release a product that was obviously not quite ready.Update-7/17/14.  Despite making contact with DLink via their review comment, I never heard from them again.  Interesting-considering the promise of "compensation" for our help.  Anyway-it does seem as though they've managed to fix the notification issue.  The alert pops up pretty quickly when at home on the network, as well as when away via 4G(IOS).  After re-enabling the notifications on the app, the messages were only coming up via the home network-not via 4G.  However after a short time, they started working as well.  And they appear surprisingly quick.  Also-they mention the ability to receive notifications via text, however I have not been able to locate any area to store a mobile number.  Perhaps its on the Android app.One thing I also noticed is that the time between notifications is basically undefined.  I imagine there is a fixed delay between notifications, but its not written anywhere that I can find.  While I don't really see a need to adjust the notification timing, it would be nice to at least know how long that delay is.So-I'll give it a little more time to test the reliability of the notifications.  If all goes well, I'll add that last star.Update-7/20/14  iOS app throughout the day spits out "disconnected" notifications from the device. Then perhaps a few hours later, "reconnected" pops up.  Noticed today when I didn't get a notification after walking by the device that I had been logged out of the app(not by me). When I tried to access the app, I got "authentication failed", followed by the login screen.Of course, naysayers could call it user or iOS error, however I have several other apps that remain logged in, such as Amazon, YouTube, etc.This issue has happened a few times now, unfortunately.  Because this means the reliability is now in question, my rating has dropped again.  Sorry DLink.Update 8/18/14.  I've determined that the fairly frequent "disconnected" and "reconnected" notifications are likely due to wifi interference in my neighborhood-which is understandable.  However, during my troubleshooting, I decided to reset the sensor & start out fresh.  As with the first install, it took several days before I began getting the push notifications.  The unit was seeing the motion(verified by logging into the app), just not pushing it to my iphone.  After a few days, with no adjustments or changes in any settings(on my end), the notifications began to appear.Also-it seems that being automatically logged out of the app(see my 7/20 update) does not affect whether you get the notifications.  They still get pushed out to my iphone-which is a good thing.  However it would be nice if the app stayed logged in.I have also yet to see any option in the app, or the website, for getting the text notifications D-Link mentions in the advertising.  Only push.Oh, and I still haven't heard from D-Link after responding to their request for contact.So my testing continues.  I'll bump my rating up to 3 stars for now.  If I can get the push notifications in a timely fashion after a fresh install, then my rating may improve.10/6/14 Update:  This thing continues to disappoint.  Still get the constant stream of connect/disconnect notifications. While I understand this us likely due to local wifi interference, there should be a way to turn off these notifications, or better yet-upgrade the wifi to the much less crowded 5ghz band!Newest problem-can't turn the dang thing off!  Recently I wanted to turn the notifications off for a while so I simply clicked the motion detection button on the iPhone app. Stays off for a while, but then manages to turn itself back on for no apparent reason!  I guess if I want to turn it off, I'll have to just unplug it!Down to one star now, unfortunately. Get with it D-Link!
