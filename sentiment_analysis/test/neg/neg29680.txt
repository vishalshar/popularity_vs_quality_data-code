I read all of earlier reviews and decided to buy the PIQ. The first one arrived damaged as the mechanism or electronics was exposed as the covering was not covering the electronics. I sent this one back and ordered a new one and it did not have the same problem but for the life of me I could not get the thing to work. I checked YouTube and Babolat's page for instructions but they were just not very good and the app is not really user friendly. While the concept makes good sense to be able to measure how you are swinging a racquet is great, the PIQ just is not the item to do this. Consequently, I just returned the second PIQ and am going to continue to look for an effective way to measure how I am swinging the racquet on the courts.
