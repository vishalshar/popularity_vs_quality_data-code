i really had high hopes for this product.  i went ahead and followed the instruction in installation.  at first it connected, but did nothing.  i had to call Tado for them to send a command to reset it.  then i went back in, and found out that i had to manually configure EVERY SINGLE heat/air/cooling/etc...  it was A LOT of manual configuration because Tado was not able to ID my Fujitsu AC Unit.  after that, i did not want to go through the whole process of manually configuring my AC.  a better engineering, integration of other units, and better testing of their equipment is needed.  i was very disappointed in the product.
