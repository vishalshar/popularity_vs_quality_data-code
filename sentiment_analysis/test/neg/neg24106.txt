I really liked the device but it falls off all the time. I contacted Misfit customer service and was told on March 30th that they were shipping me a replacement band but after weeks of back and forth I still haven't received the band and to my knowledge it has not shipped. Very disappointed. Can't recommend this because of the total lack of SERVICE in Misfit's customer service department.
