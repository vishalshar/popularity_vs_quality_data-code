The headset itself is built very well.  However, I am constantly having an issue with my PS4 where the headset will disconnect and reconnect at random.  The help article on LucidSound's website says that it must be my PS4 that is broken, which it's not, because it has worked with every other wireless headset I have plugged into it.  I tried the powered USB hub that they suggest using, and was still getting the same issue.I contacted LucidSound support today, and they had me re-pair the headset to the dongle.  After about 3 hours of use, it started disconnecting again.  They want me to send it back to them so they can send me a new headset, but all of the games I play are online multiplayer and I can't be without a headset.I ordered a new wireless headset from a different manufacturer, and I will be returning these.  Don't waste your money on this garbage.
