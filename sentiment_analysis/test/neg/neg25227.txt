I had bought two and one of the harness just tore below a buckle after less than 7 days of using. It had only been used during walking a dog for about 15mins twice a day.I had seen other people face similar problems so not sure if the quality is shoddy or it's a manufacturing defect. In either case, a complete waste of ~$22*2 that I paid. I can't even use the other one now knowing it might tear during a walk.
