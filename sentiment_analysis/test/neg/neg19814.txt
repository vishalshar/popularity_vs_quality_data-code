The Withings Activite Steel is a great looking fitness tracker/watch but leaves much to be desired in both its functionality and Withings customer service. The following is the good, bad and ugly of this product.Good - it's a very sharp and slick device; the packaging is Apple-esque and the device, while the mid-end version above the pop but below the sapphire, has a quality feel to it. The face doesn't look cheap, the case is thick and durable but still light and the glass is actual mineral glass and not plastic. From a functional perspective the step counter appears to work as well as any and the device keeps accurate time. The sleep function appears to work well, albeit basic, and the watch is extremely water resistant which is a really nice feature. Showers, pool and lakes have yet to slow this thing down.Bad- despite the look/feel aspect the functionality has some issues and those issues appear to vary by owner. Many reviewers noted the device failed to count their sleep, some noted step counting issues, and in the case of mine it stopped tracking my runs after only one week of use! While this isn't a huge issue for some, running is my core exercise and while yes I could manually track it that defeats the purpose of the tracker itself. I went in knowing this device had more basic tracking and wasn't going to be like the top end models, but I do expect it to do its basic designed functionality especially only one week into use! Combine this with the other user feedback and there are clearly some bugs still in these things.Bad- after the issue with run tracking arose I reached out to withings customer service to address the issue. Before I get into specific feedback I will say they were very fast in responding (less than 24hrs) so that was positive, however unfortunately they were not particularly helpful. Their initial response was basically a list of things that must occur for the running to be tracked: run for more than 2 minutes (ok), don't stop for 40 consecutive seconds (right, done), ensure strap is tight as possible (yes...), try wearing on your other wrist (huh?). In addition they also noted that running on a treadmill may not register (not sure why) and for best accuracy ensure you are running at or faster than 6 mph, which is essentially a 10 minute mile. I was a bit surprised about the last two of these so I followed back up and confirmed all criteria was being met, to which the response was it must be a software issue and may be addressed in a future update. The variance of these answers, combined with no clear understanding from withings on how to address tells me they likely don't know. However, the sheer number of things that must occur just to track runs was pretty surprising to me; it seems odd that a fitness tracker will only work if you run faster than a 10 minute mile with it on your opposite than standard wrist outside vs. on a tread.So given the above and the support thus far from withings I have to give this a 1; it looks exactly how I wanted it but the sporadic function combined with limited answers from withings really make this an overpriced analog watch with a step counter included; function you could equal by buying a nicer watch and less expensive pedometer.If you really just want a step-counter but want it to look like a watch and be able to get wet (which are key attributes) you'll be very happy with this, otherwise I'd suggest a more reliable and accurate manufacturer.
