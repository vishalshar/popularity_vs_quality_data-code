Don't work well on Linux and when it does don't expect it to work again later on.With Chromecast I can almost do the same thing using 3rd party apps and pay 1/4 the price.The unit heats up a lot and unless you need to password protect it I don't see the difference in-between this and Chromecast.Should have kept my Chromecast instead of giving it to my sister for her birthday.
