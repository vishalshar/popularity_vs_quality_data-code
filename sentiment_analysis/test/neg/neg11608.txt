I wanted to use this as a range extender, especially because it had such good reviews and it seemed so simple--but it doesn't work. I have typed in the password to my Wifi multiple times, and the 9 times out of ten, the kisslink won't even acknowledge it. Once, it started the "count down" process to indicate it was linking, but then it failed. I had several techie friends fiddle with it, and they couldn't get it to work either.I'm sure it's nice as a router, but it doesn't work as a range extender.
