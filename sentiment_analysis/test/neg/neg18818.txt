The glasses have been marked strength 2.5 and i can hardly use them. Looks more like a strength 1.00 to meMy regular strength is 2.0 and i have another pair here from amazon with 3.00.They both work for me .....so this thin ones are a waste of money..Now that i have them glued to the phone i cannot send them back.be careful....better check in the store ....by that way you can test.Update after 2 weeks of use....The case has scratched up the glasses in the middle of the glass. So the case is not giving that much protection at all.See picture
