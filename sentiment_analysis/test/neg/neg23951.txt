It took me a while to get an audio expert to come over, but he confirmed my opinion that there is no improvement in sound quality or amplification from adding the microphone to the iPhone. Unfortunately, the window to return the item had run out, and I am stuck with it. Or, soon Goodwill will be stuck with it.
