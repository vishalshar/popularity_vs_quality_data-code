After living with this case for a few months I can verify what others have said, that the top part of the case is a horrible design that causes nothing but problems for an otherwise great product. I am on my third top having lost one when it popped off at a concert, a second broke one of the locking tabs off after it came off a dozen or so times. I will be ditching the case soon, otherwise at some point I'll be paying more for replacement tops than I paid for the case.Update Oct 24 2016:After going through 3 top pieces the case itself is now broken at the tab that holds the top on. Now there's no way to keep the top on at all as the case itself is now broken.
