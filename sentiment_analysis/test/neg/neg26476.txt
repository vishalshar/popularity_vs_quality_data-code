Disappointed. It seems like there is so much potential for this device but so far it has just been let downs.I have experienced difficulties with range. I have made macros that work when testing but fail when run on time schedule. Even testing the macros seemed inconsistent. I'm disappointed that the device relies on your phone to be present to work.Triggering commands with the Amazon Echo is difficult.  I find myself having to try and try until the Echo understands what I am saying.  It works if you keep repeating until the command is understood.The software makes one believe that this is going to be great with all the functionality but if it doesn't perform then it seems like something not quite ready for production.This could be fantastic but it looks like it will be a paperweight and a loss of money. I  wish it worked. Would be awesome.Talked to a friend who got one also.  He took is frustrated and was hoping I would figure out fixes for the issues but instead I am trying a different product.
