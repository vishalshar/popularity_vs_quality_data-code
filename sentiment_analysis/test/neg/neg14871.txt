I wanted to give these sheets a try but was wary of the high price point, so I decided to put my toe in the water with a pair of pillowcases.  $50 seemed pricey for the pair, so I waffled on that for a few days before deciding to go for it.  Then, my package arrives, and guess what?  It was $50 for ONE pillowcase, not two.  (Who sells one pillowcase?)If the description said "one pillowcase" instead of "pillowcaseS", then I would have known this up front.  If they were sold as a pair - the industry standard- then, I would have known what to expect.  In either case, I may have sucked it up and bought the product - with a fair expectation of what I was spending and receiving.  But as it is, I got the kind of unpleasant surprise that makes a person feel ripped off.  And now I'm deciding whether to return it or still give it a shot... either way, the experience is soured by this bait-and-switch feelingUPDATE:  I ended up using this pillowcase for a short while & did find it to be very cool to the touch.  It seemed to attract any moisturizers, etc that I had on my face, so now it's in the wash while I test-drive my new Sheex pillowcases.  I like the idea of being antimicrobial, but will need more than this short time to determine whether that actually impacts my health, allergies, or complexion at all
