Mmmm... Not as great as advertised? Once you apply it to your gloves and let it dry out it becomes sticky, but not like brand new gloves sticky but good enough. Then after one catch and maybe after dirt gets on your gloves it becomes slippery again. Apply it if you really feel necessary but not like a game changer
