My son wears a size 6 in children's. I could barely get them on. Once on, he couldn't get his foot in the shoe. We have to unfasten them, and put them on, and then refasten them. They are so hard to fasten that he can't do it himself. This means he will not be able to wear them if he has to take his shoes off at school for any reason.
