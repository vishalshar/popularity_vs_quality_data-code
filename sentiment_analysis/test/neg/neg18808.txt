I bought this... and, as people have noted, the sound distorts at about 3/4 volume.  I was prepared to use my old speakers...then I investigated the speakers that came with it.  They look like 3-way speakers...but upon inspection....the mid-range speaker is a phony!  Just a piece of plastic, and...it seems as though the cross-over system for the tweeter is not standard.No way can i reward a company for faking out its customers.  Returned...
