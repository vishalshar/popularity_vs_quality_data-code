Less than a month after applying it to my Apple MagSafe power brick, the Sugru cracked and failed (see the attached photo). Sugru is too brittle to use on anything that needs to be bendable. I followed the exact instructions as listed on Sugru's website for "How to Fix a Charger" [...] They shouldn't advertise it as a good use case for broken chargers. On non-bendable surfaces, it works pretty well.
