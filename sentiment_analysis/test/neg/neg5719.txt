The TarDisk was a disaster for me.  I followed all instructions carefully and to the letter, but after installing the TarDisk I started to experience numerous kernel panics causing my MacBook Pro to crash. Finally, I had to "unpear" the TarDisk and reinstall everything -- a big pain -- and the crashes stopped for a few weeks.  They then started again, with the exact same symptoms, something I never experienced before the TarDisk.  So I had to go through the painful unpearing process a second time, once again reinstalling my system from a Time Machine backup. I decided to forget about using this product in the way it was intended, and now have it reformatted as a normal sd card.  It seems to be working fine.  I am really disappointed in this expensive product which did nothing but screw up my machine for a couple of months.
