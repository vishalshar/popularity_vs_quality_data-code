This game was presented as a game that is good for new couples as well and couples who have been married for years.  However, the majority of the questions my husband and I already knew the answers to. (We have been together for 16 years) Also, there were an awful lot of questions about death, which I didn't really like.  I would only recommend this game for people who are in a brand new relationship, and even then I am not so sure it would be all that helpful.
