Both original order and replacement scales, two different models, 4E and I think C3, failed to connect bluetooth reliably.  USELESS except weighing, and that takes an effort with both wifi and bluetooth working to set up.With the iPad right next to each of the two Withings, sometimes the Scale connects Bluetooth, sometimes not. I have invested several hours in trying to get the each of two Withings to work properly, without success. This contrasts with my FitBit Charge 2, Logitech 380 wireless keyboard, or a Bluetooth speaker, each of which connect Bluetooth rapidly when within a few feet of my iPad, and work perfectly.  The Withings Body Cardio 4E seemed to set up more easily, but would not connect  to my iPad Bluetooth the following day, nor make measurements other than weight.With the first Scale, model C3, I had to factory reset and setup multiple times before the Scale worked twice.  With the second Scale the display first looked like an abstract, no characters or numbers; it took two factory resets to get the scale to work.  Worked ONCE.  The following day the scale would not connect to the iPad bluetooth.I really wanted the Blood Pulse Velocity measurement; that is why I spent so much time trying to get the Body Cardio to work.Note:  The Withings Scale does not support a 5G internet connection, one needs 2.4 G. I had to degrade my network, when trying to setup the first Withings Scale, Model Body Cardio C5 (if memory serves me correctly.)
