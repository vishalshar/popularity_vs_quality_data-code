It said this was for dogs who chew, and "Highly durable product, you will not need to replace this anytime soon". Not True! I gave this to my pup and 10 minutes later I found him trying to swallow the small pieces he broke off. I had to throw it away. Not only will I not replace it I will not purchase again.
