The plastic does not melt together to create 3D objects. Instead, it kind of winds around itself as you draw with it, never connecting to create something solid. I can unwind the creation once the strands harden. Consequently, the strands snap easily. This may become cooler with a few more updates, but it's not worth $100 right now!
