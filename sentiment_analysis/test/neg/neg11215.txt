On a tasting note, since amazon requires an actual review of the product - I just opened up one of these expired boxes of cookies to taste it, AND guess what? The cookies tasted STALE, yes, STALE, like old cookies past its prime! Of course, it's probably not dangerous like eating a day old tuna nigiri that was sitting uncovered on the kitchen table with the temps averaging 90 degrees.I'm sure the cookies would've tasted just fine if they were not expired, BUT, expired cookies was all I received, so yes, the cookies tasted stale and they were a little too dry, again, probably because the product had EXPIRED.We ordered 2 packages of the Cinnamon Grahams (6 boxes total) and received the items on May 6th 2014 which had the following expiration dates "Best by 08 MAR 2014" Lot #307A081. NOT giving these EXPIRED cookies to our daughter. Am extremely disappointed they sent out expired food items.
