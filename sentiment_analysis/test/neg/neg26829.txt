My son begged for this case. I bought it for him for Christmas after reading description and reviews thinking that it might provide enough shock protection. After making my kids use Otterboxes for the last few years this was a mistake. My son slipped on the ice with the phone in his pocket and his IPhone 6 now won't work. I will never buy again and we will be going back to Otterboxes.
