1st light pad installed very easy. Took me about half hour and worked perfect. 2nd installation was miserable. On my second day. It will not connect to the wifi network. I went thru all the troubleshooting I could find. I call customer service on Saturday.  Only two guys and neither had the expertise to tell me what to do. They asked I call on Sunday when an expert was in. Had to wait till 11:00 am, limited customer services hours. Very frustrating.When I call the expert, he had me do all the things I had previously tried. Still can't get it to connect to Internet. Now we have to try and replace with third switch and see if that works.There's no app for iPad, phone only and no internet computer access. The app on the phone is weak and cheesie. Doesn't allow my wife to set up a username. So.,,only access is one single phone device. Not good.Great concept, hope they can get their act together.
