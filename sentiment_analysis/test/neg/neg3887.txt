Very poor support and works with about 3 Android handsets, they could rectify this very easily through modifying their terrible software, but have made it clear that they have not intention of doing this.Avoid, unless you own a Samsung phone or like the fact that their auto orientation will consistently incorrectly present the image on you phone whilst searching for the ability to turn this feature off...only to find that you absolutely can not do this!
