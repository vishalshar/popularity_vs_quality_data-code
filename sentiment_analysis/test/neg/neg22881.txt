Definitely thought it was going to be a lot better.. Almost always leaks.. when I drink out of it, it leaks out of the rim that connects the cap to the mason jar.. I use a Kerr mason jar idont know if that affects anything.also, when I put it in the fridge, it shrinks the plastic so much that I can't even take it off until it goes back to room temperature.for the price, I wouldn't recommend, i'd just buy another container to drink my liquids. it's probably good for solid foods though.
