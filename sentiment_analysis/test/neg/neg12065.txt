If you're looking for a light weight and presentable bag for your corporate commute, this probably isn't it. The bag looks nice enough and the magnetic latch is neat and works well. Unfortunately, this bag has all the hallmarks of cutting corners for savings at economies of scale. The stitching is thin and wide. Every millimeter of fabric that could be trimmed off has been. This leaves you with a nice enough looking bag that doesn't hold much.  It will hold your U-lock and some roadside repair kit. It will probably hold a 10 inch tablet along with a thin book. It will not hold a proper hardcover novel. It will not hold your tablet, a thin book, and a U-lock at the same time.This could be a really great bag if they didn't work so hard to cut costs for mass production. Give it a little more room, longer straps, proper stitching, and some better fabric, this would be a great product. As it stands, what they sold me is not so great.Contrasted with the build quality and pricing of popular (and reasonably affordable) bags like Ortlieb, Chrome, Patagonia, or even Timbuk2, this bag is built like a lower end Jansport and would be reasonably priced at $30-40.
