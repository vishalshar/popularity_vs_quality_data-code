Unfortunately this cream has an odd, strong coffee smell to it.  I think it might be the cocoa butter, which is no fault of the product because that is a wonderful ingredient to include, but I couldn't get over it.  I didn't want to go to bed with that smell on my face.  My son said it smelled like a medicine cabinet.  Too bad!  I have some of the other ArtNaturals products and like them,  but not this one.
