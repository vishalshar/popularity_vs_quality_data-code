The texture very hard, foul odor, not a nice color.  Soaked for several minutes in warm water to soften, while doing so the odor was stronger.  Still not soft enough, I placed into a chopper with a little warm water hoping to shred. My 2 cats looked at me as if I was trying to poison them.  Will not buy any Whole Life item again.
