Didn't work for me. But might for new construction.  On my old door, where you have to be careful to shut the door all the way or the deadbolt is pretty stiff, it is worthless.  Because what good is a lock that doesn't open sometimes?  Or that won't lock?  Worse yet, it made unlocking even with the key an iffy proposition.I have uninstalled it.  Back to keys.But if you have new construction where everything lines up just right and works smoothly, I bet this would work.
