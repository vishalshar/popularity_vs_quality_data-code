I live in a house with 4,000 sqft on 2 stories. Getting good wifi coverage throughout the house and without dead spots is a challenge, especially when good bandwidth for HD video streaming is required. This sounds like the perfect use case for the eero, which is why I bought it.The first impression when the product arrives is "wow": The unboxing experience is very stylish and Apple-like. Next comes the setup. It requires to install an app on your iPhone; I'd personally would want the ability to also perform setup via a web frontend. When installing the 2nd eero, there is already the first issue: even though placed only about 20 feet away, it won't connect to the master 'eero'. It takes some fiddling around to overcome this. Next, I am checking network coverage through the house. Indeed I am seeing coverage everywhere, but bandwidth is poor and inconsistent. Even though my house has 75Mbps service, I am often seeing only 20Mbps or even less. This is certainly not enough for HD video streaming. I am educating myself a little bit, and find that the mesh network performance has been improved with recent firmware. I try to update the firmware, but this can't be done manually. I have to wait over night for the eeros to update their firmware. Next morning, 2 eeros have indeed updated from 1.0.0 to 1.0.9 - but the 3rd one got stuck and now shows a red light. Power cycling won't help, which gets me in contact with tech support. They somehow are able to fix that from their end, which I personally feel is a bit spooky. However, the network performance remains poor. I send about 10 emails back and forth with hero's tech support. Kudos, eero support is very responsive... but the problems remain. After one full day of using it, I discover even more problems: my MacBook Pro, located 6 feet away from the 'master' eero will only see 20Mbps bandwidth, when waking up from sleep. To fix that, I have to turn wifi off and on. Yes, this works, but this can't be what I have to do 10 times a day. Also, I notice that my Hewlett Packard printer will randomly drop off the network, even though my iMac, sitting right next to the printer, sees perfect network. Eero's tech support confirms both issues to be known. This is the signal for me to admit that the product is not working for me.Summary:* good:- nice packaging- nice appearance- great tech support- overall good concept* bad:- poor network performance- not compatible with Mac OS X El Capitan- not compatible with Hewlett Packard OfficeJet printer- high priceI have replaced the eero with a Netgear X8 router. This router is significantly cheaper than the eeros and a single access point provides more bandwidth and better coverage than 3 eeros. I love what the eeros could be... but they absolutely did not deliver on the promise. I am sure eero will fix that eventually with a software update, but at a $500 price tag I am simply not willing to wait for that to happen.
