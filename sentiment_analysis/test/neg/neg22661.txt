It takes 4-5-6 days to charge up and about an hour to recharge my phone or tablet battery about 20%. Not worth it. The light, however, is very bright and lights up the kitchen nicely. I try not to use the light much though because I really need the phone charge feature. Basically a waste of money. And I was not given the opportunity to choose the country I wished to donate the freebie.
