I thought this would be great. Not since the first edition of Wink, have i had something so buggy. This thing is driving me nuts. I can see the potential and it works on some things, but not all. Devices i could control with the free app yesterday I can't control with the anymote home - like WHAT!!!also at one stage I could control my Peachtree stereo with the app on my phone, now it's just hopeless.won't learn by IR and when I ask my app for info on my anymote it goes into and endless cycle of zilch.I'm very very close to sending this back after just 4 hours!!!Agggggghhhhhhhh
