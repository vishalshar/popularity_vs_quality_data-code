Let me start by saying this, the UI on the Robin is one of the best I have ever used. It was polished and simple and beautiful. For the price, you're getting pretty good specs. However,there are two main issues that I had with this phone. One, the battery life is horrendous. Sitting in my pocket. With very very light messaging. It went from 100% to 60% in a matter of 3 hours. On top of that. The speaker sound is pretty bad. They crackle and  all you can hear is static through them. The bottom speaker has a distinct crackling sound that is just awful. I tried to live this phone, I think they solved the storage issue quite nicely and elegantly. I just couldn't ignore these glaring isdued.
