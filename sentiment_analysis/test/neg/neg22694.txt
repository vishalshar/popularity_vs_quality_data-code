When the myLifter arrived from Amazon and I unboxed it, I discovered there was no mounting bracket included to mount it on the ceiling, no mounting hardware bag of parts, no wall charger mount, etc.  These were all clearly labeled to be included on the side of the box, so I called Amazon service.A replacement was quickly sent, but instead of the myLifter, Amazon sent me a duplicate myLifter hook from that previous order instead.  Another frustrating service call to get that resolved.Installation was easy. Their "How to" installation videos on their website are good and worth watching.  The iOS app is good and supports being able to define the high and low set-points so you can raise/lower it more like a garage door.  (It stops if you lock the phone.). The myLifter with the optional 2nd pulley/hook has plenty of power to store my wife's recumbent trike above her car.A very easy to make mistake (that can destroy your myLifter) is to operate the motor with slack in the cable.  While adjusting the bottom set-point, we unwound it too far and the cable came out of the spool and wrapped around the axle.  The motor faulted and wouldn't budge.  I was able to untangle it, but the plastic coating on the cable got torn up.  Don't do that!  When lifting, be sure to keep some tension on the cable until the slack is pulled tight.Overall it seems to be working well now.  My wife can easily stow and go the trike with her phone. For $200 would I buy another?  Harbor freight tools sells a 440 lb. electric hoist with a remote for $99.  I think I'll look for a less expensive hoist next time.
