I bought this in May, just under three months ago. This contraption's greatest strength is its greatest downfall.While featuring three adjustable joints may seem ideal to pivot your phone to the appropriate angle, these joints become a hassle to retighten all too regularly. It never stood a chance on the bumpy dirt roads I drive every day. I've had to retighten on a nearly daily basis, as all pieces loosen after driving, especially down a dirt road. Unfortunately, the plastic threads on one joint became stripped from the road's constant loosening and my retightening, so it will not stay together and hold its position any longer. The thing is basically useless now after three months. I wonder if this was tested in a stationary or moving vehicle, because it does not hold up after some bumps in the road. I'll look to competitors for a product with fewer moving parts.
