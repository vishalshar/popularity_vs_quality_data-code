Crap! Set up procedure is horrible. I gave it a chance calling Tech support a few times. And spend many hours trying to figure it out. I understand WiFi and have set up various systems in my home. From web home security to web servers. But this procedure on this produce sucks. I gave up and returned this product. Maybe next time.
