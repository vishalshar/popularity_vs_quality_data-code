I was really looking forward to this stylus for use with my Paper by 53 iPad app for drawing, sketching, and jotting down notes, so I was excited to see it went on sale for Black Friday (down to $29.99). I had deliberately waited a while after this stylus launched to market to give 53 time to work out all the kinks in subsequent generations, but it appears some of the major problems persist in the current model.My two biggest issues with Pencil are that the tip does not produce strokes that directly correspond to pressure. Instead, they base stroke width to pen speed. WHY? Also, the eraser end isn't reliable. Only one long edge and one short edge worked, and I had to apply an uncomfortable amount of pressure to get it to register as an eraser and not a finger-tip (smudge action). This is really poor user experience for this type of product at this price point.I'm still pretty surprised at all the glowing reviews. I thought I got a dud, but after googling around a bit, it seems many others have had similar experiences with this stylus. Some pros: It arrived promptly, great eco-efficient packaging, looks gorgeous (Graphite), felt great in the hand. But sadly, all style and no substance count as a product returned in my book.
