I've been a customer of Amazon since 1996 (they tell me) and this is the first item I recall returning.It rejects my email address in setup???? It's "support" website set does not support.In spite of this I may have succeeded to pair with my Iphone 6 but never succeeded in getting to part of the app where I could test the product.Useless.
