Our game arrived today and the box was completely crushed and no longer contains the items for storage for later use because it's damaged beyond repair. The game only contained 5 mouthpieces instead of 10 as advertised both online and on the box itself. No game instructions were included and an alarming number of repeat cards were found- in several cases, at least 3 of the same card appear in the game. There was a whole round where none of the words required the use of lips and therefore were not funny or difficult to say. Furthermore, there were quite a few misspelled words and phrases, suggesting that the game quality is not as advertised.
