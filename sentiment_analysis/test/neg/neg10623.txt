Bought this simple easy to use phone for my mother.  Set up was simple.  Using the phone is simple.  Just what she wanted.  7 days after purchase, the phone did not turn on. I tried another charger, i tried different cable, nothing worked.  I went on the web for support only to find a phone number to call.  I called the number and was told there was an unusually high number of calls and to call back later.  3 days in a row, 4 to 5 times a day I called and only got as far as the message.  Lifeline and LifeAlert support lines get answered by a real person right away.  This is what I expect.  I had to look up the issue and find that removing the battery would help the phone reboot.  Ultimately, customer support for a service provided to elderly should be easy to access and informative, in this case it was non existent.  Trying to teach an 85 year old how to take out a battery to reboot a phone is more than anyone should expect.  If the service ever improves, I will certainly update my review.
