I bought this product apparently 33 days ago and can no longer return it.  I was really wanting to like it.  Before now, I have had issues sleeping and have used an all-night audio product that had white noise that helped.  When I used this product, I thought that it would help me but, the light faded on a timer and the audio also stopped as it thought I was asleep.  It did not restart when I was obviously not asleep and ultimately, I am disappointed with the product and can no longer return it.I did not rate this the lowest, one star because, I also bought the Withings Scale and the Blood Pressure monitor at the same time and I LOVE them. I apparently waited 3 days too long to return the Aura Smart Sleep System.For me, what it came down to is that, I love the sleep pad and the analytics it provides. What I hated and want to return the product based upon is  that I could not program the Sound to be constant all night and, even at it's highest volume, it did not compare to the volume produced by the Phillips charger and speaker I used and am again using now.  My husband hates the sound I play so, with that said, I did not put my Phillips speaker on a love volume setting but, when using the Withings Aura audio, it had no effect on me as it disappears too quickly.I realize I may be a unicorn in the world of needs on a sleep audio level but, if you could create a product that was not so obtrusive visually on my night stand that analyzes my sleep patterns AND I do not have to have the light effect, I would be all in.As a result, I might have to go to ebay to sell this unit and get another solution that actually analyzes my sleep alone.Again, I love my other Withings products but, this item does not live up to my expecations.
