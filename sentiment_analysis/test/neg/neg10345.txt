I SO wanted to love this. My trusty Fitbit One of three years finally died on me so I was excited to learn about the Spire right at the time I was looking to replace my activity tracker. I'm very interested in starting mindfulness and breathing exercises and I thought this would be a great tool for that in addition to tracking steps. Unfortunately it just didn't work out for me. It kept telling me to reposition it (it has to be held against your skin) and it never read accurately for me. I'm a nurse and generally wear a sports bra under my scrubs and have always clipped my Fitbit in the center, however with the Spire, placing it there didn't hold it against my skin and didn't read my respirations. I tried putting it on the side, which sort of worked, but it was awkward to have a big stone (it's markedly bigger, especially compared to the Fitbit one I've been using) under/close to your armpit all day. I bend down and move around so much at work and generally wear my scrubs a little lower (they're the yoga type waistband), so wearing it on my pants wasn't a good everyday option. Finally, I knew this didn't track sleep but was willing to deal with that drawback if the other functions worked as well as I'd hoped, but the issues with the features I wanted plus the lack of sleep tracking made this a no-go for me and I returned it and ordered another trusty Fitbit One (outdated, perhaps, but all the features that I want and lots of options to wear it comfortably). Maybe this will work well for others and I'm interested to see if this brand evolves with a new model in the future, but it's a pass for me.
