I used to love this product.  But my most recent order not only had a package redesign but also an ingredient change.  I threw out the old box when I re-stocked but I believe the ingredients were: chaga, mint leaf, star anise & stevia.  The new ingredients are: chaga, eleuthero, mint & rosehip.  It tastes awful, no matter how you try to hide it.  Please go back to the original formula!
