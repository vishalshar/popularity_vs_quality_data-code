5 Stars for the phone design. I like it. I can say, You will love it.But why 1 star? Simple, you don't know when it is dead. My is dead after 3 days, the USB Port is not working anymore randomly. I did research, and they have quality control problem on this USB Port. It may work couple days, couple month, or after warranty 1 year, and it die randomly. So, If you just want a phone for 1 year, go with it. But I will wait for Nextbin next version with a better quality control.Why I am so rule for 1 star ? You know, it's just an android phone, 3gb ram, 32GB, use one backup app to control an Online Storage.. Nothing is special. But seriously, you will love the Mint color, I am in love with it.. however, design is nothing to do with "dead randomly" :D Next version soon? I will buy it.
