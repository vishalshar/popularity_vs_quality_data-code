They don't work with every gun in Battlefield1. I had to cut both "stoppers" to even get them to work. I haven't tried them out for any other games.But honestly, they're way overpriced. It's maybe a $1 worth of plastic. But for $20? Nope.  I wouldn't buy them again. They don't work for everything. For certain games they might be fine though.They are better than the triggers that come with the controller. But they don't work as intended.
