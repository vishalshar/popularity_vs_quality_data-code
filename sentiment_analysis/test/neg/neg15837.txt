What a piece of garbage.  I got a small crack after a few days of using this garbage which was inside the glass, it was like a bubble, and the phone was in my pocket, i didnt drop it or anything.  I said hey its ok its not gonna crack, otherwise i wouldve contacted this seller right away.  This screen is so fragile, total waste of $110, go on ebay and buy a $30 screen and you can expect the same results.  I had to write this review as now my screen is back to where it was before i bought this GARBAGE.  Do not buy this!
