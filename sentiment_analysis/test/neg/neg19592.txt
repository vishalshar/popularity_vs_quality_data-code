i love this smartypants, my pediatrition said it s really complete for my 6yr old twin, who love these but i am not really happy with the fact that it covers with sugars as it dont see the purpose and it might cause cavity, i also think 4/days a little too much but i put them together w their snack bags to school and they love these gummies, so no complaint.i give only 1star as i bought 4 bottles of these from this seller LivWell Rx in Jan 25,2015 and cant believe i just found out all 4 bottles will all expire on April 2015???? i know it s not illegal to sell product with only 3 months to expire but i think this is not very honest as a store, specially it s Kids vitamine!!!! for little kids? seriously!!??BE AWARE OF THIS SELLER!!! dont buy from them or be cautious!!
