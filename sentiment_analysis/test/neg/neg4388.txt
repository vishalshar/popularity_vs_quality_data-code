(LOWERED TO ONE STAR - REASON IN COMMENT) I have a Samsung Galaxy 4 android smartphone, and the process of installing the app and setting up the cube was a nightmare that took two hours before functioning properly.  During that time, I very much considered boxing it all back up and sending it back.  The app went to complete black screen at one point, and froze multiple times, and sometimes would not even go past the scrolling three pictures to get to the page where you can log in and have menu options.  I uninstalled and re-installed about 12 times, and several times when trying to re-install, I received error notices that the app could not install.  Once the cube was finally connected to my wifi and working, it seemed great, but most of the time when I open the app and try to connect to the video, it goes into "calling" mode for several minutes, and does not show any video and gives me a button to press to "recall", and I have to go through this about eight times before a video will finally appear.  I've been trying to get video now for 20 minutes and it's just not working.  Sometimes it does... sometimes it doesn't.  This product is great in theory, but very much has multiple bugs and I would suggest others do not pay $200 just yet until these bugs are fixed.
