This product is ridiculous. I've used it for almost two months without any results to show for it. It dispenses globs of sticky, gooey slime that will get in your eyes, blur your vision, cause a sensation reminiscent of conjunctivitis, and be difficult to wash away. I nonetheless bore all this like a twit, thinking, "beauty is pain"--and got no results to speak of. Feels like they should have paid me, and not the other way around. Atrocious. Want my $$ back.
