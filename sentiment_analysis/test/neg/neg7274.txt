Got this item for my boyfriend. He selected to have the app running in the background of his phone and sync through out the day. He actually lost his wallet and promptly pulls up the app to see where his wallet is. The app was not updating through the day and only picked up the tile the last time he opened his app. He checked that location and unfortunately not there. Wallet gone.. tile did not help.
