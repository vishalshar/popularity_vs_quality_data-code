this mobile / tablet has a large viewing screen and works well with android apps. however, I have had issues with both of the units I have owned. the first had issues with the on / off button, making it difficult to operate. I was sent a replacement by amazon, which arrived the same day I returned the defective unit.the replacement item, had similar issues, and restarts / shuts down fore no apparent reason. I attempted to return this item, yet was informed I was 2-days past the 30-day return period. I contacted Posh. they are willing to replace the item. however, I must agree to return the item to Posh (paying out of pocket for shipping), then wait approximately 21-days fore my exchange item, which may in fact be a refurbished item.customer service said they would ship me a unit from their stock, if I filled out a form, which has been accomplished several weeks past. yet I have had no further contact from Posh customer service.I may naught I good conscious recommend this item, based on amazon's return policy and Posh ineffectual customer service policies.
