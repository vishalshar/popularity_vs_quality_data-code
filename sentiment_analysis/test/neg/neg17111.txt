So bad... First off, If you order this get speaker wire, it comes with 12" of wire.Additionally test every function. We installed it, tossed the box and thought nothing of it after using the input and bluetooth. A few weeks pass and we tried the CD player for the first time. Switch to CD player and it shuts the whole system down, no matter what combination you use to attempt to use the CD it's un-useable, now I realize we have tossed the boxes and can't return it to Amazon.Contact support to create an RMA. Per IT, I get to ship the unit to them at my cost and provide a money order for 10.00 to have them send it back (let's call it 20.00 round trip out of pocket). Contemplating taking that 20.00 to pawn shop and buying a used receiver.Seriously buys something else
