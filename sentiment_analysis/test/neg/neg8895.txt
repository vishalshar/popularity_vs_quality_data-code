it used to work great. after 2 month of use it malfunctioned and my wife got stuck in the house. She could not turn the knob inside. If there were an emergency my family would have been unable to leave the house through the door. It turned out that the motor prevented the knob to turn. If this happens you have to forcefully turn the knob to turn the motor inside the lock.The lock has now jammed several times and I have no idea why. I am now returning the lock and expect a refund.
