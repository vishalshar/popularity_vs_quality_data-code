Junk. Manual focus and low pixel count. This is an expensive toy that won't fit your phone if you have anything more than a paper-thin case.What's more, the app watermarks your photos with the "SEEK THERMAL" logo by default. You can shut the watermark off, but it's a deeply buried setting.There's a visual spectrum-infrared split screen option on the app that's a lame version of FLIR's MSX. Of course, since it uses the built-in camera on your iOS device to provide the visual spectrum data, and the iOS camera is located at just about the extreme opposite end from the lighting port on every iOS device, the degree of parallax is unacceptable even at long distances.The field of view on this particular camera is really narrow as well. The cheap optics coupled with the manual focus makes it just about impossible to tell if the object you're looking at is in focus. Once again, the low pixel count really hurts this unit.
