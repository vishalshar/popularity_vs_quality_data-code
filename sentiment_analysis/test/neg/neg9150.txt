This item is WAY too expensive for what it is (twenty-six bucks). This is made of hard plastic- nothing fancy.We ordered the Radmo Dual by mistake. It looked & sounded like it would hold TWO phones, but it does not. The Radmo TWIN is the model that holds 2. Never the less- we they shipped the wrong one. We received Radmo Mini Tablet (which is WAY too small for anything larger than a Galaxy Note- forget a mini tablet).It arrived in a box without ANY directions. My poor husband was so confused because he was trying to put it together as if it were the one we ordered! He eventually found a crappy video online. Once he figured out it was the wrong one, he found directions for this one. Neither of us could figure out why it wasn't put together in the first place. For that much money it should be ready to use. When it is put together it doesn't take up much ore space in the box.Bottom line, we felt gypped- these items are CHEAPLY made, should have been assembled, and should have included directions, even if only on the box.
