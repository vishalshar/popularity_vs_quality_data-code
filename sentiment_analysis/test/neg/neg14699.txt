If I could give this 0 stars, I would. First of all, it is NOT AN AUTHENTIC GAME. Do not waste your money on this game and purchase directly from the product website. When the package arrived, the box it was crushed and very flimsy. Comes with small and large mouth expanders and several wrapped decks of phrases. The phrases are misspelled and poorly translated. Which by the way, the package came from Korea.
