I was so excited for this camera. We own the original canary and love it. It has great picture quality, good night vision and it has NEVER disconnected from our wifi. We thought what better to expand our system for outdoors than getting the Flex. The Flex looks great and installation was very simple. However, once we took it more than 10 ft away from our router if would constantly disconnect. Our phones, iPad and laptops connect in the same places we tried with the same signal and show full strength, so the issue is not with our router. Customer support was very friendly and responsive but in the end they couldn't help us solve the problem. Also, the battery life is very poor. If you plan to install this outdoors, at a height, you will be climbing a ladder constantly to recharge it. And lastly, the night vision is very poor compared to our regular canary. We are returning this camera. If you need a camera for indoors get the original canary. And if you need outdoors look somewhere else, the flex still probably needs a few iterations before it works for outdoors.
