I guess a sucker is actually born every minute, because I fell for it hook line and sinker. First use and absolutely nothing! I did 10 minutes on the energy vibe at about  50% power and the sensations were definitely uncomfortable, made my right eyeball hurt at one point and gave the slight hint of a headache. I'm really bummed out, was hoping for this to replace my daily coffee but not a chance. Maybe it just doesn't work for me? Hopefully amazon will accept it as a return? I was soo excited when the THYNC arrived, now totally bummed out.
