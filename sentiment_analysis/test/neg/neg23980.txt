Since I have never used one of these I was not basing my review on how other products work but this item is a good idea too bad it doesn't do anything it advertises....my Boyfriend and I took him a block away from the house and waited and waited about 10 minutes later it alerted us he left the house!!! He could have been miles away with the way my dog runs! This product is not worth it I wouldn't use it for free! The activity tracker isn't  accurate either!
