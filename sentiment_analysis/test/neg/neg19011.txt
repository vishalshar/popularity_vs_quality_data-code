I've used the camera for a couple of months, the camera was very easy to setup and the quality is very good however, there are 2 issues that exist that Invideon knows about but have not fixed.  The camera sends alerts when is switches to night mode, the switching mechanism makes a clicking sound that's picked up by the sound detection software (even when on the lowest sound setting), it's very annoying getting these alerts when there's no problem.  The 2nd issue is that the camera has is that it goes offline then back online two or three times a day, the outage normally lasts around 10 minutes, then it restores itself, again this is aggravating because these events send alert messages.  While the camera is offline, you can't connect to it thus is an event were to occur, you would miss it.
