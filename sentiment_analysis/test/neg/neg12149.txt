I really wanted to love this product, because it sounded fantastic. Alas, the shine 2 keeps popping out of the wrist band. The clip for shoe or clothes hold the shine 2 but the shine 2 spins too easily in the clip and thus blocks easy readability. The sleep feature does not know when I wake up in the middle of the night,  not even when I wake up to go to the bathroom (one reason I got the shine was to see waking patterns because I often wake up at night). It also has a hard time detecting when I am exercising. I am very bummed that it did not turn out the way I wanted.
