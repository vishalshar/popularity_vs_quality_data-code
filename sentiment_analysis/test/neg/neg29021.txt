Update 11/12: It was working! It took 24 hours for it to show up, but my (incorrect) weight was reported in the app. Support mentioned that you can cause it to rezero by stepping on it briefly. (This is another troubleshooting item that was annoyingly omitted from the online documentation.)I wanted to try that, but the next day it just wouldn't turn on; I reinserted the batteries, etc., and at this point I'm sending it back to wait for a new version.Update 11/7: I've contacted Qardio and they responded promptly on a Saturday. I have made some progress in that the scale now recognizes me; it was as simple as step on it to choose myself. I'm pretty sure I actually tried that while I was messing around; one does try harder when one knows to do something.Another issue: if your wifi settings are wrong, it happily throws out those measurements rather than try to sync with your phone or hold on to them locally. The docs claim that it should sync with your phone via bluetooth, it didn't try to do that.Unfortunately, at this time the app is still not actually registering the measurements in the history, though, so a core feature still doesn't work. Review holds at 2 stars until I get the app to recognize that I really did weigh myself.Original review:This is my initial impression for this product.My reason for buying Yet Another Expensive Scale: I've had a WiThings scale which will carefully tell me exactly what I weigh. And WiThings has a very elaborate site that shows you all kinds of breakdowns of your weight, body composition, etc.But knowing your precise weight isn't actually useful if you're trying to diet. I have seen my weight fluctuate by 10 pounds in one day, so that kind of noise makes it pretty useless.All I want to know is "you ate too much" or "you're losing weight." When I saw Qardio, it exactly matched what I was looking for. I would rather a plus / minus sign instead of a smiley frowny face, but close enough.First thoughts: the boxing is beautiful, it's quite light and small. The scale is a nice simple white circle, even the conductive elements for all the body composition wizardy are nicely laid out.You set up by opening the app on your phone, stepping on the scale and it uses bluetooth to walk you through setting up wi-fi.And now for the negatives. Just stepping on the thing, it's too narrow. You're supposed to step on it with your feet slightly spread, but there's a very small sweet spot to where your feet are far enough apart, but not so far that you're not making the thing flip off the floor. I'll see if I get used to it.I got through the initial installation without too much trouble, I thought. Then I step on the scale for my first measurement and, contrary to the mode I chose, it's showing me my weight whcih is 10 pounds heavier. If the Withings scale has been underweighing me the whole time, so be it, that's what I weigh. I'm doubtful, though, because Withings has agreed with other devices in the past.And the QardioBase doesn't recognize me and measurements don't go into the history on the app. The scale shows my name and >guest next to the weight, and I don't see any clues in the instructions as to how to remedy this. I even tried adjusting my weight in my profile, no go.I've been messing around with it doing all the usual troubleshooting nonsense, next step see if support can help. I'll update this review if I make any progress.
