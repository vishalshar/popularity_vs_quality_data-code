Enjoyed the item for a couple months as it is very handy to leave in the bag I carry most due to its compactness, but, after charging my phone I disconnected the cable and the lightning adapter broke off, rendering the item useless!  Very disappointed as this happened just outside of Amazon's return period.  Perhaps Nomad can send me another one, we shall see.
