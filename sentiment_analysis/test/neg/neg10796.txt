At first I was really excited about this product because It smells wonderful and my armpits smelled fresh for a full 24 hours. On day 3 of use I noticed my armpits started to turn black - turns out it burned my skin and is now starting to peel off (as you can see in the picture). I so wanted to love this product because it was the first all-natural deodorant that really worked scent-wise but I had a very strong reaction to it and I'm not particularly sensitive or allergic. It's so sad because it's my favorite scent ever :(
