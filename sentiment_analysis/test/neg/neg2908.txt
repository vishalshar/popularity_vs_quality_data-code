Bought this for my son as Christmas gift. He was so thrilled when he opened the gift wrap! The assemble was ok, took about an hour or so to put everything together and we had fun working as a team. Then it started to have this problem of frequent screen sudden blackout.  We tried restarting, tested it on our TV with the green HDMI cable provided which works out to be fine, tried our own HDMI cable which did not help, then we searched reviews and found out there are other users had similar problem but no clear solution was provided. Nothing helped and the screen keeps turning black. Could be a hardware problem which made the connection super sensitive but I'm not sure. It was very frustrating to go through this, and heart breaking to see my sons face changing from excitement to big drops of tears!! It totally ruined our Christmas morning and I'm returning it.
