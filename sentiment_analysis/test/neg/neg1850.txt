At first I was quite pleased with this product. Screen is big, Laptop lightweight and easy to carry without hurting your shoulder. Having SSD instead of HDD gave it advantage of having fast boot, also it's large capacity (512GB) is one of most important features about this laptop most competitor laptops does not have that large space. Screen is not IPS so it hasn't great quality as some other laptps might have, but it's not annoying at all, for me at least. Power brick is way larger compared to competitor laptops, but it's not a big deal. Fan is really quite consideing aluminum body I don't sense beneath my palms and fingertips.For me everything was fine until I looked over windows Event Viewer and I found out that it's flooded with "WHEA-Logger" Warnings (Picture of them attached) and I think it's source is Intel 520 graphic card. So far I have tried to update graphic driver to newest version but it lead me no where. Considering effort I put to fix with and getting nowhere I began to regret my decision about purchasing this laptop.
