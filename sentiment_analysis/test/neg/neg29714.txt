I purchased the original reCAP Mason Jars Pour Caps as a set of 4 - 2 regular, 2 wide mouth. Those were silver and I bought several years ago. While not perfect, they took some fussing to get them screwed on tightly so they didn't leak. They are great for making salad dressings, flavored oils, other items that you want to make and put in the fridge and the convenience outweighs the fussing of screwing the caps on.These new once most recently purchased (July 2015). The flip tops do not seal well at all - in fact they randomly pop open! They are hard to screw on to keep them from leaking and the plastic has changed to a cheaper material. I won't buy these again. They are more expensive than the last ones as well. :(
