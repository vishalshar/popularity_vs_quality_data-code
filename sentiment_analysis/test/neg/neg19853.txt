For the money? Junk. Less than a month after I purchased the Fugoo one of the volume controls quit working. Before that I wasn't happy at all with the quality of its sound. After I bought the Fugoo I heard a friend's Infinity One Premium and I was floored by the difference in quality between them. The Infinity is twice as much price wise but it's sound is worth every penny over the sound and quality of this (expensive-ish) Fugoo. I'll add that I am something of an audiophile so if you can't tell the difference then the Fugoo would be great!--Except that it broke too :)
