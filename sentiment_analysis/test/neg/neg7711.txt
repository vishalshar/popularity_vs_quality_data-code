I just just bought and returned as it said its UNLOCKED... I have Roam mobility sim and it did not recognize . period. Screen was not good quality. too gray, no dark tones.. Touch was not sensitive enough. Charge cord in the top as opposed to bottom. Very strange and awkward. Sorry. I wanted to like it but .. no way. coming from Samsung and going back...
