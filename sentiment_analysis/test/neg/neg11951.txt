Not sure where those pictures in the product description came from, but they sure weren't from one of these cameras.  I bought this camera to look for insulation problems in my house, and so far, I've been able to tell where a window and door are, but unless it's a large area, or a large temperature differential, I can't tell much of anything.  It's odd, they show pictures of people's faces where you could tell who they are.  I can only see a blurry person that might be my wife or might be a home intruder.  Not sure which.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but for now, it seems like this overpromises on its abilities.
