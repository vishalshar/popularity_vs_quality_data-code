**UPDATE**My old 8MB Dane-Elec flash drive proved very durable (see my original review, below), but I've had a bad experience with my newer 32MB drive. The top part, to which I had attached a key ring, snapped off after only a year of use. Amazon generously replaced this drive with an identical one, which suffered the same fate after only three months. Since there's clearly a weakness in that part of the drive, I've reduced my rating to two stars. The Dane-Elec might still be a good drive if you keep it on your desk, but if you need to carry it around, especially in a way that might occasionally stress its upper portion, you may want to look elsewhere. For the past six months I've been using a SanDisk Cruzer, which--knock on wood--is doing fine so far.**ORIGINAL REVIEW**The Dane-Elec flash drives are tougher than others I have used. Their bodies are a hard rubber rather than breakable plastic, and the larger part of the case slides out to protect the USB connector securely. (The slide is an improvement over the usual cap, which can easily get lost.) I've seen test results showing that this is not the fastest drive available, but I have not found its speed to be an inconvenience. When I outgrew my old 8GB Dane-Elec drive, I decided to go for a 32GB one, mainly because I've come to appreciate its durability. In comparison, other drives now feel flimsy to me.
