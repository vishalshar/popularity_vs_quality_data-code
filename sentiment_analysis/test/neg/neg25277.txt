If you plan on using this with your android phone, please go to Google Play and read the app reviews.  Great concept, but doesn't deliver.  We spent over 3 hours with tech support, just to get it configured, and it still won't let us watch live video from our android devices.  (WiFi bandwidth to the front door 20.32Mbps Down/13.53Mbps Up, so there is more than enough bandwidth.  Tried on both Samsung S7 Active and Samsung Note 5).Even without the live feed, the delay for the motion detection is slow, we have yet to catch the face of anyone ringing the door bell.  All we get are the back sides, of people leaving.We are sending it back.
