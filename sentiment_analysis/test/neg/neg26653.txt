The packaging is great but the doll itself is designed in a bizarre way. Instead of having an actual plush witch hat (with a brim), it's a weird cutout design- like a "stuffed" 2D hat. Why? I've seen plushes with actual hats before. It takes the fun out of the witch by making it not look like a witch at all.
