Out of the box it looked cool and was excited.  i noticed moisture in the sight tube, took the cap off and there was water/moisture inside.  initial inspection noted scratches, gunk in the sight tube (which never cleaned off after running waster through it, the tap connections were loose, and the pressure control on the cap wouldn't stay in some spots.  I cleaned it out, and added water and pressurized.  It held pressure at 5 psi for two days then declined, and co2 was fully expelled after 4 days of sitting (leak?).  to add to the loose fitting neck pipes and tap, there was black silicon showing as if it was being used to keep it all held together. Food safe silicon from china?  ...i dont like to gamble.  Really cool looking, and an awesome concept but poor execution.  No thanks!  especially for $129.00 and when there are better options out there.
