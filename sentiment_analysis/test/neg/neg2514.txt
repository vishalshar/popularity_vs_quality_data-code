I have had the WORST experience with this thing. I've had my MacBook Pro 13" for 2 years and it has always ran smoothly until i installed this thing (which was a hassle to install in the first place because it didn't even work the first time). Tardisk slowed down my computer, and KEPT making me restart my laptop at the point which it just keeps restarting in a loop without me doing anything. The startup also takes longer and transferring from USB drives also takes longer. Terrible product that DOES NOT work as advertised. Stay away.
