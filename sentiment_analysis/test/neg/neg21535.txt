I currently have the 2630, 5029, 5222, and 5020 all of which have pretty good night vision so I was expecting the same from the 935....The night vision on the 935 is terrible, it's basically useless.  The HD during the day is also subpar compared to the other cams that I have from Dlink.  I'm not quite sure what went wrong with this model.  Save your money and don't get this.  See the image attached (720P), maybe mines defective? I'm looking at the other reviews and the quality looks better.
