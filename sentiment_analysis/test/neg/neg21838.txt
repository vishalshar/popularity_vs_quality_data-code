I am disappointed by these. I thought I had found a solution for my 5 year old son, who wants to put his own shoes on, but has not yet mastered tying his own shoes. He was getting very frustrated trying to tie traditional shoelaces, so I decided not to push the issue. However, he also didn't want my help tying them, which was leading to a lot of drama before school. I purchased cheap shoelace replacement spirals from my local shoe store. My son loved them, but they were kind of goofy looking, and only lasted for a couple of weeks before falling apart. I remembered hearing about Hickies, and they seemed like a much better product. When I went to put the hickies on his shoes, they were far too loose...so I followed the instructions for the tighter fit by criss-crossing two hickies. That seemed to solve the issue, and both my son and I were excited to have something that looked good and would save a lot of time in the mornings. They lasted for THREE DAYS before two of them broke. I replaced them, and then one of the replacements broke too. I am more than a little annoyed since these were pretty expensive for shoelaces! We are very disappointed.
