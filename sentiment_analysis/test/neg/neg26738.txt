I started using Automatic 2gen I quickly returned it in when they announced pro.  I really liked this product it's headed in the right direction one problem tho this adapter has caused issues with my Toyota 4Runner & my friends 4Runner.  My 4runner is a 2011 and there's is a newer one.When I started using 2gen and pro adapter my airbag warning light would come out. I thought a issue might be with a lose seat wire etc. After spending money to take it to the shop and pay a diagnostic fee nothing was found. I was able to take it in again and not pay another fee same thing.  I download recommended third party software that Automatic recommend through the app OBD well guess what pro doesn't work with OBD for code reading second gen worked find for me but pro doesn't now.So after doing some more thinking I decided to take the adapter out  BOOM. Once the adapter is removed and my 4runner is restarted the Airbag light goes off.  I spoke to my friend who's having the same issue so there's clearly a problem with the adapter. I love my Automatic adapter but with it causing my Airbag light to come out this is a serious issue and a big liability. According to the techs at the Toyota dealership if the light is on the airbag system will not deploy this is a HUGE safety issue this adapter needs to be looked at I think if someone was in a crash and the airbags didn't deploy Automatic could have a lawsuit on it's hands specially since it's listed its compatible with my vehicle and safe to use
