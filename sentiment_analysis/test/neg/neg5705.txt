This is a horrible product.  I'm sorry I was convinced to even try it.  The powder shakes on your head and clumps together in unattractive lumps if you use too much.  If you use just a little, it doesn't work.  You need to apply hair spray before you use it and afterward too to make it stick into a nice yucky mass.  It came with a sprayer top that I could never get screwed onto the bottle.  I contacted the seller and was told to take off the shaker lid before screwing the puffer top on.  I read that and thought..."No Kidding".  Very unhelpful.  You can get better coverage buying a cheap eye shadow color to match your hair and puffing that on your head with a soft brush.
