I have the compatible helmet so I figured that I'd pick these up.  In hindsight, it was a big mistake. Some of my other Bluetooth headsets don't even compare in quality to this one. The sound is absolutely awful and the walkie-talkie feature is a complete waste of time. These are going straight back. However, for the convenience of fitting it into the helmet, there is some value. Not for $130 though. I would buy these back at 30 bucks max. Not worth more.
