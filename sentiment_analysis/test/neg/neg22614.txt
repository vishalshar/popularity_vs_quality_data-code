This may be a great phone for someone who isn't a lefty. Every rime i picked up the phone I turned on the camera and kept taking pictures of the table top or room.or my, nose or open mouth. The phone worked fine.once I was able to pick it up, remembering where the buttons were. May be a great phone for someone else. it just didn't work for me.
