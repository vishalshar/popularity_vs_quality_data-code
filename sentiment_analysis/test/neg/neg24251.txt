I brought a Tagg tracker pre Whistle. Worked great. Timely notification when my dog left the defined zone. Simple app that did exactly what I needed. Find my dog.  Then Whistle came along and rolled out a new app. This one focused on a pet social network (because it's like doing e-commerce in the 90s! The perfect biz plan). So now you have to wade through a bunch of social network stuff to find the maps and track your pet. In addition to this new, desperately needed, functionality they also managed to turn a once reliable system into a roulette wheel. Notification of a dog escaping happens with in a minute or two up to one hour later. I have a whistle tracker and a tagg, both dogs got out the other day together. Received notice on one dog in a couple of minutes. Over 50 minutes later got the first notice on the second dog. Then there's the new random feature that sometimes when the dog returns you get a notice it's back in the whistle zone. This is nice, however, when you get 30 or so of these notices over the next few hours it's a tad annoying.Been trying to add two family members as owners so they can track my dogs while out of town. I'm weeks into trying this but yet another Whistle bug is preventing us from being able to do this. Working with support but it's slow going with a 24-48 hour turn around on support emails and usually the response is one simple question that will require a followup (there goes another 2 days).Bailing on this product as soon as I find an alternative. They've lost their focus and have proven unable to correct major issues after many months.
