Yet another item that claims to work with Alexa, but the fine print is that you also need a bridge.  I already dropped 200 lucre on your product; I'm not going to pay you 70 more for a bridge.  Even the app 'disconnects' from the lock regularly, and it's a few minute process to get it to connect.  So much for expedited entry.  Major buyers remorse.
