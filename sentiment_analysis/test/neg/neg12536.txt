I purchased these as a cheaper version of a Tilewith hopes that I could use them for a variety of devices,  and was excited to try them with IFTTT.I was upset to find that the accuracy of the devices were not very good,  The ability to use as a proximity notification didn't work at all, and all three devices ceased functioning in just over a month.Instead I purchased an additional Tile. While more expensive yes, the tiles have been 100% reliable, which is preferable to having a tracker device fail when I truly need it.
