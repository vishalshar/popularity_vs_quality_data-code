This is a good quality product it just didn't work for us. Our dogs just both like to sniff different areas of the grass and when they would do this the bigger dog would pull the other one even when he was going potty. The only real complaint would be that it doesn't adjust real good for different sized dogs. When you do adjust it the bigger dog can't really go side to side cause the tether is to short, or he drags the smaller one even more.But we gave it 2 stars cause the quality is good :)
