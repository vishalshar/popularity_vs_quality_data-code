I am updating my review.  I took it to Ecuador and signal is only 3g and really slow, I did a speed test and download speed was under 0.2 my and upload was 0.000....I bought this device since the concept is very good, a device which you can use to have 4g internet in differente countries.  However, I am in Santiago right now and it never gets 4g signal, instead it gets a very poor 3g signal.  Aditionally, it is important to say i nver imagine the heavy weight this device have, which makes it very difficult to carry it in the pocket.
