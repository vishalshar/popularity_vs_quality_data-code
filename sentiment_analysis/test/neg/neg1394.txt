ALL MY PLANTS DIED in less than 1 month of planting it. I followed the instruction, kept it indoor by kitchen window and watered it every few days. Once it sprouted, mold started to grow between the plants and on the popsicle stick. Then by week 2, the parsley and the cilantro and withered away. With only mint and basil left, I tried to take extra care of the plants, but they also grew mold and are now withering away also....Do not buy!
