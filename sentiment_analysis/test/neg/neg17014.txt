I bought this for my wife Oct 21, 2016, for Christmas.  Unfortunately it is now too late to return it.  She wanted something wearable other than a wrist watch.  Spire does not work properly.  It says she is tense when she is resting comfortably on the couch and says she needs to get up and walk around when she is already up and walking around. Utterly worthless.  BUY A WRIST WATCH TYPE DEVICE!  I am not advocating any particular brand, but there are some excellent deals out there.  We have two in this family, different brands, and they both work very well.  The Spire is basically a glorified step counter that doesn't even do that well.
