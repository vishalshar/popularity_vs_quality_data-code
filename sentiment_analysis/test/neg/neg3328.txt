Don't listen to the phony Amazon Vine reviews where people get these amps for free and then say they sound great. Apparently they've never used a real amp before because these Line 6 V amps sound horrible on every level. They use the same sims from the POD X3 days, and those were discontinued over 5 years ago in favor of the better-sounding HD gear, so why Line 6 still thinks they're good enough for these new amps is beyond comprehension. There are much better sounding free amp sims that you can use on your computer. Don't buy into the hype. These amps are absolutely dreadful. Honestly the Spider IV amps are better.
