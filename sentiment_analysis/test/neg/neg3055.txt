I'm thinking this was a knock-off even though it claimed to be from Discovery Trekking Outfitters and sold by Amazon. The quality was poor and the fabric was rough. However, After getting this I ordered another bigger, again claimed to be from Discovery Trekking Outfitters and sold by Amazon and loved it. I am speculating, but wanted to share my experience. If you decide to go with this one know that it is not suitable for a body towel. I'm 5'5" 150 lbs and this thing could not wrap around and just covered my torso to backside. You'd be better off using a tee shirt.
