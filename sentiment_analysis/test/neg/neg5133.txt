Failure.  "Wearable" tech should be wearable.  This thing works when it can stay attached to your body but that rarely happens.  This thing will fall out of it's housing at random times making it worse than useless.  Customer service's answer was "We know".  Great.  You know your product is useless and designed to get lost?  Perfect.  Lets hope the design team is looking for new jobs.  Save your money, this thing fails on a level so basic that a fraud class action suit is inevitable.And, it's happened.  The day I went to check this little roulette gamble in my pocket.  It was gone and, this time, it was I was not able to fund it.  100.00 flushed down the toilet.  No company support.  Do not buy this.  It is an waste of money sold by a company that does not care.
