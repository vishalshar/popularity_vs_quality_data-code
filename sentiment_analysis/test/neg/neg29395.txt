Sounded like a good idea, use the cell phone's screen for a viewing device.  I don't know if the quality of these cameras vary as some seem to be very happy with the results, but the images I got were totally worthless. Even knowing what the camera was looking at was no help. Thankfully returning it to Amazon was an option, so I was only out time, frustration and disappointment that it didn't work.
