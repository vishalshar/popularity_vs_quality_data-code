Overall it is okay for a 720p video with latency when viewing remotely using the MyD-Link Home app. Not satisfied with the night vision when it is  in complete darkness. Happy that the camera served the needs of watching the home for a week then it stopped working (that was when we were away from home!). It defeated the purpose. Upon return, I had to unplugged the camera from the wall and power on/off the camera so that it would worked again. Until recently when I connect my newly purchased DCS-2630L, the DCS-935L just stopped working - where I can only see blank white screen from the MyDlink Home iOS app as well as an error message "Sorry, we were unable to connect to your camera. Please check your Internet Connection, then try again" on my android devices. Sent email to D-Link support with the situation and I have yet to receive any feedback from them. It is only the 5th week since this camera is delivered!
