There are other reviewers who have written what I'm going to say:  these are impossibly tight for a woman (or man) with normal-size feet.  I originally bought them for my granddaughter, thinking they would make a cute stocking stuffer at Christmas.  Boy, was I wrong.  She thought they were the lamest gift she'd ever received.  Not discouraged, I decided to give them a try myself.  The first problem I encountered was how hard they were to thread through my sneakers.  (If there were instructions with the package, they were covered up by the price sticker on the back.)  I finally managed to get them in the holes and buckle them.  These ties are only about 4" long fully extended.  Doubled up as laces, and you have only 2" of very firm elastic across the top of your shoe.  It was impossible for me to wedge my size 8 foot into the shoes at all.  I ended up throwing them away.  Maybe they would work for a small child.  But otherwise they are a complete waste of money.
