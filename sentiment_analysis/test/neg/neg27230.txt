I'll eat them because I don't want my money to go to waste, but they are truly bad tasting. They make my wife turn up her nose, the dog runs out of the room when I open the bottle, and babies cry. Unless these give you some magical superpowers, I'd say avoid these at all costs! All kidding aside, seriously, they are really horrible tasting.
