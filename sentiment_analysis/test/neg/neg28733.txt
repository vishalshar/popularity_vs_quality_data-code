We were very excited to order this. It pressed a lot of the right buttons for us. But the product needs more work before market.Specifically the problems we had were- Playing as just a normal marble maze game (no VR) does not work well. The ball frequently gets caught on the perforations in the paper, forcing you to use your finger to get it going again.- Setting up a maze of a pain. Adding double sided tape to the back of each block and then to the board takes time. Maybe this is what you want if you want to keep your kids occupied for a while. I kind of assumed that the blocks had magnets in them and that it would be trivial to stick to a board. Guess that was hopeful thinking.- The iphone app never capture my maze. We had good lighting (tried many different lights and many different times). The maze it scanned kind of resembled the one we built - but had lots of missing walls and new walls here and there. It never once got the placement of the start and finish tags - and I don't think it caught most of the traps either.- Ours did not come with VR goggles. I feel a little jipped as this was the reason we wanted it - and I see it displayed on amazon page.- We happened to have another google cardboard VR goggle setup - but it would not work with this game since there was no button on the goggles and therefor no way to move.So ultimately the physical unit is pretty useless AFAIK, and the app is completely useless. I am very technical, and play with lots of new toys all the time. I don't have the patience to make this work.I hate to write a sour review, but I think this product was pushed to market way too soon.
