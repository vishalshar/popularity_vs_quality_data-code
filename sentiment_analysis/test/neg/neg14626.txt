There are a few of these products for sale but based on the research and reviews I decided on this one. I think if devices like these are going to be cell based then the accompanying app should be slick and user option friendly (i.e. app should have an option to keep it continuously running).I'm not sure how the company can say, "A Bluetooth Tracking Device for Everyday Life". With all the things going on in my daily schedule this device doesnt make it any easier. The phone app DOESN'T HAVE AN OPTION TO TELL THE SOFTWARE TO STAY ON. You MUST re-connect to the device over and over, and over...so for me that would be 10 or more times a day. Yea, real time saver.So, if the app shuts down on the phone your SOL and you can kiss your keys, the pebblebee, gym bag, laptop bag, etc. you have this device attached to good bye forever.So back it goes. The whole concept is great but still needs a bit more work to call it a Device for Everyday Life. Too bad, I thought this would be a home run; Wasnt even a foul ball : (
