Very disappointed with this. I received my order today and the bluetooth distance is terrible.I tried updating to 2.1, but yet - still the same issue. Also, when trying to play music stored vs. music on my phone - I have to disconnect the bluetooth in order to play the music I have stored on the headphones.
