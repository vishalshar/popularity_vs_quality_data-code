First off...this is definitely NOT as loud as an ambulance...not even close! It's loud enough to draw attention but that claim is just straight up bogus. After having this for 2 months the plastic on the side split and started triggering itself at really horrible times (indoors multiple times before I realized it had broke). It's not something you should keep on your keyring if you want it to last a long time --- but that's where you would want it to be handy in case of an attack...so bummed it didn't turn out to be worth the $ :(
