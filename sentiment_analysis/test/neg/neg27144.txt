Few Pro's- Good Screen- Tactile Buttons- Soft Wrist Band- Good Product Packaging (Plus you get Pebble Stickers, Yayy!!)and that's it.... Everything else with this is watch is a Pain!!!Was Looking for a light and all purpose watch, Pebble 2 SE looked to be a right choice. I ordered the watch from USA, the delivery was super fast and packaging was good, no hassles with that.The real hassle started the moment I Powered up the watch, had to undergo a long and repetitive update process, updating the watch software via wi-fi was not possible, so had to update on the phones data network. Below are the issues one would face after updating to Firmware v4.3 :- Bluetooth connection is patchy, the watch disconnects often- cant' download watch faces, stuck with the stock watch face, getting multiple failure messages- Cant receive notifications on the watch, even if they appear there is a considerable lag- You cannot dismiss message / call history from the watch, getting multiple failure messages- Cannot connect to Android wear (though the Official pebble app suggests you to connect to Android Wear!!)- Battery Drains in 4-5 Hrs (This can be fixed by resetting your device)- Health App :  My basic Pedometer device tracks accurate footsteps than the watch!I am not sure if this is happening because of the latest firmware update (v4.3). Would advice buyers to hold on to their purchase, not a good time to buy a pebble, by the way the Customer Support is Non-Existent!Shame on you Pebble, looting it's customers big time!
