I love the way it looks and I love the pass-through usb-c port, but it doesn't form a reliable connection between my laptop and my external hard drive. I'll be working in lightroom, with my laptop in my lap, I shift my weight very slightly, and suddenly I'm unable to access the photos because the drive has been ejected.. Annoying and potentially damaging to my drive, will be forced to use this only as backup when I need the pass-through usb-c for charging. Disappointed.
