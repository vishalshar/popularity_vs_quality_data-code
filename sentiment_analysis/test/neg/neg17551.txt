So wildly inaccurate, that it's only use is as a questionable piece of jewelry.I guess this a built-in problem with wrist mounted motion detectors, they detect motion of your wrist, not your steps. I'm going to try the Fitbit 2 with an accessory clip that I can clip to my shirt pocket, or just carry in my pocket.I guess I could have removed the band and put this device in my pocket, but I'm a slow thinker and have already sent it back.
