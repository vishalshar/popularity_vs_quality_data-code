I received my Petcube yesterday after over-nighting it.  I spent three hours between trying to set up by myself for the first hour.  Then spent another another 2 hours with support on the phone trying to get it set up.  When setting it up, the cube would not match up with the android app that you have to download.  The green light on the cube remained solid the entire time and it needed to be flashing.  We could not get it to flash. After reading the set up process, over and over, watching the youtube video for set up which was worthless in itself, and having to download the trouble shooting pdf file to go through trouble shooting, then making the phone call to support.  After all this time, and trying to have it set up to view my new puppy during the next day, they told me they would send me a new one but it would take up to 5 days to receive.  They determine the one they sent was ineffective.  So, I am waiting for the new one to show up and see if this one will work.  So much for over-nighting it.  I guess I lost out on paying the extra to get it. AND on top of it all I could barely understand the accent of the person on the phone for support. Unbelievable.
