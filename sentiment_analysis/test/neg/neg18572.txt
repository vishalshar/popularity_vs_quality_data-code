I bought the style above and it is terrible!  You can see during the day, however, at night when I really need it ~ there is a bright light a over the camera and all I can see if feedback from the light.  So you couldn't see anyone unless they stood looked under the light and right at the camera.  Despite that, I bought the Maxium Style Light with the clear shade and it is some better, but that is the ONLY one I'd consider and it still has the delay issues in seeing who's there, that others have mentioned.  Gosh, I hope they get this improved!!!
