When I first installed the August Smart Lock, I was amazed at the possibility of having my phone automatically unlock my door. I also purchased the August Keypad for guest entry and the August Connect to control and monitor my lock remotely. This of course cost a pretty penny, but it seemed worth it for all of the convenience and security I was getting. After a few months, the lock only unlocked automatically via Bluetooth only 50% of the time. Then the battery in the lock seemed to drain faster. I stopped using the August Keypad because it would also run out of battery without warning, locking my guests out. The last straw was when I had given just my regular keys to some guests because I didn't want to risk a lockout while I was away. Something in the lock mechanically failed, and the lock wouldn't open with just my manual keys. I had to call a locksmith who had to drill through the lock to open up my door. I will never use August products again and am sad that I've wasted so much money on the Smart Lock, Keypad and Connect.
