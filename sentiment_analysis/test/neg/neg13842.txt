Gave this to my son for Christmas, got it out of the box and charge it through the night, when trying to connect made all kinds of lights and sounds, however never moved, now it keeps telling me in the app to wake him up but nothing happens, tried 3 different cell phones with Bluetooth and nothing. Sending this unit back and not planning on replacing it.
