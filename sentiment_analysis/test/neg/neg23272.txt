The iMCO CoWatch is without a doubt one of the prettier watches I've purchased - and it joined an assortment including everything from the latest semi-smart Movado MotionX watch to almost all of the Pebbles, Gear S2, Gear Fit 2, Android wear since day one etc...When I heard about the iMCO watch finally gaining Alexa support, I hit buy. Next day, it arrived and I proceeded to set it up on my (new) Note 7. The watch design is really good - sturdy, premium materials, a nice magnetic charging dock. Adjusting the strap was simple, and only needed a small screwdriver to open the latch.Setup took no more than a few minutes, and I was up and running. After that, it was mostly disappointment. The Alexa feature works, but is so unreliable that it isn't something you can rely on. When on the go, the watch needs Bluetooth tethering to connect, and on secured networks, you can connect over Wi-Fi, as long as there is no web portal or other captive portal in the way.The features of the watch are so limited, that you feel like a beta tester - you get extremely basic weather, notifications, steps, heart rate - and that is it. You can't sync steps or heartrate back to your phone, and the weather is just a single screen.But to me, the bit that was the least reliable was Alexa - despite having the watch connected to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Tethering, I had a success rate of no more than 1 in 20, which isn't enough for me to put up with it.Battery life is also dismal - with the always on display, it was dead by 2PM. Without always on display, it made it just past dinner. In both cases, that is not enough to make it usable.
