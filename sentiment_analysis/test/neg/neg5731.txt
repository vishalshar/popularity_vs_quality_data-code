Leaked .. Had to super tighten, so won't be removed to be used as advertised.  US bottle, but cheap chinese caps that have too low quality "seal rings".. They also wern't fitted flat in the grooves.  Were wonderful when they were all made in the us in the past,now will get something cheaper and a bottle brush.  Won't buy these at all in future.
