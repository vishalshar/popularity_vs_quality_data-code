I am getting tired of having my soul crushed with false advertisements like the one on this bag. As I opened the box, I could smell the chemical odor right away and as suspected, the bag turned white upon the "pinch and twist" test which indicates plastick (and god knows what else) WAS added into the product. This is NOT a pure 100% platinum silicone, and I would like to know which European country tested it (if any). If such claims are made in the description of a product, then the customer should recieve such product! These false advertisements have been used on products mostly made in China. Pure silicone has no odor and does not show any signs of white color when twisted or squeezed!
