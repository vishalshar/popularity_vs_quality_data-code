IT SAID IT CAME WITH ALL THE CABLES THAT I NEEDED, WHICH IS A COMPLETE LIE! The cables that it comes with doesn't fit my Mac ports, neither my phone port. Additionally, the remote doesn't work, I don't know if it's because the battery, but it's very disappointing and frustrating that you open the box and you wanna use the product first time and you cannot use it.
