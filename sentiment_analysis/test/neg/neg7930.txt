The only thing I liked about this product is that I can return it. My wife had wanted one for a while and I bought it for her for mother's day. Out of the box it didn't work. She checked the battery and it was good, but would not sync with the app. She tried all of the FAQ'S, and youtube videos, and finally contacted customer support. Customer support was no help. After only having the Bellabeat Leaf for three days, I am returning it. Off to shop for a Fitbit.
