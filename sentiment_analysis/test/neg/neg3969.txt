Too tiny. These bars are not really bars. They're more like nuggets or cookies. We eat lots of bars at my house Zone, Balance, Kind, cliff, power, etc. These are the smallest product I've every run across. I guess should have paid more attention, I didn't realize how small .8 oz per bar would be.  I just assumed they'd be more normal size. Each one is about 2 bites, maybe 3 bites for a female.After analyzing a recent order I calculated that these bars cost $1.4 per ounce. Other bars I ordered at the same time were: Zone (.51 per oz), Kind (.71 per oz), Luna (.57 per oz).
