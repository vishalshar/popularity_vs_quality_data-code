UPDATED: Since Tile keeps deleting my facebook comments and ignoring me, going to drop it down to one star from the three. They say the range is 50-100ft. FALSE. If you're in an open field, sure. If you're in your house 10-15ft. MAYBE. If it's in your wallet or purse, it won't even see your tile. I have a brand new iPhone 6S Plus, so it's not my bluetooth that sucks, it's the product.Improvements could be made. Your phone must be within bluetooth range to find the tile. I have an iPhone 6 Plus and it can't even find the tile when it's on the other side of my apartment. I think adding wifi would be a good addition. Wifi has a much more reliable range than Bluetooth. I also put a 2nd tile inside my wallet, well that almost never works even when it's just a few feet away. So good luck. I probably wouldn't purchase these again knowing what I do now.
