I had seen this on Pinterest about a year ago and was extremely excited when I rediscovered it on Amazon a few weeks ago but after having it less than a week, it's going back. I am really sad it didn't live up to the expectations I had. The leaf itself is great. Cute as a clip, bracelet, necklace. I don't even mind that it isn't sweat or water resistant, I love the look. The app however is where it all goes south. It literally only tracks your steps, sleeping, & breathing. You aren't able to adjust anything if it's off, the sleeping and breathing tracking is slightly inaccurate, and you can't add any of the activity you might do when not wearing the clip. It is certainly Not an all in one place health tracker. It is a great pedometer if that's all you are wanting.
