Still issues with this system.........UPDATE 3 - April 2nd, 2016: I first wrote a review of this product in April, 2015, so it's been installed for almost a year. Initially, the product worked OK, although I felt that a derived "local" forecast (no matter how much science and climatology was used to describe it), was no substitute for a physical rain gauge.Then in late Fall 2015/early Winter 2016, I noticed on several occasions, the sprinklers were running while it was raining (after several days of rain). I was in contact with Blossom support and in March 2016 claimed to know what the problem was with their algorithm.I now have another problem with this system. On several occasions recently, the sprinklers have been set on come on, the iPhone app says "Ran 6 zones at 3:51am. Finished at 5:07am". The light on the controller is solid blue, but no irrigation has occurred - neither can I activate the sprinklers from the app. I have no failure or error indication. If I unplug the Controller and the powerline extender for 30 secs, then reconnect them, I can recover control, at least temporarily.So I'm now wondering if I have a $200 (I paid the initial price for this system) "boat anchor".Unless Blossom can address these issues quickly (and so far that's not been the case), I can no longer recommend this system.
