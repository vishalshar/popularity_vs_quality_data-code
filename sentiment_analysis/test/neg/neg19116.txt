My 86 year old mother spilled some coffee at her weekly card game a couple of months ago. She was so embarassed that she has neen bringing bottled water since that day. She loves her coffee so I was absolutely thrilled to hear of the Mighty Mug. I showed her how it worked and taught her to lift it with ease etc. She really was thrilled to be able to bring coffee this week and also was going to show the mug off to the other old ladies.So I am standing talking to her as she began to rinse it for first time use, and I look down and see dark brown water running over her hands. For a very split second I thought she was bleeding and blurted out "what happened?" Well, she had been looking at me the whole time (so was obviously not in pain or cut) and she looked down and brought her hand to her nose and declared "it's rust".Underneath the orange pad at the bottom it is caked very heavily with rust. When she was rinsing the bottom it flowed out. It was an extreme amount of rust. I have no idea how that happens on a brand new, in the box mug. All the labels were still affixed, the box was pristine, and had no indications it was ever handled by anyone, much less that it was someones return. This tells me that 1. the mug was obviously exposed to water during manufacture, and 2. the area underneath the suction cup - at least on this mug - is not rust resistant. Rust resistance is pretty important for a coffee mug.I have reached out to Mighty Mug and don't know if I will get a reply as it seems others have had no luck. If I get any feedback I will update this review.For now, whether you just received it or had it for a bit, I suggest you check for this heavy rust. By using the sink spray attachment for just a second the rust began to flow. Rinse or spray some water over the base of your cup and make sure nothing flows out from under the orange base.It really sucks that this happened because the mug stood up to every bump and smack test I threw at it. Both my mom and I were absolutely shocked at how well it works. If I can hear back a decent reason why this was an anomaly I will purchase again in a heartbeat! In fact, I will give it a day or two to see if Mighty Mug answers my email before processing the return. because I have a choice for "replace" or "refund" and I need to know which box to check.
