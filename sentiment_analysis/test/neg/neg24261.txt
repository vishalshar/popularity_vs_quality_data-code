Purchased this screen 4/13/15. Once I took the iphone6 phone apart the screen installed fairly easily and functioned just like the oem apple screen. Time went on and ~ 7/4/15 the screen separated from the plastic that holds the screen to the phone, this was not a big deal as the phone was in a life proof case. The separation of the screen from plastic was only noticed when changing cases. 10/5/15 the screen has the back light but nothing else. The thumb print and siri function but you cant see what is happening. Overall the screen lasted 6 months.....dont know if i would buy it again vs going to apple and letting them deal with it for $200 a screen
