waited 5 business days after the "guaranteed delivery date" on top of that my packaging was demolished. the box was crushed and twisted. even the inside casing was bent up. I went to plug this thing in and it doesn't even work for my 2016 MacBook Pro. the USB slots just give me an error. have not tried the sd card slots yet. this thing gets extremely hot, was only plugged in for about 10 minutes. the product also bends when plugged into your USB-C port, very unbalanced and not aligned to the bottom of the laptop. HORRIBLE product would not purchase ever again or recommend it to anyone. Worst amazon purchase I have ever made.
