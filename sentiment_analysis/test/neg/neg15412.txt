The screen is fine. The tools are good. The instructions are very comprehensive. But the protector that comes pre-installed is so fragile that it started deteriorating literally days after I starting using my phone with the new screen. I I had to rip it off eventually not having got more than two weeks use out of it. This really left a bad taste in my mouth because I spent more for this iCracked screen then some of the other options on Amazon so I was expecting a premium experience. It's sad that this badly sourced screen protector has ruined an otherwise satisfactory product.
