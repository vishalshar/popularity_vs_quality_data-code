Typical high tech junk that does not work right. I paired it with a tablet. That works. Then try pairing with the phone. Double beep. Could not find what this means. Their on lime help is useless. For any kind of problem the suggestion is : restart bluetooth , restart phone, remove battery and re-pair.  That is just nonsense. If my lightswitch does not work i do not have to reset my house nor click the breakers. So if i need to find my keys and the device does not react i have to find it first to cycle the battery. By that time i have found the keys i was looking for in the first place. Useless
