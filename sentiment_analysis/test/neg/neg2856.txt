If you have SAD and are looking for something to help, this is not it.About me: I'm a 38 year old female who suffers from SAD and I try to be very proactive with managing my Seasonal Affective Disorder.  I eat nutritiously, I exercise, I get out every day.  I've used light boxes and light hats.  I've tried medication and I have, and still, do therapy.I paid extra for shipping, I was so excited to order my SunSprite after reading four, five-star reviews.  I received my SunSprite Wearable Light Tracker this afternoon and eagerly read the instructions - though, honestly, I have been watching the company for a while now since I almost participated in their crowdfunding but having been displeased with another crowdfunding project over a year and a half ago that I STILL haven't received *cough, cough, FitBark* so, having watched their videos, I already knew what to expect - simple one button operation, powered by the sun.First, the directions:  They're patronizing and useless.  I'm not sure what idiots they think they're gearing this product to but, if you think you NEED a SunSprite, one would think you also know things like, "...improved energy mood, and sleep - are caused by light entering your eyes (not by light absorption through your skin).  So wearing sunscreen does not block the benefits of bright light or affect SunSprite's tracking."  Verbatim.  I know nobody who suffers from SAD who is under the misconception that treating it is like treating Vitamin D deficiency.  Also, seriously, who would think that wearing sunscreen would affect the tracker's ability to track?  Why not discuss something pertinent like, does wearing sunglasses affect your eyes ability to absorb the beneficial light or merely block out the harmful UV rays?  Or, those of us who use light therapy also know that the light doesn't have to directly enter your eyes so, does wearing a hat make a difference or is there enough light from the periphery being absorbed that the SunSprite would still be giving you accurate data?SunSprite's website implies that the tracker measures real-time UV intensity.  Nowhere in the instructions does it mention this feature.The app:  With data as recent as November of 2014, it's estimated that 52% of people use an android phone.  Does this device work with the most popular platform?  Of course not.  No problem I thought, I'll just get the app on my iPad.  Less convenient, sure, but really do I need real time data or just a daily snapshot?  I go to download the app and I it doesn't work with my current OS and I need an update.  Fine, later, I think to myself.  Supposedly I can still reap the benefits of my SunSprite by simply clipping it to my clothes and tracking my bright light use using the LED display.  Hooray!  Out for a walk with my dog I go!  (Although, why they didn't make it so that you can access a user dashboard with a computer, since nearly everyone has one, I'm a little stymied by...)The device:  The device presumably does what it says to but I have zero confidence of it's accuracy because, unlike other wearables, like the Fitbit which allows you to obsessively count your steps when you first receive it to see if it's display matches the reality (it does!), there's really no way to see if this device is really tracking your bright light exposure.  Since I didn't get the app up and running I decided to set a timer to see how long it would take me to get what percentage of bright light.  I left the house shortly before five o'clock PM wearing my functioning SunSprite.  By 5:25 PM, a mere 31 minutes, 31 seconds and .09 tenths of a second later, I had successfully received my "daily, medically proven amount of light to improve my energy, mood, and sleep."  Well, damn it, if that's the case unless you live in a cave or rarely leave your house almost ANYONE receives enough light to improve their energy, mood and sleep.  Even when I lived in Northern NH and worked the night shift I got at least that much strong, bright light most days, never mind when I started using light therapy.  Let me clarify, today was a cloudy/slightly overcast, but warm day and I still logged enough light from nearly 5:00 PM in about half an hour.  That "data" surprised me.  Also, honestly, I had to wonder if the device had a timer so that it reached 100% of my goal in as many minutes as it detected sunlight, instead of really tracking anything measurably helpful.So, do you need a SunSprite to track your bright light and improve your mood, energy and sleep?  I honestly don't think so.  Get out your timer from your trusty smartphone and each time you're outside in bright light (or even bright-ish, like I was today), run the timer and see how much you get on a daily basis.  If it's really overcast, be sure to set your alarm a half hour earlier and sit in front of a light therapy device, following the manufacturers instructions, for half an hour.  Seriously, there are light therapy devices that are far less expensive than this tracker.  (and almost certainly more useful)I'm MOST DISAPPOINTED by the fact that, per SunSprite's website, their home page proudly declares this to be a, "Light therapy engagement solution for depression" further stating that, "Measuring and analyzing bright light to manage energy, mood and depression, maximizing treatment effectiveness and adherence, thus reducing cost."  If you suffer, as I do, from SAD and depression and get at least 30 minutes of bright light daily in some form (natural or via a device that delivers 10,000 LUX), the only thing this device will do for you is make you look a little dorky and lighten your wallet.PROS:*Lightweight*Magnet works well - even tested with a down coat.CONS:*Poor directions*Device tells you basically what your eyes can tell you - you're getting bright light.  I don't need flashing LEDs to tell me this.*Doesn't work with an Android device*Doesn't work with a computer*Device alone does not track UV exposure*Feels sort of cheaply made - I could easily see the rubber that attaches the magnet to the device breaking, as well as the button for operation of seeing what percentage of light you received breaking since it's flimsy and thin or the clear face getting scratched and potentially affecting it's tracking abilities (if it even has any).*There are no recommendations for how much bright light someone with SAD and/or depression needs (versus just the general population's guideline) either on their website or in the instruction guide because, honestly, if 30 minutes really would improve my life I'd be the happiest person on the planet because I often get much more than that.*It's bigger than a Fitbit.*  It's dorky looking and must be worn prominently - so you can either be sure you'll get questions like "What's that?" or those who know what it is will know that you suffer from SAD and/or depression - nothing subtle about it in the least.*There's no way to measure if an increase above the 100% goal that they set for you will improve your mood, energy or sleep.  In fact, there doesn't seem to be a way to adjust your goal at all.*If you don't have an iPhone, you have to manually reset the device each day - let's be honest, those of us who suffer from SAD and/or depression aren't necessarily the most chipper or functioning of people so the idea that one will remember to reset it is somewhat far-fetched.SUMMARY:  For someone like me who's so proactive in improving their health and well-being that was excited to reap the purported benefits of this device to want to send it back and give it ZERO stars if I could, you have to really reconsider purchasing this device.If you're a doctor and thinking of recommending this product to a patient.  Don't.  Unless you think they are lying through their teeth about using their light therapy, this device won't help them.  It will, however, make them feel distrusted, more hopeless and wonder why this disorder isn't better studied so that we can get some relief.  Support a SAD researcher or something.  This product is useless and an insult to those who suffer from SAD and depression.I should also add, I don't normally write reviews.  I am just that outraged at the lack of thought that went into this device for a segment of people already suffering that, if my review helps even one person, I'll feel better because, if you're like me and you DO suffer from depression, fatigue and poor sleep then, not only will you be disappointed by what the device promises vs. how little it delivers, you're also likely to not have the will or the energy to return this item.
