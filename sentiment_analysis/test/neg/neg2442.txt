I ordered two bottles and one of the bottles I order contains discolored vitamins. I don't feel safe feeding them to my child. I stored them in the same cabinet as the other bottle and those were fine. Thankfully I knew what they were supposed to look like! The discolored ones are on top, the good ones are on bottom.
