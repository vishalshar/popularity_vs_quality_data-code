**UPDATE**6-24-16Mine died. I bought the cilantro and basil and they both died. At first the basil was growing and doing great but then it completely died. So disappointing and upset I spent $20 for these and they were expensive for freaking seeds that didn't grew as advertised. Another poor money wasted choice made. Just a head up, Go to a garden center and buy these herbs. Cut the basil and put them in water. They'll grow like crazy! :)Oh I was also promised a replacement but never received them. I wasn't too concerned about getting them due to my address/where I live, but don't say you're going to send me replacements and then don't. Empty promises!!!Don't. Buy. This. Product.
