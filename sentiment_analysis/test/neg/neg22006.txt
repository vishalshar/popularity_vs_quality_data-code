This router produced the same results in download speed as all other high-end wireless routers with only 1 device connected at 20 ft away. In fact, my ASUS RT-AC66U Dual-Band Wireless AC-1750 Gigabit Router is better than this. I subscribe to high-speed digital cable at 150Mbps. I usually get 190 or better. Top download speed through Portal was 40Mbps and average wis 32. My ASUS AVERAGES 35Mbps. I checked my wireless adapter and the deiver was up-to-date with potential of 130Mbps. So, I went to the only website provided in the package, clicked on support, and it was just the technical log. But there was no email to send it to, no number to call, even after a Google search. I then noticed a technical support option through Amazon. Jennifer was very helpful and exhausted all option for me wit no result. I am so dissapionted as the video presentation of this product was what I've always thought a router should be. Maybe my expectation of a router to supply 50% of wired download speed is delusional.
