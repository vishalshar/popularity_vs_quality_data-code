I think most cd players these days have a slight curve to the entrance of the CD slot (at least mine does)....this means that the devices just slowly slips out and falls off over and over.  I opened it as wide as I could without being concerned about cracking my car but it still slipped out every time.  I think the idea is a good one, just needs better constrution or a longer insert part into the CD slot.
