Neat idea - 11 year old daughter loved it, but unfortunately the watch (or battery) part seems to have died already.  I plug it into USB and it works as a Minecraft multi-platform USB drive, but the button to turn on the display doesn't do anything anymore.  While charging, it shows the Battery/Plug icon, so they display works, but it just won't activate for showing time or the animations.Edit: Docked another star.  The company replaced the previous defective band and it worked for a short while and then also ran into the same problem eventually.  I'm not going to keep going back and forth with them for replacements.  I'm just chalking this up to "live and learn".  This thing isn't ready for prime time.
