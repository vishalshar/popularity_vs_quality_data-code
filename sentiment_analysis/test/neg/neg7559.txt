This product is nice looking, but way too big for me. Also, I wanted this watch to be able to leave my phone behind and not miss steps. Even still, it is almost 2000 steps behind my phones step tracker every day, and I don't have my phone on me as often as I did before. Another thing, the health mate app, it only syncs when it feels like it. I may not get my sleep activity until noon if it doesn't choose to sync.Overall, I'm disappointed in a product I was highly recommended to. I am considering returning it.
