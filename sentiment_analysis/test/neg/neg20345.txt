I feel like I should preface this by saying I'm not a person with joint issues, or muscle pains/issues .. I'm just your average early-30ish person.The conditioner itself is pretty decent.  I really like the scent and the feel of it.  It's a thick formula, so I need to use quite a bit of it since I have long hair, but that's to be expected, as I'm a woman with long hair. The formula doesn't do anything magical to my hair, but it's a conditioner, not a unicorn, so that's also to be expected. It does the job.The combination of the thick formula and the ridiculously thick plastic bottle makes the conditioner nearly impossible to even use.  You have to squeeze the bottle with such force just to get a tiny blob out.  Storing the bottle upside down doesn't help it "flow" out or squeeze out any better.  It is especially hard to get product out after you've gone through about 1/2 of the product.  It's completely ridiculous.  I shouldn't have to fight with the bottle just to use the product.  What a horrible waste of time.I do not mind paying extra for a good product, but only if I can actually USE it.  The packaging makes it extremely difficult to use.As a person with absolutely no joint issues, muscle issues, etc, I found it very hard to get the product out.  I can't even imagine what it's like to use to older individuals, or individuals with joint pain, arthritis, muscle issues, etc.This product/company touts itself as being "natural" and "good for you"... maybe they should go the extra mile and be good to the environment too.  There's absolutely no need to have such thick, useless plastic as packaging.  The company might even save some money if they changed their bottles or switched to a tube.All in all, it's OK. I am leaning towards 2 stars because of the packaging that renders the product hard to use.  I will be searching for another conditioner to replace this one.
