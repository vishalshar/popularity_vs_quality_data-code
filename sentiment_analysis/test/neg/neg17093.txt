Updated review: I am very very disappointed with the quality control of this product. I bought a single one through Amazon and a pack of 5 directly from TrackR. The single one from Amazon never worked quite right and would not register or connect unless the phone was right beside the unit. (see original annoyed review below) When I got the five additional ones, actually ordered before the Amazon unit but took much longer to ship, I was more pleased with their ability to connect with my phone and actually sound the tone on the unit. But not more than a week after I began using the one on my keyring it stopped working and wouldn't connect with the phone. I tried replacing the battery and it didn't work. The other four in the pack, including the spare I now have on my keys, work just fine. A track record of 1/3 broken in less than two weeks does not speak well to the quality of the product. I just hope my other four continue working so this was not a complete waste of money.Original review:Will find the keys if they are sitting on you phone.......other wise forget it.What a piece of crap. This is a joke. I have to be right on top of the tracker with my phone before it will register and then it says it is close by. Under 6 inches is not close by it is right there. I put it on the dogs collar. The dog is sitting in my lap the phone is resting on the dogs back and it reads one bar and then starts searching. And the beeper can't be heard unless you're wearing it as an earring.
