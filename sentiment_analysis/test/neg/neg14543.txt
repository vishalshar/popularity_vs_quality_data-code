This toy is TERRIBLE! There's nothing good about it. Not easy to use for my kids. The app is ridiculous, it's difficult for the family members to use and it doesn't even work appropriately. The toy doesn't get all the messages and the toy doesn't notify the child at all. It plays the sams old messages for days without updating. I think the people leaving good reviews must be friends with the people who created this toy or got paid for it. I'm very good with technology but I couldn't be more disappointed with this "toy" my kids were very frustrated on Christmas day trying to make this thing work. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!
