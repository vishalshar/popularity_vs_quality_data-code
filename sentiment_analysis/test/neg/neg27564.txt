There is no documentation and the Leeo website is pretty sparse on information too. My original Leeo detected alarms, but the light ring didn't work properly and the temperature/humidity sensors didn't work.Since there was no documentation and no answers on their website, I opened a support ticket. I think it took me about 5 days to get a response and then a few emails back and forth to clarify the problem, but then they said it was defective and sent me a new one immediately. My second Leeo seemed to be working better. I like the product, but I wish there was better documentation and more support on their website.Update: Second Leeo heard something on TV and thought it was a water alarm. False alarm, but at least it is listening. But it is supposed to send a sound clip to your phone so that you can verify if it is an real alarm. My phone got an alert, but no sound clip. Their support people said my wifi wasn't strong enough. I have a wifi camera in the same area that flawlessly streams video all day, so I don't understand why Leeo couldn't transmit a short sound clip. They suggested I move it higher on the wall using an extension cord (my IP camera sits on the floor and the signal is fine). Not a reasonable solution.Update #2: Today I tested my smoke detectors without first telling Leeo that I was testing. I assumed it would alert me, but no. I tried two different smoke detectors in close proximity to the Leeo and it didn't respond to either one.Overall, this product is a good idea that is being sold long before it has been debugged and perfected. I can understand a few minor bugs, but a life saving device should work well for its primary function before a company begins shipping. Mine appears to be nothing more than a fancy night light.
