I ordered this so I would not lose my keys.  The idea is great.  The first one I bought would not ring the Chipolo and would not stay connected to my phone. I called tech support, they said it was defective, and I returned it to Amazon for a replacement.  The second one came in the mail and I was excited.  It won't stay connected to my phone, so it is useless for me.  I am returning it for a refund.  I will try another device my a different manufacturer.
