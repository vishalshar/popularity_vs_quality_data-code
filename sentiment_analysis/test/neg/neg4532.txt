Looks cool and charges. But it doesn't work well as a car locator. On android at least it requires high accuracy mode enabled which kills the battery. If it worked with the battery saving gps it would be a lot better. Also it doesn't connect everytime. That was annoying when the car was parked twice today and it shows it as being disconnected two 2 days. Great idea, wish it worked.
