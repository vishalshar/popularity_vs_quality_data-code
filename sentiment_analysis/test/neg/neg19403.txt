Unusable, I tried using this about a month after ordering it.  The material seems partially cured though far from expiration date listed on the packet.  The consistency is slightly crumbly and if you fold it over it doesn't even stick to itself, really doesn't stick to anything at all, feeling quite ripped off right now.
