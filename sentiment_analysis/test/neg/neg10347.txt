Waste of money. I bought this device few weeks ago and it gives me completely wrong readings of stress levels. E.g. I was in a meeting where we had a difficult situation to solve that has been causing stress for all of us for months and Spire detected it as a calm period. Later, when I got home and was reading a book on the couch for an hour, it notified me that I was stressed and should take a few deep breaths. Maybe they will update the app soon and it becomes better, but so far is a disappointment :(
