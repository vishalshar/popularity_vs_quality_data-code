As of now I'm giving this bulb a 1 star.  For the price I expected the bulb to work out of the box, but the violet/purple color is red and the blue light does not work at all, and the bulb goes dark instead.  I'm going to try and get it to work but I believe the bulb is B/O.I also did the latest firmware update.  If I can't get it to work, I'm shipping the ilumi back for a refund.
