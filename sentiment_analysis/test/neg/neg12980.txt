First they don't disclose that you need a data plan for automatic to work. Then, if you have a problem it is not possible to contact anyone for a solution. You have to wait for someone to respond to a problem, and then forward you problem to someone else. Meanwhile you are left in the dark. Very POOR customer support.  ok, finally got crash alert working, discovered in web search that you can send a email to help@automatic.com. a shame this is not on their tortuous web site. Then of course unable to add emergency numbers without the same circus. Also, if you add a landline for a contact, you must use the help support procedure. Again not published on their web site.
