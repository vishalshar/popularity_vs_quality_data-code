A HUGELY disappointing no-grow. Neither side grew, nothing. I've raised my family's food organically for 40+ years, including mushrooms, so i know how this should work. Thought this would be fun for the grandkids even though it's pricey. Maybe it was old inventory...if so it should have been identified as such.
