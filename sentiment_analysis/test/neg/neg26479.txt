I bought the AnyMote to work with my Echo.  On that front, I have been able to get it to turn the TV on and off about 10% of the time that I ask it to, but I have not been able to get it to execute any other commands.The only reason that it gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that it works OK as a universal remote for my iPhone.  My home theater components are either sony or samsung, but the AnyMote does not support the models that I have, which results in the remote not supporting all functionality.  On top of this, there is very little online support for the remote.  A lot of work is required before this will deliver on what it promises.
