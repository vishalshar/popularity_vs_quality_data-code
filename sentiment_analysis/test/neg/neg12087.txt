I bought this Ottie Bike Mount so that I would have a more effective way of carrying my iPhone 6 (in Otter Defender Case) on my frequent mountain bike rides. In fact I purchased two of them, one for me and one for my daughter. She likes to record video on her iPhone 6 while she rides so this appeared to meet her needs. On the onset, I was rather disappointed by the quality of this product. The plastic is very cheap and flimsy and although it does work for the intended purpose, it probably will not last. Halfway through the first ride, my daughter's mount was already having issues with the spring loaded bottom holders not staying engaged. Although it did hold my phone somewhat securely and snugly, there was a constant rattling sound coming from what sounded like very cheap and flimsy springs moving around on the inside. I took a couple of videos and the rattling is quite annoying.The design and concept is very good and the mount that fits on the bicycle is fairly sturdy. It is the sliding mechanism that holds the phone in place that is very suspect. The material used and the spring tension just seems too light and flimsy to stand up to the constant vibration. I can see this product being OK for light use for putting around the neighborhood or attaching to a baby stroller but not for extended trail and mountain bike riding. I am going to keep using mine until it breaks and try and recoup my investment. I will probably add a rubber band or something around the frame to serve as a safety strap to keep my phone from flying off.Overall not worth the $34.99 plus shipping. I will find something more rugged and durable when this thing finally does break.
