I am a student on the go and I simply can't remember when to drink water. So when I saw this, I was pretty damn excited.Bought the thing without a second thought. Reviews were bad but I thought I would give it a try.This cup sucks, for many reason.Pros:looks cooltells you when to drink watercharging station is pretty niceCons:the cap is extremely hard to open. It is so hard to add water into the cup.The lid is not tight. water leaks from the edge. The vessyl needs to be upright the entire time = I can't put my bag on the ground.super hard to refill but takes a couple vessyls of water for me to drink enough water.You know, I think I will buy the h20pal... it's an actual bottle.
