The product itself is small and convenient, however trying to get any customer service from the company was impossible.  They answered the first time to activate it and take my money, then would not answer again.  We tried for almost two weeks at various times throughout the day.  My mother fell yesterday while wearing the device.  Thankfully she was not hurt but nothing happened, no call, nothing.  We paid extra for the fall alert.  I would not recommend this to anyone until there are some major changes made in the customer service/alert side of this business.  The web site given also failed to work properly, would not activate the unit or allow us to address our concerns.  I am sending it back and hope for a full refund on the "service" and price.
