I have (relatively) big feet, I wear a size 12. These were too long and when I put them on my shoes they were super loose and didn't lay flat and frankly looked really stupid. I have no clue how they would manage to work comfortably on a pair of shoes unless they were enormous and allowed the laces to be put on with little or minimum slack.
