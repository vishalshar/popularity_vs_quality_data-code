We've owned a ScoopFree Ultra for 4 months now and we loved it.  We rescued a 3 month old kitten and when we brought him to his new home, we were worried about whether he would jump straight to using this system or would need a transition from a typical litter box.  To our surprise, he had no issues and has used it perfectly since day 1.  Then our most recent shipment of ScoopFree Litter Tray Refills arrived, which included a new plastic liner to prevent leaks...This is great conceptually, however, as all cat owners know, our little furry friends like to cover their waste after going to the bathroom.  Since the liner is not permanently adhered to the cardboard below, when our cat goes to cover his poop, he scratches the edge of the lining up off of the cardboard.  Then the litter crystals get trapped under the liner, which creates a bulge that the automatic scooper can't scoop through, and BROKE our entire system!  This had happened when the first tray of our set of 3 was due to be changed, so I changed it out and it didn't break the scooper, but this time it was 5 days into using this second tray and the scooper is now completely bent and scoops the wrong direction and the tray is useless, as now it is way less effective at scooping and leaves much of the feces trapped on the other side of the scooper.  At $15/tray this is completely inexcusable and if the trays are all going to be made like this in the future, I will have to return the entire system and go back to a traditional litter box.I love the convenience of this system and really hope that PetSafe fixes these trays ASAP so that we don't have to go back to a manual box!
