This stylus would not pair consistently with my ipad air running iOS 8.1.1. It also did not function correctly at all in Pro-create (would not work as the correct tools it would think its an eraser, etc.) even though other Stylus such as Wacom and Adjonit work great, and was flakey EVEN in the Fifty-Three Paper app (their own app).Following Fifty-Three's troubleshooting was no help. The firmware was updated to 74. I restarted the pen, it was fully charged (to green light), restarted the ipad, restarted both (a separate time). And while now and then I could get it working, the kindest and most gentle description was completely flakey.Seeing so many glowing reviews (of which I can only assume that fifty-three paid the reviewers, though I have no proof of this), I was terribly disappointed by this piece of junk made in China.Whether they have terrible drivers, can't keep up with iOS updates, errors in their firmware, or just a bad product overall--I cannot tell you why this stylus is so terrible, I can only recommend that you stay as far away from it as possible. The product is ALL hype and no substance.
