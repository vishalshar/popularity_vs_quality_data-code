WHOA... This is a terrible projector! I have tried many Pico Projectors. I know it may be hard to believe with all these glowing reviews (I find them suspicious). Here is the KICKER: THIS PROJECTORS ENTIRE EXISTENCE IS DEPENDENT ON A CHEAP .99cent REMOTE. THATS RIGHT, IF THE REMOTE BREAKS OR YOU LOSE IT. ITS A PAPERWEIGHT!, NOT ONLY THAT... the MicroSD card doesn't read all the formats it says it does, and you cant even buy a remote! Also the menu system is about as attractive as MS-DOS... no buttons on unit, your forced to awkwardly point this cheap remote controller, which is flimsy at the projector.  BUYER BEWARE I sent it right back!
