I would not recommend purchasing this item or the seller OnHand. I was disappointed in the product. I was unable to get a decent volume from speaker and it was not convenient to operate. The item must be removed from the shower daily to recharge. It must be manually turned off via a tiny switch underneath a rubber flap which doesn't close very well to keep the unit dry. Upon submitted a return order, the company did not respond for two weeks and then send me what amounts to an address to ship the item back and RMA number. They did not pay the return shipping which was almost 1/3 the cost of the item. The product may be ok for some but I was not happy with it or the response to my return request.
