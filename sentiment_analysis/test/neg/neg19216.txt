Not sure how Amazon has these at 4 stars when all the verified purchase reviews basically say they're junk. They cost more than kontrol freaks and they're basement manufacture quality useless trash. Like every other review here mine didn't work. It wasn't the "stops", they fit around all sides of the button including the space between the trigger and its upper 'rest' and keeps them from fully returning to their starting position, essentially holding them down. This froze the controler completely(all buttons) in Dishonored. I tried to thin out the top part but the button was too loose inside the thing.  When I shimmed the space at the bottom they seemed to work for a second until the button came off. Theres no way I'm going to stop the game, unmount the controler so attaching the thing and shimming it doesnt result in a bunch of random button presses, and reshim and reattach the stop every couple minutes. I think the review ratings are high from shills or something, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, THESE ARE USELESS.
