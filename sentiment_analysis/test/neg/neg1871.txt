North a good buy. The USB ports are bad and a lot of times I have issues getting devices detected in any of the USB ports. I have no problems using the same devices on my macbook air. Also, the ports are too tight and it's really hard to remove the plugged in device. You have to hold the adapter tight with one hand and the take off the device with other.
