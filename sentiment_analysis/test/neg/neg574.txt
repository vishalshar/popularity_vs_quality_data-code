My 1st day with it. So far I can't say anything too bad about it. It's just a bare bones no frills phone & seems a bit flimsy but works fine. The only problem I had was getting into my voicemail where normally you just hit 1, This you have to set it up first & I didn't know what number I needed to call to get to my voicemail but found out from my carrier to just dial your own #.& of coarse your password after connecting. Duh me. It will give you a menu when you hit 1 if you want to set it up for connecting to your voicemail then just follow the prompts to get it set up or you could just put your # in your contacts & get to it that way too. I tend to destroy phones pretty regular & tired of it draining my wallet, this price doesn't hurt so bad & if it holds up good will buy another for a backup.Update... Now that I've had it for a couple months, changing from 4 star to 2, I don't like it much anymore. It has very weak reception & drops calls or breaks up in places I never had trouble before & has very low volume & no control of it, can't hear anything if there's any background noise. I'll have to look for another phone & use this for a backup, this is too aggravating.
