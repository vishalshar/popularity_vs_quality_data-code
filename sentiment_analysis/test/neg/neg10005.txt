I purchased two of these, one as a gift and one for myself.  Both had issues.  Both have very "touchy" taps.  If you throw them in either directions too quickly, there is a good chance they will not activate.  Also both produce way too much head in the "pour" operation (i.e., pulling tap forward).  I own the original and it does not have this problem.  I think they choose a lower quality pump this time to cut cost.  They made some quality of life improvements (I like the heavy base), but overall I can not suggest this model.
