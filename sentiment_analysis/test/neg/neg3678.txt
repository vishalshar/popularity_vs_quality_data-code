VERY difficult to set up...despite wasting several hours, it still doesn't work.  I am certainly not a technical genius but have done many set ups designed by engineers for engineers.  You shouldn't have to be a Microsoft technician to get a consumer product to work.  i would beware of this product.  i am going  to return the two I bought until they improve their interface between the engineers and the consumer.
