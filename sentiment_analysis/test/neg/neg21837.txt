Bought these thinking I would use them to eliminate tying shoes during transition of triathlon.  The product offers various ways to "lace" up your shoe depending on how tight you would like them.  After various tries, I settled on the loosest possible way.  Everytime I slip my foot into my shoe, at least one of the "laces" pops open, and inevitably I spend more time trying to get it back together than I would have if I just had regular laces.  I'd like to note that I have women's size 8.5 shoes...pretty average size...maybe they work for kids shoes?  Will be solution to cut down on transition times, as this product was a fail.
