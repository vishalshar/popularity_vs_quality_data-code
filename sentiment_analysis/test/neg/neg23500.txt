I was excited to give this to my 4 year old for Christmas until I looked at the app store to get it working. Only Apple and Google stores. When I contacted the company to see if the kids fire tablet from amazon is compatible they told me no. So if you have an Amazon tablet period point blank don't buy it. Great concept but limited platforms that it will work on.
