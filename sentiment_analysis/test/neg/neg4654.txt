The Doodler 3D Create Pen was a disaster for me. I had previously purchased the Doodler 3D 2.0 pen and had used it till the orifice would not emit any material. So, I thought that the new, improved Create Pen would be an obvious improvement. Not true. A jam on it and I removed the pen tip orifice to clear the jam. In the process of clearing the jam and re-attaching the pen orifice, the threads apparently stripped. No way to get the tip back on the pen. As such, the pen is useless. Both pens are now residing in a local land-fill.Â 3Doodler Create 3D Pen
