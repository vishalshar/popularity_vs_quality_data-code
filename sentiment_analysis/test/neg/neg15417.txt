This screen is cheap and not worth the high price point. After 3 weeks it began to separate at the sides due to cheap adhesive. Now the screen is dead. Emailed customer support and they could care less. Stay away and just get a real screen replacement from Apple if you're going to spend this much. That's what I was going to do but I'm deployed in the Middle East... Talk about inconvenient.
