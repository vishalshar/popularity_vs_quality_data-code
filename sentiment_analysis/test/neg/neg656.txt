My goal was to use AnyMote in conjunction with my Amazon Echo to control my home entertainment setup with voice commands. Since it integrated directly with the Echo, it seemed the obvious choice. However the integration is poorly implemented. Even when the commands were sent correctly to the device, they would often not work as intended. So without Echo integration, you're left with a very overpriced and inconsistent IR-blaster. At that point, it isn't worth the money. Use a Logitech Harmony remote instead.
