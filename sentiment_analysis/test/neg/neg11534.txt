Stylish.Added to the review after several months of use: Downgraded from five stars to two stars. It is stylish, but it is unreliable. The app doesn't work properly, and the customer service is HORRIBLE. Don't even bother trying to get assistance, it's not worth the trouble you will have to go to.Update after 1 year of use: It won't even hold a charge for a whole day now. And customer service is less than useless. The won't help you unless you've saved all of the packaging the item came in. DON'T BUY THIS!!
