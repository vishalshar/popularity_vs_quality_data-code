Aesthetically pleasing kettle. Unfoturnately the handle bubbled and loosened on the 4th use. There was plenty of water in the kette, the flame was set to Medium and fully contained under the kettle. I have no idea how a kettle like this could be made of whatever material the handle is. Thermometer is great though. Returned it, or rather asking permission to return it.
