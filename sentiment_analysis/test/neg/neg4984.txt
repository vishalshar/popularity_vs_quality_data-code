I am posting this based on trying to set these up.  At first it makes sense, I paired with 2 separate phones to test and 1 out of 5 communications went through.  I have to say not having clear directions is a huge issue as ours are just not working the way they should be.  It also seems that they disconnect each and every time you phone switches to a lock screen, which I'd think is rather inconvenient.I do think one of the pieces is broken, it has a completely different "feel" than the other one.  The face is rather flimsy and pressing it to talk does not function the same way as the other.  I purchased 4 of these so I am going to try and set up the other pair to see how they work.So far, unfortunately, these are very expensive duds...Will update when I hear back from Orion Labs about the issues.UPDATE: I have tried to set up the second pair and the app on one of the test phones will not connect to the microphone, I have now spent 4 hours trying to get these set up and am beyond annoyed and dropping the star rating further. I spent $400 on these and they are already a pain in my *** and I haven't even applied them to the work environment yet just testing.
