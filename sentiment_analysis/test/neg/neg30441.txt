I don't typically write reviews, but I feel compelled in this case. Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this product. It won't last you 3 months (trust me - I've tried twice).Good:It works as advertised and is extends batter life significantly.Bad:There is a mechanism on the right side of the case that is used to press in on the 'wake' button. It is attached by a small piece of plastic, and flexes along that piece in order press in. After a very short number of uses, this piece of plastic will break (I thought this was a fluke the first time, so I bought another one - then it happened again). Once this piece of plastic breaks, the case is now useless.It's honestly very sad that I am forced to give this case an extremely poor review because of small oversight in the design unrelated to the point of the product itself. They hit a home run with the battery, aesthetic, and bulkiness. But what's the use if the weak link is a piece plastic that breaks after three months?A redesign would be extremely easy and little cost to the manufacturer. Please fix and re-release product. I won't be buying - but at least you may not lose future customers.
