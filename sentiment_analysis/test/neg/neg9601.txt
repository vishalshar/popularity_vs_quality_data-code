I rarely write a review. But, this product was so disappointing. I was really excited to get the Pebblebee Honey for my wife as a Christmas present. She frequently misplaces her keys. Unfortunately, it has never worked. We have never been able to connect it to either of our iPhones. Contacted customer service via email (the only option given) and they said we got part of a "potentially bad batch of product" and asked us to send the MAC and serial numbers from the device and they will check in to it and be able to fix it. Needless to say, that is the last we have heard from them in the last 6 days. Time to send it back. In my case, bad product and even worse customer service.
