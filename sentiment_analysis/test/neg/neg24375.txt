On paper this bulb is great.  In practice its wifi aspect is falling short.I was able to set up the bulb on my home network and control it fully via the android app.  However the app failed to 'claim' the bulb and it never connected to the cloud account.  Also, the 'dim on' feature did not work  (powering from 0-100% in a set time interval)I worked with Lifx support and verified that my home router had the proper port open and assigned to the bulb... to no avail.  After days of trying i returned the bulb.what i found aggravating (and unacceptable for a bulb costing $60) is that when the app failed to claim the bulb (even though it was already on my home wifi network) there was no info or error message pointing to the cause of the problem.  For a software driven device this is just primitive.note:  i have Comcast cable internet with my router set to default security... nothing arcane that Lifx couldn't (and should already) know abouti will keep looking for a similar solution that works.based on the percentage of dissatisfied users on Amazon i hope Lifx goes back to the drawing board to fix these issue  (mostly connectivity related)
