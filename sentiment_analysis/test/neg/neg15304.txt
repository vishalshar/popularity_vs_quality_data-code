No advantage for signal strength at all.  I'm really disappointed.  This was purchased since I am a sales rep with a large territory and routinely encounter "dead" spots or weak signal areas that lose reception.  Using this for three days has shown no signal improvement at all.  The case requires a micro USB for charging and doesn't want to charge by cord.  I actually have to take the phone out of the case and charge the phone and the case indpendandly. Will be attempting to return / refund.  Very disappointed considering the cost of the case.
