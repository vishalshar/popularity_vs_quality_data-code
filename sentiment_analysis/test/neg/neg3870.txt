No matter how big you think this bag is, it's smaller. I want to love this bag so much but it's too small, not enough storage and the GPS tracking is ultimately BS. It's good for tracking as long as you have a bluetooth connection to it. If it gets gate checked and put on another plane you have no advantage finding this bag over the guy that paid $28 at Wal-Mart for his.The USB ports are awesome. The sleeve for a laptop / tablet with a USB port is awesome. I love the pocket for the tech but it's not hard backed so if you pack a little heavy in the main compartment it makes getting your laptop / tablets in or out difficult.No spot for shoes that makes sense.The scale isn't accurate at all and after having it, it doesn't make sense why it is even on there. You can't check this bag. Period. It's because of the batteries / tech. Weight restrictions are typically only for checked bags. The Bluesmart is so small you can't exceed weight restrictions if they exist. Maybe if you are hauling around gold bricks or something but if you're doing that, you aren't travelling commercially more than likely.If / when the price drops to around $150 I would get it, but at $350 + buy a name brand suitcase, a quality portable charger and a Tile. You'll save money, have a lot more room and you can check if you don't feel like dragging it through the airport. I just can't find any compelling reasons to recommend this bag. I'm sorry Bluesmart, I went in so hopeful and with an open mind but it's just not worth it.
