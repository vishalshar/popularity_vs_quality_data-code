This seems like a very handy product, and many people will probably find it comfortable. Unfortunately, I cannot use it.  The product description says it fits coats of all styles and sizes. I beg to differ. I am 5 2 and weigh about 113 pounds. The heater is too big for me to wear. There are three heat pads  connected via a band that contains the wires. This band is not adjustable, and when I put the device in my coats the band bulges uncomfortably. The product description says it is 6 by 3 by 9 inches.  It is actually 38 inches long. Each of the pads is about 6 inches wide, and there are about 10 inches between each of the pads.I dont know how tall the smiling woman on the product page is, but it would be interesting to see how the Torch fits inside her coat. The Torch would probably fit most men and larger women, but if you are on the small side you might not find it acceptable.One size does not fit all
