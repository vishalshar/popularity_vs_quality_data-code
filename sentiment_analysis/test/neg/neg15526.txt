First watch was DOA.  Amazon replaced now just outside the 30 day return window the watch stops for no reason.  Replaced battery still doesn't work properly.  Rysynced with iPhone several times.  Now the reset button (which has never worked as advertised) just popped out while I was wearing the watch (irretrievably lost).  This is a $450 watch!! It's garbage.
