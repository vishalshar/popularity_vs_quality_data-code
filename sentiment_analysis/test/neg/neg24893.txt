For $60 on Woot/Amazon, I thought "why not?".  I've known about Lytro since a couple of years ago when the buzz was starting to build up prior to their first product launch.  I thought the premise of a modern implementation of light field photography was really interesting and very exciting.  The first cameras (this one) were very expensive.  I'm not sure it ever really caught on since I've never seen one used and these cameras are now on Woot (basically clearance).The good things:* Camera is lightning fast to start up (practically instantaneously).* Fairly easy to use controls (note: zoom is on the silicone above the screen, not the screen itself).* Updates for the software and camera firmware installed easily and quickly.* Interesting shape and gets people curious when you are taking pictures.* Software has features for adjustment, playback, and even 3D (red/cyan, or double picture).The bad things:* Even on optimal sunny outdoor shots, a lot of pictures still didn't turn out well.  There is a bit of bleeding between shadows and light, some of the eyes of of my subjects would turn into blobs.  Pictures still look soft.* Indoor shots and outdoor dusky shots yielded grainy photos.* Perspective with trees is messy.  This can be understood as tree branches do not line up uniformly in a plane.* The vast majority of the pictures you take don't even come close to what is seen on the Lytro website.  Don't be fooled since those photographers have probably set everything "perfect" for a good Lytro type shot.  I still don't know how they got such good resolution on those pictures as the resolution on my pictures seem like they were taken with a 1 MP camera from last decade...* Lytro turtorials and products are centered on the Illum.  This product is practically forgotten already.* The lens cap is neat, but the magnet is too weak and it keeps on falling off when you put it in your pocket.In the end, I, like many others on Amazon who have reviewed this camera, feel underwhelmed.  I haven't decided if I should return this camera or keep it as a "toy"... a curiosity item.  Maybe the Illum is much better since it seems to have about 4x the "resolution" according to their website.
