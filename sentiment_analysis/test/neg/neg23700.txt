Based on the many good reviews I was hopeful that this product would work, for me it didn't.  I don't suffer from a significant amount of psoriasis, just some spots on my face and under my arms.  I didn't use the cream for 3 months as is advertised on the bottle because after only 3 days of using it my psoriasis spots flared up and spread even more than before I started using the cream.  The same thing happens if I use just a standard white moisturizing cream.  Since a lot of the positive reviews seem like folks had quick results, I didn't want to commit to three months of potentially flared psoriasis on my face just to be certain it doesn't work.
