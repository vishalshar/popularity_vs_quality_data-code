Garbage.  I have had 5000 routers and I am tech savvy.  There is something strange about this router. Only connected with the secured connection great deal of difficulty.  Couldn't input a manual password.  Kept defaulting back to the kisslink password.  Then when I tried to search the kisslink website through Google Chrome got some kind of a warning message.  Very strange.  There is a website on the Internet showing that 40+ percent of the positive reviews on this on amazon look fake.  I have to say the signal was very good.  The whole security issue and the clunkiness of the process weird me out.  I am going to wait a while until there is more broad based feedback and reviews on this item before I return it.  If it turns out to be legit, I will try to start it up again.
