Bought it as a Christmas present for my grandson.  Made sure the battery was fully charged before giving it to him Christmas day..  Unfortunately, it was a failure.  Would go forward (or backward) a little distance then just fall over.  Would only respond to hand gestures about 20% of the time.  He was really disappointed and I felt bad about it.  I meant for it to be a "cool" and fun present from grandpa.  Maybe this one was defective.  Don't want to take another chance.  It's going back and I'll just take him to the store to pick out something else.
