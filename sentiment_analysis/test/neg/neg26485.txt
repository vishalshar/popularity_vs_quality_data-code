I really wanted to like this lunch box.  I researched it a lot and felt confident purchasing due to all of the positive reviews. Sadly, though, this has not kept any food hot for us.  I've followed the instructions to a tee, and tried warming up the insulated portion several times with varying degrees of hot water and every single time my daughter comes home and tells me the food was cold.  Maybe we received a faulty one? Anyway, this would be fine for cold foods only.  But the whole reason I purchased was for the hot food portion so I'm really disappointed. Am going to try to return.
