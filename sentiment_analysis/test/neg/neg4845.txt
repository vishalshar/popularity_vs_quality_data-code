It came when expected-nice packaging.,, enough products for containers .., so that's where I have to stop.., I ordered 2 sets to get all the herbs.,, both had 1 mislabeled each set,,, so I have no idea what I will get... No I didn't contact seller because it was too late.., me and grandson had fun planting anyway!!!Yes.. I probably -maybe would buy again ..,
