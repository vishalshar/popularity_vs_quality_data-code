I don't need a swanky pair of expensive headphones for my daily commute. I just need something to get me from Point A to Point B. The price point on these were great. 40 bones. I can't hate on that. The sound on these things was decent, and was what to be expect for the price. The unfortunate thing about this design is the hinges where they fold. I'm not sure why they made them like this. The aluminum seemed kind of flimsy. They would have been better without this feature. The left ear hinge bent yesterday after a month of daily use. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. I just put them on my head and it decided it wanted to bend the other way. I'm not sure if it's even worth contacting their customer service to see if these things are fixable.So, if the headphones didn't bend, I would have given them 3 stars. They are a decent set of headphones for 40 bones. But since they malfunctioned, they get two. These things happen. I'm a little bummed out about it, but I'm not sweating it.Outdoor Tech OT1900 Los Cabos - Wireless Bluetooth Headphones (Red)
