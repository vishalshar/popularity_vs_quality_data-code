I purchased this item on November 7th. The device failed with light usage after 6 months. I have tried re-plugging it in, resetting the device, checking for shorts in the cabling and am unable to resolve the issue. I wrote their support email asking for them to help and have yet to receive an email back after a week.  I would have liked to received help, but at this point it would be easier to purchase from another vendor. Very dissatisfied in support and device.Â gLink turn your smart phone to garage door remote
