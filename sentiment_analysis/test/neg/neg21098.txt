I have always been fascinated with the mechanics of sleep.  From 2012-2013 I had the Zeo headband sleep monitor, which was a dream!  It helped me optimize my sleep and the manage the daytime factors that affected it.The Good about the Withings Aura: the nightlight and music as you drift off to sleep are nice and the smart alarm is gentle and effective.  I also like that it records the fluctuations of temperature in my bedroom.The Bad: Once you get through the frustration of the set-up process, there are glitches.  The recording stopped several times (maybe my wifi?) resulting in incomplete data and after a month the Aura stopped recording my sleep altogether.  I had to unistall and reinstall the app.  In addition, I don't think the data is accurate.  My Zeo would show 4-5 regular 90 minute cycles of sleep (see photo, top section is Zeo). With Withings Aura it looks like I have 9 or 10 cycles of sleep over the course of 6 hours (bottom portion of photo).  Also, if I'm lying still in bed watching a video or reading, the Aura records it as deep sleep.  How then can the app truly measure anything?  This product, like many other sleep monitoring products, simply measures movement.  The Zeo recorded sleep via electroencephalogram (EEG), the electrical activity of the brain.Conclusion: this is a hefty price-tag for something rudimentary and inaccurate.  I regret the purchase.  If you want a similar product for fun, save your money and get Sleep Like an Android/upgraded version for $5.00.  It measures movement because you place it on the mattress next to you.
