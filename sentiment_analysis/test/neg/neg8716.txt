This is 700wt which would be good for an office break room to warm up food. I do not recommend this for home use.I purchased this for my husband who took a job in another state. It was much smaller than what we thought it would be. We can't fit a standard size dinner plate in it without having to turn it diagonal to get it through the door. It is very noisy and not very powerful. What would usually warm in in a minute takes at least 2 minutes+.
