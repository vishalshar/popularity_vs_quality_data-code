I bought the Dash just about a month ago and they are already non-functioning. I have contacted Bragi and they have made me do two different types of updates to try to fix the problem and nothing has worked. I have spent hours trying to fix their broken product.Unfortunately these earphones haven't worked well for me from the start. When I run with them I cannot stream music from my phone because it cuts out every few seconds. I then loaded music onto the built in hard drive and that worked fairly well but I find the touch controls to be very difficult to get correct. I then swimming with them and found the right earpiece to be totally unresponsive in the water. One day after swimming with them they stopped syncing with one another. Since then I have spent the past week trying to troubleshoot the problem through email with Bragi. I definitely do not recommend these headphones.
