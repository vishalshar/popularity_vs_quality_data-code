This is so expensive. True, it makes application of dermaflage much easier.. But I think it is not worth it. If they weren't disposable, I wouldn't mind the price, but they are for one time use only! So that sucks.I'm trying to use my dermaflage without these tips... Takes quite a bit of practice, but it can be done..
