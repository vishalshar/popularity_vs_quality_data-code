Does not work on my Samsung Galaxy S5.  Manufacturer website states it IS supported on this phone.  However after purchasing, the app just crashes as soon as I plug in the device.  Launch the app again and it keeps saying to plug in the device...  Which is already plugged in.  Looking deeper into the manufacturers support site, I find a post saying that the device does not work on the S5 with Android v5.1.1.  Which is what I've got.  Sending this back since it does not work on my device.Also, if you have the charging port cover still on your S5, you really have to bend it out of the way (unnatural bend -- risk breaking it off) to get this thing to plug in.  Workaround would be to buy the extension dongle, but then the camera just hangs off the phone on a cord and becomes a 2-hand device.
