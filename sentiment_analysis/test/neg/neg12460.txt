I have an iPhone 6.Regardless of the position of the phone (horizontal or vertical) it just doesn't feel too secure. I feel that when I tap the screen with my finger to open an app, that it might slip out. Maybe I'm comparing it to the super tight clip grip one I have in my car attached to the window, but I'm not too thrilled with the lack of textured grip provided by this RIF6. The pictures provided look awesome hanging from trees and poles and such, I just don't have the same level of confidence with doing that with my phone.
