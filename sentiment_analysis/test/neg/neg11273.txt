Less than a month in my shoes and they are breaking.  Also would have been nice to have various sizes, you don't need such long ones near the toe that you do at the top.Keep your money and look for something else.  I am 67 and pretty much a couch potato in front of my computer not like i am doing an Ironman.And to think I bought 4 pairs....ugh.
