june 30 i got an email reminding me to replace the battery, i watched the video and followed it step by step, during opening it wasnt as easy(took me several attempts and my hand started to hurt), now that I'm trying to close it(tried every possible way) still its not yet closing, really frustrated and dissapointed!!! and i tried to return the product since i think its not worth what i paid for, the return time has expired, why should i be penalized for a difficult product, if i knew it early on i would have returned it immediately
