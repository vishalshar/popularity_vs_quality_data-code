Really glitchy product.  I love spotify and I was excited to have a relatively cheap option to play a higher quality music without having to plug in my phone at my stereo.  It was relatively easy to set up.  The steps are not confusing but getting the network to stay was the problem I had.  It would show 4-5 bars and excellent connection for my wifi but then would tell me there was not a network when trying to setup so I would have to go through the whole thing again.  Once I finally got it set up, the network would last a couple of days before it was not recognized again.Seeing some of the other more recent posts, I have decided not to utilize mine anymore.  I don't like creating a whole new open network for all to utilize, even if it is short range.  I thought it would be transmitting over my current network but mirroring a network and not having it protected even with a minimal password is unacceptable to me.
