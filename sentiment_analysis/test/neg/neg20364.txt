I just ordered these and tried to put them in my 11-year-old son's men's size 9.5 Nikes.  Right away it was clear that they wouldn't work in the top holes.  So I then fastened them in the bottom four pairs of holes.  Unfortunately, when he went to slip the shoes on, the top Hickie unlatched.  I tried stretching the top Hickie and had him try to slip the shoe on gently (what kid ever does that?!) but it still popped open.  Obviously these won't work at all for him so we will be returning them. And I had been so excited not to have to nag him to tie his shoes.  Disappointing.
