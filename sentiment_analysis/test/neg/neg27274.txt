My baby likes eating from these spoons; however, it looks like with every bite he is scraping off some of the clear coating (silicone?) on the bottom of the spoon. He got his first 2 teeth when he turned 4 months, about the same time when we started introducing him to solids. I noticed that the spoons have been catching on his teeth, and when I looked, sure enough--there were scratch marks on the bottom part of the spoon and even some of the clear coating was missing after several uses. Yes, these spoons are soft on baby's gums and he likes them. But I don't think it's very good for him to eat some of the coating, even if it's a miniscule amount... I don't recommend these spoons if your baby has teeth.
