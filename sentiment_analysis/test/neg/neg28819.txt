I followed all of the instructions (pre-soaking and placing in the correct location) and a little over a week later some mushrooms started to bud. Unfortunately, that is all that happened. The mushrooms budded and never grew any more. I noticed that the soil seemed to be rather dry so I flipped the box around to start the second crop. This time I increased the frequency of watering and had the exact same outcome. It doesn't seem as though all of these Oyster Mushroom kits are created equal. It seems as though some of the kits work and the rest of the kits do not. Unfortunately, I received a kit that didn't work.
