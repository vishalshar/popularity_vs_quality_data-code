I was very disappointed with the Leaf.  First of all, I found its tracking capabilities to be very limited.  It more or less tracks when you're active, but it can't tell the intensity of your activity.  I was hoping it would be able to tell the difference between running and walking, but it can't.  It has a feature to remind you to be active - for instance, you can set it to vibrate once an hour if you don't move.  The problem is that it apparently can't tell if you're moving.  For me, it buzzed every hour no matter what, even if I was getting up and moving around.  In fact, in the evenings it couldn't tell when I went to sleep - I usually do a bunch of house cleaning around 10pm, walk my dog around 11pm, and go to bed at midnight.  The Leaf arbitrarily decided that I went to bed at 9pm every night and slept poorly until midnight.  So the activity tracking was pretty useless.  In fact, I have apps on my phone that track my activity far better than the Leaf.I was also excited by the stress prediction function of the Leaf app.  Unfortunately, this was also really disappointing.  All it does is judge your susceptibility to stress based on whether you are meeting your goals for activity, sleep, and meditation.  So if you meet your goals, the stress meter is low.  If you don't meet your goals, the stress meter is high.  That doesn't really tell me anything I don't already know.  I wish you could give different weights to different activities.  For several days, I met my activity and sleep goals and not my meditation goals, and the app said I was barely susceptible to stress, but the truth is that meditation (or lack thereof) has a much greater effect on my stress than activity or sleep.  It's also annoying that you can manually enter activities like yoga or running, but you can't manually enter meditation.  If you want the app to know you meditated, you have to use the app to track your meditation.  There are other meditation apps that I like a lot better.It was a nice idea, but ultimately the Leaf didn't do anything for me that Runtastic, Endomondo, RunKeeper, Calm, Omvana, and a bunch of other phone apps can do.
