Initially I thought this was a really good idea for my keys....since I lose them all-the-freakin'-time. It was easy to set up and worked just fine at first. But the darn thing turns itself off (to conserve power? I dunno) so when I actually lose my keys....it's off and therefore of no help whatsoever. Meh. :(
