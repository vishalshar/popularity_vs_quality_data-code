Good idea, doesn't work as advertised.  7 of the 8 units I received worked fine.  1 blinks but emits no sound.  Emailed company, they said to take out and put back in the battery, "solved" my help request.  I had already tried the batter trick, did it one more time anyway, still no sound.  Other than that one unit, the others all make noise when requested.  Not a bad deal just with that ability, and the app is ok.  Easy to sync and figure out how to use it.This was initially really cool.  You really can find the chips when in BT range, and see on the app map where the app last "saw" the chip.  But....something doesn't work - the crowd sourcing feature.  I had my wife sync a chip and then put the chip in my phone case.  Theoretically, since I have BT on all the time, she should be able to see my location any time she wants on the Trackr app, allowing time for updates to go through my app, the Trackr server(s), to her app.  Nothing doing.  My app is on, BT on, she has never received a location update on the chip in my phone case.  She can only see it on her app when I am within BT range.  So, the crowd sourcing function is non operational.  This is the main feature that make a device like this worth the money, and makes it worth it to keep your app on the background and BT on all the time with the intention to help other users that one time they hope someone like me will cross paths with something they lost.  Will be dropping off for return tomorrow, unfortunately.  I had really hoped this was a working thing.  Sounded great.  I hope the TrackR charlie(?) is more successful.
