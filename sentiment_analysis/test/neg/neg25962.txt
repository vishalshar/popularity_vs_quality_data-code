Come on guys this won't fit on any Ibanez SR series basses and probably a bunch more, even with the L adapter.  Why make that an L, pointless.Start putting, "device will not work on recessed guitar inputs".  It simply does not fit.  UPDATE:  tried this on my new fender jazz with plug on the side.  It's works great BUT, it comes out!  It pops out every now and then just enough to cut signal, that's HUGE design flaw.  So doesn't fit on recessed plugs and doesn't work on edge plugs.  Othe than eliminating like 70% of all guitars, it's fine.  Going back.
