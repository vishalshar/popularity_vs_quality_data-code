August's advertisements show this product to be fast, reliable and high quality, however the truth is far from it. The doorbell cam regularly fails to stream video, and on occasion doesn't deliver doorbell notifications. When it does work, there's so much of a delay that you'll be lucky if the person hasn't walked away from your door by the time you answer. Don't waste your money on this product, look into alternatives or wait until the market matures.
