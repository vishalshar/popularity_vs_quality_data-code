This  might actually work well enough with an iPhone 6. Unfortunately I don't have one of those. Image quality is surprisingly good at the price (I do own a "proper" dermatoscope and I'm a physician so i do have a comparison). The "universal mount" is cheesily made however. A plastic contraption like that reminds you of a consolation prize at a carnival. Even if it would work to begin with (it didn't work properly with either an iPhone 5 or or an iPhone 6 plus) you wouldn't trust it to last for a day without falling apart. The two stars are for the optical aspect. The app could be improved also. Just taking a picture and saving it could be made much more simple.
