This is a 3 week update to my previous review.  Sadly a number of problems developed that led to me sending the unit back.  All issues appear to relate to poor bluetooth function because when this thing is working properly the sound is excellent.  I started to notice the unit would "cut out" and lose the signal even when the phone was in close proximity.  You should be aware that if you take the bluetooth source into a back bedroom the speaker will likely lose the signal as well.  I paired my wife's iPhone to the unit and it went well, and the unit played at the time, using the music from her phone.  However, each time we tried to make it work subsequently we could not get the unit to pair at all, and it would not pair with my son's android phone either.  So we concluded the bluetooth unit was faulty and returned it to Amazon.  I've yet to have a wireless radio work well, in my experience, so I'm going to move to a dedicated two channel audio setup.
