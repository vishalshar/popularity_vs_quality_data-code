I have begun the process into looking for a refund for the TrackRs I purchased. I have never been so disappointed in a product before. I can have the device sitting right next to my phone and it cannot be found. I purchased four of them and they all work in a similarly bad way. I have taken the batteries out and reset them ,completed the suggestion of turning off additional Bluetooth devices, nothing helps. I purchased these to help my elderly parents with the items they keep losing and I can't see that these devices would help in any way shape or form.
