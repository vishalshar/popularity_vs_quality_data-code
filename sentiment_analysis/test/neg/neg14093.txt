This seemed like a brilliant idea. Only problem is when my daughter moves the whole contraption tips over. I also don't really like that it leans on her chest while she eats and there is always one green leaf obstructing her view of everything. Instead of this I use a stuffed animal to hold the bottle when I can't. Will keep this and try again when she is a few months older, she is 2 months now.
