The lock was easy to install and mechanically works fine. The app works OK to lock/unlock, but the auto unlock hasn't worked for me (the auto lock works fine-it's just a timer...).My big beef is that this is the HomeKit enabled version; and after 2 hours of screwing with it with no success, I called August tech support.  I was told that Apple required a software update to the lock that wasn't available yet for security reasons...and there was no expected date when it would be available. So, I have a lock that I paid extra for the HomeKit capability that does not actually work with HomeKit.Even once August fixes this, I'll leave my review as is; do NOT ship a product with KEY features that DO NOT WORK out of the box! It's like Ford selling me a truck that has no steering wheel and promising to fix it sometime in the future...
