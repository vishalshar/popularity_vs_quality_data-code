I'm a home automation junkie. I have all the lights hooked up, multiple echoes, and am generally willing to put up with betas or other difficulties.Not only is Anymote difficult to set up, but even if you do go through the pain of getting it configured, the transmit distance and vertical broadcast is so short and narrow that it is incapable of turning on my sound bar and set top box, each of which is 3 feet apart. Standard remotes seemed to do it, and I am hugely disappointed.
