I ordered this for my 9 year-old-son as his main gift from Santa for Christmas. The packaging was probably some of the best I have seen and it really is quite appealing to both kids and their parents. Items are clearly labeled and I don't think I've ever been as impressed by an unboxing of an item as I was with this product. However, the battery is placed in the charger and it seems as if either it is defective on arrival or it becomes depleted packaged this way and you cannot recharge it once your receive it. I contacted UBTECH and their 24/7 a few times at different times only to get a recording with an answering machine...not quite a 24/7 support line. I also visited the UBTECH website and saw an FAQ related to this issue that suggest re-seating the battery up to a few times. I did this without success. I also contacted UBTECH on FB and got a response promising to get someone to contact me. Within 24 hours, I was contacted by UBTECH via an email support request I sent stating that they would send me a replacement battery without any further questions.  I asked when it might happen. I was told a couple of days later that they would send me a tracking number when they got the battery sent to me. I sent a follow up email a couple of days after that and have not heard back from them. In the meantime, I contacted Amazon and arranged to have a replacement sent to me as the one I received obviously isn't working and unfortunately...this other product has the exact same issue. Of all the things to go wrong with a STEM product that costs close to $200, I would not expect it to be the rechargeable battery. I am extremely disappointed with what I think could be really a fun product for my son to work on. At this point, unless the battery comes in and it is obvious that it works, both kits are getting sent back. My concern is that even if I get a new battery and it just happens to work, what will stop it from getting depleted and not working shortly thereafter when I can't return the product to Amazon?
