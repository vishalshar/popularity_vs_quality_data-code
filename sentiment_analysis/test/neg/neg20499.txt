I am not sure this product was engineered for the DJI Phantom 4. To guard the gimbal properly, It should be mounted on the bottom of the landing skids. However it will not stay snapped on if snapped on the bottom. If it is snapped onto the top of the landing skids it would come off and hit the gimbal with a hard landing. I had to find some gummy glue strips to hold it onto the bottom of the landing skids.
