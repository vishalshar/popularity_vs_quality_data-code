Wanted to love this, but could not get any mushrooms to grow.First attempt: Soaked for 12 hours, sprayed 2 times per day for 14 days.Second attempt: Soaked in rainwater 24 hours, sprayed 2-3 times per day for 10 days.Absolutely no growth. Very sad, but would be willing to give another kit a shot if I could get it replaced. Could not locate an email address for Back to the Roots.
