All of the "laces" are the same size. That means that the "lace" you place at the toe of the shoe is the same size as at the opening. Anyone who wears shoes knows the opening is larger than near the toe. You can criss-cross and make these a little tighter at the toe, but there's nothing you can do to make the top any looser. Thus the shoe is tight at the top and loose at the toe.This product looks good in pictures, but pictures aren't reality.
