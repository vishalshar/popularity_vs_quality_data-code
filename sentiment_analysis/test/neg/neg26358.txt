I was unable to get this working at all. The setup app first told me to login to the antenna by choosing its WiFi network. I did that, and when I returned to the app it froze up for about 30 seconds. It wouldn't respond to button presses or anything else.After that it asked me to choose my WiFi network. Unfortunately it never detected my WiFi network. I let it sit there for a few minutes, and it never detected it. So I rebooted the app and started the process over. That didn't help.Then I rebooted my iPhone, rebooted my network equipment, rebooted the antenna, and tried again. It still didn't work. My WiFi network is working properly, and there is a strong signal, but this app simply won't see it. Anyway, this is too much work for a new product, so I'm returning it.See the attached photo for what the app shows me.
