The Roadie failed to meet my expectations.  I followed all of the directions and it did work a little, but when I started tuning the G string on my 12, it broke three.  I then changed to a 6, thinking it was having a hard time with the 12, and the same thing happened.  I get to the G and it broke two more.  At that point I tried to contact the company, but there is no phone support.  I used the text support option and no one ever go back to me.  I returned the Roadie.
