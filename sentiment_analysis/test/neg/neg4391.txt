I had trouble getting this device to work well. The sound didn't function well, and there was a significant delay in the communication making it difficult to play with. The connection kept dropping and needing to me reset. It might well be related to wifi connection, but I can't be sure. I was disappointed that it would only connect to visible wifi networks. No way to choose one which doesn't broadcast it's availability.
