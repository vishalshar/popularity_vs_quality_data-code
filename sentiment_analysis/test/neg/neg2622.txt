The good:-Easy to read indicator of what it thinks is overall air quality.-Pretty appearance.-Easy to set up (could be much worse).-Powered via USB, no tricky cables are needed.The bad:-The app is beta quality: buggy, slow and confusing; each version is becoming worse and worse. Why? No idea, honestly. Notifications are mostly annoying and "learning" doesn't seem to teach the unit anything. History is hard to read, the main screen is cluttered, but there's a "useful" built-in quiz. WTF?-Not very accurate, but ok for home use as long as you're ok with this fact.-No integration with other products/services (not a very big issue).Overall:It's not bad, but as with most modern Home Automation/IoT products, software part drags it down. Sensor accuracy might be better as well.Looking forward to Awair and other competing products.UPD: removing one star.
