The good:  The product does exactly what it says.  Packaging is professional, instruction are well written and easy to follow. The molding process worked for me easily the first time.  In addition, the refitting process worked as advertised.The Bad:  I bought these to wear while riding a motorcycle.Sound Quality: Very poor regardless of the tips used.  When you spend $60.00 for ear-buds I think you should expect to have above average sound quality.  For me, the sound didnt have enough highs or lows and I would compare the sound to first gen iPod ear buds.Used with Helmet:  I have a Shoei  RF 1200 and while the molded buds stayed in place when putting the helmet on, getting the helmet off was a unique situation that almost destroying my ears, the helmet, and the buds resulting from getting caught on the neck roll.  The issue for me is the same issue I have with any ear buds that stick out from your ear and catch on the helmet when removing it.  I do have a pair of Sony buds that are very short and dont stick out very far from the ear and they do not get caught on the neck roll of the helmet.I really wanted to love these.  Sadly, that is not the case.
