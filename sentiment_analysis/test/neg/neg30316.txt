I bought one of these for my father for last Christmas. When I gave it to him he was excited to use it and all. We used the blender one time and it was great. We then went on this trip where we had to put it on a golf cart and it was full of drinks and stuff. Someone didn't drop it when it was being unloaded but it sorta hit the ground somewhat hard. We then tried to use the blender and it didn't work! everything else did. The blender was the main thing that won me over on the product and since it hit the ground a little it broke! SO BE CAREFUL IF YOU GET IT
