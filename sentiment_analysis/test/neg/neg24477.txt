I really wanted to like this, but after 10 days I really think it needs a total redesign.Pros: Lightweight, easy to forget it is in place.  Good packaging.Cons: In the "standard" attachment position (shown in the photo), all pictures taken will be 90 degrees off.  The auto-rotate feature only works on the app.  The app only works on Android and iPhone based products.  The app does not always auto-rotate correctly, especially if there is a vertical line in the photo (the app thinks it's the horizon).  The moment autoplay does not have the ability to control the speed (at least on the Android app).  It really needs an on/off switch, other than "set it down on a flat surface or put it in a pocket"  I normally delete a large number of pocket photos.  Does not work well if the wearer is moving (I run, but not fast).
