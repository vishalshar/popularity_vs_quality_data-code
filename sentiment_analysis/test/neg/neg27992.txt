I HATED this stuff for several reasons.  First, the smell was overwhelming--like something had rotted in the bottle.  Second, the product went on ok when my hair was wet, but when my hair dried it made my hair feel horribly greasy--almost slimy.  It was impossible to style my hair (make it look nice) with this stuff in there.  Third, for what you are getting, this is way overpriced!  It is comparable in quality to the stuff you can buy at the dollar store.  GROSS.
