Got the kit for my kid, who is very interested in mushrooms and fungus and gardening.  We followed the soaking and spraying directions, and after a few days had...  tiny little maggots.  Kid was so eager to see mushrooms, so I went on a daily maggot-killing spree to keep them from falling out of the slits and crawling all over the house and becoming whatever bug they were destined to become.  After about 10 days, had...  bigger, longer maggots.  Again, kid was so curious to see what mushrooms looked like when they sprouted, so kept up the daily maggot massacre.  After 2 1/2 weeks, had to leave for a week-long vacation, so I gave the thing a final misting, sealed it up in a ziploc, and returned a week later to find a huge mass of white mold and a bunch of dead maggots.  At that point, even my kid was too disgusted to keep it.
