Posture correcter: This is what caused me to get this over other fitness trackers, but for the most part it does not work. Even when I purposely hunched it was not detected. It would randomly detect is hand in my pocket, but I had purposely put there to keep it warm. It would also radomly detect when I was walking with my phone, which was just annoying as I wanted to be using my phone.Fitness tracker: Pedameter didn't seem really accurate. Sleep tracker was off by hours on most nights.Messaging: This is the only feature I liked about the thing.App: Terrible app. I used this tracker for a week and one of the days I couldn't access the app at all because it said I needed an update and would just re-route me to the app store- however, no update was available.Overal rating: It's aesthetically pleasing, but overpriced. I would recommend eliminating the posture correcter feature as it's inaccurate and annoying and instead focus on just making the fitness tracker and app better (and reduce the price by at least 50%)
