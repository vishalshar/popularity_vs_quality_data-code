I recently purchased this item and the company appears to have changed the recipe/ingredients.  The new recipe is not good.  The previous recipe with one egg, 2 tsp vanilla and 3 tbsp oil was perfect. They also seemed to change some of the ingredients and took out the Arrowroot etc.  The box I got called for 4 tbsp oil, which I thought was too much. Long story short, the cookies were a disaster in taste and texture.  Please bring back the old recipe/ingredients.
