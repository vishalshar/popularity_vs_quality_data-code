I bought this as a used/refurbished "Amazon Warehouse" deal. It came and had an "Amazon Inspected" sticker on it. I'm curious as to what they inspected.It was missing two of the three mounting options/plates/connectors (huge deal, as it was missing the option that works for MOST doors/locks). It didn't have batteries (not a huge deal). It was also missing the instructions (not a huge deal as you can get on the internet).The lock WAS missing the mounting option that I needed - but that was OK because I had the mounting connector from my old non-HomeKit Augst lock.Got the lock installed - went to calibrate - and it didn't work. It would halfway lock, and then sounded like it was grinding. Updated the firmware, same problem. I tried about 10 times before taking it off.Amazon Inspected? Not sure what was inspected. Everything was wrong.
