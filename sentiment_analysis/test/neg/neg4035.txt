My daughter received this set for her birthday.  We were previously unfamiliar with the Roominate toys, so I was really excited and encouraged to see positive reviews on so many of their products.  Unfortunately, we haven't had the same positive experience as some of the other reviewers.  These are hard to snap together and don't stay together at all.PROS:- Durable plastic pieces- Motor works fairly well for light piecesCONS:- Very difficult to snap together.  When my daughter was having trouble my husband and I tried to help.  We also had a hard time getting pieces to snap together again and again.- Doesn't stay together.  Structures are...fragile.  Once you build it, playing with it is almost impossible.  It falls down with the slightest touch!- Walls/Rugs are just pieces of paper.  They won't last.Last night my husband and I were watching TV after the kids went to bed.  Every few minutes we heard a small crash.  We finally figured out it was this house falling apart piece by piece...while it was untouched across the room!For the price and what you get, Legos are a much better option.  They stay together and you can actually play with them!
