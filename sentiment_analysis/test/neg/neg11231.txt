This cheap piece of garbage, worked for two beers then wouldn't pump for the third beer. So cheaply made. They say they use sound waves to create the foam, but I highly doubt that. Judging by the two way handle and the small size of the actual mechanical size of the product, I bet pushing the handle back just pinches the tube to cause the beer to foam. I'd buy another for about 35 bucks, but I'd never pay $150 for it again to take a chance on it. For 150 you'd figure something would be made of metal and feel solid, but no it's seriously all just cheap plastic. Didnt even take a chance on an exchange, just returned for a refund.After emailing fizzics just to see what they'd say, they did offer a exchange, but I just returned to Amazon. They do have a responsive service team.For the two beers we did get to pour out of it, the foam bubbles are small and tight packed. It did seem like it made the canned porter we used feel softer and the smell while drinking it did enhance the taste. The price, feel and failure of the product is why I give it the one star.
