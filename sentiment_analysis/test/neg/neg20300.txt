We have contacted the seller multiple times, and each time it takes forever to get a response.  They have made us do everything possible to save the kit, to no avail.  This was a bday present, that supposedly a kid can do (even though this wasn't FOR a KID!)...yeah, well, this has been the WORST present EVER!  Do yourself a favor, and get a different brand/SELLER...We have a log that does just fine, and my husband has grown mushrooms before...  This started growing on its own, out the TOP of the package, shortly after arrival, with not moisture added to it...and now, it's proved to be completely useless, although HOURS of work have gone into trying to save it.  The seller doesn't seem to really be bothered by this, and so far, even though they've been notified that this kit is a complete bust, they won't even respond to us again...:(  WORST bday present ever, worst experience with a seller's customer service on Amazon, EVER!  Really stinks...
