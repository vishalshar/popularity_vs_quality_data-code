First of this item purchased and received, the clear face plate was scratched up, despite this being "brand new". Couldn't read phone screen due to how scratched the cover was. So we sent it back as an exchange for another of the same item. This second mount kit was also scratched up, despite also being brand new/never used/never opened. What gives? Returning second, will not be purchasing again. For $70, it is expected that you should be able to use the item right out of package and not have something already scratched up, VERY disappointed.
