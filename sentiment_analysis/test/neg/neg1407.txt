Well after countless attempts and days, I finally discovered the main problem of connecting; you have to finish the four stage tutorial on gestures!  Not the tutorial where you establish your personal gestures but just the informational tutorial.Aside from that problem the unit does not function properly with my media set-up.  I have a main receiver/amplifier into which all my peripherals are connected.  Then I have one HDMI connection into my Samsung 8500 television.  The malfunction occurs when I gesture the Singlecue on; it first turns my receiver and television on but then defaults to my Samsung DVD player.  It does not allow me to gesture back to the two units I want operating in tandem.  I therefore have to resort to my remotes to get everything operating once again; so in other words the device is useless until it can distinguish between my Samsung television and DVD player.I do note on their website they state DVD units are not compatible at this time.  That doesn't help because it is controlling mine along with my television.
