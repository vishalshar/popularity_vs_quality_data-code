Received this in January. It did not get wet, it was not dropped, nothing out of the ordinary occurred. It just went dark and stopped working a little over two months after receiving it.Cannot get it to work and I am past the return deadline by 1 month. For the amount of money I paid for this, It should have lasted longer than this.
