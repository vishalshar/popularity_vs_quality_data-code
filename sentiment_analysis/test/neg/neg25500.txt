I thought buying the expensive brush guards would be a better long term investment but boy was I wrong. I bought two pack of the variety pack, and not only do you receive very little in exchange (less then 10 per pack) but the plastic is so thick that it does not help in any way to shape the bristles. I am currently using them along with ultra cheap thin plastic guards (which I prefer believe it or not) on: Tom Ford #2 Cream Foundation (fits okay, no shaping), Chikuhodo Z-2 (fits well), Zoeva 126 Luxe cheek finish (fits well), The Sakura Collection by Chikuhodo x Beautylish (The smallest does not fit the eye brushes), Chikuhodo Passion Series PS-2 Cheek (fits well), Wayne Goss The Collection #1 foundation (fits well), Wayne Goss The Collection  #2 bronzer (fits okay, no shaping), Wayne Goss The Collection #3 large sized crease (fits okay, no shaping), Wayne Goss The Collection #4  medium sized crease (The smallest does not fit the eye brushes, the 2nd largest is too big), Wayne Goss The Collection #5 fine-point pencil (The smallest does not fit the eye brushes, the 2nd largest is too big), Wayne Goss The Collection #6 blending (The smallest does not fit the eye brushes, the 2nd largest is too big), Wayne Goss The Collection #7 flat lip/liner  (The smallest does not fit the eye brushes, the 2nd largest is too big), Wayne Goss The Collection #8 tightlining (No fit at all), Marc Jacobs  Bronzer Brush (none of these guards will fit this brush but it's not supposed to since you would have to buy the jumbo size brush guard for a large brush such as this).So keep in mind if you have tapered brushes these are going to be a big fat fail. I would recommend going on any auction site and buying the knock off guards since they are more form fitting than these thick, stiff plastic guards which by the way crack along the webbing once stretched out.
