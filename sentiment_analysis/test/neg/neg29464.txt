Caused my signal to degrade in a MAJOR way. Sitting at my office desk I have 3 out of 5 bars and never had an issue.  Since I installed this case was dropping calls, LTE was dropping to 1X, losing data connections entirely.  Terrible.  So I sat at my desk and installed and uninstalled the case 5 times.  EVERY time I installed it dropped to 1 bar, uninstalled 3 bars.Rokform claims on their site they tested for signal loss and there is none but they lie.  Take if from a customer this case destroys your signal.I wish it wasn't true because I liked the case.  But this case is terrible !!!!It's going back !!
