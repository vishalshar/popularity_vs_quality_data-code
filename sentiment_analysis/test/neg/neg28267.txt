The game is really fun to play however this was not the original game but a knock-off version.  There were lots of  duplicate cards and even more cards with misspellings and phrases that didn't make sense which makes the game hard to play.  I recommend buying the game but not this version.  It also took a long time to receive it because it came from overseas.
