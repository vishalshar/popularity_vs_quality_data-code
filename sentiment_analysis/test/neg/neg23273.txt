Summary: It looks and feels nice. The screen is excellent, the band is comfortable. If I only wanted a watch I think it would be a nice though expensive watch. As a smartwatch it's pretty awful. I'd like to give it two stars but the battery life is non-existent. The software though...just wow what a mess, lag to do anything even open the settings screen. Even more so considering this is just a skin of another companies OS with a custom Alexa client baked in.Pros:+ Excellent band+ Nice display+ Overall hardware is very well designedCons:- The Android app is awful, pairing breaks frequently and very few settings can be controlled directly, instead actions frequently rely on doing steps 1,2,3 on the watch and then 4,5,6 on the phone.- The lag, this thing has 1 gig of ram and lags trying to open the settings page.- Alexa integration works for maybe 1-2 requests per reboot.- Very limited music integration etc.
