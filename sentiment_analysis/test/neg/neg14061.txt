This products sucks.  It will not switch colors automatically (only stays on one color no matter if the button is in or out, and it does not stay on for 2 minutes as the package states.  It come on and off at random times.  This is my 2nd one as the first one I received did not even turn on at all.  Great concept, horrible product.  Wish they could figure out how to make the product work right.  The funny thing is that I actually found it in our trashcan by the toilet as it came off the bowl since the suction cups are horrible and never stay on the side of the bowl - leaving it there as it is right where it belongs!
