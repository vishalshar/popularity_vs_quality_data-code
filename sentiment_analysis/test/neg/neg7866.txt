Unfortunately this Jitterbug flip phone for $79 quit ringing right at 60 days after purchase. I bought it for my grandfather who is blind, cannot make calls but can easily open the phone to accept a call.  I was unable to return because he lived in a different state and I would only see him once a month and by then it was past the return date. I did purchase a new jitterbug flip from Greatcall directly although it was more expensive and so far it continues to work. It would be great if they would incorporate a vibrate feature so if my grandfather does not hear it ring (he also has some hearing loss) then at least he could feel it vibrate when it rang. Overall, the phone is the best for elderly folks, simple and easy to work.
