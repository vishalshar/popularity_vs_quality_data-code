While I like the design-it sits solidly on the floor-I'm not a fan of the noise it makes and the laser pointer that seemed to be the focal point for my cats.  A couple of them followed the dot on the floor for a minute, but they were more interested in the noise of the laser itself and the laser pointer on the laser toy.  After ten minutes, all of them had left except for one staunch supporter who was still trying to grab the laser pointer itself.  Maybe if it were just one or two cats playing, it would have been better.  We have multiple cats who LOVE the laser pointer that you hold in your hand and chase it all over the place.  I guess that's what I was hoping for here, but it didn't happen.If you have one or two cats, this product would work wonderfully for you!  Mine "hoard" is more attune to the noise of the machine and the prominent 'red dot' laser pointer.
