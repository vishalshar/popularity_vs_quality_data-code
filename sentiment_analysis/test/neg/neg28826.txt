This was cool for about a week but then I noticed the smell as I tried to buy some velcro to hold the grass down, which slipped out from under my pup every time she tried to walk on it (it was comparable to a person walking on a thin layer of slippery snow over an ice covered road).  This thing stinks, literally!  The whole thing stinks up anything within 30-40' of it and the odor is noticeable through walls it seems.  Even with proper care, cleaning, scrubbing, etc this thing smells aweful!  Bottom line - DON'T BUY!!!!!
