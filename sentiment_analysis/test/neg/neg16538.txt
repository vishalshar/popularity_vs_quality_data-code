Haven't written many reviews but so many positive reviews got me to buy this.  First the good.  Yes they do work I got solid energy boost out of these guys and they do what is advertised.  The bad.  Oh my gosh the taste.  I put the first one in my mouth whole.  The medicine taste was overwhelming the coffee taste. Yuck Yuck Yuck.  I tried second one in small bites lots of water got it chocked down.  I really wanted these to work tried to chock down 3-4 more because I liked the energy but ultimately i threw the rest away.  Sorry.  Great Idea.  terrible taste.
