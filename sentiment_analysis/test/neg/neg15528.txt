I never write reviews good or bad. I thought i needed to this time. overall I really liked the watch. Unfortunately the withings app quit working. would no longer let me log in.Kept saying incorrect password. I would reset it and still not working. Customer service is non existing. I've e-mailed and even used twitter and zero reply. So the watch will be sent back
