I gave it one star because after 5-6 months the powder became one clump and we couldn't use them anymore.  I tried chopping the clump up with a knife to break it up .... no go.  I added rice to it to try to absorb the moisture ... no use.  I bought a cheaper version from a local grocery store - much cheaper - and it is still in powder form - after a year!!!  We live in Maryland and I bought these in the winter, so it wasn't even very humid.  I stored them in a dry pantry.  Great tasting but use them fast because you only have 4-5 months of use!!!!  These were a waste of money!!!
