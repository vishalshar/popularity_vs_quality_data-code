I purchased this as a present and it worked as expected for a week or two. After that the buttons started working inconsistently. They would work while plugged in, but sometimes when the speaker was unplugged all buttons would stop working.Now the buttons only work when the speaker is connected to a USB power source. The battery is charged and the device will continue to play music while connected to a Bluetooth device, but no buttons work at all. You can't even do the hard reset or power up/down the device.I'll be returning and looking for an alternative.
