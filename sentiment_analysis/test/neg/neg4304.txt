I purchased this because when I'm stressed, I tend to hold my breath and/or become short of breath and thought this would help me remember to breathe. I had it for 2 and a half weeks and not once was I buzzed by the pendent I wore on my bra between my breasts to breathe. The free app on my phone was neat to watch at first, but unless you can have it open and are able to be looking at it all the time, it's quite useless. Who can watch their phone while working? Not me. Also, it did unpair from my phone twice and was not able to track my data. It was disappointing and not at all what I thought. It also captures data as "tense" when you are happy, laughing and otherwise enjoying yourself. I don't need to know when I'm focused and calm. Cool concept, but I can't be looking at my phone all day.
