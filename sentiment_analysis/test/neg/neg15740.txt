Made hair very sticky and somehow greasy. The only way it added any volume was to run your fingers through your hair continuously until it got some semblance of volume but then your hair looked like a giant mess which could not be brushed as it would make hair flat again plus getting the brush through it all was a struggle. Plus the price is absolutely ridiculous for the the tiny size.
