Gee I like technology...I'm an early adopter and I'm usually not too difficult to please.I really like the idea of this product and really wanted it to work well.Alas - the technology's simply not there yet.Imagine activating your mousepad by using a broken popsicle stick held between your teeth......while having an epileptic fit.That should give you some idea of just how frequently what's happening on the screen correlates with what the user is doing with their finger.If I was the sort of fellow who returned things I'd surely ask for my money back on this one
