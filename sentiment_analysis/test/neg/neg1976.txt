I was really excited to find a tool that would make hanging pictures a breeze. Sadly this tool didn't live up to its expectations. It appears to be solidly constructed with a decent tape measure and plastic housing. But it has two serious flaws that prevents you from hanging photos correctly and with ease. 1. The air bubble in the leveler splits into numerous bubbles with the slightest of movement preventing you from getting an accurate level measurement. Even my cheap leveler from The dollar store doesn't do that. 2. The moveable insertion knob to place your second hole moves too easily. I had to have a death grip on it and even then it didn't maintain an accurate distance for the other hole. You are much better off taking normal measurements with a standard measuring tape and leveler. It's what I ended up doing. Back to Amazon this goes.
