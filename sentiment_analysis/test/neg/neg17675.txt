Followed instructions to a tee and did not produce anything, aside from white mold, let alone the promised "easy" results of edible mushrooms. While attempting to make user-friendly instructions, the kit managed to only provide the bare minimum of pictorial/written explanation of what to do and ironically, abiding the simple messages doesn't result the complex activity of successful growth. I want my $ back. Unfortunately, doubt that will happen but at least I can warn others. If the prescribed growing conditions were more stringent or precise, I would blame myself for failing. However, when you make a product that is as "easy as 1, 2, 3" and customers complete all three steps and see nothing, it's your own fault for providing such a elementary expectation of a rather complex and apparently picky (and not well optimized) process.
