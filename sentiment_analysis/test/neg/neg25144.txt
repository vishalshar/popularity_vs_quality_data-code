I had great expectations with this watch, after getting bored with a Fitbit (mostly from having to charge it every other day and because of its design, definitely not smart). At first I loved my new Withings watch, after a month wearing it I am disappointed.The good:This is a great watch: great packaging and unboxing experience, great design, comfortable and light, waterproof, and no need to charge it. There is no digital screen, only 2 needles for time (hour and minute, no seconds and no date) and 1 needle that reads how far one is from ones daily activity goal, in %. I am not sure how the goals are set up, the needle only seems to move when I am running. There is no button on the watch. The time is automatically synchronized with the app. Beware, the watch is only waterproof up to 5 atm, i.e. good for the swimming pool but not for diving.So, a watch with an additional needle.The bad:The activity tracking is far from being as good as my previous Fitbit:- Steps are not always recorded. The help section explains that in order to be valid, one needs to walk for some time. So taking a few steps as a break from a sitting position is not recorded, only longer walks count.- The sleep monitoring just doesn't work. I had great expectations since it should have recorded light vs. heavy sleep, that my Fitbit did not do. But every time I do not move late or early at night (watching TV, checking smartphone in bed, etc.), this is considered as sleep time. My Fitbit had that accurate.- The alarm can be set up to wake one up with a gentle vibration. I like the vibration level (although it is VERY gentle) because it only wakes me up, not my wife (she was awoken when my Fitbit vibrated). It is supposed to wake one up only in light sleep phase, which is a great improvement over my previous smartwatch. On the other hand, one cannot stop the vibration since there is no button, even if one is awake. But the big issue with the alarm is that it is not ringing everyday, so it is not reliable... What is the point if I need to set up another alarm clock to make sure I wake up?- I don't like too much the silicone band that was by default with the watch. It was either too loose or too tight. And it break after 3 weeks simply wearing the watch... One can buy another band and replace it easily.- The app is really oriented to help loose weight. I actually purchased the Withings scale to go with it, it is great for that purpose. But activity tracking is abysmal: aside from steps and sleep, there is no easy way to access the activity history. So I don't know if the watch is picking when I run or swim as advertised, because I cannot find it other than by accident sometimes.- There is no tracking on the watch itself, only on the app.- There is no other smartwatch integration like showing calls, etc.So although I like this object very much as a watch, is is not a good smartwatch. But then, I would have bought a real watch if this is what I wanted, with seconds and date on the screen and waterproof to 50 atm at least... I will return this watch and try another one.
