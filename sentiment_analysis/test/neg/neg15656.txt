**update, product stays on all the time. It shuts off when it senses light, but once the light is off it runs all night because the motion sensor is broke! I realized this after replacing the batteries every week and tested this and go fish! So I bought the competition that wasn't on shark tank and it's much better. Now this unit is pointless and useless !so we only bought one of this name brand and 2 of the glow bowl.  we had no issue with the suction cups but we still like the design better of the glow bowl,  this one is much easier to change the colors by far!  we are happy with both, I would buy again.
