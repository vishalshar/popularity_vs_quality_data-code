My 7 YO son is ADHD/SPD, and I did a lot of research to find a multi-vitamin that not have the typical trigger ingredients such as artificial dyes.  This product sounded great, and I decided to go ahead with the order when I read one particular review by a woman who had seen marked improvement in her own ADHD child since starting these gummy vitamins.  Every kid is different, and I'm sure there are other positive experiences out there, but this product was HORRIBLE for our son intensifying his hyperactivity and causing him to become very angry/aggitated/aggressive.  Within 48 hours of stopping these vitamins, our kiddo was back to his "normal" and there were no other modifications made to his diet, sleep pattern, routine, etc.  For our kid, this product is just not compatible.  I wanted to post my review in hopes that other parents might make the correlation to the vitamin if their children begin acting uncontrollable as well.  We tried the vitamin for three weeks.  Still don't know which ingredient(s) was the problem, but we've tossed this product out.
