I love the concept of this device but it won't stay connected. We have hardly been able to use this since Christmas. Website says there is known issue with connectivity and a firmware will be released Feb 29. I am returning it as that is not soon enough for something using technology which has been around for a while. I would not recommend this product at this time until they can get this thing to be reliable. So frustrating to try to connect to this thing over and over again. When it finally does connect it does not stay connected long.
