Right out of the gate, connecting this product to your WiFi is mind-bogglingly difficult, and requires a comical amount of troubleshooting to master the smartphone-generated-strobe-light-linking technology. I'm a pretty tech-savvy person, but only after two hour+ calls with product support (who informed me that the parent company Wink had gone out of business a while ago), was I finally able to connect my device to the network. Even then, the connection would only last for a few seconds before disconnecting again.I'll give it to the product support team- they were very helpful and apologetic. Unfortunately, this product just wasn't ready for the mainstream. Save your money, this product is just going to waste hours of your life in troubleshooting, and inevitably won't work.
