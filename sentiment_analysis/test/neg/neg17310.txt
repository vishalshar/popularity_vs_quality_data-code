I have now owned my Robin for just under two weeks now.The good: The performance seems great - no lag that I can detect (I am coming from an iPhone 5s). Beautiful screen - bright and crisp. Build seems solid. Phone reception actually seems better than my iPhone 5s. And the phone is thinner than my iPhone 5s. I also really like the stereo speaker setup.Minimal packaging. Looks like the phone manufactures are finally getting it. I don't need a huge package with mostly air in it.The bad: Using a speaker or headphones when the phone is idle (e.g. when some music stopped playing, I just got off the phone, etc.) There is an annoying click that seems to happen about every second. When you unlock the phone, it stops, but soon as the screen shuts off, it begins. I can't tolerate it, and have to pull the jack. This does not appear to happen with a bluetooth headset.My camera has stopped functioning more than once now - requiring a power down to get it working again.Android. I don't want to be a hater, but come on, do I really need to give you permissions to things like location or microphone in order to use some of these apps that really don't need it? Yes, I am referring to built in delivered apps. Google, I don't care how much fluff and sugar coating you use to justify the gathering of my personal information. I want control over it. I am hoping that Cyanogenmod will help in this area if/when it arrives for the Robin.Battery life. The screen and phone seem to suck the juice out of this phone. I am unable to get a full day on a single charge. I have tried power management, but it does not seem to help much.Sound. Okay, I get that these are tiny speakers, but still not great.Something new that is happening - twice now the phone did not detect that I have raised to my ear to talk. The first time my cheek must have clicked the speaker phone button - which was a nice loud surprise. The second time I hung up on my call to find that I had somehow entered the notifications screen. Taking a star away.The pretty: Well, it is a great looking phone. I was an Apple fan because of form and function, and the Robin certainly covers the form side very well.Well that is my take after almost two weeks. I'll give it some more time to get comfortable and see if I can sort out the kinks before deciding if it is a keeper (or not).Update May 26, 2016: It is being returned. Too many problems with both the hardware and Android operating system. That along with Amazon not offering an exchange (requiring a return to the manufacturer if I want it repaired/replaced and a wait without a loaner). I wanted to like this phone. I am bummed.
