I was very excited to get this phone case, but upon its arrival, I could not be more disappointed. The case leaves your screen open. There is no protection at all for your screen. It is made of hard plastic. I was expecting more of a rubbery silicone feel. The area to hold cards is a joke. It was difficult to get the phone in and out. Waste of money. I won't be using this case.
