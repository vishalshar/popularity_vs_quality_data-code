UPDATE AS OF 4/3/14:  So, it's now been another 7 days since I harvested my first and only batch of mushrooms.  I got about 8-10 shrooms from 1 stalk.  I Have to say they were very tasty and grew quickly....however, I'm sitting here with a log that isn't doing anything so far.  I will continue to water it, talk to it, pet it, call it George and everything else I can think of but at this point in time I'm not downgrading to 2STARS because I paid $$$ for 10 shrooms after 2 months.  In another week or 2 I'll open the other side of the bag and start digging, watering etc to see what happens but so far not all that happy with the attempt.  On the positive side, once it started growing they went from tiny to huge in 2 days...in my case it took 6 weeks to get there.  And they were extremely tasty....again...6 weeks to get there.I've left previous inputs as is for historical purpose and an attempt at objectivity.  I will add to this review if things change with the current log.  When I have lost patience I will also post a final review with end results.___________________I've adjusted my rating to 3 stars (originally posted as 1) for now and may change it to a higher number later depending on how it continues.  I purchased this kit back in February and here's my timeline of how it went:Delivered 13 FebSoaked 12 hours (per instructions) evening of 14 FebStarted care (per instructions) 15 FebAfter 10 days no activityKept caring for another week still no activityRemoved from box, resoaked for 12 more hours and kept out of box (approx date 12-14 March).  Had to scrape more of the outer layer.  this time instead of using the spray bottle I essentially soaked the surface and allowed water to seep into the brick and set on the windowsill (direct sunlight in afternoon - normal daylight in morning)I did notice some green moldy growth on surface but chose to ignore it since I figured it was getting trashed anyway.  Looked kidna like algaeevening of 26 March noticed small mushrooms growingsince then growing really fast.  Now gotta figure out if the green algae/mold is an issueWhat I've learned:The instructions are lacking.  Only says to spray, doesn't say how much or what you're trying to achieve.  Once I started using lots of water it started growning.Main reason for 3 stars at this time is because it took so long to get mushrooms started.  I had read other places where it might take more than the advertised 10 days depending on conditions but 1 1/2 months is a few days more than 10+.
