I would give this product a -5 if I could. I ordered this product for my child's birthday. The first Gameband would work as a flash drive and nothing else. None of the apps would launch and the battery would not stay charged. My son was disappointed on his birthday, this was the one present he was looking forward to the most. Second Gameband game in almost a week after his birthday. We plugged the thing into the computer and the application installed on it actually launched! The only problem is that I'm not able to register it because who knows? So I sent an email to their support team but I'm not expecting much out of these guys because I've managed to read deeper into the reviews and it seems like these guys just don't value their customers. I would suggest that no one buy this terrible product.
