I was an early adopter of the Muku Shuttr and loved it until the battery died. Replacing the battery with a new one does not revive this product in that there is a serious design flaw in the circuitry. It seems that Muku made the decision to let the consumer eat it once the battery died rather than going back to the drawing board and doing it right.  If you have one of these remotes you may be able to prevent the device from permanent failure by replacing the battery before it goes dead.  I have written to Muku Labs multiple times in the past year asking for an explanation but have never had a reply.
