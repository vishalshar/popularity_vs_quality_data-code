I was really excited when I came across these no-tie shoelaces. The idea of not having to tie my athletic shoes, again and again plus all of the fun color combinations really appealed to me.  After following the helpful directions on the Hickies website for extra-tight lacing setup, my shoes did not feel as snug or secure as they would with regular laces. I spent about an hour trying to come up with a tighter lacing method; using only 4 hickies on each shoe lacing them in tight zig zag  x' quads - threading one Hickie lace through four lace holes on my shoe. At first they seemed okay, so I tested the Hickies on a workout.  If I only used the elliptical machines, indoor cycling or lifted weights the Hickies would have been fine. However, in group cardio fitness classes like Zumba, Kickboxing or HIIT where there is fast foot movement, the Hickies began to feel more loose and stretch more.  For example, if you stand on tiptoes for calf raises or in lunges, the Hickies really give way and stretch too much. This is probably because they are designed to make your shoes slip on and off without any re-lacing. Unfortunately they just weren't a good fit. I am thankful that Hickies allowed for return / refund.
