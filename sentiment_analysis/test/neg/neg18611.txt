Great and clever design. The armband feels comfortable even for big arms. It holds the phone secure and it is, design wise, the best alternative for armbands. The problem is, the sewing was coming undone right out of the box, big disappointment. I don't live in the U.S. so I'm not returning it since it wouldn't be cost effective for me, just gonna use it until the sewing lasts.
