My son is 7, so his shoes are smaller than adult shoes, but still the first lace (closest to his ankle) has broken several times on both shoes.  We have tried pre-stretching the Hickies with no success.  They are promoted as being able to loop through one side and back to the first side (forming a circle), so in my opinion this shouldn't be happening, at least not more than once.If I can have silicone ponytail holders that get stretched to multiple times their original size and still shrink back and hold my hair tight without breaking, why can't this product be more durable?
