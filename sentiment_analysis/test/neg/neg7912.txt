I would highly recommend getting a cheaper model with just weight and body fat measurements.  The pulse wave detection works less than 10% of the time and the measurement is highly variable to the point of being nearly useless.  If you are that concerned about your heart health, get an EKG and save yourself $80 on this poorly designed device.  This isn't the first time Withings has been slammed with quality issues in their product line... their sapphire watch has issues with production consistency and sleep measurements as well.  I am seriously starting to question the integrity and stability of this company.
