I've ben using the Zus for the past three weeks. It worked well as a car charger, though I noticed it didn't really seem to actively charge two phones connected at the same time. The GPS locator is a neat feature, but only really helpful if you always have your bluetooth on. If you don't normally keep bluetooth on you'll have to remember to turn it on when you park your car in a place where you might forget the location. You may as well just drop in a pin in Google maps at that point. My main issue with the charger though is the battery life meter in the app. For the past three weeks the app has told me my car battery was operating at optimal levels, and then yesterday my car wouldn't start. I jumped the battery and checked the app, which told me it was fine. I then took the battery to be checked and was told it was actually dead and needed to be replaced. I was really disappointed in this feature and its misinformation.
