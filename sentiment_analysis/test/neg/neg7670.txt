I bought Solid Gold Fit as a Fiddle after researching online most recommended foods. I have always fed my cats Purina One Sensitive Systems.And I think I've figured out why they call it diet cat food. The cats lose weight because they don't like it and won't eat it.We have 3 cats, 2 of which will eat anything. They turned their nose up at it. I tried slowly incorporating it into their regular dry food, and they wouldn't even touch it. So I tried mixing it with wet food. They still weren't having any of it.So now i have a bag of $35 cat food I guess I'll use as a doorstop.
