I really wanted to like this doorbell. My biggest fear was that it wouldn't be obvious that it was a doorbell and where to push to ring it. My fears were justified as two people told me they didn't know what to do with it. Unfortunately that's not even the biggest problem.It's extremely unreliable. The video is constantly unavailable, and when it does connect, it only works for a few seconds before disconnecting again. There is also a lag between the time someone rings the bell and the time notification shows up on my phone. I'd say it's at least 30 seconds, maybe more. Our router sits less than 10 feet away from the front door and when it's connected, it says we have a very strong signal. So I don't know what the issue is. I hope it's a software issue that will be resolved in upcoming updates. As of right now, it's pretty useless. What a shame.
