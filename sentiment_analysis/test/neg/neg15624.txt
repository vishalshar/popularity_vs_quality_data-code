Having recently bought an iPad Pro, specifically for artistic purposes, I was dismayed to find all the various local stores sold out of the new Apple Pencil. Indeed, I would have to get one delivered to me, which purportedly would take 3 weeks minimum. Begrudgingly I accepted this, but I did not want to wait to start trying to draw anything on my new iPad.With this in mind, I decided I might as well look at some third party styluses to use while I waited for the Apple Pencil. The 53 Digital Stylus was probably the most highly rated of any third party stylus. Having already dropped (HOLY MOLEY) dollars on my iPad and another (GOOD GRAVY) on the pencil, I figured, why not drop a few more for a stylus I can use in the interim while I wait for my Apple Pencil to be delivered.Do I regret my decision? Well...The item is 'just okay' at its very, very best. It does have things like pressure sensitivity and the like, but it's incredibly finicky. More importantly, though, the pressure functions only really seem to work with the special '53 Paper' app (which you can thankfully get free on the App store). Unfortunately, you'll very quickly find out that said app is very much NOT intended for any artistic endeavors. It's purely an office app. Everything is geared towards making charts, graphs, and demonstrations. Makes you wonder why you'd even need a stylus with special pressure sensitivity for it in the first place. A regular stylus would work just as well.It's also worth mentioning that its touted 'eraser' function doesn't work at all. Even in 53 Paper, it never seemed to actually WORK as an eraser. It always made lines instead.Meanwhile, pressure sensitivity DOESN'T work on any other apps. There, it works like a regular stylus. Except it's even more awkward than using a normal stylus because of it's incredibly squishy rubber tip. This weird, squishy rubber tip doesn't really make any sense and I'm honestly not sure why it's necessary. All it does is make it confusing where your line is going to land. It's hard to make clean lines with this when the rubber, squishy, wiggly tip is wobbling all over the place on the screen. You'd honestly be better served using a normal, hard tipped stylus. In a word, it's imprecise."Okay, but it's better than using your finger right?" You ask as you consider just using it as a fancy stylus you can impress your friends with because you're apparently compensating for something. "It doesn't leave weird fingerprint smudges after all!"Guess again.This is the only stylus I have EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE that actually leaves it's own smudges. I don't know if I just need to give it a good thorough washing or what, but whenever I drag it across the screen it leaves this weird gray smudge behind. Now, the smudge is easily dusted off with a cloth (more easily than a fingerprint is), but still what the hell? A stylus that actually leaves smudges. When I bought the 'graphite' version of this stylus I didn't expect it to actually leave graphite powder behind like a real pencil. That's honestly what it seems like it's doing as I try to use this thing.I honestly think you'd be better served buying any hard-tipped stylus over this thing. It's imprecise, leaves weird smudges, the eraser doesn't actually work, and its only selling point, the fact that it's pressure sensitive and can be used for drawing, is only applicable in an app that is very clearly NOT SUITED for any decent art making.(though to be fair, the state of art apps on the iPad is pretty abysmal, so compared to some others, 53 paper actually pretty good. Here's a tip though: If you want to make good art on the iPad, get "ArtStudio for iPad - Draw and Paint" by Lucky Clan. It's just about the only one I've found that has a wide array of brushes and the ability to use layers. Unfortunately, it isn't compatible with this item at all.)And if you actually DO get 53 Paper with the intent of using it for making business presentations, charts, etc... then why would you need a fancy pencil stylus to do that? Why would you ever need pressure sensitivity to make something like that?In conclusion...CONS:- Only works with specialized app that isn't suited towards drawing and art so why would you even need pressure sensitivity- Squishy tip makes it incredibly imprecise- leaves weird smudges everywhere- eraser doesn't actually workPROS:- It looks really nice.
