This works ad advertised and gets the job, but the connection the MacBook is a little wiggly. The biggest drawback to this is that it runs very hot, probably over 100 degrees F. The casing/materials are relatively cheap feeling and the logo etched on the product only emphasizes its cheapness.UPDATE: After 2-3 months use, it died on me. Do *NOT* get this if you plan to use it regularly. Might work as an occasional one-off connector, but any extended use will overheat and in my case it killed it (current it emits weird noise and doesn't function). Pretty disappoints.
