Purchased this for an 84yr old grandmother, this phone comes with a huge pink 5-star icon button on the home screen. When this button is pressed, whether you are subscribed to the service or not, when the pink 5-star button is pressed the next page has a huge red "Call 911" icon button at the bottom located directly above the home button. There is no way to deactivate the button. I was nervous that my grandmother would accidently hit the pink 5 star button and then realize she was in the wrong place and accidently just hit the huge red call 911 button while trying to hit the home button to escape. This phone would have been great if we could have deactivated that button or at least the call 911 button. I just felt that she would have kept accidently hitting that 911 button. When I called Greatcall and added them about accidentally hitting the huge 911 button... They said it happens all the time and that the smaller should just remain on the line and let the police know it was an accident... I know my grandmother would panic and just hang up.
