I really wanted to like this but its flimsy construction guaranteed it wouldn't last. Simply opening the back to get at the battery, SIM and micro SD card causes damage. It finally died in less than 2 months, by going into an endless loop of restarts.The OS was also outdated and not upgradable so I couldn't use it for Smart Things and Spire.
