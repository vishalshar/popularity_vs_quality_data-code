This board would be awesome if it actually worked.  I've been able to get it up and running very quickly as an Arduino, but when trying to use any of the wifi functions, it does a memory dump and resets itself.  Acrobotic's website is very helpful as far as getting the board running as an Arduino but it doesn't address the wifi functionality at all.  Since the wifi functionality is what attracted me to this board in the first place, I have to give it a low rating.  I've searched online for an resolution and all I can find are many, many posts from those experiencing the same frustration that I'm experiencing.  There doesn't seem to be an answer to this memory dump/reset issue.  If Acrobotic would address the wifi functionality on their website, it would be very helpful.  If they know of a resolution that works, they really need to get the word out.  I'm afraid this board is getting a bad reputation because of this issue.  I can certainly use this board as an Arduino, but the currently-unusable wifi functionality is the whole reason that I purchased this board.
