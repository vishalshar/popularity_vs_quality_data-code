I think the company would do better to cut down on the price and get more skin colored shirts on the market.  They are not worth the price, but I have zero complaints about them and now own 3.  If the price was more reasonable I would own 10!  Fit snug and amazing material.  Feels very nice.  Great length, great low cut neck.  I really like these shirts.Update--- A year later, I bought 3 more because there is still nothing else out there like it (and believe me I wish there was rather than paying $34 a shirt), however, I am not happy with the changes they made.  A year ago it was 93% Siro Micro Modal and 7% spandex.  The shirts fit great and were absorbent enough to feel like an undershirt.  Now, 95% Siro Micro Modal and 5% spandex, I wouldn't have thought that would make a difference, but now you really feel like you are wearing tight panty hose around your body.  Before, this had a tight Under Armor shirt feel (which was good), but softer material and with good thickness to it to be absorbent.  Now I can see nipples through the shirt it is so thin and somehow the cut or material made it smaller.  The large fit great, albeit a trim fit, but now it is so small that the arm sleeves don't come very far off your shoulder and because there isn't much to hold them down to your arms, it rides up into your pits and you end up wanting to reach into your shirt and pull them down.I always thought they were too expensive but at least there were all around pretty great.  Now with these changes, they have cheapened the shirt to increase their margins and ruined something that was great.  These changes are making me think twice about buying the Invisible Undershirt again in the future.  I will probably look around for an alternative but if they make some changes to bring back the thickness and arm sleeve length of the shirt, I would happily give it another shot.
