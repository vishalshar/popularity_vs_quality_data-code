So i purchased this PLA along with a half KG of white.  I started out using the White and once i got it dialed in it worked flawlessly to help me build some parts to upgrade the 3d printer so i figured the black would do just as good however i was wrong.  In general it's a nice glossy black but i think that's also it's downfall.  It's extremely hard to get it's extrusion temperature right (i'm sitting at 225) or it doesn't extrude at all.  Even after i get it to extrude it's very stringy (think spider silk) making a mess and causing first layer issues.  After spending almost 2 day's getting to where I thought it would work fine i left it over night and then came back and started having issues when printing again.  I've used to much to return this roll trying to get it working but I wont be purchasing this one again and I recommend you look else where for your Black PLA
