Works fine. Huge hassle to set up with Alexa. A sponsored link on Amazon brought me to puchase it. The set up instructions are so bad, and the website lacks detailed steps to get it set up with Alexa. Alexa app skills rating for the LIFX skill was around 2 1/2 stars. So here's fix, hopefully save someone a headache. Screw in blub, turn on light, download LIFX app. Run LIFX app and create login and password. Then select wifi (supposed to be same as Alexa is on), it'll find device then send wifi configuration to it. (If it configures for over 5min just close app and reopen should be done)* then in app you will see the light all set up and be able to turn it on and off. All easy stuff.  Then goto Alexa app download skill LIFX and login to your account.What happens next is your supposed to have Alexa discover the device, tho she wont. It won't happen. Then you'll spend way to much time trying to find the answer, and think about returning blub. (Like alot of comments)If you do figure it out you'll want to write a review like this one.(Website instructions no help, at all, just makes vague reference to make sure linked to cloud. They actually have a How to set up a cloud link, which just tells you to create an account, not how to link a bulb to cloud. They also keep referencing the word Cloud and your LIFX Account, interchanging, as in the same term.)****So fix is, in the LIFX app, little >  next to your blub. Click it then at very top of screen to left of the little star is a symbol. Click symbol and then tell it to link to cloud. Then it'll ask you to create name. Once that's done Alexa now can find the device. Please let me know if this helped. Had to rant little, just wasn't clear cut instructions.
