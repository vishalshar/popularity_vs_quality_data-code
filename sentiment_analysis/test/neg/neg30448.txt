Great product.  I had a hard time setting it up...I kept getting an error message.  Once it finally worked,  tested the camera (including the night vision), speaker quality,  and the treat dispenser.  It's pretty awesome.  I just hope my dog will like it.  Right now he's hiding from it.  Hopefully I'll get to actually use it.Update:  Had to reduce my rating since the service is spotty sometimes.  I've walked right in front of the camera but the app doesn't show me.  So not sure if what I've been looking at is even live.  And the dog is deathly afraid of it...he just hides until I get home.  Think this one will be going back.
