I hate this device, I have to keep reinstalling, it doesn't sync, most the time my phone can't find the tracker, when it does i get a message saying its draining my phone and i have a S7.  Kept hoping I would like it, I really wanted to like it, but it sucks.  Too late to return it now stuck withIt.
