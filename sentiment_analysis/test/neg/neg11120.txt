I purchased this for my mother.  She is elderly and visually impaired, so I thought the Jitterbug would be good for her.  Not the case.  No ability to use voice commands as there are on other flip phones.  When I called, I was told this was not a current feature with Great Call service.  I returned the Jitterbug and replaced with a Verizon filp phone.
