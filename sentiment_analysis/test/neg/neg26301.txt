This did not work for my purpose- I wanted to get shots to show where bees were clustering in the hive in cold weather. This could not capture that difference (returned this and bought FLIR1 later and it does it well). I tried to contact the SEEK help line but could not find a phone # and got no response to email so returned it.  It did fine with shots of cold air around doors and windows.
