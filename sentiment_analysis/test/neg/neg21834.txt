I have read comments that these are too small and make the shoes too tight.  However, I have short, wide feet (5-1/2 E) and generally wear girl's size large sock because women's small are too large.  No matter what configuration I tried they were far too loose.  My heels slipped up and almost out of the sides of the shoes extremely easily.  I tried them in two different sets of sneakers (New Balance and Nike) and one pair of Easy Spirit white walking shoes and no matter which shoes and what configuration they did not work for my feet.  I would buy child's size but am very reluctant to spend the money.
