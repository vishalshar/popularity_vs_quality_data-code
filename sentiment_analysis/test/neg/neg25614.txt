The calibration lasts a good 10 minutes and not beyond that. It stops reminding me about my posture after that even when I am "in training". I need to keep recalibrating every 10 minutes. Maybe this is something that can be improved in the next version of the product. Right now for the features it offers, it's current price tag is too high.
