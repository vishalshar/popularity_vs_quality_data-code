This bike is a huge disappointment.  It comes out of the box looking neat, but the assembly is poor and the quality is suspect.  It came with all the advertised parts, but they didn't fit very well together.  The hand brake is poorly adjusted and very difficult to adjust as it goes from either too loose or too tight with virtually no wiggle room in between.  Neither of the wheels spin true as either the tire or the wheel were mildly warped (I wasn't going to pull the tire off the rim to find out).  The max tire inflation is 40psi which is too low as I could still depress the tire with my finger at that level.  The bearings are cheap in the wheels as a good spin will come to a stop on its own within 1-2 seconds despite not having any resistance.  This bike also weighs a ton.  This may be the #1 kids bike in China, but unless they are taking this off-road into serious terrain I can't imagine why the bike would need to be so heavy.  And finally the coup-de-grace was the fact that the website for the bike is in Chinese.  When you try to find the English translation you get a 404 message.  All in all we are pretty disappointed. bonus star for looks and having all parts included with shipping.
