I was expecting something very fun and creative. After four anticipated days, it came. It worked for the whole day from 3:30 PM to 7:00 PM. That night I charged it fully. The next afternoon, I went outside to play. It didn't turn on. I tried, literally, EVERYTHING!!!? I even looked on the Powerup site's troubleshooting page. I couldn't find an answer. I even read through the entire manual! This is absolutely the worst item I have EVER bought on Amazon!????? I would give this item zero stars, but Amazon won't let me! Please, don't by this item! It will cause you unbelievable frustration! DONT BUY!!!
