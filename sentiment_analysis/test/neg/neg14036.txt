The makers of this product believe people want to be constantly recording the mundane events of their daily lives. If that's what you want, it's a perfect product. If you are thinking, like I was, that this would be great for travels and adventures, don't bother. This requires regular access to a computer and internet connection in order to be anything but a major pain to use, meaning its only real use would be for everyday wear, when you can regularly connect to the cloud-based system it requires (and which they want to charge you for after the first year, by the way). Basically this camera is a good idea but the company misunderstands how a large market of people might want to use it.
