I really hoped this would work. I've sent 8 or so messages to Thync tech support as I'm struggling with placement. They offered to meet with me on Skype, I said yes, and then never heard back. I waited on Skype for a full day but the person wasn't on (even though he gave me his Skype ID).The other issue is with the strips. In Thync's support documentation on their website they say strips should only be used once...however the main part of the website says 2 or more times. My strip turns a different color after a single use, but again, their support documentation says not to use them when they change color.
