I ordered this in November as a Christmas gift for my son. Now that Christmas is over and we have opened it...holy cow. This is totally a knock-off game from China. The box was a little rough looking when I got it, but I just wrote that off to shipping. The cards don't make any sense, there are misspellings, it didn't come with any directions either. Who knows where the mouthpieces have been?!
