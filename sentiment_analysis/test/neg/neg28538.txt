This camera is not good. First of all the image during the day is pixelated so you can't actually see the person if they are moving. Usually people are moving. Secondly, we had this pointed outside through a front window. This causes the IR LED night vision to reflect and you can't see anything. Why would I need night vision to monitor in my house?
