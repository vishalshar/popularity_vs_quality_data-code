1st one arrived and didn't work out of the box.  Returned it.  2nd one wouldn't sync due to firmware issues and they only offer Windows based tools for upgrading firmware.  Finally found someone with Windows who let me flash the lighter.  Even after flashing it would only connect intermittently.  After a couple weeks, the screen on the lighter doesn't work.  Just a piece of junk.
