After reading the reviews I ordered a box of these and the Bare Fruit Organic, Gluten Free Baked Apple Chips, Fuji bags.  I am very disappointed in the taste, They taste like overly sweet rotten apples.  I will keep these as a last resort for a snack.  IDK what the people are eating who gave these a good rating, to make these taste good, but I am on the Whole30 Paleo plan, and having no sugar, dairy, grain, etc...so it's not like I'm eating sugary snacks and comparing these to that.  Just Yuck.
