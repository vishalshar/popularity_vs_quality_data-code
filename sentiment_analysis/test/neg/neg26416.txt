Purchased this December 2015. It fit in my CD slot without any problem and held my iPhone securely. A few days ago the arms popped open and my phone fell out. I have not made any changes to the opening size since it was installed. It will no longer close back into the position needed to hold my phone, so it is now useless. I am unsure why the internal mechanism would fail, guess I got a defective one.
