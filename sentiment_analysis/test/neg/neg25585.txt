The mug itself and lid are nice. The anti spill feature turns out to be more annoying then useful. You have to lift the mug straight up versus how I naturally lift the mug in a "swiping/angled" (for lack of a more descriptive term) motion.  If you don't lift the mug straight up the anti spill feature kicks in and I've found its less helpful because it wants to stick to whatever flat/smooth surface it happens to be on.
