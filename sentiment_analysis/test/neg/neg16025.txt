I just got this product today. The fact that this is bulky (like many others) doesn't win it any awards. Automatic setup doesn't work -- had to do manual setup.The biggest turn-off is that app is laggy and prone to hanging. Voice control would have been nice, but the hanging is a big problem. It's very easy to make a quality app, but D-Link decided not to.
