Pros: It sort of works.Cons:- The motor is really slow. At first, I thought the battery was dead. But no, it actually is just slow.- Very picky "initial setup" for a guitar. My Taylor took about 8 minutes to calibrate. My electric guitar didn't work when plugged directly into the phone with the app. I did it with an amp on, and that still took several minutes. I tried to use it before changing strings on a friend's Takamine acoustic, and after about 15-20 minutes trying to "calibrate" it, I just quit. So, it was basically just used at that point to unwind the old strings.- Using it to unwind strings is about as slow as using your fingers. I thought it could maybe replace my manual winder, but that's not the case.- The app is fine, but presets are kind of pointless for me, because I can literally detune and re-tune my guitar quicker than this device would do it.I thought this would be a nice addition to my travel gear, with an multitool: Tuner, string winder, (quick) multi-tuning preset adjuster.As a tuner, it's pointless (if you can even get it to recognize your guitar). As a string winder, it's way too slow. As an auto-alternate tuning device, it's REAL slow and almost pointless.
