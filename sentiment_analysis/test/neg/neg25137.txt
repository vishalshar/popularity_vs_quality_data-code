Just received the black Rokform Fuzion Pro for girlfriends brand new Iphone 6s- it simply does not fit. The real problem is she is super rough on phones and we need a super good case now.  The machined aluminum piece is too short to reach around the circumference and hook over the rubberized lip. Spent over 30 minutes playing with it, swapping back plates, pushing the rubber into the aluminum then trying to stretch it over; everything....does not fit.  Looks nice, has potential, but the machining is off and the reach-over part is too short to grab over the molded rubber lip. Honestly the aluminum is very thin, feels like plastic and the carbon fiber, or pho fiber, not sure, piece came unglued then trying to squeeze the frame over the rubber. For a $100 cover- super disappointed with the quality control. It's going back.Will try an exchange and give it 1 more chance.
