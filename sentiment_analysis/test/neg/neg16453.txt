In 2014 we had purchased a PetSafe ScoopFree Self Cleaning Litter Box.  Along with it we bought a six pack of the Premium Blue Crystals.  We were extremely happy with those and they worked very well, keeping odor down and were very easy to use.  One thing that we liked was that the top of the litter tray acted as both a bottom for the tray to sit in as well as as a top that could be put back on (i always taped it) so that everything was sealed for disposal.  We stopped using it because a cat we had took a dislike to it and refused to use it any longer.This year we got a couple of kittens (the older cat having passed away) and started them out on the ScoopFree system.  This time we bought the Dye-Free crystals.  To date we have been VERY displeased with these.  The boxes are not the same and much more difficult to dispose of, needing to empty everything into a bag.  The box must be "put together" and does not fit as well - not sure why they would be different but they are.  The dye free crystals also do not seem to cover as well as the blue ones.  We are constantly finding "bare" spots, which was never a problem with the blue crystals.  More importantly the dye free do not last very long and do a very poor job of masking the odor.  We are having to change them out on average every week.  (Note that these are kittens, not full grown cats.)+While we like the ScoopFree system, we will not buy the dye free crystals again and will go back to the Blue Crystals that we started out on.  Hope this is helpful.
