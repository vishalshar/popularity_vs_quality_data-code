The Whistle sounds like a great idea for a dog that digs out during storms, but the product doesn't work.We followed the directions, defined out zone, and bought the the tracking service.  Since, I have had to leave work two times to check on my dog when whistle indicated he was out of zone.  One time the whistle was sitting on the charger where my husband had left it, and the second time it was on my dog, who was in the back yard.  Our dog's $20 tag with our name and number works better than this product.  ALSO UNDERSTAND THERE IS A MONTHLY FEE FOR THE TRACKING SERVICE.
