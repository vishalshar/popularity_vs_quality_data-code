This pillow isn't designed for someone like me apparently. Started out fine, but after a week of using this pillow, I found quite a few issues with it. Every night, I feel like I have to "fluff" it to break up the shredded foam. When I wake up in the morning, the pillow feels really hard.Staring a few days ago, I started to notice an issue with my neck and shoulders. Today, it feels as if I got whiplash from a car accident. I'm finding it difficult just to turn my head. My sister warned me of neck problems like this when she used a similar pillow, but I decided to try it out myself. Turns out, it's not just hear. We're both Side Sleepers, so that tells me a pillow like this isn't designed for people like us.Her husband sleeps on his back, and he doesn't have and issue with it.If you're a Side Sleeper, I recommend you don't use this pillow.
