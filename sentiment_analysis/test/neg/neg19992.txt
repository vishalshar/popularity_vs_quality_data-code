I cannot add the camera to the IFamCare app using WiFi. I can add the camera to the app using hard wire Ethernet connection (RJ45 in the base of the Helmet). However, as soon as I unplug the network cable the Helmet is no longer accessible. I've followed all Tech Support instructions and verified that my router is compatible. And unfortunately, there are no advanced settings that I can try to connect over WiFi. The product simply does not work as advertised.
