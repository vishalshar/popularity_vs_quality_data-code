Device worked 3 times then was nothing but trouble. I called support but still waiting for a return call. Device freezes up and will not refocus on new object, will not take picture, or video. Maybe warranty has expired and so device malfunctions. My initial impression was this - Device is quite small in size, yet powerful. It shows accurate temperature readings and a reasonable level of detail. Photos can display exact location and easily store in same location as all other photos on iPad and iCloud. I am using for heat loss in my older home but also explored wooded area to see what lurks in the night. So much fun!h
