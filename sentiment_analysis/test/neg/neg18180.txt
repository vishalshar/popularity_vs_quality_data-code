As of this date I'm writing the review (12/17), there is no full functionality with the Android app. Unfortunately, this is another app optimized for iOS and not Android. Thankfully, since it's just released, I'm hoping for an Android update so we can have full features as mentioned and seen on the website. (Sleep mode, distance auto lock, etc.) Right now, you can only locate your bag, lock it, and control the lights. No flight settings like there are in iOS, no distance settings. I hope for an update soon since the bag was $399 and I'd like to use it. Otherwise, the bag is nice, sleek, and feels like it can hold enough for a quick weekend trip. After my first couple of uses and once it gets Android support, I will update my review.
