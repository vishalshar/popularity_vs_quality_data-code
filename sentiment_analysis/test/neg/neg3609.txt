Lee REALLY loved this cup, as it had everything we were looking for -glass, no plastic, silicone, supremely easy to clean, etc. Unfortunately, similar to another reviewer, my 20-month-old broke this just by dropping it while I was holding him a few days after we received it. So sad! Such a great concept, but the glass is THIN for something meant to be used by little ones! I would love to rate this higher, but can't because of that one very significant design flaw.
