Unfortunately, all the gummies came stuck together.. when i opened the bottle, and tried to pull one out, i realized the gummies are one giant piece, not cute little individual gummie bears..I think this particular bottle was exposed to heat or something. It's too bad because I know my kids like this product, but I was afraid the plastic (the bottle) had melted and stuck to the gummy so I was unable to give them this gummies :(
