I bought this because as others have said, the camera sleeve is way too tight.  However, I don't understand why they recommend this case.  It is also a couple sizes too small to be usable.  Everything will fit, but just as with the sleeve, good luck in getting it out.  I wish I could give it zero stars because it is totally overpriced & useless.
