Just three months, the battery drains very quickly, we have to charge it every two or three days. Sometimes we are out for work and got a message saying the Whistle's battery is low, then not until when we got home in the afternoon, the whistle has already turned off. Am I getting a defect product? Will see how customer service solve this problem and update my review then.
