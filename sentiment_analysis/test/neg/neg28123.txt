I have always preferred to use good quality metal stays over the flimsy included ones with most shirts, but only had one length of 3rd party metal stay. Purchased these and one other item based upon the reviews.While the premise is good, in actual usage the stays close up to a size smaller than that set for them. This has occurred in numerous shirts, and after a dozen or so attempts at using them, I have now retired them completely and no longer use.
