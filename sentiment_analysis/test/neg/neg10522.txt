It's rather disappointing. The August App does not consistently connect to the lock. Tapping that big grey button multiple times and seeing "COULD NOT CONNECT TAP TO RECONNECT" is VERY frustrating.  Also, while the auto lock function works quite well, the Auto Unlock has never worked once since I got the smart lock, 4 days ago.I called August support, and I'm sorry to say they weren't very supportive. Once they found out that I had a Google Pixel, I was told that the phone hasn't been tested and they can't guarantee compatibility. Then I was told that there are known problems with the Pixel, and that there was nothing they could do to troubleshoot the device.I also have an August Connect, and while the app consistent connects via WiFi, it seems that August's own Connect product can't connect to its own Smart Lock.When it works, it's wonderful, but it's way too unreliable to ever consider leaving the house without a key as a backup.
