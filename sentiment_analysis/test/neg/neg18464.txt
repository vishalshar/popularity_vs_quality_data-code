Admittedly, it's a good laptop and it ran well when I first got it but...HOO boy. I'm not sure if I was unlucky (hopefully I was) but it only took a day or two when it completely glitched out.This went on for around a month. It would be running fine but every single day it would interrupt my work, the entire screen display glitching out, with the audio screaming along. It would stay that way until I forced shutdown and restarted, with the cycle repeating. It couldn't be overheating, considering sometimes the only thing I had up was Google Chrome, something a gaming laptop shouldn't have trouble with.Did I mention the speakers didn't work, even when I reinstalled the drivers?Even when I brought it in for repairs, I was told nothing was wrong with it. I ended up returning it. Now, tax was quite a bit so I ended up spending $900 while only being refunded $730. Taxes can't be avoided, but I still lost money in the process. If he same thing happens to you, send it to Asus for repairs instead of what I did.I'm getting it again, banking on it just an account of being unlucky. Only because the laptop worked well when it did. I'd be a little wary though.
