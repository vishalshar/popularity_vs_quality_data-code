May 17:  After returning my August doorbell cam I installed a Skybell HD doorbell cam and couldn't be happier.  For the same price as the August, the Skybell HD does everything well, doesn't drop WiFi connection, has excellent video quality with LED light augmentation to improve facial recognition and has free cloud storage of video clips.  The Skybell HD is everything the August wishes it could be.May 6:  I have returned mine because it will not reconnect even after resetting.  Plus the video and still quality is much too dark.  Hopefully the Skybell HD will be better.May 5th:  I am revising my review.  After about a week of working (kind of), this device is now offline and I can't get it back - this despite a solid signal strength of 70/70 and -33dBm.  I called tech support and after he told me I have to totally remove the doorbell in order to reset it I told him that is ridiculous for something that is designed to be a permanent fixture that would require a lengthy process to comply - there should be a reset function remotely or at least available without having to remove the whole darn thing.  I then requested to RMA this crappy thing and he said sure after which he hung up on me.  This is what you can expect from August.  Buyer beware!!I just received the dark gray version of this doorbell cam directly from August.  The installation was straightforward and easy after taking the advice from someone else here that said to leave the device hooked up to the 24V AC bell wiring before proceeding with installation.  It seems the internal battery comes discharged and mine needed at least 30 minutes before it would work.  Despite the successful installation, I am not very happy that this does not have an infrared light for dimly lit conditions.  Also, I have a covered front porch that faces south and peoples faces are very difficult to identify since the faces appear too dark, probably because the camera is compensating for the south facing lighting conditions.  Another issue, at least with the dark gray version, it does not really look like a traditional door bell and people have a hard time trying to figure out where to press to ring the bell - the tiny, almost unrecognizable green bell-shaped led light in the center of the device is not visible during daylight.  I furthermore am not happy that August has yet to implement motion detection or cloud or local storage of captured video.
