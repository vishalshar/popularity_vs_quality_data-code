I mean it is nice and gets the job done but the build quality is poor I feel like if the lens part gets pushed from the back or even the front it might pop out. You can clearly see its just glue holding to the frame. It just feels really cheap, it doesn't feel like it could take too much which is ironic since it's built for an action camera.  definitely not worth 50$.. Hopefully another company will come out with some.
