I bought this Jitterbug phone for my elderly mother but returned it.  The phone has large numbers and probably works Great Call describes it, but the lowest cost monthly minute plan through Great Call is $25 per month ($300/yr.).  My mother stills uses a landline and only uses a cell phone in case of emergency.  I went to Walmart and got her a Tracfone that had a speakerphone.  Annual minute plans are much less expensive.
