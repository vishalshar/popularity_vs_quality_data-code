HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!The device is ok, but Whistle has the absolute WORST customer service that I have encountered out of all of these "connected devices" (and I own many). It's ironic, given that when other devices fail it's an inconvenience, but when your dog's tracker fails it could result in a life/death situation!The tracker was working fine for a while (false alarms here and there, reporting that he had left the premise even though I could see him right next to me). But one day when we were at work and our dog was in our enclosed back yard we received an alert that he had left the perimeter. As usual we checked to see where his GPS location was to verify that it was a false alarm, but this time it reported him on a parallel street about a block down!!! We kept watching to see if it was a false alarm, but then it started reporting him moving around in the neighborhood -- ACTUALLY wandering around loose! Of course, we panicked and I sped across town, running lights, to try to find him before he got hit by a car (all the while with my wife freaking out on the phone). Meanwhile, she was reporting his whereabouts so that I could know where to go. As I was approaching the neighborhood, the GPS was telling us that he had navigated back to our street and was only a few houses down. When I reached our street he was nowhere to be found, so I went in the house and.... sure enough.... he was in the enclosed yard, sleeping in his dog house!As if this weren't BAD ENOUGH, I reached out to Whistle support with a full account of what happened, including screenshots of the GPS activity and the thread of alerts we were getting as the system was SIMULATING his movement around our neighborhood. What did Whistle support do? They instructed me on a multi-step process to troubleshoot the system, followed with "keep an eye on it"!  I performed the troubleshooting steps but told them that I no longer trusted my unit and would like a replacement. Then they instructed me on more troubleshooting steps and told me to keep an eye on my system. ARE YOU FRIGGIN' JOKING?!  Under NO UNCERTAIN TERMS did I express to them how frustrated and angry I was at this false alarm, how it could have cause an accident, and how I was no longer interested in playing QA for their faulty device... all I wanted was a replacement, but I simply got the brush off, telling me that it's their policy to go through multiple steps of troubleshooting and monitoring before they do anything about it. Awesome, in the meantime it's my dog's welfare that's on the line.When I have had doorbell cameras, wifi security detectors, and Nest thermostats go bad the companies don't skip a beat in replacing the devices because they KNOW that these instruments act up from time to time, and it's better to make the customer happy than to put them through hell. We're already knowingly taking a chance by being early adopters. Clearly, Whistle has more of the philosophy that owners and their dogs can go pound dirt because they'd rather save the $3 shipping cost and leverage users as live testers.DO NOT TRUST YOUR DOG'S WELFARE WITH THIS COMPANY. THEY DO NOT CARE.---------------------------------ADDENDUM: Colin from their secondary level of customer care reviewed the email threads that we had and he decided to take things into his own hands. He reached out and scheduled a phone call in order to review the issue. He admitted that their customer service "dropped the ball" and wanted to make it up to me.  He explained why the device acted funny and how to try to avoid it in the future.  He definitely made the situation better, although it would have obviously been better if their first-level of customer care had just properly explained and handled the situation. I'm hesitant to delete the original negative review because it was accurate, even though Colin has made the situation better, but I also didn't want to leave it as is without giving Colin credit for his effort.  Due to this I'm giving them another start, moving them to 2 stars.
