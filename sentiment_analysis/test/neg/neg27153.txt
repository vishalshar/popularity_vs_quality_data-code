Packaging is exactly like the original real brand I brought. I loved the original by the actual Beauty Diary, my skin is so smooth after using it and I loved it. I paid $60 for a box of 10 or 12 masks. This one is only $20 with shipping, but it's definitely not the same as original. I don't feel the same smoothness and I don't feel the skin tightens. The mask paper itself is thinner by 3-4x of the original. I guess we get what we paid for...
