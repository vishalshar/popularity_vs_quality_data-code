I really wanted to like the Bobine because good car mounts with cables for lightning connectors are practically nonexistent, but it just doesn't work the way I expected. And of course, these flaws are not advertised or addressed by all the five-star reviews that make me wonder if they even used the device. First, Une Bobine blocks the headphone jack. I only use my iPhone for two things in the car: getting turn-by-turn GPS directions and playing music. For both, I need to hook the phone up to my car stereo via the headphone jack. As a result, Une Bobine is useless to me. Second, Une Bobine doesn't work with most cases. I have a slim case that barely adds any thickness to the exterior of the phone, but it's enough that Une Bobine can't handle it. For most cases, you will have to remove your iPhone from the case to use Une Bobine, which is a major pain. The only case that might work is one that does not block the bottom part of your phone at all (which sort of defeats the purpose of having a case in the first place). Third, Une Bobine does not truly support the weight of the iPhone. After a lot of careful adjustment, you just might be able to get your iPhone to stand up, at least until it gets slightly jostled or you turn the steering wheel, after which point Une Bobine will slowly sink out of reach. Here, the car kit might help, but I generally find that adhesives never work well in my car's interior due to the slightly rough surface. Plus, the model with the car kit is annoyingly not for sale on Amazon.
