I really liked it the first 2 days.. Wanted this for my kid.. He was very fond of it..But then suddenly the 3rd day, it started to show some lines on the screen.. SO I returned it..Otherwise if POSH can make better quality phones in this size, it is a Wonderfull meaniature phone..Many of my friends liked it..
