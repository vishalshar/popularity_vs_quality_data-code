If you are thinking of buying this watch and you own an iPhone, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WATCH. Setting this watch up was quick and easy, but trying to keep it connected my phone is the hardest thing I have had to do with a smart watch. It constantly disconnects and requires you to either A: restart your phone or B: Turn off your Bluetooth and turn it back on again every time you close the app. I am very disappointed because I was greatly looking forward to a cheaper alternative to the Apple watch. However, I will be returning this watch and putting some money aside to purchase the Apple Watch. This should not be categorized as an Android and Apple smart watch.DISCLAIMER: (Yes I know it is not the companies fault because 3rd part smart watches do not work well with IOS.)
