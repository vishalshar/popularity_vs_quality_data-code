This speaker is extremely durable, but lacks some of the qualities I was hoping for.It is not very loud! It says it is as loud as a bears roar... That bear must be elderly and mute because it doesn't even fill a room unless it is very quiet. The base sucks and the music quality decent but not clear and crisp. Spent $80 on this thing and I could have bought a $20 speaker and have it louder and more clear.It is durable. It has gotten a little water in it but doesn't seem effected.The Bluetooth sucks. I had this thing in my ruck and my phone in my acu pocket. The device kept glitching like it was too far away to receive a signal. It says 34/35 ft but that is not correct.All in all I would return it and get my money back and spend it on a jbl speaker but it is too much of a hassle so I'm stuck with this crappy durable speaker.I've had it for 6 months and now it is broken. Won't get loud anymore. Pretty annoyed because the discription said it was for rough turrain but broke, couldn't handle it.
