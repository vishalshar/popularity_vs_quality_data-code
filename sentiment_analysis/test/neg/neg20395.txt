This thing looks good and sturdy, however it is trash.  The locking mechanism is worthless.  It consists of 2 clasps one that is supposed to lock the the front strap on one direction and another clasp to restrain it in the other.  Only one of those claps works and neither has enough force to hold the back strap down.  So basically the adjustment is constantly changing which makes this worthless.
