I cannot recommend this printer. I had to return it within a few days because it would not print. No matter how much I cleaned out the hot end and re-threaded filament, it would continue to jam and not print. I used cleaning filament and that would remove everything correctly but after putting in new filament it would extrude fine for a while and then jam, either during a print or testing it outside of a print. It would leak all the time if it was sitting with the hot end hot even though there was nothing being extruded into it.Amazon has a great return policy and I am eternally grateful for the ease of the return process.
