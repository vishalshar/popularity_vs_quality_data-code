The initial setup was quite easy and the finder actually worked. Things started to break down when I actually needed to find my keys.The app was unable to find the item even if it was sitting in the bag next to me. "Out of range" was the only message I was getting. Sometimes logging out and in helped, sometimes pairing the thing with my phone again helped. Sometimes the app told me that my phone is in a 5 miles shopping mall, while the keys are next to me.After that things started to at least work a little - the app knew about the item near. However "beeping" the keys worked only once after the very initial setup. Now it always stucks on "connecting". Nothing helps. So since I can't beep the device, which is the essential functionality of this thing, I can't really use it.In short: unreliable, buggy, not worth the $25, I'm returning the item.For reference, my phone is Nexus 5X.
