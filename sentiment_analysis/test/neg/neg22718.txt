Although the apps/android aspect was decent, the physical makeup of the phone is cheap.  I had this phone for literally a week until the screen stared pixelling out...Mind you, it was NEVER dropped, crushed, or handled with any sort of force. In fact, I took really good care of it when I used it and stored it in a soft case. DO NOT BUY!!! CHEAP AND BROKE WITHIN A WEEK OF PURCHASE- DUE TO NO FAULT OF MY OWN...YOU ARE FOREWARNED.*If Amazon would let me, I am uploading pics to show. As you will see, it is brand new looking (I literally just received this at the end of June) yet the screen decided to pixel out, which has been growing from a few pixels to a full line as pics will show.
