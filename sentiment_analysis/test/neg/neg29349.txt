You had a sleek design; not the bulky look of many other fitness trackers. Indeed, your pre-release advertisements showed how the tracker could be worn as a pendant as an elegant accessory.I received my Ray today, and after a bit of a challenge getting my Ray to update and sync, we were finally in business.My first disappointment... it appears that the tracking is wildly inaccurate. I took my normal 4.25 mile route, I wore another tracker on one side of my body, and the Ray on the opposite, non-dominant wrist.The results? Misfit recorded my 4.25 mile route as 2.71 miles and 5936 steps. My "other" device recorded my route as 4.26 miles and 8264 steps. That is off by between 28-36% off depending on which measurement is being tracked.It would appear my tracking inaccuracy is the opposite of what other Ray owners are experiencing.The second disappointment is that it appears there are no accessories available for this. No bands, no pendant chains... heck, not even any information on the website or available documentation as how the existing band can be removed/replaced.I do hope that Misfit/Fossil will address some of these issues in the near future.For now, however, I'll be sticking with my old reliable tracker as my health plan really places a lot of emphasis (financial incentive) on meeting certain activity benchmarks... and in my case, the Misfit is exactly that.
