Barely works with the iPad Pro!  Lag time and connection rate are substandard.  Works pretty good on the iPad but once you upgrade to iPad pro it is useless.  One would think it would work seamlessly with the Paper App; but it doesn't.  It is yesterday's hardware, obsolete and not comfortable in your hand.
