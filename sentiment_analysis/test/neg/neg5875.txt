I'm returning the unit because the first generation technology and software just doesn't live up to the hype.  I purchased a rangefinder instead.Usability:From tee to green the device is very simple to use.  You just tag your shot before you hit.  On the greens its a bit more tricky, since there's no built in way to identify the hole location, I found myself trying to tag extra shots at the hole sometimes, and forgetting to other times.  Editing all the hole locations and adding/deleting shots post-round was a pain and too time consuming.Accuracy:Long shots:  The gps can be off by several yards on both a shot's start point and finishing point, which for irons could potentially sum up to a full club. Since the point of this is to gather as much data about your yardages and tendencies as possible, it presents a huge problem.Putting: The devices accuracy limitation make it absolutely useless for gathering  putting data or statistics.Software:I could have lived with the devices accuracy issues if the software had made up for it, but sadly this is where Game Golf really does not live up to the hype.  There are several problems I'd like to point out:(1) Lack of useful stats.  This devices tracks GIR, Fairways, etc.  Thats it.  It doesn't record the direction of fairway or green misses.  Given all of the data the device gathers, Game Golf could easily compile stats for strokes gained driving, long irons, approach shots, etc.  You could compare yourself to golfers with various handicap levels, etc.  Sadly none of this exists.(2) No access to your raw data.  You get your club averages (which I think is the median of your distances) but thats it.  Since Game Golf doesn't disclose on their software exactly how they are coming up with the numbers, I have no idea what I'm actually looking at.  At least give me access to a downloadable csv file with all my data so I can figure out my own stats in excel.(3) Can't search users by golf course.  I have no idea which of my friends own the Game Golf device.  It would be nice to be able to view all of the users at a given course so you can compare yourself to your peers at your local club, etc.Conclusion:The stats just aren't complex enough for me.  I can track basic GIR, fairways, miss direction, etc on my phone easily when I enter my score for a given hole.  I purchased a Bushnell Rangefinder after using Game Golf and really like it significantly more.  I think right now the combination of using a smartphone app along with the rangefinder makes the most sense, at least until companies like Game Golf improve their software.
