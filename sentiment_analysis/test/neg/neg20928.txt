As others have noted, the price is steep. I was willing to pay that for this item assuming it delivered on the goods. It works well. So what's the scoop?At the Belle-V website, there is a page called "Story" ([...]). It shows a cut-in-half longitudinal section of the handle of a polished finish scoop, presumably the stainless model sold at this page. The picture shows a solid metal handle.This is not how my Belle-V stainless scoop is constructed. The handle is hollow. No, it does not feel flimsy as a result of this. But the image on the manufacturer's site is dishonest about the construction of the item. I believed I was purchasing an item with a solid steel handle, especially when the associated section of the pages is discussing its "heirloom quality."The text about "all-metal construction" is true. With a hollow handle, though, it's kind of like saying a balloon has "all-rubber construction."While the item is still nice to use, each time I use it I am reminded about the marketing and that the design team behind Belle-V doesn't care to let the customers for their luxury product know the full story.
