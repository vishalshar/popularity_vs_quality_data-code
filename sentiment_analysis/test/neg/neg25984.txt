The scooter ran good except it starting leaking propane from the line. Filled the house with a propane gas. Could of killed us. Customer service from pro go is absolutely terrible. Could not get them to call me back or email me back. Called 50 times, emailed 100 times. It's a shame. It could be a great product.
