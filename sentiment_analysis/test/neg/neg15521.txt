I really tried hard to find something positive about this product.  I failed.  Basically a cheap plastic handle with a couple of rubber bands & a couple of paper clips . The arrow which looks like it's lined up with the marker plate is in fact about an inch away & consequently lines up with nothing.  The Plate for marking focus gets knocked over every time you reach for the handle. Its just held on with a thin rubber band & is beyond fiddly to try & stand up.  The handle itself is also held on by a thin rubber band & has a ridiculous amount of play forward & back.  Not sure how this ever made it to production.  I did try it on 3 different lenses.  It goes back today.
