Dont do it!!!  Had it for three weeks its worked out of the box great fro 10 hours then down hill from there.  System always had trouble finding my dog or said he was near the base, and we would be in the next town over.  Customer support is slow, takes days to get replies.  Had to do multiple steps to try to make it work.  They finally send me a new one, same problem.  Always get cant located Tucker.  So its worthless luckly he comes to me when I call.  If you want to spend money on something that will take you hours to try to make work, countless email, high frustration level but a expensive gadget on your dogs collar then order right away!!  Ive been sending emails for the last few days about please give me my money back with no luck.Take my advice spend 70 dollars on an other item, dog training for your dog so he stays with you better or just threw your money in the air like you just dont care and make it rain!
