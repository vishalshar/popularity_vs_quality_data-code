I have bought over 3 dozen of the "regular"mugs to give as gifts etc.for co-workers and a non profit I belong to.  Really liked them and even brought 2 for myself.  However these Pilsner Glasses were a big disappointment.  First of all they came wrapped in bubble wrap and not the nice boxes the others come in.  Secondly they do not work at all.  Its a waste of money so beware.  Cannot recommend the regular mighty mugs enough however do not waste your money on the Pilsner.
