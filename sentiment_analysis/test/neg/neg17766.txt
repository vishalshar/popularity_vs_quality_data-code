Has a decent caramel taste (2 stars) but remains soggy on freshly popped popcorn. Messy to eat. Pretty sad. I followed the very simple directions. It appears it is supposed to harden soon per directions but after 1/2 hour - no change.I was tempted to bake it like my other caramel corn recipies but I wanted to give the included instructions a chance. Will not buy again unless it can be guaranteed to turn into brittle!
