This clock is really only ok. As an alarm clock its fine, and I think the speakers are not half bad, and the white back light is actually really nice and I like that its dim able, but as a whole, with the spotify, the multi color lights and the really important broken app that controls the clock and its key features basically rendering them useless, its not great, and probably not worth the price. This was honestly a good idea, but I think the execution sucks. I also do not like the cloth like texture in the front, I just don't get it, while I can see the time just fine, it still bothers me, and I hate that I couldn't recognize that from the pictures, thinking it was a display in the front, I almost feel duped, but I learned to live with it. I just shouldn't have to. The only 3 buttons I use on top, is the first one to turn on and off the back light, and each of the 3 buttons have 3 different settings base on how you press them, and I still only use 1 out 9. Everything that this clock can tell you about the weather, or traffic, or even music comes from my phone via bluetooth and I just feel like I could have done the exact same thing if I just asked my phone and sometimes when waking up, the bluetooth would be disconnected even though I used it last night before bed and I have to use my phone anyways. So yeah to summarized, this clock can't do anything but tell time, charge your stuff, and act as a nightlight, if its not connected to your phone. It gets 3 stars for doing the bare minimum an alarm clock should do, but just lost one when I realized I couldn't even set an alarm without my phone.
