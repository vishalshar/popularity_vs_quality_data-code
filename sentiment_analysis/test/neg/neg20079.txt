This drone is very cool. Somehow very durable. It's nice that is comes with extra props, because although they don't really break, they get bent and nicked and will affect flight. Easy to control with the iPhone, but my controller does not work.Also, the camera does not work. I think this is an app problem, but still, without a functional camera this drone is the same as their camera-less one in the 40 dollar range. Reached out to Mota over a week ago now and they still have not replied, despite saying on their website that it would be within one business day. Will return if no reply is made quickly.
