I really wanted to like this printer. It's simple and clean and sturdy. Unfortunately, after just a few test prints the printer just started acting buggy. No matter how many times I calibrated it, it was a gamble each time if the printer would print correctly. Nothing was obviously broken. The factory rep was very nice to work with but I wasted days just trying to make it work. Note: even if the print time is ten minutes, the bed must heat up first which takes about 5 minutes, then the nozzle which also takes some time before the print actually starts. If the print is canceled, the bed and nozzle must also cool down for nearly ten minutes just to open the door, so each failed print actually took close to 30 minutes and I must have had 30 failed prints out of 50. The thing is, when it prints correctly it's awesome.
