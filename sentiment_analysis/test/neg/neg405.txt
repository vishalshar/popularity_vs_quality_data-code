After spending an additional $20 on goats milk, it was so disappointing when this cheese never formed up at all. It was too thin to catch when straining through the cheese cloth provided. I tried contacting this company via Facebook and they said they would email/message me but never did. Won't waste this money again. Home brewing was much more fruitful.
