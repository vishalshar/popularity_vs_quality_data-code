If you are iPhone users: Disco mode, color effect and all other effects will not work if your phone is locked, so practically, you end up buying a single colored phone.Pros-Good Responsive to Wi-Fi-App download and app itself are smooth.-Packaging was nice-Disco feature is fantastic and works well (but see cons).-Good/Rich looking bulb-supports all voltages, internationally, i am using on 240 V.Cons-Color change mode and disco mode works only if the iPhone is ON and the app is on the screen. Dont know about android, but i assume same issue there too.-Higher Lumens as advertised is only white lumens, color lumens are low, for example if you select green color and increase brightness, after 50% it will start to become white. Hence this bulb is not bright color bulb. In case of white, yes it is bright.unfortunately, my purpose of buying this bulb was 2 cons mentioned above and Wi-Fi feature. Wi-Fi feature is good, but bulbs are sitting in the corner (neither kids are interested in it) hence 1 star.Who should buy this bulb and not get dissapointment. One looking to keep one color all the time and dont expect too much brightness from colors.
