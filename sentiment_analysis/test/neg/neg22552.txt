This barely works as a Phantom 4 backpack.  It's basically a camera bag that happens to barely be big enough to work as a drone backpack.  The inserts aren't even made for a Phantom 4, nor are they arranged for a Phantom 4 drone when you get it.  You will spend 30min figuring out just how you want the inserts install to be the most effective, a waste of my time. The TSA lock is an interesting idea, but I'll never check my drone bag, I'm buying a backpack SPECIFICALLY to carry my drone onto a plane, so the lock is worthless, something I don't want or need.  The real problem is the back isn't the right height.  The drone arms overlap other compartments because the bag isn't big enough, no designed for P4.  What's crazy is the access to the drone is from the back of the backpack (the side that rests on your back while hiking), and there are other compartments on the front side.  For a drone, this is terrible ergonomics.  I want all stored items accessible from one side, period.  I don't want to have flip the pack over, back and forth to access everything, a really dumb design.  But like I said, this wasn't designed for a drone.  The zippers are often binding becasue the bag is slightly too small.  You have to move things around to get the drone to fit each time you zip up.  Oh, and when you open the main compartment, there's another skirt that's zippered over all the gear, so you have two layers of zippered lids to open to access the drone compartment.  Dumb!  I sent it back the day after I got it. For the same $120 price the ProCraft backpack is much better value.  However the best Phantom 4 backpack is the Think Tank Helipak for $200.
