Purchased Beddi with great expectations.The hardware is clean and impressive. It would be a decent $30 system with some more manual functionality.The app is an absolute embarrassment. I have an Galaxy S6, and have downloaded BEDDI seven times hoping it would work. The app has yet to successfully launch. This is very frustrating. On top of a potato of an app platform, while this app was installed, it drained my battery like no other. I think I lost 60% in about 40 minutes of non use.I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is simply not ready, and very overpriced.
