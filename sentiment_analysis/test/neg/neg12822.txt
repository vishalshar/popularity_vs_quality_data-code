I bought these for my son's shoes so he could just slip them on. They are very durable but they never stay closed. They are unisex but they must only fit a small size range of shoes because they stick up on his shoes instead of laying flat. I thought they would be stretchy but they are not. They are a hard standard size rubber with no give.
