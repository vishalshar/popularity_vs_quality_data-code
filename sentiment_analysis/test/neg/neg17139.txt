I bought this phone to replace my wife's broken samsung, and had planned to get another for myself good thing i only bought one, and will be the only Posh i will ever buy. Phone size is reasonable, OS as good as any Android I have used, wifi, bluetooth good, network antenna reasonable, however 13mp camera both back and front sucks, pictures are very grainy, and slow to respond. Battery drains quickly and phone gets hot.The camera write up made me choose this phone over other similar units.
