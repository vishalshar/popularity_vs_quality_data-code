Thus far the auto unlock when you arrive home is mostly a fail. Which they touted as a primary reason to purchase.  I was disappointed to learn that Alexa/echo cannot unlock the door. She will only lock it. The alexa app once launched wants to stay on.  You will find yourself arguing with Alexa to get the August app to shut down.  When you arrive home it shows you a map of where you have been (if that even works).... but it still doesn't unlock the door on time.  It takes less time to launch the app and tell it to unlock or just use your key. I'm also not sure I trust the auto lock.  It doesn't trigger for a preset time after you leave the house. If for whatever reason you didn't fully close the door and the lock can't throw then your home sits unlocked until you get back (but the app says it's locked)... imagine if you went on vacation. Overall it's a decent idea... but it'll have issues until they can figure out how to make it react a lot quicker.  It's a product that's not quite ready for "prime time".  If at a minimum the auto-unlock when you get home feature worked it would be OK.  I have reached out to customer service several times. They responded right up until I told them I was using an Android phone then they disappeared.  They are telling me to make changes in the app that doesn't exist.  If they respond and get the issue fixed I'll update this review....  (12/17/2016)
