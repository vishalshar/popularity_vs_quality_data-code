Shutter clicks every 3-5 seconds, can't imagine why as it doesnt change the image or temperature displayed, does it while holding the camera still, all it does is freeze the display for a few seconds and that every 3-5 seconds is very. very annoying on the verge of making this unusable.It will display the temperature of the hottest thing in view, however supports no functionality for say "touch to display temperature" or a way to save images and have multiple temperatures read later on. App rotates the screen when the screen rotation is locked. Connected it to a samsung galaxy s4 running cyanogen and it displayed a black screen, so resorted to my nexus 6 with an adapter which makes it completely unwieldy as my usb connector is reversed and having to use two hands to aim the camera is just poor design, why not make a model with a rotating usb plug? So finally, there is the low field of view which really makes this seem like a toy.One star, and forget using this thing outdoors, it displays blurry images past about a foot away and takes no accurate temperatures outside, also the entire border of the image displays as though other reviewers have said "leaking" as if light is leaking into the edges of the sensor. Included picture outside was taken in 22F weather with snow on the ground, two dogs in view! The other are a series of ferrite chokes with the sensor extremely close.
