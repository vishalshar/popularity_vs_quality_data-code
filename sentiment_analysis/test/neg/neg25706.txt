trying to control this device with the Echo is impossible. getting it to pair up with my network is a painfully exhausting tortuous task. it only wants to be run by a smartphone which I don't intend to own. the dlink system is NOT worth all the aggravation it is putting me through ! ! !  I want to operate the dlink switch from my Kindle Fire HD or by way of Alexa. If you know how to help me out, PLEASE do it.
