I really like the idea of locking and unlocking my computer without typing the password after every time and automatically it goes to  sleep and this device has the key idea for that. But unfortunately this device still has so many issues before became a real alternative for that purpose. First of all this product is not a registered product at the App Store for Mac and not even an identify developer. From that start I think it is very bad because in terms of software security I don't even know how this company is going to use my computer information or where it goes to. I anyway gave a shot to this product and unlocked my computer to allow third party applications to be installed in my Mac. I installed the software, plugged the USB terminal, ran the program, registered a new GateKeeper key, touch the GateKeeper to the USB terminal and right after it said that the new key was successfully registered, the program is supposed to ask me for my computer credentials to allow the GateKeeper to log-in and log-out to my computer and this step never happened and the program starts running like the GateKeeper is successfully connected to my Mac without the credentials or password.  I unregistered the key several times and repeat the steps over and over with the same result. I know this is a Beta version for Mac but at least should be able to lock and unlock in some point.I tried the device with my iPhone 6 running on 9.3.2 iOS version and it does not work either. It keeps saying "No device found" when I tried to add a new key.I definitely like the idea and I like to support small companies or startups, but they definitely should release the product when it's more ready and avoid bad customer experiences. I would love to change my review in the future when they released a new firmware or version completely compatible with Mac and IOS.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review all opinions are entirely my own and based on my own experiences.
