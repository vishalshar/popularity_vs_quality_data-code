Plain are delicious but all the flavors are horrendous. They taste like...Hmmm...chemicals? I would think there aren't chemicals in them but it doesn't matter because the HOUR LONG AFTER TASTE IS SOOOO BAD and so much like non-food flavor. I bought this because the plain I ordered were so delicious but gave them away because only the plain is edible.
