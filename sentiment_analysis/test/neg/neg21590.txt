The disappointment when real world performance doesn't live up to expectations is painful.My experience:  6 month old Netgear Nighthawk Router compared to Portal Router in a highly congested Urban Wifi Apartment.BEFORE PORTAL = 8-12 clients on my home network.  (Printer, Cell phone, laptop, Smart TV, Chromecast, etc).  Most connect to 5Ghz channels, while a few older devices only connect through 2.4Ghz channels.  The amount of network congestion on the 2.4Ghz bands in a NYC apartment is high, so the few device without 5Ghz connectivity perform poorly.  The 5ghz connected devices perform well, as there's much less interference, without Portal.  However, move far away from the router and 5Ghz access is lost, since these frequency cannot penetrate as well as 2.4Ghz, but the apartment is not that big, so ... its not that big of a problem.AFTER PORTAL = As promised, Portal finds an utterly uncongested channel in the 5Ghz DFS band.  Pefect.  However, the overwhelming majority of devices are not able to connect using that new Portal DFS channel. Since they cannot see Portal's fast lane channels, all of my devices are forced to connect exclusively to the highly congested 2.4GHz.  Updating Portal Firmware = no change. Updating every clients firmware/drivers = no change.  The throughput, latency, range, and reliability of my home wifi network is markedly decreased following installation of the Portal Router, since adding portal essentially means the complete loss of 5Ghz channels.Caveat #1 - I can see how it is quite possible that using the Portal Router in a MESH configuration would provide superior performance.  The portal APs could use the free and clear DFS channels to create a MESH backbone.  And the local 2.4Ghz network would provide client connectivity.  Interference would be overcomes so long as the number of APs was sufficient to ensure short range connections has high 2.4Ghz signal-to-noise ratios.Caveat #2 - If the Next Gen of Wifi Devices is built to include DFS channel compatibility, the Portal Router could be tremendously advantageous.  The question is . . . do Next Gen Devices, like Chromecast Ultra support the use of DFS channels ?
