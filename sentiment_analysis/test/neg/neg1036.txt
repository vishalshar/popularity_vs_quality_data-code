I bought this to replace another brand of the same thing. That one worked well until it didn't, and this one was on Prime, so I went for it. The batteries died before it ever caught any mice. I gave my old one another go, and it caught a mouse within minutes. While the concept is great, the particular one that I bought seems to be a dud.
