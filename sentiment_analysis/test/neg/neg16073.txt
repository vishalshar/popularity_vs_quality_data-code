Lots of problems connecting the bulb to my iPhone 6. Had to power cycle the bulb and WIFI several times. When the app finally connected to the bulb it could not seem to switch the bulb from its own WIFI network to my home WIFI network (powered by a previous generation Apple Airport Extreme). After lots of failed attempts I finally got it working.Within an hour of things finally working the app kept pestering me about a firmware update. For future designers of smart lightbulbs please don't make us manually apply and babysit firmware updates. Nobody wants to struggle with firmware updates for lightbulbs.The firmware update failed spectacularly. The bulb went into rescue mode and I had to download some desktop software to re-apply the firmware update. The first time it hung on "uploading the firmware". The software gave no indication that things timed out or failed so that was a wasted half hour. Second time it finally applied the firmware update in a few minutes. After that the bulb disappeared from the WIFI networks and I had to reset it in order to struggle through the process of getting it connected again.If you're interested in wasting hours with a thinly veiled computer that can barely operate a light bulb go for it, otherwise look elsewhere.
