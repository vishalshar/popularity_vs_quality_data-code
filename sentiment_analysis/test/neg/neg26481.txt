Given the price, I expected a lot more.I purchased two boxes.  The pink box arrived on time.  The blue was delayed.  On both boxes, the thermos comes detached from the plastic compartment case.  For the pink one, I fastened it by aligning the threads, filled it with water and then screwed on the cap.  In part I wanted to check if it would leak and also to see how my kid would do with unscrewing it.  The first thing I noticed was that it leaked.  There is no ring seal with the box, so all I could do was tug a bit harder. That seemed to have done it because it stopped leaking for the moment.  My kids (8 and 6) were both able to unscrew the lid with minimal spilling. So that's not bad.  Now for the blue one that arrived about a week or so later.  I can not tighten the thermos to the plastic compartment.  It's almost as if the threads are worn.  Hence, that one leaks all over the place and would only be minimally useful for other warm foods but certainly not soup, despite what the promotional video would have you believe.As for keeping things warm, they both seem to keep food warm-ish.  To test, I used a digital thermometer.  I filled the thermos with boiling water, I then dumped the water and measured 120 degrees for the empty container, filled it was super hot mac and cheese.  Nearly 3.5 hours later the container had lost about 20 degrees.  So the food was warm enough but not as warm as I had hoped for.  I packed grapes and carrots and a dry snack.  Those compartments measured 75 degrees which I thought was way too hot for a box that claims to keep hot food hot and cold food cold with two temperature zones.I did not put the box inside of an insulated lunch box case with an ice pack.  I thought that would be a tad redundant.  Perhaps I am just not using it correctly :( .As it stands, I wouldn't buy this again (esp since these set me back $80!) particularly because one is most definitely defective and the other may later experience the same leaking problems it started with.  So there is very little confidence now in the product overall.I returned the blue one today 9/8 thankfully, Amazon is great and refunded me the cost immediately.  I am going to give the pink one another shot today but, honestly, confidence is gone that it will work as promised.  I will likely return that one too.  What a shame.  I really wanted this product to deliver on its promises.
