I've never grown mushrooms before, but I thought this kit would be a great place to start since it advertises that it's great for children.  I love the idea of recycling coffee grounds this way and was extremely excited to receive this kit.I'm a bit ashamed to admit, nothing is growing!  I followed all of the direction, it's been about a week and nothing!  I want to think that I am the problem, but I'm actually a pretty good gardener.  I'm not sure what to say.  I suppose I'll wait another week and then contact the company.  The directions are so simple, I'm not sure how I could have done it wrong....
