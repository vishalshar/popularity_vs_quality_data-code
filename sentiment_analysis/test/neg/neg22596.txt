I bought one of these in the summer, because I had seen a couple little bitty mice near the chicken coop.  I set it up, and within a couple hours checked it and already had a dead mouse.  Reset it, and had another by morning.  I thought I was going to love this thing!  So I set it again, and when I checked back, that light was blinking-- but no dead mouse.  I could not get it properly set again, and this started internet searches for trouble shooting, and reaching out to the company.  Turns out you have to take the batteries out and soak it to clean it, then it takes quite some time to air dry thoroughly.  So I did all this, and it still would not set.  After a few days of intermittently messing with it, it seemed to work long enough to get a third mouse.  I did not see any more mice, so I put it away.Fast forward to December.  I see a mouse, then I see a bigger mouse.  So I retrieve the zapper.  It's dusty so brush it off real good, then do the soaking thing, then air dry.  Light won't even come on.  So for good measure I wipe it all down again, soak it again, and let it dry.  Light won't come on, not one bit.  I take all the batteries out, and put them all back in.  No good.  So I replace all four batteries.  No good.  Wiggle the wires?  No good.  Curse and threaten it?  No good.  Tested those new batteries in another appliance and they work perfect.  So I have a freshly bathed Raticator, with fresh batteries, and I can't get the darn thing to even power on.  The mice are laughing at me.I'm bummed.  The product is not as easy to use as I would have hoped, you do have to mess with it.  Not ideal, but workable.  But now that I need it to work, and have spend way too much time messing with it, I have nothing workable.
