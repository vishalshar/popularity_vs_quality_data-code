Doesn't live up to the promise in the description. In good light the picture quality was pretty good. However, the pictures were always of the ceiling or tilted. If it was dark out, you might as well not even use it. There was no way to see if the pictures being taken were at a good angle until you synced it to your computer. It took forever for pictures to sync to the online service, which I was not impressed with. I went for a long walk to see what kind of pictures were being taken when I was constantly moving. Not having high hopes, I was outraged to find out that it didn't even take any pictures for the whole 2 hours. I brought this to capture random moments while hiking or on vacation and I can't even trust it to take pictures. Plus everything was at chest level and not really good for POV.Very cool concept with very poor execution.
