First. Let's note that they removed the word "thermal" on their description on the Nightowl website which is why I bought it. Their packaging makes it look like there is a thermal image showing. All my cameras have passive infrared sensors already. What makes these different?  Who knows as there was no difference in the performance.Second. These are made of the cheapest plastic and I can't believe these are weatherproof. They are so light they feel like a toy.Feels more like false advertising to me.
