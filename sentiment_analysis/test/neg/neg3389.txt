There is a straight line visible across the video on one of the cameras after a few days of use. Plus, There is no setting whatsoever in the HDA-DVR to record only when both motion and heat are detected. Motion's still recording without heat's detecting!!!!! Make sure your device is fully compatible with it. What is a fake product. Will return it.
