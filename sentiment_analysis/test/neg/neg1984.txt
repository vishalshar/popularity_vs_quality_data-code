This is far and away the most attractive brick I have ever purchased. Honestly, though, calling it a brick is an insult to bricks, which of course do not pretend to be anything other than bricks. This beauty is completely maddening because every now and then (no rhyme or reason) it works, beautifully. And we fool ourselves into thinking it will finally do all it promised to do. And then it doesn't. Again. And then we spend hours trying to reconnect it again, to get it to play music when we ask it to and at the volumes we request. Again. And then we say, "oh well, at least it is an attractive brick." And the cycle starts all over again.
