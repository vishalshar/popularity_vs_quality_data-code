I am not very pleased with the D-Link DSP-W110 Wi-Fi Smart Plug - I purchased 3 to control some fans.  I have about a dozen other home automation Wi-Fi devices from other manufacturers and the D-Link are by far the LEAST reliable.  They tend to go off line frequently, requiring a restart (unplug, replug, wait).I have a schedule set for my 3 switches to turn on and off the same time every day (air circulation fans are connected).  Well, when I turned a couple of them off via the iPhone app, it turned itself back on.  I contacted the support online and they said they were not seeing the issue, suggested deleting and resetting the schedule which I did.  Still the same issue.
