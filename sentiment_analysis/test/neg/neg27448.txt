I'm very disappointed in the game I rec'd.  Although this game could be extremely fun & entertaining, it is my belief I have rec'd a knock off edition.  There are several duplicate cards, a lot of them have incorrectly spelled words, that aren't even words! The package came shipped from China and the game box was all smashed.  I'm so mad that I ended up getting who knows what from who knows where!!! I mean, I'm not so sure these mouthpieces are even safe to put in my mouth!  What if there are some type of weird chemicals on them???  GRRRR!!!!  Thanks for fake crap, China people.
