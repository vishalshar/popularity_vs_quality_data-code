It was a unique experience before the app update in June 2016 but now it looks like any other wearable's app. Tracking is also unreliable since update; I've had to disconnect it as a source from the Apple Health app because it recorded unrealistic numbers such as 30,000 steps in a day. Also, it used to give a calories burned number for the whole day and now it only shows calories burned when it records activity. There is no longer a calendar that helps a person discover their personal patterns of calm, focus and activity.Three months ago I purchased the Spire and was very happy with the app and the tracking. Last month they updated the app and now it is unrecognizable. No longer a positive experience - the interface is boring, uninspiring and might as well be Fitbit.As of July 5, they were apologetic but no resolution (nor a return to the functioning, mindfull interface).
