If you want a lash builder use Orgins or something that is half the price and does a way better job! -- It appears there is barely any product in the tube and I will get several uses out of it before its dried up and I have to throw it outNo way worth the money - its like a cheap dime store brand - I can barely see a difference - you still have to apply mascara if you want any color or thickness to your lash
