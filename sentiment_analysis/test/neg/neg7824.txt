Living in Los Angeles, we haven't had much to go on regarding the smartness of the smart watering since we installed this device. But that changed last night when we had a large rainstorm. This morning I checked the Blossom app and was disappointed to see that Blossom had conducted a full 45-minute watering cycle literally at the same time as the rainstorm.It's a nice, simple and easy to use controller if you want to use it manually, but from what I've seen the weatherbased element is totally useless - and that's the sole reason we got this thing.
