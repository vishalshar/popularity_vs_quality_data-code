I ordered this phone for my husband primarily for the ease of use and large buttons and display. We had problems with it almost from the beginning. Buttons began to stick and not respond, phone would not turn on all the time and we would have to try multiple times in order to get it on, no call waiting, you cannot view missed calls unless the number is on your contacts list. I really could go on and on. It became so frustrating we have already thrown it away and replaced. Do not recommend it to anyone.
