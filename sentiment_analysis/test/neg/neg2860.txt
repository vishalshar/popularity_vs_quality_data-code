"Fails to onboard." It's a common error, it seems. When I submit a trouble ticket to LIFX, I get a reply letting me know they're busier than usual, and it might take a while for them to get back to me. Looks like I'll be returning this not-ready-for-primetime dud.My IT/tech level is high. If I can't get this thing working, I know plenty of other people are having the same problem. I poked around online and found many troubleshooting suggestions. None of them worked. The contents of my trouble ticket to LIFX is below.Hi!LIFX 800 Fails to onboard. I've reset the light, app, phone, changed from AES to TKIP+AES, changed mode from "up to 217 mbps" to "up to 54 mbps", then to "up to 450 mbps", changed lease time from 3600 to 7200. ...and done some other bulb and app resetting. Nothing works. Same error. My tech level is high. Willing to try whatever. Going to return this to Amazon if we can't get it worked out pretty quickly. Thanks for your help!UPDATE:LIFX support has been surprisingly prompt, and while it's obvious this product works for many, it's just as clear that it doesn't work for plenty of us. They say that my very modern and common, Netgear CG3000 series router doesn't play well with the old firmware, but the firmware update process more or less bricked my LIFX, and it's not doing what they normally expect from a device rescue mode. (No SSID to be found.) They want it back to examine.But my router plays well with: Echo, Sensi, and several other wireless peripherals.LIFX is the oddball here.I've wasted WAY too much time to give them any more of it for nothing. I told them that if they want me to send this back to them in exchange for another, they're going to have to incentivize me, somehow. Otherwise, I'm sending this dud back to Amazon for a refund in a few days and wiping my hands of it. I'll never get the frustrating time back. Wish I'd been doing something else other than troubleshooting a #@$ing lightbulb.
