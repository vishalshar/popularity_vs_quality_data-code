I found this difficult to deal with.  First, as others have commented, it was difficult to attach with a cover on my android so I used a cable.  That really didn't work well for me because it was hard to aim.  There is a delay in the refresh rate so when you aim it at something it takes a second or two to "materialize".  By that time you are not sure where you have aimed it if you are holding it by hand and if you are still there. Further, I did not find a way to overlay a photograph on the thermal image as some cameras do.  I was "lost" looking at globs of color.  I attempted to focus but with the combined bouncing around and refresh delay it was very difficult. I am a novice at thermal imaging.  Perhaps someone with more experience knows how to do this better such as a stationery mount of some sort.  But for my application where I want to move around easily I found holding the camera apart from the smart phone cumbersome and impractical.  I am returning this camera and am investigating FLIR cameras which are more expensive but they  do overlay the thermal image with an optical image so you know where you are, and exactly what is causing the temperature variations.  The overlay feature is worth the extra money for me.
