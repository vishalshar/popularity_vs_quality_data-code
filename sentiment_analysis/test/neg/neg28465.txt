The only reason I gave this product 2 stars instead of one is that my husband said "Don't return them, I'll eat them." I won't eat them as they are neither crispy or crunchy. . I've tried many brands of dried apples over the years but these are the worse. . They are extremely dried up(maybe stale is the right word as another reviewer stated), tough to chew and pieces of the skin remain in my mouth to spit out. They're not sweet at all. I purchased these on the wonderful 5 star reviews  I read but I certainly can't agree. I cancelled my subcription a day after I received them.Update: One hour later:  I am returning these. My husband has opted out of eating these as I just told him one 30 gram bag equals about 3 portions. He has to watch his sugar intake. THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE pictured on Amazon is for a 12 gram bag. This is VERY misleading as the bags you receive are 30 grams. I  naturally zoomed in on the nutritional value. The comparison between the 12 gram and 30 gram  bag is SUGAR 7g/21g, CARBS 8g/26g, CALORIES 29/90. I bought these not realizing I was reading the 12 gram nurtritional value.
