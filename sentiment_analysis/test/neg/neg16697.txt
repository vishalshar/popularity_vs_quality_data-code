So I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because there are 2 parts:1) There are 2 parts. In addition to the batter there is the front part. This part is completely USELESS. The power and volume buttons are reversed so in effect you cant use either. There is a plastic cover to protect the screen as well: this COMPLETELY blocks the Home button thus preventing you from using this button as well. The plastic cover is NOT removeable without damaging the outer case. If you leave this part off you have a phone that swivels while in the battery case and while the battery portion is plugged in you have to choose between a protected phone you cant use with the outer care OR COMPLetely unprotected phone.1) The backup chargeable battery itself is great. The indicator lights that let  you know how charged the battery is great. It also is great at charging the iphone. On this part of the equipment I have no complaintsI am only keeping the battery portion for when i travel and need an addition charge  BUT dont plan on using the phone. I am in the process of looking for another charging case.
