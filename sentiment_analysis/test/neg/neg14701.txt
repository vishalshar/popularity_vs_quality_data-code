I have to agree with the other disappointed posters. The only reason I ordered from this seller is that the game seemed to be sold out everywhere else. I was excited to find it available here. However, this is definitely not a legitimate version of the game. I was surprised that it arrived shipped from China, and it was smashed, like many others reported! There were no instructions included, so although we knew the gist of it, did not know anything about partners, teams, scoring, etc. The cards and mouthpieces seemed new, but the cards are a joke. Like others reported, many phrases make no sense, and many words are misspelled, as though they were translated by someone who doesn't speak English. Reading through the cards once was good for a laugh, but it is impossible to play the game. Amazon needs to remove this version of the game from their site.
