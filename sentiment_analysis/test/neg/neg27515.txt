While the actual whistle part works the plastic part that attaches it to the collar has now broken twice. Asked their customer service and they have decided to not replace it but want me to pay a total of $10 for a part that should not of broken after only a few months of use. The entire thing is now completely unusable and will now buy the competitor product.
