I would give this 2.5 stars. I bought two of these, one for each of my sons, for their birthdays. The idea is really neat that they can take their Minecraft worlds with them, and the Pixel Furnace app is really easy to use to personalize the pictures that scroll across the band. My youngest son loved his and wore it almost every day.As great as I initially thought it was, I now have issues with it:-First, it was a little annoying because I would plug it into his computer to charge it when it died, but most of the time when I would unplug it the time was incorrect and I would have to plug it in 1-2 more times, open the Pixel Furnace app, and eject it again to correct the time.-Second, after a month of my son wearing his, it will no longer work when not plugged into the computer. It shows the charging icon when plugged in, but when unplugged the screen no longer works which leads me to believe there is something wrong with the battery, and of course there is no way to replace the battery.-Third, I am frustrated because I contacted the company about the issue of it no longer working and have heard nothing back from them. Apparently they don't stand by their product and now I have a disappointed little boy and a piece of junk. At least I didn't spend $80 on it or I'd be steaming mad.Edited 11/18/16: Changed to one star, our other Game Band is now exhibiting the same issue.
