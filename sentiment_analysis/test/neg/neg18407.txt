So far this is dead on accurate. I am careful not to drop it or let the tape slide in too fast. Can't be beat for inside dead on measurements.  I feel is was well worth the money I paid for it. Some of the other reviews made me question if it was accurate or not but this one is dead on still.UpdateWell, I see not this is been discontinued by the manufacturer. I purchased this in Aug 2015, always kept it in the drawer and only used it in the house, never been dropped and now, its junk. You have to Zero it every time and still can't trust it. Fresh battery (old one was still 3 volts) but never the less, expensive mistake on my part.
