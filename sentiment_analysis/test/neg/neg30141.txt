This is a great idea, and would be a great product if it worked longer than a few days at a time. just poor execution. When it works, it's wonderful. It updates current weight in the cloud, and that data syncs with things like Microsoft Health automatically.The problem is that it sucks the life out of batteries. I've had it for 3-4 weeks and changed the batteries 3 times already (it takes 4 AA's).Worse still, every time the batteries die and need to be replaced you have to reprogram it to connect to the internet. And doing that is not very straight forward or intuitive; it requires you to disconnect a computer from the internet and temporarily connect to this device's access point (which may or may not be broadcasting - it's very finicky). Lots of trying over and over again until it sticks. Very frustrating.The startup effort wouldn't be too bad if it truly was just startup effort, but having to replace the batteries every few weeks and reprogram the device to connect is way more effort than just typing your weight into a tracking Web site once and a while. Save your money.
