The size and sleek design is a great compliment to the MacBook. However, it is a very brittle device, innovative design but poor construction quality. Just the act of plugging it and removing it has caused the outer shell fasteners to break and separate from the chassis. Also, It is a constant challenge to keep the SD card USB C connectors securely plugged in to make contact to charge and transfer data. I ended up buying the Apple dongle for more than 2x but well worth it.
