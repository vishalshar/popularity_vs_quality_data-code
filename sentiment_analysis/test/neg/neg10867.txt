Great bulb. Lots of colors. Integrates well with Smartthings.Using this with the stand-alone app and integrating with multiple smartthings smartapps.Update: 3/14/16-Bulb no longer connects to Wifi. Flickers while on every few seconds (read it is due to dropping of wifi and reconnecting). I have updated to the latest firmware, reset the bulb many times, but always get "lifx failed to onboard you're bulb" every time I try to re-add it. Bulb shows up in the app and then goes away. It is no longer usable. Haven't even owned the bulb for 6 months.
