I purchased this product on June 21, 2016 planning to save it for vacation this October which I did.  After having been in contact with the Customer Service Dept. of Great Call and getting a new phone number I began reading up on the manual, etc. only to find out that to have the 5* medical FALL alert you would have to purchase the costliest plan.  After much contemplation and understanding the various plans and amounts I came to the conclusion that this model would not work for me.  So I went away on vacation with no phone.  I have read the terms of the Return Policy and noted that I was way beyond the return date.I now have a Smartphone that I will not use as I have purchased a separate medical device made by another company.  However, I would like to "donate" this phone and am wondering does Amazon.com provide this option?  .....or another suggestion???Thank you.
