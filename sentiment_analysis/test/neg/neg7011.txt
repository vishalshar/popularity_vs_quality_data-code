With the coffee-brown box I was expecting it to be coffee, not something you added to you coffee; oh well, my fault for not reading more carefully.I do love hazelnut flavored coffee, so I told myself it was not a total loss, I will just add it to my existing unflavored coffee... Nope, makes the coffee awful!  I do not recommend.
