Well, green apples are sour, I should have known better.  The chips themselves are not nearly dried enough, some are mush, some dried, some mush in the center.  Very bizarre shapes and size chips.  As if they used the peels from a pie factory to make these (feels like a bag of scraps, to be honest).Simply, avoid!
