I was so excited to get this and use it as my mp3 player for my Christmas vacation.  I got it  put the battery in and nothing ... ok maybe a dead battery.  I left it charging for 2 hours and still nothing.  I really wish it worked but after this experience and reading all the bad reviews I wont be trying out the Posh micro any time soon.  Returned next day !
