The recipe has changed.  I have been ordering this for years since I have a bag each day with lunch.  Well my latest order of exactly the same item is different.  The type of apple has changed (it seems).  The thickness of the chips has changed.  The flavor has changed.  I am not sure I will order any more because I do not like the new chip and there is no way of telling in advance which one you get.
