Ordered the larger version of this as well as this package of the smaller ones. I love the large one.....this one my toddler sets off crying and was driving my dogs nuts. If you're trying to decide between this and the larger version of this one (PetSafe Ultrasonic Indoor Bark Control, PBC-1000) then choose that one. I love the other version of this, hate this one. If you don't have kids will probably be ok for you though.
