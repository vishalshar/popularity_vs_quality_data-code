Positives- It was supposed to arrive Sunday but it arrived Saturday instead (thanks Amazon!).Negatives - Most annoying product I have every purchased in my entire life. I really want to return it. Let me start from the beginning. My husband and I installed it ourselves. It would have been a very easy install... if the screw handle stripped when we almost had it installed. Rather than trying to remove the stripped screw we did everything in our power to force the thing in and FINALLY got it! So now, after wasting hours because of this stupid stripped screw I am ready to set up the thing on my app. The doorbell is stuck in a solid yellow reboot mode thing. So I follow all the instructions online and try taking it down and putting it back up, doing a factory reset, etc. Nothing works. It's the weekend, so I enter a ticket but cannot call the help desk. I wait until Monday and don't get a response on my ticket so I call the help desk. At first I get a message that they are too busy to accept calls and it hangs up on me. I call again. It says it will call me back. It calls me back to say they are too busy to help me and I need to enter a ticket. I have entered 3 tickets now and called a million times. I cannot get in touch with anyone at all to help me. This is so DAMN frustrating. And I can't return the stupid thing because it's installed with a stripped screw. So I currently have the world's most expensive doorbell, that literally does nothing except function as a doorbell. I checked my router, power, everything. It seems the device itself must be defective, but I cannot get in contact with anyone to get a new one sent to me. I HATE Skybell. Hopefully someone contacts me before my return period is up; I will update my post if I hear anything.
