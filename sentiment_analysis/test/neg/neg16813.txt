Let me preface this review by saying this is probably one of my favorite mice I've ever used.It's incredibly comfortable (I love claw-grip mice), it's got a perfect weight to it, and it looks pretty sleek.Now the not so fun stuff:I had this mouse for maybe 6-9 months. In that time, it worked wonderfully. It has some tracking issues every now and then, but i'm not sure if it was buggy software or what.Getting towards the latter end of that time period, right mouse clicks started to register less and less. After awhile, that tactile "click" that comes with hitting the mouse button disappeared entirely. It started to feel like there was a cushion under the mouse button that just absorbed the click and wouldn't register. Kinda frustrating for gaming.I contacted support to see what could have happened. They told me to open the mouse up to make sure nothing got inside of it. Mind you, it was still relatively newish and has been kept in good shape. I didn't find anything under the button, but this white plastic mechanism that hit the actual mouse button had literally wore down to the point it wasn't registering mouse clicks anymore (see picture, you can see the groove that wore into it).Support wouldn't replace it because I didn't have my receipt (I bought it at a box store and had tossed it). I sort of get that, but it kinda of ruined the experience for me. I could understand that wear and tear occuring after years of use, but less than a year? Hmmm.I loved the mouse, but the corsair and logitech mice I've had previously lasted for years. They still actually work, I had just wanted to upgrade.I have to dock stars for needing to buy a new mouse. I'll probably go back to Corsair for something more durable.
