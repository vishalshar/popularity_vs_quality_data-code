I bought this for my 7 month old cat after texting with Whistle Labs.  They said it could work but in reality once you open it, the entire "band" is the size of a computer mouse but thinner.  Not usable by any stretch.  Saving it for our 2 month old puppy but more like headed to the garbage can.Major complaints (I used it on myself to "track" my path since it didn't work for my cat)-  It doesn't actually map the path of you or your pet.-  It approximates within something like 50 - 100 yards where you / your bet is - completely useless-  It is only a snapshot of your pet's location over timeI had believed it was something like "Map My Run" but it is not.The MAJOR design flaw in this product is that in no municipality can you EVER LET YOUR DOG RUN OFF LEASH.  It is illegal in CA to do so.  So, the only real use case is if your dog gets loose / lost.  The only "pet" allowed to roam wherever it wants are CATS.Skip this marginally useful product.  Oh, because it doesn't work as a pet tracker - they now market it as a "pet fitness band" - another equally useless product.  I would NOT recommend NOR buy again.
