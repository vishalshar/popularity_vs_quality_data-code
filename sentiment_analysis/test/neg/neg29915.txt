Not worth the $20. It works, but only if your toilet is set up in a way that the motion sensing will actually turn it on. If your toilet is directly facing the door to your bathroom, then the sensor must be in the front of the toilet, and then it is uncomfortable, getting in the way while you are using the toilet.Additionally, I just don't see the $20 value here... it seems more like a $10 item at best.
