Note that this nozzle is only plated in wear resistant coating. As soon as this wears through, the nozzle wears away quickly like any other brass nozzle when printing with composite filaments. I would say that this lasts about 50% longer than normal brass nozzles which cost about a third of the price. This nozzle did have good tolerances compared to some other nozzles hear on Amazon. Yet for the price, its more cost effective to buy sets of 5 nozzles and just throw out the ones that have issues since they are a quarter to a third of the price. For the price, I would recommend just getting normal brass nozzles and replacing them more frequently.
