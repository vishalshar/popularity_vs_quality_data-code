This is my first time purchasing a Polar Pro product.  The item is not that quality I was expecting.  I could be wrong, but, I believe this is a piece of polarized plastic.  Description states it is a glass.  I could see it being scratched very easily.  When you pull it off, be expecting for your Hero 5 lens (which is meant t o come off) to be partially pulled off.  I will be returning it and hopefully another manufacturer will produce something of better quality.
