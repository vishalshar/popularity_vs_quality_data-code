I've ordered two different brands of freeze-dried chicken before for my two cats, which they absolutely loved.  Decided to go for this variety-pack to give them some more options.  Instead of receiving the Turkey flavor, however, I received an Organic Chicken, which was EXTREMELY HARD, so I ended up throwing away that entire bag (a waste of money because these aren't cheap compared to the other brands I've bought previously).  I don't know if that's a result of them being "organic" or whether it was just a bad/stale batch.  The Chicken (non-organic) flavor, one of my kittens seems to like.  Haven't tried the other flavors yet, but hopefully they are edible for my kitties.  I will adjust my rating accordingly based on the other flavors.EDIT: I gave my kittens the salmon and while they liked that one... it was very hard as well.  I tried giving them the beef liver (which was also kind of hard) and they didn't eat that flavor at all!  Even my little kitten who usually eats anything and everything refused to eat it.  Reduced to 1 star--a waste of money.
