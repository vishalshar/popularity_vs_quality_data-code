I didn't give this much time and perhaps with a more dedicated effort I could learn to like it.  Here's my experience:I first tried tuning my 1930's tenor guitar.  I had to make a custom setting for tenor guitar.  Then as soon as I tried calibrating (you must calibrate every guitar first), the motor couldn't turn the tuner and gave out with a warning on my iPhone.  I went to a drop tuned acoustic guitar...  calibration was slow and I kept hitting the string wind/unwind buttons by mistake.  I suppose I would learn to avoid them over time.  I tried an electric guitar using the adapter cord to plug directly into the headphone jack, but no luck- it couldn't hear the string at all through the headphone jack.  I had to plug into an amplifier and work acoustically to calibrate.  Once I calibrated a guitar I'd try tuning- it is a slow process to pick each string, put the tuner on the appropriate tuning peg, and repeatedly pluck your string.  It is much easier for me to do this by hand with a clip-on tuner.  I thought I'd try the auto-recognize feature to speed up the process, but  the tuner would continually pick the wrong string and completely detune say, the "D" string thinking it was the "A" string.  Cool gadget/idea but if I kept it I don't think I'd use it past the first couple of days.For me, a clip-on tuner and my own fingers are easier and don't need calibrating.
