In the end, the negatives outweigh the positives with this strap.Pros:-Soft neck padding-Durable strap-Secure metal claspsCons:-Size. This becomes more apparent especially if used for travel.-Very bouncy. When walking around, the camera will bounce against your side because of the bungee material. Also, the fatigue from it bouncing around and dangling so much is very annoying which brings me to:-Strap is too long. I'm 5'11 and with the camera adjusted as short as it can go, the camera dangles just beyond my hip.-Holds onto moisture. If you're carrying around your camera all day in the heat, along with your neck hurting from the camera bouncing around on it, you'll also pool moisture onto the padding.I think if this strap could be adjusted to a shorter length, it may be more comfortable all around.
