I purchased this product because it has fall protection.  In fact there is something wrong with the software that causes the unit to use up its battery too quickly when the fall protection mode is enabled.  The battery will last about 4-5 hours in that mode. Company is difficult to deal with.  Said several times that they would have a tech person call and that did not happen.  Tried to talk with a supervisor who always had a meeting or another customer.  Finally spoke with a tech person who made me aware of the fall detection problem.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM IF YOU WANT FALL DETECTION.
