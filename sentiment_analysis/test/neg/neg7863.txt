The phone is great but when you go to get service from "Great Call" that is an entirely different story.  I tried for FOUR HOURS to get the phone to activate.  I called the company - and sat on hold forever - THREE times and THREE different people gave THREE different reasons why the phone wasn't setting up properly.  The last one tried to convince me that the phone wasn't yet activated - even though the first two people told me it was and I had called the number from a landline - one told me it wasn't charged - it was, I certainly know how to tell if a phone is charged - and one told me that the service wasn't strong enough in my area to set the phone up ... see, according to her, the service has to be stronger service to do the set up, but that my 89 year old father would get service after that???!!!  What the heck?  Like I have never activated a phone before?  I blew up and cancelled everything and returned the phone.  A great phone is of no use if you can't use it.  I went to Verizon at the last minute and got my dad a phone that worked so his birthday was not a total bust.
