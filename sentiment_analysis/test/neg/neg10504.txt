I had brought these for my girlfriend as a gift. She a hairstylist so I figured she would love this to add to her collection that she has of Andis. But it turns out that they weren't that great. They make this weird noises like its broken in the inside and they leave lines so she always has to go threw the head again with other clippers. I try to do a good buy but I guess they weren't that great. And they get very hot after the they first use.
