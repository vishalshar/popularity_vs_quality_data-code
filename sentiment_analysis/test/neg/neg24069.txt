Received the Netatmo station today (July 26th, 2013) and set up was a breeze. Not much in the way of set up instructions included other than how to add batteries. However, once you connect the Netatmo indoor station to computer it will take you to their web site to register and set up. I placed outdoor device under eaves as you can't place it directly in the elements. It is within 30 feet of indoor sensor and I get 4 bars of strength on a scale of 5, and I have steel siding which would kill most signals. So I am happy with the connection. Takes about an hour to get reliable outdoor readings. However, indoor humidity is 20% too high but according to the netatmo forums, it may take up to 2 weeks for indoor humidity to be accurate. So for now I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but that may change one direction or the other in the next 2 weeks. Outdoor temperature and humidity are very close to what my local NWS office is showing on their web site, and indoor temperature is within one degree of another sensor in the house. The ios app works great and is well made. Overall I am very happy with this purchase. One other item of note. The newest outdoor module takes 2 AAA batteries and the outdoor module number is NWS-02. This newer module is more waterproof than the original which is NWS-01. The box will be labelled as NWS-01, but when you put the batteries in the outdoor module, look on the inside and you will see NWS-02. If it says NWS-01, return it. Plus the older module takes 4 AAA batteries. And finally, there are some people posting bad information about the outdoor unit. They are saying that the outdoor module transmits the data to the indoor until via wifi. Absolutely WRONG! The outdoor unit transmits either on 915 MHz or 868 MHz to the indoor unit, which then transmits the data via wifi to the Netatmo servers. It transmits on those bands because it requires a lot less power to communicate to indoor unit as there is a lot less interference and 915 MHZ or 868 MHz are very efficient over short ranges. If it actually had to use wifi to communicate with indoor unit, you would be replacing batteries every day.***********UPDATE AUGUST 5 2013********************The indoor humidity is still running 20% too high, while rest of readings seem accurate. This seems to be a fairly widespread problem as many on the Netamo forum are reporting this issue. I lowered my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars because of the poor indoor humidity readings. I have emailed Netatmo to find out if they can recalibrate the indoor unit remotely, which should be possible through the device mac address.************UPDATE AUGUST 7 2013*******************Netatmo re-calibrated my humidity sensor and now all is working well. Their response was quick and they instructed me to set them side by side and then I emailed the readings to them along with a reference temperature and humidity from another known accurate device. They then made adjustments, not to the actual equipment, but most likely adjusted the readings when they came in through the cloud. Probably just some correction to the readings after they come into their servers. As long as it works, I am happy.************UPDATE AUGUST 20 2013**************After Netatmo did their adjustment, outdoor humidity does not get above 75%. This has become a waste of money. This company is not ready for prime time. Decided to get a real weather station that also has ios app, and provides wind, dewpoint, temperature, pressure, rainfall, etc for almost the same price. Plus you don't have to worry about the outdoor sensors getting wet like you have to with the Netatmo device. I am happy with my new equipment. I drop the Netatmo down to 2 stars. It still can give you accurate temperature and CO2 levels. That's it. Not worth $179 for that!
