I bought these for my girlfriend because she was always misplacing her phone or her keys or her bag. I myself went with a Tile brand but he didn't want to buy more because you can't replace the batteries. I thought that this would be a good alternative to get the same good results that tile give me a more reasonable price.  I was completely wrong. These things are totally worthless. She can hold her keys in one hand and her phone in the other and it still can't find her keys. She pages the keys with her phone and nothing happens. Save your time your frustration and your money.
