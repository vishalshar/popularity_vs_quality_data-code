I bought this for my husband's birthday in January.  We used it for the first time last week.  The blender leaked.  He thought that he had screwed it in wrong and we tried it again on Father's Day.  It leaked all over the cooler!  The time for return has expired but I will pursue this further with Amazon.  The concept is good but it is a poor product for an exorbitant price.  Don't buy it until they fix their product!
