The device might work properly if the mouth piece didn't fall out, it dosent lock in properly. I contacted the company and they said they did have issues with the mouth pieces, they were re engineering them and send them to me, they did 'but' they also fall out just like the ones the came with the device. Now time has elapsed and I cannot return the devise to Amazon. Frustrated!
