I am sure this is a quality product based upon other reviews by owners that have read;  however, make sure that your phone is expressly indicated as compatible with this item.  None of the phones I had were compatible and of the 3, the LG was listed as possibly compatible.  Not so! I found out after purchase that the usb on the phone must power this item and if it does not have power, this thing is a brick, albeit a small compact, light weight brick  but nonetheless.....  There was some mention of a cord that would connect the phone, thermal, and external battery however i could not locate them anywhere.  I will say that Amazon is exceptional in handling the return and processing the refund.  Excellent service.
