I was super excited when this product was announced. It was exactly what I have been searching for, Motion, Smoke, and a camera? sign me up!  My disappointment started when my order was delayed... twice ( I still haven't gotten my add on sensor) So after 2 months of waiting my base package finally arrived a few weeks ago. Here are my initial thoughts.Preface: My internet connection isn't the fastest, I have DSL that runs at around 3M. But if its fast enough to stream Hulu and Netflix in HD. It should be fast enough for this.1. Setup was Incredibly easy. Took less than 10 minutes.2. The App is slow, I mean SLOW. When I arm the sensor in the morning it sometimes takes 3-4 tries and 10 minutes to do.3. Sometimes when the alarm is tripped the pictures don't show up on the app for a day or so, but when they do send they look great.4. My sensor keeps going "offline" won't let me arm it.5. Motion sensor works great, and is adjustable to suit your application6.  Pictures won't save to my phone. I keep getting an error.7. When I try to take a picture to see whats going on, I can't. It gives me an error.8. "App support" link in the app doesn't work.Overall I think this has a TON of potential, but in my opinion it wasn't ready for market yet. Orders are delayed, app is beta at best and hardware seems finicky. I hope that app updates and firmware upgrades fix most of my issues and if they do I will certainly update this review.2/2/16 UPDATE - Novi Customer service and technical support has been outstanding. I've talked to several people on their engineering team and they have given me numerous communication updates on how the software is progressing. There have been several software updates that have solved all my issues.I used the system recently while on vacation in Jamaica, even with a questionable internet connection on my end I was able to check on my house and look at pictures letting me know everything was safe and secure. I will and have now been recommending Novi to friends and family. I am very glad I waited for software updates instead of sending the product back. The final product is worth the wait!I can't wait to see if they come out with more products and updates in the future. ( Outdoor Relay please!??)6/16/16 UPDATE - When it works its great. unfortunately it is 50/50 on if its going to work today or not. Sometimes I can't connect to the relay, sometimes the sensors are offline. Support continues to be great and they are always willing to help, but in a product I paid almost $500 for and have had for about 7 months I should not have to contact support once a month to fix it. Overall I am unsatisfied and would not purchase this again.
