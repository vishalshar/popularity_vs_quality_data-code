Wouldn't power my PNOScan module - but it did work with just the MIDI cable. However - I was disgusted by the fact that I received a used item when it was listed as new. It had the batteries already installed, fingerprints all over it - and hair caught in the plastic molding. Retail box had the plastic sealed sticker already tucked under - so no way could this have ever been sold new. Device probably works for most situations and I could have lived with using the MIDI cable instead of USB - but no thanks.
