I wanted to like this product, but I couldn't. The concept is great and I really wanted this gift to wow but I was disappointed. There were many times it failed to "see" my gestures (perhaps due to lighting) and other times it was so sensitive I couldn't stop the selections. Oh well, not right for our household.
