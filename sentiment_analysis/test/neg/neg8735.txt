UPDATE: Jan 2016Unfortunately, a couple months ago I went to transfer a 90GB virtual machine to it and it overheated and disconnected right before finishing. Thought perhaps it was a one-off. But no, tried again now and same thing happened. Sigh. Worked great while it lasted. I still have data on it and as long as you don't do sustained throughput it appears to be working fine, but you can't have issues with something as important as a drive.--I am extremely pleased with this drive.Bought the 512GB version and the speeds on it are phenomenal. In fact, the speeds came out so well testing with BlackMagic that I thought something was wrong with the app: 295MB/s write and 433 MB/s read. This is faster than my SSD on my 2013 rMBP and has twice as fast reads and writes than another Samsung 840 256GB drive that I have in a Gauntlet2 USB 3.0 external enclosure (which is also 6x the size of the tiny MyDigitalSSD enclosure). A very small, reliable, and fast package that I would easily buy again; highly recommended for anyone else in the market for an USB 3.0 connected fast drive.
