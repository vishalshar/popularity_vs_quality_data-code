Huge waste. with the slightest movement of your head the picture goes out of focus and alignment. Products like these have been on the market for years. This product is suppose to have new tech that's delivers the image with an array of mirrors but is not much of an improvement from what was being sold in in flight magazines 10 years ago.In order to focus the image you have to disrupt the eye piece. Then once it's focused its out of focus again after it settles back in the nose. Very clumsy and unlabeled controls.Using this as a headphone set feels awkward and very heavy.
