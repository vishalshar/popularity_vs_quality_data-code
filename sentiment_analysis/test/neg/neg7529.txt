The bluetooth connection is bad specially when outdoors.Heart monitor is not as accurate as iphone or Mio Alpha.Does not recognize the swipe to fast forward or rewind all the time. Sometime it pause or increase the volume instead.After 4 months of use, the left ear bud is dead.Will definitely not recommend it.
