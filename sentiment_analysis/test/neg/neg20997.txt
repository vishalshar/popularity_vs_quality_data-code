I've owned this item since March 2015 and it seems to be a pretty sturdy piece of hardware.  The bad part is it's totally dependent on Wink for the "smart" features and Wink has proven (to me anyway) to be somewhat less than reliable when it comes to firmware, compatibility and overall system updates.  My experience with this item is just one example of many I could provide documenting Wink's shortcomings.  It worked great until some time this month (Aug 2015), I can't pinpoint the exact time since I've been on vacation for over two weeks of the month.  At some point though, the on/off events from the outlets on this strip stopped initiating robots.  The outlets still work fine, as I can turn them on/off via the Wink app, it's just those on/off events can no longer be used to initiate other events via robots.  What's really upsetting is this is the only reason I bought it.  You see, this is one of the few Wink devices that also interfaces with IFTTT making it an ideal way to "tie" the two systems together.  This device is great when it's working, but since Wink is such an integral part of it you can't really review one without mentioning the other.  Wink is what makes this a 1-star item and I can't really recommend it.
