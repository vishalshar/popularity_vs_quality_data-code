I bought a brand new pair of football gloves  last year that has lost its tackiness. I love the gloves, so I didn't want to give up on them and spend another $100 on new ones. I bought this stuff to see if it would do the trick. It does...for about 20 seconds. I keep it in my pocket and apply throughout the game. Better than nothing, but honestly, not a very good product.
