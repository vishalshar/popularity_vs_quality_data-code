I was at first really excited to use this product... It sounded like a save all for my lashes! Unfortunately, this product lived up to none of its standards it "claims" to meet. First of all, this product has a very weak application... It caused my eyes to be slightly itchy and watery therefore, I had product running down my face and getting on the tops of eyelids. After it dries, the "conditioner" makes your eyelashes hard and separated. It doesn't tint (AT ALL) and to top it off I've had more eyelashes fall out during the use of this product than over the last year. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. I've had Peter Lamas lash masque for about two weeks now and I regret everyday buying it...
