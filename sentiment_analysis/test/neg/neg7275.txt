NOTE* My wallet is not RFID. I bought a Tile Slim to replace the original Tile I had in my wallet.  Unfortunately, this device has a very difficult time connecting via bluetooth when its in my wallet. I've found that I have to be within a few feet to be able to ring it, a problem I never had with the original tile.  I thought it may have been an issue with the device so I exchanged it for a new tile slim but i'm still having connection issues with the new one.Until they improve its connection I'd wait and just stick with the tile original.
