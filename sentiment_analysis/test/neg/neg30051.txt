As a a phone case it gets the job done the grip is pretty good and won't slip off your hands. But if you expect it to stick on mirrors or surfaces for more than minutes then good luck. I found that it doesn't really work that well. And it certainly doesn't perform well on car windows it falls off after a few.minutes. The reason I gave it 2 stars was because I expected to use the case to stick on smooth surface like my restroom mirror while I brushed my teeth, it'll work for that but it has fallen a few times. For a novelty is great, but for real usage to stick on surfaces I don't think so.
