I really wanted to love this damn cooler. I ordered  it the first time and invited 6 people to the beach. Blender lasted one hour ,even though the battery said it was fully  charged. Super embarrassing!! I'm hosting a beach party, bragging about the cooler, and dead blender. I Returned it , get a second cooler. Invite another  crowd to the beach ( it couldn't possibly happen again, right?) The blender lasted four hours, then died. Once again the battery said it was still charged. So I'm assuming it must be a motor thing. I did feel really cool , but will wait for the version 3 of this device. The coolest cooler needs to get that damn blender working. I dont care about the weight or anything else. Having the blender not work when you brought bags of ice and Colada mix is an epic, sad No Bueno :(... Goodbye  Coolest Cooler
