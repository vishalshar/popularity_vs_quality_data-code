Not as i expected it to be. Gotta keep it plugged in to work, also it takes a long time to connect to my samsung phone. You also need wifi just to view your camera when you're on the road or at work. There's other different products out there that don't need wifi to connect.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
