UPDATE 11/23/2016: unit failed in under three years and company did not respond for support, even when I pointed out that I helped them update their software to work with the unique way South Florida wires sprinkler zones.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I believe in products like this for the environment and future automation. This controller was originally not configured to work with a sprinkler system like mine because I have all my zones wired together with just a pause to switch from zone to zone. The support team updated the software and worked with me. Now I'm good to go and I feel good about the weather affecting how much I water without having to manually turn the sprinklers off or run them longer. This is the future of sprinkler controllers so if you're just installing one or replacing an older one, time to move up to a smart unit.
