This is a cool product in the sense that you have an integrated USB input and lightning output. It does charge a phone pretty quickly, about the same speed as the 2.4A wall charger. That being said the actual amount of charge it provides is a bad joke. Usually in the range of 20% battery on a 6S. You'd be much better off getting a larger battery.
