Received it today. Very unhappy because I have been trying to set up wifi and calibration of the laser and it keeps taking me offline for some reason (with the petcube flashing blue meaning it's online) I called customer service and they don't know what's wrong. :( so I have to return it. Hopefully they will improve it. My puppy loves lasers.
