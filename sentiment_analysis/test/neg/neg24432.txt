I seldom post negative reviews but feel I must speak out. My dog had a Tagg and we were happy customers for nearly 3 years. But since Whistle took over, the quality and customer service has gone downhill. Actually, downhill doesn't even come close -- more like it's jumped off the cliff.We recently got a new puppy and I bought the Whistle tracker for him. A week later, my original dog's Tagg died. It just stopped charging. I contacted customer service and they refused to do anything about it saying it was out of warranty. Of course I'd just paid for a new year of service a few weeks earlier but had nothing to use that service with. Finally after about a dozen emails back and forth over a couple weeks, Whistle offered me a new GPS at a $20 discount. I went to their site to find out that they had merely had a sale on the product and were offering me nothing at all. At that point i asked for a refund for the new tracker I had bought and a refund on both service.At that point I got a phone call from the cancellation department. They offered to give me a new Whistle at half price. I asked why it took them this long to offer me anything, and they said only the cancellation department really has latitude. That to me says a lot! They aren't authorized to help their customers unless the customer tries to cancel their service.I took them up on the discount, but the Whistle that arrived never worked. It's been nearly three weeks, multiple phone calls and another dozen emails back and forth to customer service and they refuse to replace the defective tracker!! They keep asking me the same questions I've already answered and sending me canned "troubleshooting" steps that if they actually read my emails or listened to what I told them they would know don't apply. Every time I ask them to replace the defective tracker they come up with other hoops I have to jump through (ridiculous ones like taking a picture of the tracker base station plugged into the wall.)I'm fed up and asked for a refund. They're refusing to refund the trackers and service. I've had to try to get my credit card company to reverse the charges and am hoping that will work because otherwise I'm out a few hundred dollars.As for their service when it works... it's okay. It was much better when it was Tagg. The map on Whistle's web site is inaccurate and shows my dogs about a few hundred yards away from our home when they're at the base. And the three minutes between updates when they pet leaves is not really adequate -- a dog can go quite a ways in three minutes.Im looking to change to iotaracker which has no annual fee.There are many pet trackers now and more new ones coming out soon. Do yourself a favor and research one of those.
