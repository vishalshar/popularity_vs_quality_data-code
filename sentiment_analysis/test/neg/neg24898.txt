After using this "camera" for 6 months, I still don't know how to feel about it.  I wan't to say its at least useful as a gimmicky 'lomogrophy' type toy to keep in your bag for the right moment, but the camera and Lytro seem to go out of their way to make the experience as unpleasant as possible.As far as the pro's go, there are few.  I guess its biggest, and possibly only pro, is the ability to 're-focus' pictures after you have taken them.  This is very neat, and its especially cool to look at the work some people have produced professionally on lytro's website.  It doesn't take much to see the possibilities this type of photography opens up in terms of composition and narrative.  I also like the fact that the camera uses a standard micro usb cable to charge, and transfer photos.  Its nice to have one less cord to worry about.Now the cons....  Where to begin...  For starters, the image quality is incredibly subpar, especially considering they once charged 600$+ for these things.  Even in full studio lighting, and on a tripod, the images come out terrible, extremely noisy, and very soft.  There is no sharpness to the pictures at all.  The whole point of this tech is to be able to take pictures, and focus them later.  The image quality produced by this camera is so poor, it makes it a moot point.  You get blurry portions of the frame, and less blurry.If you do decide to use any of your images, you are in for a whole new world of pain when you load their desktop software.  They have 2 varieties, Desktop 3 and 4, both with its own unique cons.  I can only speak from a OSX standpoint, since it wasn't even worth it to me to try to wrestle the software onto a windows machine.  On OSX  Desktop 3 works on Mavericks and older, and will run on Intel Graphics 3000 and up.  The software is extremely SLOOOOOOOOOOW, and does little to nothing to your images.  Its basically a viewer for your images.  You cannot adjust any settings, crop, or even flip images.  You can save them to your 'library", or "share" them, by uploading them to Lytro's website.Desktop 4 promises actual editing and cropping, but requires Intel Graphics 5000 and up, so there was no way for me to test it out.  While editing sounds promising, having no way at all (aside from a 3rd party android app, with limited compatibility) to share images makes the whole thing seem like a giant waste of time and money.Some other con's, which didn't bother me much, but may be a deal breaker for some, are that the battery is built in and non replaceable, as is the memory.In the end if there was any way to easily share your images, this could still be fun as a toy, but no sharing options, along with impossible software, topped off with Lytro's basically non-existant support, make this really hard to recommend to anyone who doesn't have their heart set on one, and knows what they are getting into.
