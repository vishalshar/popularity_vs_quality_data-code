I don't know why everyone says Autels customer service is great because it's actually horrible.  Their response time is somewhat quick (email only) but they did not help with the issues I was having with the drone and actually stopped responding to me.  Also, I would definitely not recommend this product due to the fact parts aren't available.  They do not have replacement anti-drop gimbal pins nor due they have rubber grommets for the gimbal has well.  I asked the company how I could obtain these parts and they stated these parts are not available for purchase ?.  The drone also loses connection after about 1/4 mile, even with no obstructions to interfere with the signal, and the camera video will stop recording for no reason.  Don't buy this product, for the $$$$ buy from a more reputable company.  I have learned this the hard way.
