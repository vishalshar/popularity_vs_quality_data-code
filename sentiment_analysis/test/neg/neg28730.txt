Of all the gifts I bought this year, I had the highest hopes for this one and it let me down the hardest. I spent $60 on this and regret every single penny. My 11 year old wanted something virtual reality for Christmas as after watching the video for this, it seemed like a really fun VR gift. But the construction of this is so cheap! The wood blocks used to make the maze just sit on top and slide around so when you actually try to play, the heavy marbles move the walls. The cardboard viewer is chintzy, and we couldn't get the mazes to upload to the app even after we tried for an hour. This whole thing was completely worthless. I hate giving 1 star reviews but this was just such a huge disappointment.
