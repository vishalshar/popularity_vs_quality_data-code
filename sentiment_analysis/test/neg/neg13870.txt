I like the sheets themselves but the logos are way too visible and large, I really dislike them them and will return this product. The logos impact the orientation of the sheets when you put them on whatever surface you are using. I was going to put them on a white wall but then I'd floating logos  visible on the wall. The one I'm looking at now has the logo in the bottom right in a portrait orientation but I really want to use it horizontally and the logo looks dumb sideways as well.  I guess you could cut them off but I shouldn't have to.  Regular whiteboards don't have logos on them, why should these?
