The functions of the shine 2 are great, movement tracker, sleep monitor, activities, etc... BUT the physical design is FAULTY. the shine falls off the strap and the clip all the time. I have been only using it for 1 week and have already lost it 4 times... luckily i found it but now I am worried all the time that is going to fall when I am running or when I am outside the house and I won't be able to find it.I would look for another option that is safer to wear...
