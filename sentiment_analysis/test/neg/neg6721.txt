I never got to try it as I had an iPhone 4 at the time, and I didn't see anywhere that you can't use with an iPhone 4. Maybe I just didn't read close enough. But I was disappointed. It seemed like a great gadget, and I looked into a lot of these item finders for my keys, since I lost an expensive one and wanted to prevent that again. The most popular one doesn't have a rechargeable battery, you have to order a new one pretty much every year and that was a deal breaker for me. So I'm sure it's great, but just beware if you have older technology, you might not even have a chance to use it.
