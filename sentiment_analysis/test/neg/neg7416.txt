Beware!This new screen kit is not backwards compatible with the first Kano computer kit. The 1st gen Kano Pi has a mini USB port on the right side and a bottom speaker plug that will not allow it to snap into place where intended on the Kano Screen Kit. That's just poor design. Seriously, do the Kano whiz kids owners expect parents to now buy a new Kano Pi just to fit into that plastic snap slot? The screen kit isn't that educational except for little kids. You're better off saving your money and just connecting the Raspberry Pi to your own monitor. Inexpensive monitors can be bought for less than this kit.
