Well the only reason i am giving this only one star is due to the customer service from the Brush Guard and also just the plain fact of not getting my stuff. I am an avid Amazon user and almost everything that i have ordered has come in a timely fashion. This is not the first but the SECOND time i have orderd from the Brush Guard and i have not received anything. Especially with the whole "non-tracking" information is kind of upsetting. This overall experience is just ridiculous and i would have loved to sample this product but it is unfortunate that i am going to have to find something similiar and is able to communicate a bit more with their customers.
