I don't count myself as being extremely large but this band made me feel like perhaps I am because I have the length set at the longest setting and it just fits. I weight about 160 and am 5'3". Overweight but didn't think I was way over the average. Other than that it works as stated. It's a useful item to have but I think the manufacuters should make it extend longer for more people to be able to use it
