It's disappointing that it only lights up very briefly and only after you shake it.  I never saw anything near the picture.  Plus it must stay out of direct sunlight during the day and away from artificial light at night.  So it ends up getting stuck in some corner until the occasional drive to go shake it or the weekly feeding time.
