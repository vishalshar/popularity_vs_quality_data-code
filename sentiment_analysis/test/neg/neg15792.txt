Good concept. I was very excited. But, I have had to throw out every batch I've done with these, each has been funky in a bad way. I sterilize all my equipment and don't have issues with ferments where I burp the jars daily. This tool does not allow lactobacillic fermentation. Being airtight and watertight are different things, re company video. I wish I hadn't wasted my money and all those lovely veggies. They are pretty though.
