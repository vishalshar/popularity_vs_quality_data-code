Pitcher came with some aesthetic damage. Scratches along two opposite sides. Then the handle had a bit of splintering pieces coming off. Not much fun. And then there's yellow crud on the plastic attached to the handle. Didn't come off with washing, or scraping.Wouldn't in and of itself result in a one star review. But the filter does a terrible job of filtering water. I washed the whole pitcher, and then filled the little bag that filter came in and soaked it for a half hour. Dumped the water, rinsed the filter, and then soaked it for another half hour. Proceeded to filter a few litres of water to make sure any loose carbon was flushed out. Then filled it up, put it in the fridge, and let it sit for a few hours. Decided to try a glass. Tasted like dirt, and none of the nasty flavours from the tap water was filtered out. So it made the water worse, actually.Soo... This water pitcher and filter really suck. Quality control is poor for the construction of the pitcher. And then the filter does nothing, but add extra dirt flavour. Woo-hoo.FYI: Returning it, if it wasn't obvious.
