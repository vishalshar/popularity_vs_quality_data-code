Really don't like this product.  Cable too short and cannot use it on a pot for measuring the temperature of oil as it's far too long to hold onto the edge and cannot be adjusted.  Also, it's impractical as a 'remote' thermometer as you must keep your phone plugged into it, and that means you have to leave your phone near the food you're cooking.  You can't take your phone and use it, so where's the benefit in this as a 'remote' thermometer?  I may as well leave a standard meat thermometer in the meat if I've got to walk back to look at my phone every time.  My fault for not thinking all this through before buying it, but hey, it is what it is.
