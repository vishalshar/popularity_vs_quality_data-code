I opened the device - and it is small.  I followed the minimal instructions, pressed the button on the device, and although it beeped twice it would not pair with my phone.  I removed the battery as suggested in the help screen, which seemed to reset the device.  More trying to get it to connect.  In the end I connected it via the bluetooth in Iphone settings.  Then it said the connection was successful in the app itself.  But, going back into the add device facility in the app, it said it was waiting for a bluetooth connection.At that point I was half an hour into trying the device, so I gave up.On the plus side the device is very small, but until they get it to work properly with the app, don't waste your money
