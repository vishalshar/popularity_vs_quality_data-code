Not very hot. Please don't put Ghost Pepper on the label if it's as spicy as a jalapeno. And I'm still trying to figure out why they would make all of their sauces have the consistency of water. Tried this and the pineapple one (which doesn't taste at all like pineapple) and they are both too runny.
