The device was easy to setup and detected motion consistently and quickly. However I was not getting the advertised push notifications to my iPhone 5. I contacted tech support and they informed me that, even though it states on their website this device sends push notifications through their app, that in reality it does not. According to the technician to get those notifications I must pair it with one of their other products (which I have no interest in doing). I then ask the rep why it doesn't state that on their website or in the manual and he replies with: "Thank you for contact D-Link tech support, have a nice day" and hangs up on me. Not exactly the support I was looking for, looks like this item is going to take advantage of Amazon's wonderful return policy.
