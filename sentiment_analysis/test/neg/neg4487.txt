About 20min after installation, when everything seemed to be working fine, my laptop shut off and would no longer power up.  I brought it to an electronics repair shop and they determined the cause was this card.  It's odd, I haven't seen any other reviews claiming this so I can't say for sure but I can tell you that when I replaced my MacBook, I opted for the larger storage because I would never trust this product again.  I did return it for a refund
