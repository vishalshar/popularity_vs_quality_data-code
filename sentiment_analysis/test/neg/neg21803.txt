At first, I loved this stylus. But, now that it is 3 months old, I have seen a serious decline in performance.  This is a total bummer because this stylus was the best one I had used at first.  I thought maybe I would try replacing the tip, but the tips on this model aren't replaceable.  Too expensive of an item to get 3 months of light use out of.  I also trued to contact the company direct on thee occasions.  No one would answer the phone, so I left 2 messages and never received a call back :(
