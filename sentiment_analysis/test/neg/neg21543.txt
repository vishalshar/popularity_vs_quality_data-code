Worked great for about 2 months, but stopped connecting.  As the owner of a new car and a new iPhone, I thought I could ignore the negative reviews and use this anyway.  Turns out I was wrong, and started suffering connection problems.  After days stretched into weeks of support, here's what tech support told me: "The adapter does not appear to defective, so the replacement second gen adapter won't help.  Some versions of iOS are more stable w/r/t Bluetooth connection than others.  I totally understand your frustration, and I'll definitely pass your feedback to our engineers."While very polite, support was quite unhelpful- blaming it on iOS or Bluetooth.  Save your money, this is not a reliable product.
