The product would not work no matter what bra i wore. I would reset and reset. Then slouch for over 5 mon purposely too see if it would vibrate. Nope. Or sometimes it would vibrate many minutes later after slouching for a time No one from the company returned my cry for help. I lost money for a product that never worked. Too late to return to Amazon by the time i realised LumoLift wasnt going to get back with me.Booooooooooooo
