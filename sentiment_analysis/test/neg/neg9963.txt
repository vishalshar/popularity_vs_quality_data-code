The first unit was defective.  The replacement unit started displaying OUTSIDE AIR QUALITY then stopped.  Forecast section does not work either, states we have 40 to 50 mph winds on a CALM day.Netatmo support has not responded to requests about the outside air quality, and they state the weather forecast organization is working on correcting that feature.  So far NADA.Amazon has been great in the support area, --sent a replacement unit with no hassle.
