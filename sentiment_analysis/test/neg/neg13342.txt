Worked great to catch the first rat, but after that, nothing. I read online somewhere that when the rat is electrocuted it gives off pheromones of extreme fear and anxiety that other rats can sense on the device. This must be true because I know for sure we had a second rat still in our crawl space (I saw it after we sealed the crawl space), but we weren't able to catch it with the Raticator no matter what kind of bait we tried and had to resort to another option.
