Let me start that I love this product. I used to get it at my local store when it was called Protings but they no longer carry it. As a bariatric patient who is allergic to dairy finding  protein rich snacks is hard as they are all whey, These are pea and the BBQ is the best flavor. Perfect to satisfy that munch factor too.BUTthis listing is for 4 bags. I only received one bag. And it was shipped in an envelope so the chips are completly crushed.
