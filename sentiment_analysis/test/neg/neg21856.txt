I don't usually give bad reviews, so this is with a caveat...I have been unable to get the earbuds to function yet - and I would welcome any help. They have been charged, software updated, music downloaded from my files, and they pair with my iPhone (like my Beats) - -but no music. They talk to me - but no music.Can someone walk me through this step-by-step because I stupidly bought a second pair for my husband?!?
