Purchased these for a very active 8 year old boy who cannot be bothered with tying/untying tennis shoes.  Instead, he would break down the back of the shoe each time he shoved his foot in without having untied them.  While these certainly solve that problem by allowing enough give for the foot to slip in, they are FOREVER coming undone.  8 year old cannot refasten them as they are tricky even for this adult; therefore, they remain undone during the day and eventually slip out and are lost.  Great idea in theory, but not practical for kids who are rough and tumble.  Disappointed as I thought they were the answer.
