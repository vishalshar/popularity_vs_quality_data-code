First of all, i ordered this from seller "BREED", fulfilled by Amazon.my unit came with a Micro USB instead of the Lightning i ordered.this sucks as i will not want to carry another Micro USB to Lightning adapter. Which is why I'm buying this product that has everything i need built-in.second thing i realised, this is not "5 credit cards thick "By standard, All card sizes have a thickness of 0.76 mm (0.030 in).NOT 1.1mm (This lithium card is 5.5mm thick without the Nano Stik {another1.5mm})so unless your wallet has the space of 7-8 cards, this lithium card will struggle to fit.Even though i receive the wrong item, i gave it some testing, by using a Lightning adapter on my iphone6 4.7inchi test charged it 3 times.1st 18%-55% -41mins2nd 37%-74% - 42 mins3rd 32% - 68% 45mins (airplane mode , no "hey siri")so technical i only manage to charge it about 36% in about 40-45 mins.36% of my iphone6 battery is36% x 1810mah = 651mahthe lithium suppose to produce 1200 x 70% = 840mah.which should charge my iPhone by 46%.i calibrate my phone battery regularly.where did my 10% go? the lightning adapter? i wonder.
