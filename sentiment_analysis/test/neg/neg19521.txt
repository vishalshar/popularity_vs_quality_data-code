Bracelet is just like an other tracker, maybe a bit more stretchy than a fitbit.The app...really needs some work.  I have to delete and re-pair at least once a week on my Galaxy.  But, if you stay in a good phone signal area you should be ok.Update: three.months a later they stopped supporting the dang thing.  60 bucks wasted.  I'll never buy this again.
