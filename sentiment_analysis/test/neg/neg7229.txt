I returned this junk. The machining quality just isn't there. The tips had a tiny contact patch and did not align well. Good luck trying to find the sweet spot to get it to actually grip a hair. They claim they are American made, but clearly that is no longer an indication of a quality product. Clearly they have a good reputation but the actual product has been reduced to junk.
