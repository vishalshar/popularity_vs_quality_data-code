Smelled strongly of petrochemicals resembling naphtha (lighter fluid).  I tried to air it out in front of a fan for a half day and ended up with a basement that smelled like petrochemicals.  No way I would put this in the hands of my kids.  The seller gave me an unintelligible response when I submitted the return.  I'll deal with them separately.
