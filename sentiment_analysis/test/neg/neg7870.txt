I got this product to record a few interviews as well as some thing in my 99 seat theatre. The app crashes a lot and the sd card sometimes does not accept the recording but it does not tell you until you are done and trying to stop the recording. i would just go back to a go pro.The video quality when you zoom in is not that great as well.
