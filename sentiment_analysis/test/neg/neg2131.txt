Was really hoping for a accurate measurement device.  This is not accurate at all for precision work.  I need my measurements to be precise.  Sometimes it's accurate, sometimes not.  So I cannot trust it for multiple measurements.  It might be fine for wood work, but for metal work, where a 16th of a inch is huge, it's no good.  The best thing about it is the divide in half feature, that comes in handy.  Other than that, it's just a gimmick.
