I return this nightmare as well. When I bought this printer and learned it was fully mechanized from feed to print, a red flag went up. In my life experiences and what my business college professors had said, the more mechanized parts you have, the greater for disaster. Mechanized parts tend to wear out. Well my printer feeder had a defect where it stopped feeding the line and it can't eject properly. I even had prints ruined because the print head couldn't get the filament it needed. What on earth was that British engineer was thinking? How many 3D printers in the market does not require you to push the filament maybe up a tube and then into the extruder? My fingers will not break but automated parts will. The retro robot and an owl head was the only things I could print and the prints were great. What a shame. I feel like Chef Ramsey saying this dish could have been out of the park if it was not under cooked.
