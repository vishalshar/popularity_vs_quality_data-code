This product barely worked for a short time but now does not hold a charge at all and does not track my dog at all.  It also does not track his activity level anymore. I still am paying the monthly fee but now it is for nothing.  The product rarely was able to properly track my dog initially but it seemed like a good idea in case he got lost.  Now there is no point in him wearing it since it does nothing but weigh down his neck. Canceling this service.
