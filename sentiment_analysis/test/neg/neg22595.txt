I had a rat problem and had been trying to control them using a spring trap for some time.  Every morning I found the traps sprung with the bait missing, which indicated I was dealing with some pretty smart and agile rats.  I decided to try this product.  I followed directions, including leaving the trap turned off the first night so that the rats could take the bait and get accustomed to the trap.  Following the first night I armed it, I found that the trap had triggered according to the blinking light, but there was no rat in the trap.  Subsequently, the trap never triggered again, indicating to me that the rat had been shocked but not killed and now knew to avoid the trap.  Since this was now useless, I went back to spring traps and finally caught two rats the old-fashioned way.  Neither were particularly large, so I can't say why this product didn't have enough power to kill one.  As recommended, I installed brand new high-quality batteries.  Everything has seemed to work as expected, it just wasn't powerful enough to kill a couple of relatively small rats.  I'll try it again in the future if rats return, but without much hope of success. As of now it's a $45 door stop.  Very disappointed.
