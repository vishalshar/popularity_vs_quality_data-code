I have been searching for a very rugged and durable Metal based case for my Iphone 6 Plus.  As a person that manufactures and distributes Smartphone accessories I have very high standards and had hoped that the impressive video on the Rokform website showing a car driving over the phone inside the case demonstrated the high quality.  I didn't want to risk doing the same test on my $1000 Iphone 6 Plus 128gb but hoped that this would be THE Best case I have found to date for my Iphone 6 Plus.  Sadly my brief experience with the Rokform Fuzion Series CNC machined case has not been a good one.  For starters several of the issues claimed by reviewers on Amazon are still a problem.  I would think that RokForm selling most of their product on Amazon would have taken these comments into consideration and modified their product.  I would also have hoped that if they did so they would replace the inventory at Amazons Warehouse so people purchasing the case now would not encounter the same circumstances.When I'm spending $100+ on an Iphone Case I expect that it would be leaps and bounds above the rest of the pack.  The use of CNC Machined Aluminum which is manufactured in the United States would allay the concerns that people have buying products that are made in Asia.  I have been manufacturing in China for almost 10 years and have never encountered quality control inconsistencies like I have with this case. The case simply doesn't fit properly and the silicone component has a rough finish that smacks of cheap production.  I'm not sure if Rokform manufactures the silicon sleeve in the United States as they claim with their Aluminum CNC Machined Backplate, but I would expect much much better from a company that advertises their product being great because its made in the U.S.  Spigen, UAG, Ballistic all make fantastic cases that don't use Aluminum and their Polycarbonate and Silicone components put the Rokform to shame.  Their products can be purchased for a fraction of the price of the Rokform so that means the lions share of the price is for this "Fantastic" CNC Machined Aluminum Backplate.Lets talk about the CNC Backplate.  The finish on that is streaked.  I understand that this is a byproduct of the machining process but when you are producing a Consumer Retail Product use a coating so that the finish looks nice.  I didn't know whether this was normal or a result of poor quality control had I not had personal experience with Aluminum machined components for my own products.  What should the regular consumer think not knowing what the norm is for this type of product?? The other major concern I have is that the backplate should be larger and cover more of the back of the phone.  I'm sure people willing to pay $100-$110 would spend another $20 to get a product that really smacks of ruggedness and durability.As someone that makes recommendations to their customers to buy our products I am always searching for a unique, well designed and well built product.  This case unfortunately doesn't seem to meet that criteria.  Unfortunately I can't even return this to Amazon as they won't allow a return so I am stuck with a $110 item that I wouldn't risk using on my very expensive Iphone.  I even took the additional steps to contact Rokform directly and immediately received a call back by someone in charge of customer service who assured me they valued my input and would look after me.  I have not received any further communication from them and would have hoped that given the fact I can't return this purchase would have done something to insure I was happy with their product.  At the very least I would have hoped that my particular unit was an anomaly and that they would demonstrate their commitment and conviction that their product is leaps and bounds above others and tried to make me a happy customer.  As of this date February 10, 2016 I have yet to hear from Rokform or see something surprising shipped to me via UPS or U.S.P.S.I hope that the people are Rokform read this review and take some steps to show me that their product is indeed worth purchasing especially for over $100.  IF and when I am satisfied I will amend my review accordingly.
