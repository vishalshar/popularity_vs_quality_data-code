I skipped reading the reviews before buying this as I put more weight on the description and web advertisement. Well, to my surprise, the negative reviews were result of unsatisfied users. They were right. The unit wobbles when iphone is connected. You can not use a thick phone case and use this. The bendy cable is amazing, though. But, the portability of connection, not good. This has to go back to the drawing board and needs to be redeveloped. I have to return this and get something else.
