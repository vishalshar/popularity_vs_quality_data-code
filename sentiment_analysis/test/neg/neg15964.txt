Dead On ArrivalTried 7 times with kettle water from a simmer and boil.  Tamping and untamped.  Does not put water through the grounds and did not scream on tightly enough, resulting in scalded hands where the water spews forth from the area where the the top (bottom when trying to pump) screws into the pump.  It got me in a few places.  I'm more patient than most, but will be sending this one back in the morning.  I may try a replacement, but not until my skin has grown back on my hands and neck.
