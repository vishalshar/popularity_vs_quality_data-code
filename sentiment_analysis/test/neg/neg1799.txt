big sound from a small box. great feel to the wooded case.like a lot of airplay boxes, it does occasionally drop out for a second (once every three or four hours), but the quality of the sound, and the available volume without distortion, make that a small price to pay.[UPDATE]earlier this week, i updated the software in the unit. now, it seems to boot, and the status LED glows green, but it is unreachable by any device i have. i tried resetting it, still the same. i have 3.0.0 of the iOS app. the forums on the sugrsugr.com web sit are useless. i tried email, but have not heard back.when it worked, it was pretty good. now, it just sits there, ignoring me, as does the company.i guess, if you can get it working, dont try and upgrade it. if you have issues, the company seems to leave you hanging.
