I had high hopes of finding a nice quality bullet pencil.  Unfortunately this product missed the mark.The clip broke loose almost immediately.  The eraser and pencil are non-standard sizes so can only to be replaced by the Midori offering unless you improvise with duct tape, a pocket knife and band-aids.  Remember, direct pressure almost always stops the bleeding.
