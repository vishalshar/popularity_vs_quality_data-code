I wouldn't give it a star if I could....I bought this phone for my older mom.  We opened the package and set the phone up but to our surprise she could not hear .  After trying several things to turn up volume it was as high as it would go.  Which is no higher than any other phone .  So I sent it back and requested a refund.  A week later I got an email that denied the refund because the package had been opened .  I wonder how your supposed to know if you like the phone if it's in the package??  They wil not work with is at all.
