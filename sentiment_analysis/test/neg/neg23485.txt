We love this product and was attracted to buying it here in bulk due to the cheaper price compared to our local store.  Just received my order middle of 8/13.  Best by date on bags is the first part of 9/13.  Product does not taste fresh compared to local store.  There is no way we can eat a case of this stuff within a couple of weeks before it expires.  Now we know why it's so cheap!  It's nearly stale dated.  Gave it two stars because it arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition.
