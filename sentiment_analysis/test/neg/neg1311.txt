Not working as I would have hoped.  Connecting to the camera takes minutes.  I have mine in my backyard and had hoped I could use it to monitor my dogs activities while we are away.  Sometimes they escape!  Anyway, the Flex is really slow to connect.  If I am not on wifi with my phone sometimes it won't even connect.  If I am on high speed wifi, it still takes minutes to connect.  By the time it connects I am frustrated.  Battery life in my real world setting has been about 2 weeks.  Very inconvenient when you want to place this somewhere that's not easy to get to.. like the top of an eve.  Also, this setup really needs an on-line application or a computer based way to access cameras.  I'd like a display or connection that allows me to see all my cameras on split screens.  Currently you can only view one camera at a time.
