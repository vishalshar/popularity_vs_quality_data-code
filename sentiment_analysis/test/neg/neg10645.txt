First of all, it's very liquidy so it takes a long time to dry. If you have light eyelashes and all you want is to not look like a zombie on the days that you "don't want to wear makeup", then you'll be disappointed. I have light eyelashes and this mascara would give the natural look I desire IF it could get to the root of my eyelashes. But it doesn't. At all. And believe me, I've tried. So it looks obviously fake and just terrible if I'm not wearing it in conjunction with eye liner that does darken the roots of my eyelashes. Which makes it useless to me.
