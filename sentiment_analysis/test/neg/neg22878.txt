I so wanted to like this bike bell. The design is super cute and reminds me of bike bells from years ago. I love the shiny chrome finish and the colored stripes along the side. I wasn't, however, happy with the sound it produced. It had a very irritating and "off" sound to it. I tried it different ways and could not get the sound to change. It is possible that the bell was dammaged in shipment. It does not appear dented, etc., but since the padded envelope didn't appear substantial enough in which to ship this item, I wonder if it was knocked around during shipment and this adversely affected the acoustics of the bell? Not sure.
