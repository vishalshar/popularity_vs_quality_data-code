So far it's not great. It doesn't really track activity accurately. I jogged on the treadmill for a few minutes and it didn't register any activity. The breathing exercises are similarly inaccurate. The app isn't great either it has no options to track food intake or other things like stress levels. Overall i'm pretty disappointed. I have a fitbit and overall it's MUCH better at everything, the only problem is it's ugly. I will give the leaf a few more days and see how it goes but I can't imagine i'm going to keep it.
