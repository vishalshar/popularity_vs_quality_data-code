First of all, the two stars are for the looks and simplicity of setup process.I preordered two lumas and have received it. The installation was a breeze got it done in 10min all up. After the installation it all goes down. First of all, Luma cannot be setup in bridge mode and when I contacted support about it they asked to connect to my modem. Well I don't have a modem my router is my modem which gets internet through PPPoE which Luma doesn't support. So, if you are planning to use this as "access point" with advanced firewall system like pfsense it might not work as well as you might have thought. As, I can't afford to turn my pfsense box into bridge mode as it handles my VPN, Dynamic DNS which Luma doesn't support.Secondly, even though Amazon delivers this to Australia there is no localisation option when setting up so this seems to be creating some sort of certificate issue as Lastpass and few other site don't seem to work when connected to Luma. Works as normal once connected to previous AP.In short, If you just wanted to expand your wifi network without the gimmick Luma says it has. This device is not for you. However, if you just want a simple to connect and doesn't have any existing router this will do the job for you.
