The hardware on this bulb is nice the color output is good but the functionality is horrible. There is not much you can do outside of changing the color while on your own network. None of the promised features have been delivered and as much as they state that they are coming the never do. After owning one of these bulbs I went and got the Philips Hue and have been pretty happy. I have since put this bulb in a drawer and have not used it. Wasted 100.00 and should have bought the Hue in the first place.
