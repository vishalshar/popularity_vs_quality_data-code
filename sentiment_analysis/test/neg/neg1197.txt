I don't think I've ever given a one-star review before, but this product makes it necessary. It's a great idea - a top with a spout so you can use mason jars as portable drink cups. Let's start with the annoying: when you take a drink from it, the spout cap falls forward and lands on your nose; if the cap has any liquid in it, the liquid will drip down your face. And if you try to push the cap back farther, it will just pop off. It's annoying, but I can live with it.The main problem is that the spout lid is fickle - it might stay on, it might not. I was using the mason jar as a shaker cup; as I was shaking, the spout cap opened, and protein shake dumped all over me, my couch and my laptop (which I now have to replace).Bottom line: if you absolutely MUST HAVE a glass jar/spout cap combo, keep a finger on the cap when you shake it, always hold the jar upright, and get used to the cap landing on your nose.
