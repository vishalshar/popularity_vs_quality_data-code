This product is not as  advertised. I was expecting a queen sized pillow filled with shredded foam. I received a sheet of memory foam a quarter inch thick. Did it inflate itself? Yes. Was it comfortable ? No. Would I recommend it? Absouletely not. I don't have a problem with memory foam, I do have a problem with merchants not delivering what is advertised.
