Not even a week into use and the plastic portion it locks into broke. Thankfully I found the tracker in the sand by our beach. Disappointed 2 days into our vacation I can't track their activity the full week. Very cheap plastic locking mechanism. I returned the monitor and ordered the FitBark. Much easier setup, lighter weight,  easier to charge and better mechanism for securing to the collar. all for a lower price.  Don't spend the extra money on the cheaper Whistle.
