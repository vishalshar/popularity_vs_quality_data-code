While I enjoy kayaking in this kayak immensely, a few weeks in and materials are starting to chafe and wear already. The neoprene cover which goes over the bow to prevent water from entering is already forming a hole, apparently from rubbing against the sharp edges of the plastic of the bow. Additionally, the backrest is breaking apart where it rests back against the two screws which hold the backrest/frame together. I have contacted Oru about this and will follow up on this review based on how they handle these issues.
