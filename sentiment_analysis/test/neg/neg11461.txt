I just took delivery of this product.  The first thing instructions told me to do was install their App which I did.  Then it says to scan the QR code that came with the device.  Well unbelievably, the program doesn't recognize the code that came with the device!  So then there's an entirely different procedure to connect the device.  But amazingly enough it too, doesn't work!!!  I can't get my WiFi system to connect to this device or vice-versa making it completely useless.  I called their technical support, spend 1 1/2 hours trying to get this piece of crap to connect.  No one could make it work.  It turns out it only works on 2.4Ghz networks, so if you have a 5Ghz network, forget it.  Don't buy this crap, it DOESN'T configure with 3 easy steps, that's for sure!!!
