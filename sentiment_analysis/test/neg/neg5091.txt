Misfit decided to use their customers as beta testers and this is the result. The latest update broke double tap for progress(a double tap does nothing now), sleep tracking (sleep record is of by nearly an hour each night since the update), the final straw however are the false call notifications the device keeps delivering, post update. The only (temporary) solution is to remove and re-seat the batteries. Which is terrible for a device designed to only be opened a few times a year. How long until it's no longer water resistant due to seal wear?I've asked Misfit repeatedly for instructions how to roll back to functional firmware but have been ignored.After 3 days the final response was "since it's not a serious problem bear with us, have a good weekend".I love the hardware but the software and support are terrible.  Buy from a different company.Update 14-7-16  Another update(2.11.2), another failure to fix this problem.  Misfit did offer me a replacement Shine since the Ray firmware is still defective. Which I suppose is half a solution.
