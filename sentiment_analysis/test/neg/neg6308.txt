Received this today. Bought this because I had read various articles about the harmful bacteria and germs that are found on most cellphones and can lead to making a person sick. Read the directions and followed the instructions on how to properly use this device. I then plugged in this device, placed my phone inside, closed the lid, and waited for the lightning bolt on the lid to glow blue to signify that the two UVC lights inside this device were disinfecting my cellphone. And I waited. And I waited. And I waited, but the lightning bolt never glowed blue. I opened up the lid and for a quick second caught a glimpse of the bottom UVC light glowing blue and then turning off. After further inspection I determined that the bottom UVC light worked properly, but the top UVC light - which disinfects the front of your cellphone and also makes the lightning bolt on the lid glow blue - was not working correctly. In order to thoroughly disinfect your phone both UVC lights should be working. So, I can disinfect my cellphone but that requires me to run the back of my cellphone through one cleaning cycle and then flip it over to disinfect the front of my cellphone through a second cleaning cycle; for the amount of money I paid for this device I shouldn't have to do this. I noticed that another buyer/reviewer encountered the same problem. I'll use it for a few more days to see if begins to work correctly but if it doesn't then I will be returning it. So far I'm very disappointed with this product.
