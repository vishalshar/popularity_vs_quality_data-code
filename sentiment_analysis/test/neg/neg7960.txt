This does not work reliably.  Sometimes it works (light turns on) when I close the lid and sometimes it does not.  I checked all the connections and they are all snug.I asked PhoneSoap for an exchange.  They have dragged their feet.  I requested an exchange on Jan 31.  Got a reply that they will do it on Feb 1.  I have not heard from them since and they have not made good on their offer to exchange my unit.
