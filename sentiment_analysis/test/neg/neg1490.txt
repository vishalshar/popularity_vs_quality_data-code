This product is kind of good for showing the life cycle of mushrooms but that's about it. The strain this company has selected will yield very small and very few mushrooms. If you want to eat fresh mushrooms you are better off going to the farmers market, you will get about 10 times the mushrooms by weight for the same price. If you want to learn how to grow mushrooms, save your money buy "the mushroom cultivator" book and buy some spawn. It will end up costing about $75 for the book and the base bones setup but you will get far more mushrooms than you can eat. This is an OK idea but over priced and not as green as they claim.
