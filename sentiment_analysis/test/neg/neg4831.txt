Though I like the concept, i find that the screw top lid leaks with my 24 oZ and 64oz big mouth mason jars.  So i have to bring a regular lid to work with me, and then replace the leak proof lid with this lid, so I can use a straw for my morning smoothies.  It's a bit annoying but I like the concept!  it;s a good lid if you don[t need to travel with it.  I use one lid with my home made salad dressings and keep that in the fridge. No issues with that.
