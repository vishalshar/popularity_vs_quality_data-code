I was very excited after reading the product details and features and how easy it is to setup.The setup is easy as far as connecting devices to the router is concerned. What is not mentioned is the setup of configuring the router to connect to the internet which is awful in case of this router. Traditional routers are way easier to setup. As mentioned devices can easily be connected to the router using the proximity authentication system. But no matter what I tried the router would not configure properly (DHCP configuration in case of comcast) in order to connect to the internet. After messing around with it for 2 hours, I was quite disappointed and am returning it.
