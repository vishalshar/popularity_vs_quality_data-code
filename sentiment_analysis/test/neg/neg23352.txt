Followed the instructions to the letter and nothing ever happened. I gave up on the one side and tried the other. I soaked it for even longer this time and still nothing...I'm guessing it's been about two weeks now on the other side. What a waste of money and time. Even more upsetting is how disappointed my kids were. May as well flush your money down the toilet, or better yet, just go buy some damn mushrooms.
