This product is not ready for the prime time. I think they should tell customers it's in Beta until the following issues are fixed.1. I got the product in the mail and the black box's cover had come off during shipping. When I looked at the black box it had a small chip where the cover connects to the box and as a result the cover is loose and could not have stayed on. The box is was also scratched up. At first I thought I had gotten a used black box. In reality it's just really cheaply made. The printing on the black box is faded in places and scratched. Made in a even cheaper factory in China for sure!2. The set-up was easy and as described, however the box is not shipped with instructions. As a result you have to go on their website for the instructions or print them before you start. It also takes a lot more than 20 minutes to install unless you've done it before.3. The app is awful! This is where my "beta" statement comes from. When I first set-up the system I only set it up for one door because I wanted to make sure it would work with my opener as it's  not on the list of confirmed devices. Once I confirmed it worked I was unable to add the second door because I did not choose the 2 door option when setting up my account. You must email the company to get the second door on your app unless you chose the correct number of doors at initial set-up.4. Checking the status of your door is a manual process. You have to go into the app and refresh it to see if you door is opened or closed. I opened the door with the push button and the app showed the door as still closed. I had to exit the app and go back in then the app showed the door open. I did not get any alerts. (Update: you can shake the phone for refresh and the IFTTT app is what sends you notification not garageio).5. IFTTT - I also used an IFTTT recipe to open the door when I arrived. I set-up the recipe correctly and put the circle around my house. The door does not open when I enter the circle. (geofencing). I'm not sure if this is an IFTTT issue or a Garageio issue and as a result have no idea on how to trouble shoot it. (Update: this turned out to be an iphone issue. Although 'app refresh in background was one, I turned it off and on again and then it started working.)6. My biggest concern is that I don't get notifications on the door being left open or if the door has been opened or closed as advertised. So I have to exit the app and open fresh to get an update on the status of the door. If you want to see the open/close history you must log on to the website as the app does not show that info. (Update: IFTTT app is required to get notifications at this time)The app is in a bad need for update. Again what's the point if I can't get notification or get geofencing to work? Yes it's cool to open the door with your phone, but it's must easier for me to push the little button on my car's mirror instead of getting my phone out, unlocking it, going to the garageio app and sliding up. In order for this device to be interesting it really needs to work with geofencing so that the door closes and opens automatically when I leave or arrive.I will continue to try and get this to work for a couple of days. Although with the loose black box cover and the scratches I might return it anyways.08 FEB 2016 - I've updated my review from 1 star to 3. This is mainly due to the customer support and help from co-founder Dave. Long story short. We finally got all the features to work, however via work around. The app is still in bad need of overhaul and the features should be stand alone and not rely on IFTTT. The garageio advertising shows notifications coming from garargeio, however they rely on IFTTT to send messages. I think this will eventually change, but at the moment you need two apps in order to get open/close/door left open notifications. The biggest problem is that nobody at IFTTT or garargeio will tell you this until you send an email to garageio. This further gives me the "beta testing" feeling.18 FEB 16 - Final update. I got the gogogate 2 yesterday. The gogogate is a far better product and is cheaper! Not only is the build quality better, but the set-up was super easy. The wireless sensors are more reliable than the wired ones garageio uses. Based on the build quality and the bugs that that the garageio app still has, I decided to send it back for a refund.
