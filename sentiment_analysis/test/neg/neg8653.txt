died after a few months. no sign of life. Getting new batteries for it, I thought they would last way longer based on claim.UpdateI changed the battery. It lasted two days and no sign of life again. So I changed the battery for another new one. It worked for 3 days then it stopped again.I followed all the instructions to reset/pair again and all that but nada. Emails are back saying my chipolo has lost communication for over 48 hrs. And now it's dead again. This is the worst tech-buy in a while. Downgraded to one star and chipolo will be thrown away. What a waste of time and I even bought a pack of new batteries for it. Unreliable, can't trust this thing. Buyer be aware.UPDATE 3Battery inside the chipolo now lasts about 2 hrs. That's it.Chipolo on the table, phone next to it. After 2 hrs the app doesn't see the chipolo, I test the battery (brand new when I put in) and it's now completely depleted.Joke
