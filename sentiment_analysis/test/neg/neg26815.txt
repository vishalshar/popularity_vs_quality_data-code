Mine came with the small suction cup that is supposed to hold the light in place in the bowl erroneously glued to the cord  with excess adhesive so it couldn't get suction. Keeps falling off my bowl no matter what angle/location I try using it for (this is limited by my inability to affix the light to the side of the rim). The concept is neat and while I was trying it out it was certainly a nice function once you see how it should work, but I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a product to fill that specific need based on my experience with this. Not worth the time or hassle to bother trying to return it.
