This looked so cool! I had to have it! When the product arrived I was instantly disappointed! The pictures online look so good. It looks solid, polished, a beautiful steampunk'ish growler!The pictures are truly the best aspect of this product. I bought two, one for each son. When I opened the box and pulled away the foam protection, I could instantly see the poor craftsmanship! It truly looked nothing like the pics online.The steel body looked like it had been kicked around shop floor and used for scrap storage. The brass parts were not much better. The welds look very amateurish. The whole product looks like it's been thrown together in some forced labor factory.It was all loose, wiggly and very cheap looking. I quickly opened the other one, you guessed it, the same poor quality but this one had a bonus! The pull down handle was broken.I called, obviously very upset, and found out this product has a "Not Possible to Return" status. They come with a couple C02 cartridges that for some reason can't be shipped back.The Amazon rep quickly stated not to worry as he could give me a credit or have two more shipped out. My gut told me to take my credit and forget about it, but I wanted them!Now I'm the proud owner of 4 shoddy looking growlers that I wouldn't gift an enemy!
