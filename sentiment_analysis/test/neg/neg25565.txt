Update: (Raspberry/Coconut) Wow..I knew they were for healthy conscious people but these are mostly tasteless and bland. It's like they went out of their way to make sure they have little-to-no flavor. I can see having them as emergency food for storms, power outages and maybe for camping but it would make a boring snack on a trip. If I was a kid and my parent gave these to me, I'd call CPS (just kidding) but I'd be a p'd off kid.I have also tried the Maple one and the Apple/Cinnamon one. They seem to have a little more flavor. When you eat raw raspberries, they have a distinctive taste. There is almost no raspberry flavor in these at all. It also says they used unflavored coconut. WHY??? Will not buy again. Gave them away at work.Edit: The Maple and Pear ones are better than the Raspberry and Coconut ones. Not much but a little better. I at least tasted the maple and pear in these. It's still VERY bland and I won't buy them again. See image of what I had to do to enjoy the Raspberry ones.
