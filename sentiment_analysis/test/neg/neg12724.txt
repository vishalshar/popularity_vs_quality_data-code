Guys, perhaps you were like me excited to get into the whole remote controlling your lock wherever you are especially if you are running an Airbnb business. I did, and got the smartlock and connect first. It worked while it lasted for a month but not in the way that you might have imagined it to.(1) Connecting to the smartlock via the connect remotely is unreliable and each time you are put through a 15 second or so wait not knowing if it will fail to connect while your guest is waiting in front of the door;(2) the idea of remote operation is to save you time as you don't need to be present to check people in or out but from my experience, it is a pain to have to coordinate with your guests via whatsapp and phone to ensure the exact moment they reach your front door so that you could then remotely open the door or lock it; and(3) as I also use several cleaning agencies to clean my apartment when my guests leaves, the hassle is multiplied.I thought hey, since I'm already invested in the August ecosystem, I might as well get the keypad so that (1) I don't need to coordinate with my guests and cleaners when they get in or out; and (2) I'll just grant/revoke passwords remotely. WRONG. The keypad does not allow you to remotely grant or revoke temporary passwords. You need to be in bluetooth proximity to add or delete passwords which completely defeats the purpose as having the same 1 or 2 passwords for multiple guests and cleaners compromises security. I live 100 miles away from my Airbnb apartment and may only be able to change the password once a month. I have also read from other reviewers that the battery on this thing sucks big time.So what is the conclusion? The keypad is an afterthought product from August and it shows. It does not add any new or novel functionality to other existing keypad based digital locks in the market and in fact is utterly inferior to them since (1) it has very bad battery life (read other reviews); (2) needs to be screwed in at the side of your front door as close as possible to your smartlock; (3) easily ripped off and stolen; (4) NO REMOTE ADDING OR DELETING PASSWORDS; (5) need to wait several seconds for the bluetooth to sync with the smartlock to open/close; and (6) existing digital locks in the market are just better in every respect!
