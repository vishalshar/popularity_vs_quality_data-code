Ordered two ThermoPeanuts, one for the refrigerator and one for a freezer in the garage.  Very easy to set up, and since they come in a variety of colors, it is easy to distinguish them.  Once the sensor is paired with your smartphone, you can rename them from Red and Navy to whatever you want.  By the way, when you activate them by pulling the battery tab, they should make a sound, so you will know if the battery is dead.  Also, they make a sound once paired with your phone.  They do an excellent job of monitoring the temperatures.  Two issues; the Bluetooth range seems to require that you be in the same room as the peanut, and the minimum expected temperature you can set (for alarm purposes) is minus 5 degrees (F).  The freezer is slighter lower.The App itself (Android) is easy to use, and will initially display all the Peanuts originally synced with it, so you can quickly see the temperatures on all the units at once (along with the time of the most recent update).  You can than select each individual sensor for a readout and a graph showing the recent readings.  Alarms are easily set from this page to warn you if the temperature is out of  limits (too hot or too cold).Overall, if you need to monitor temperature in a location this will do the trick.  However, the range appears to be limited reducing its usefulness, thus the four stars.Comes nicely packaged with a clay-like adhesive, a belt holder that the sensor slips into, a key ring and a nice little gift bag.  All this is in a small 3x4 inch box.  I wouldn't mention the packaging, but it is particularly nice.  I would have expected just a cardboard with a heat shrink wrapper.---------------------One month follow-up -Both units have gone bad.  I replaced the battery in one, and it worked a few days before stopping.  Didn't see any need to try fixing the other.  Have returned them.  Overall, the Bluetooth range is very limited and will not register through an object like a refrigerator door.  But more importantly, they both stopped working within a month, so it wasn't just one bad unit.  I would not recommend it !
