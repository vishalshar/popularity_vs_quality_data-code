Per their web site the app is supported by the following,"Most HTC and LG devices"yet when I try and install I get a stupid message about"This app is incompatible with your device."Either post EVERY device you support, or put out an app that will load on devices that have the same CPU and chipset support as other supported (in this case LG devices)AWFUL Installation Experience!I was able to install an APK offline from the Google store and the camera works JUST FINE on my device.  I'm giving 2 stars, 4 for the hardware (I do notice some thermal gradient), 2 for the software and 1 for the installation experience and ease of use.  If they can straighten out the issue with the Google store and improve the app, I could easily see this device being a 4 star product.
