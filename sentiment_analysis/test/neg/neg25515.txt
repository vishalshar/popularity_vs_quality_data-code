As if 3 negative reviews weren't enough for me, I just had to try these for myself. I have a scar near my eyebrow, that can look like a big wrinkle, so I thought these tips might help; with the application.  WRONG!  It becomes clumsy trying to navigate pushing the syringe 5 inches away from my face, vs. using the spatula that allows for easier application.  Also, there is a lot of the Dermaflage that remains in the tip that is not usable, so you end up wasting more of the product than you would without the tips.  #FeelingLikeI'veBeenHad
