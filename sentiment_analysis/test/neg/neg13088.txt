I've been using the quad lock system for few years now and i love it! I decided to purchase the case because I ended up getting the new iphone 6s. The case itself is pretty decent, but the TPU around the flash is already coming undone and its starting to separate. Not too sure how much longer the case will last. Also they should update the design of the case where the overall case is thicker to match the bulge in the middle.
