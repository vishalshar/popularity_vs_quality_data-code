We have the TP-Link HS200 which are awesome but they unfortunately don't have the ability to dim you lights.These are expensive at at the time of purchase were not supported by Alexa but we were super excited about the ability to set a permanent dimmer level for each switch form the app.It was cool being able to see how much power was being drawn by the lights but sadly the switches themselves are very unresponsive.Both my wife an I had to press each switch 5 to 7 times every time to actually turn them on.All three switches had the same result.Disappointed and returned.
