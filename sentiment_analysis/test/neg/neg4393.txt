I wanted to love this product. When it works, it is the best thing for my dog. She loves the laser and I love getting to check on her and letting my family see and play with her from afar. I even purchased one for my sister and hers works perfectly. The initial set up is simple. The product (when it works) works as advertised and even just downloading the app is fun to play with other people's pets.That said, after the initial 2 days of consistent connection, mine constantly disconnects itself for no reason. The only way to reset it, that was worked, is to connect it to the wireless "Guest Network" like it's a new network. Within 24 hours, it forgets the network information and begins blinking yellow again. If I rename the guest network, it'll work for 1-24 hours and break again. I've tried leaving it unplugged for hours/days - no good. I've tried traveling with it to see if it works on another persons wifi - no good. This specific petcube appears to be jacked up.I am going to give it until this weekend when I have some time to mess around with it again, and if that doesn't do it, I'll be returning it.
