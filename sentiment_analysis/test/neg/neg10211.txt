This review will be updated soon but my continued experience with the Presence has not been good so far.Unboxed it, hooked up to existing light fixture (whoever designed the place for the allen wrench to be used to tighten the camera should be fired btw), and powered on.  Lights turned on and did their thing.  Was briefly pleasantly surprised.Downloaded the NetAtmo security app.  Detected the camera.  Tried to join to wifi network.  Failed with picture attached.  Kept repeating.  Created an Open SSID without any encryption to see if that was what was breaking it but it failed with the same error.Tried to contact NetAtmo.  No phone number anywhere and contacting through their site is a serious hassle.  Sent initial communication three days ago of problem.  Received one email back approx two hours later asking me to confirm my order number and email address.  Replied right away.  Nothing since.I have ordered a replacement unit from Amazon which I will try installing today to see if it was just a faulty unit.  If I have the same problem both will be going back and I will be done with the presence.  Shame too because WeatherStation is a good product I am fond of.
