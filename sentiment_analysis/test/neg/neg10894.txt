I am not one to write reviews, but this particular item simply won't last. I am one week out of the return window or I would return it. The touch controls do not have a durable covering - the plastic overlay on the start and cancel "buttons" are already showing signs of wear. - there is a spider web of scratches in the plastic that do not bode well for longevity. I've had similar appliances that that withstood years of wear, so my expectations I think are reasonable.
