I was an early adopter of the GAME GOLF (original not Live). I lived through the terrible web experience, but it kept getting better. Little by little it became more useful. I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME about the Live Tracking System. I waited and bought it later in the cycle, hoping that they would have the Live bugs worked out. No such luck.:THE GOOD:1) The ability to have a accurate reading of the distances and directions your ball went is extremely valuable. This product like its less expensive non-live GAME GOLF does deliver that. Although you will see there are areas for improvement.2) It is easy to use if your DO NOT use the LIVE feature or App.3) The website is getting better features and is useful for sifting through sats.THE BADBUGS Galore1) Live App hangs all the time (see Screen shot of 7th hole when I was on the 10th) during all that time the screen stayed the same.2) The only way out is to kill the app, but to reconnect to the Game Golf Module you have start a new round.3) But you can't merge the 2 partial rounds into one round.THE UGLYThen let talk about the GPS Map. (Nice idea, but many others apps out there do a much better job)1) The features of touching the screen to find a distant (which most other GPS do quite well) is so bad you can't use it.2) (ignore the hanging all the time) The GPS maps are static which does not make sense to me.3) distances to Hazards etc are not listed so you have to point on the screen (which I pointed out does not work).For use on a round this tool is not worth the Free that you pay for the App. Golfshot GPS, GolfNow and several other work much better. I still do not understand why they don't partner with the others and make a killer add-on instead of trying to be everything and doing it poorly.
