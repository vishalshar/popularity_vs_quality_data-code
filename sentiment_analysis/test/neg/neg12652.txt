Love this item.  Problem is.. I purchased this 2/pk in April 2016 for $23.08.  3 months later it is DOUBLE the price!  Almost $50.00 for 2 bags of apple chips?  No wonder it's so hard for people to be healthy!!  Companies make it so difficult when they charge such outrageous prices!  People try to teach their kids/grandkids healthy habits,  only to be ripped off by companies who want to take people for all they can get!!  Shame on this company for being so greedy!
