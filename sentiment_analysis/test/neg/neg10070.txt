PLEASE SEE UPDATES BELOW ORIGINAL REVIEWWithin the app I tried to limit "Message Privacy" to just me - it does not work.  I tried to "Limit Comments" -  it does not work,  "Limit Comment Viewing" does not work.  What does work??  App freezes sometimes too, like when it was trying to download my address list.  AND the stated privacy policy is way too invasive.  Do yourself a favor and read the privacy policy.UPDATE: Despite their website stating that you can control privacy, you cannot control privacy.  The privacy settings do not work.  You can see people's private pictures, audio messages, and video messages from all across the country (and world actually).  I would have to guess most people have no idea that other people are able to see their tine tag messages.  The two that I have done (that I tried to make private) have been viewed by people I do not know many times already.  This is pretty bad since one of them is a password.  it has forced me to change one of my passwords.  You don't even need to scan the tag to view it, you go to their map and just click on the tags you want to view.  Until these people start taking privacy seriously, I strongly recommend that you heed my warnings, and read their privacy policy before you make this purchase.  I would be most interested to see if the company responds to this privacy catastrophe, and what they plan on doing about it.Update 2I did add one star because they removed the ability to see peoples tags on the map.  That is very good.However, many things did not change.  App still freezes during contact sync, I still have issues with their privacy policy (as per their request I will contact them about my concerns), there is no way to remove tags that are no longer valid (at least that I can find), and when I tried to restrict who can see my tags to just me ( which was my entire purpose for getting these tags), that still does not work.It was nice to see that the company at least responded.Update 3The company has contacted me repeatedly about my issues.  While I am not ready to say I am satisfied, I am impressed with the fact they they have been persistent in contacting me, and addressing my concerns.  It should be noted that they have not asked me to modify my review; I have done this of my own volition.They take customer feedback seriously, that is clear.  I have yet to address my concerns with their privacy policy, but they have promised to discuss my concerns.
