The clear dry erase board seemed like a very good idea. The reviews certainly added to this assumption. Unfortunately, it does not cling well to even smooth surfaces. I may have received a defective product since the entire film seemed to shrink and peel off by itself overnight. When I found it in the morning, it had curled up on itself in all directions and could no longer be used (think scotch tape folding on itself). This was in less than 12 hours after first applying it. I was hoping that this would be my solution to a heavy writing board but I guess you truly cannot replace the tried and tested! I now have one more of these that I will probably never take out of the box. Extremely disappointed.
