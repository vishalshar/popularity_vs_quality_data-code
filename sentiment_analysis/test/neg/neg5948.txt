This is for the plug switch.  Save yourself the headache.  Buy a Z-wave device.  I bought three of these to complement my existing Smartthings network for those Christmas things you want to move around the the house.  I have spent over an hour attempting to get it configured -- BEFORE I tried bringing it onto the Smartthings net.  It will NOT recognize my wifi --no matter how many resets.
