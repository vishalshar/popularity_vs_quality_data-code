This test came back negative when I know for a fact that something was wrong..So I went to the express care center and guess what they do..More tests..swabs and urine..and Guess what they come back as..Positive.I mentioned taking this mail in test and the Dr. was puzzled telling me that he couldnt see how I could do one through a Lab without a Dr.s order.Somewhat Fishy if you ask me.
