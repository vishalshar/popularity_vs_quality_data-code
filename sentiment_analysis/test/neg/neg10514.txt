Maybe ok for someone else, but definitely not for me! I wish this was available without the citrus flavor, but all together has a very medicinal taste that makes it very difficult for me to drink the recommended 12oz of this stuff... I've tried adding juice, soda, flavored water and it all still taste like medicine... reminds me of the aftertaste from those powdered migraine meds.After trying several different things to avoid throwing it away, I've finally found that heating it up makes it slightly more palatable!
