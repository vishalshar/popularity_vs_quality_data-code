For the price I expected higher quality material than the average lower cheaper one. The ergonomic nob broke and now it can't hold any weight on the end without dropping. I see that other reviewer also have some problem with theirs breaking due to heat and it was pretty hot on the day it broke too so this thing sucks with hot weather.
