I was able to overlook the huge size and thickness of this wallet when I received it, but after having it for a little more than a month, it's basically a paperweight.  The charges are not consistent, I can't get a full charge on my 6+, it shuts down a lot.  When I tried to initiate a return I had missed the window by a week so this will be my first and last Nomad product.
