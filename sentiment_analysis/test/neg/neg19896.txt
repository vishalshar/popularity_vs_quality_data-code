Good if it works.... Experiences issues every day or so that requires camera to be unplugged and restarted.  Shows as active on the network, but camera is unresponsive.  Also tried using Security Spy software and camera would drop connection every few seconds rather than offering a constant stream (something my other DLink cameras do not encounter).  Camera is fairly useless for a security camera, but is good quality in the rare times it functions properly.
