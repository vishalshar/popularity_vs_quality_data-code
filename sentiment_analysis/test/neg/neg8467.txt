This case did not fit my iPhone 6S Plus (2015), it looks like it is for the regular 6 Plus from 2014 (which is smaller by millimeters). The case is ever-so-slightly too small for the 6S Plus, so it pushes in the power button of the phone, making the phone think you want to turn it off. No matter how I adjusted the case, I couldn't get it to fit properly (even if you could, it's so tight, you can't press the power button). So it is unusable on the 6S Plus.Also, mine arrived broken, so I had to return it anyways. You can see in my photo that the small, black rubber part near the speaker hole was already severed.The materials were fairly nice, the felt is an interesting texture and a nice color, definitely unusual. The black plastic/rubber is flexible and feels high-quality.
