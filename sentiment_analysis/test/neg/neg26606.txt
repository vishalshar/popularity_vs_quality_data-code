The Zipp speaker could never connect to my iPod Touch (latest generation), iPad Air 2, nor MacBook Pro via their Libratone App using wi-fi.  Bluetooth worked, but that's not why I bought the speaker.  The Libratone app seems suspect, though Libratone and I were not able to nail that down.  I was not willing to "try another router" (versus my Netgear AC1750).A further, special ding against this speaker is that Libratone has conflated the *control* of the speaker with the *display of its status*, and the display is ALWAYS lit when the speaker is on.  Most of the time, the light is completely unnecessary.  (Hey Libratone software engineers: perhaps you can teach your hardware folks about MVC, and that V does not have to be the same widget as C.) Remember the recent headlines (early June/16) such as "80 Percent of Americans Can't See the Milky Way Anymore"?  This kind of thing is one more nail in that coffin (yep, I did plan to use the speaker outside, while enjoying astronomy).  Libratone did not answer when I asked if a firmware update might change this.It's a *speaker*.  It shouldn't be this hard to use.  Nor this bright.Returned.
