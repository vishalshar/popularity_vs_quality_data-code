ive been using these for a few months on some puma sneakers. the reason for my low review is that they started kind of nice and tight, but any sort of pressure on them (IE jogging or quick movements) caused the top 2 to come undone. i tried all the tricks listed by this company to try and get them to work correctly, but could never get them right. i have since removed the top 2 links from my shoes, and they are very loose. i am just waiting to find an alternative that may work better. might even go back to the old laces.
