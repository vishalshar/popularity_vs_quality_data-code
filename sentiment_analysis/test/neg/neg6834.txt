I tested 3 different watches , all three had same experience.The good: The watch design is remarkable,  it's well crafted and feel good to waer, the watch is  water resistant and has a solid good and feel.The step track feature works well.The bad:The software quality is debatable,  I was unable to find a valid code on the Google store only back door installation.The watch features are basics , it's hard to read the caller ID.The watch battery drained after one day of use , I changed the battery and the battery dies 48 hours after the replacement.Summqry:Very nice design very poor execution.
