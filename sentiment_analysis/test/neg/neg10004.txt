I purchased two Fizzics Waytaps as gifts for my husband and my father.  We tested ours on Christmas Eve (only 2 beers) and it worked great.  We tried it again on New Year's Eve and it no longer works!  We put in new batteries and tried it with a glass of water instead of beer to no avail.  You can only hear the "engine" when you press back on the tap for the head; no sound and nothing happens when you pull forward on the tap.My father's Waytap, on the other hand, has not worked straight out of the box at all!I was so excited for this gift ever since I saw it on Shark Tank, so you can imagine my disappointment when the product did not work for either of my recipients!  When my husband's didn't work, I thought we got a dud, but when my dad called I knew we had a product quality issue on our hands.I'm going through Fizzic's warranty claims process now, so we'll see how that goes :(
