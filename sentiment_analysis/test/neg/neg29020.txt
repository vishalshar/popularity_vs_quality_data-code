PROS: Nice looking, cute round design with invisible display behind glass.CONS: #1 - inaccurate. At first, gave results about 1.5lb off my Withings (checked against doctor's balance to be within 0.4lbs). but then started to read about 10lbs too high. I replaced the batteries, just on a whim and that made me 'gain' 45lbs. What a piece of crap!  I tested a FitBit Aria (+2.2lbs high readings, 0.3lb standard deviation) and Withings WS-50 (0.4lbs too low, 0.2lbs standard deviation), both provided repeatable measurements, but this Qardio isn't anywhere near in the same ballgame. Could be a firmware bug, like they are trying to correct for your local gravity but got it 100x too much correction.#2 - 8 (eight) batteries! The LED display, bright enough to shine through the white paint on the glass is cute, but costly in power.#3 - Display position - center of scale, under your feet. What are they thinking? At least it repeats the weight and fat% after you step out#4 - Unstable - feet too much to the center, step too much to the corner and the whole thing flips when you lift your other foot off the ground to step on it. Safety hazard!#5 - Poor wifi - got 'wifi error' half of the time. Withings next to it has no problem uploading data to same router#6 - Can't weight luggage, packages, etc. Despite being told by email that it was possible, it can't do what a $15 10-yr old scale can.#7 - Bugs, bugs, bugs - firmware is not ready for shipment. Scale gets stuck often in a 4-dot lit mode (wasting those 8 batteries) where can't communicate to it, can't weight, can't do a thing except remove batteries to get a damn smiley face again.Save yourself the aggravation - get a Withings WS-50 (my choice) or FitBit Aria (also decent if not as accurate).########## update 11/7/2015Qardio sent me a replacement unit. It was in fact much more accurate, just about 1.5lb under actual weight. Taking 10 measurements to estimate standard deviation, though, showed weird behavior, 6x got 214.5, 2x 214.7 and 3x 214.9 (not a single .6 or .8, making for a 'missing tooth' histogram).  I suspected either lower precision or some VW-type firmware trying to stick to older readings. I then took another 5 holding my 1/2lb phone (extended battery) and got 4x 214.7 and one 214.5. I went for alternating measurements with and without and extra 2.1lb of Prego, which first gave 'wireless error' then twice in a row the 'The scale is dead' four dots in the center (I have waited as long as 8min for it to clear, it seems it is stuck doing something, maybe connecting to wifi or just locked up) twice - had to remove batteries to 'reboot'. I tried a firmware update - which took 3 tries and didn't make a difference. I did get one weight with an even decimal before I just gave up on the thing.  I was doing the tests alternating with a Withings WS-50, which didn't fail a single time, got better histogram (4x 214.9, 4x 215.0 and 2x 215.1) and had no issue connecting, from the same place, to wifi and uploading results to their superior app. Replacement shipped back the same day it arrived. The box already had a second 'seal' on it, likely been returned before.From the replacement, I learned:#1- Measuring weight with strain gauges is no rocket science, Qardio will get it right eventually, like most $15 scales#2- Undercooked firmware can really hurt a product - 8 out of 8 bad reviews will be a scar here in Amazon#3- You can have a pretty design, preemptive marketing hype, but that alone can't float bad hardwareMy recommendation is still the Withings WS-50 or a not too distant second, the Fitbit Aria.
