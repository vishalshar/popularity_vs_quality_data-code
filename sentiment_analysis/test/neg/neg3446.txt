I wanted to have an email or txt msg sent to me if motion was detected, but when I tried to setup the rule on the mydlink home app, the "Select Responder" field was blank (there was no way to send an email or msg).  I called DLink tech support and talked to agent AR004620 and I think I would need one of their smart plugs or cameras to make this work.  The mydlink home app does receive notifications, but that wasn't what I wanted.I'll return this.Update - when I unplugged this device from the wall socket, then it sent a notification to my iPhone.  The phone beeped, and a message appeared on the notifications screen saying that the device had been unplugged. Too bad it didn't work like this when it detected motion.
