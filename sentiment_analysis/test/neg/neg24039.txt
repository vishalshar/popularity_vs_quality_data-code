This product looks good and sturdy, but its far from that. The body looks well made but the lightening part which goes in the iOS devices is not. After very nominal use i.e. 15 times in last couple of months and keeping it in my office bag I find that the lightening end of the NomadKey has fallen off and now cannot be used any more. I wished i haven't bought this.
