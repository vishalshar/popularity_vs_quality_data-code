I've been waiting to give this company the benefit of the doubt but I've lost my trust in Automatic at this point.  I've been using 2 of these for close to a year now, one in each car...  the company still has yet to bring all of the advertised features to the Android app despite all of their promises...  But honestly, the thing had been tracking my trips very well which is what I bought it for ... that is until just recently.  You may note that they now have a Gold version of the adapter....  after the most recent app updates after the announcement of the Gold adapter the reliability of the device seems to have disintegrated.  What's worse is there is now information in the FAQs that indicate these 2 adapters I purchased no more than a year ago are going to be obsoleted and will not see any additional features -- this means that I'll never see features that they advertised and with the reliability not there any longer I'm questioning the usefulness of the product moving forward which means I'm out $200 and may not have even got an entire year's worth of trip logs for my taxes.  It's possible that they work through this reliability issue but I don't trust the company at all....  when you keep promising that you're adding features that are promised ON THE BOX your device came in that's one thing but when you all of a sudden abandon that and tell you that they've decided to stop production of your device and recommend you by their new one that is completely unacceptable.
