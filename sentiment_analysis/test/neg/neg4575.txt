Originally before purchasing this item, I contacted their support to inquire about the android app and when it would be released. They promised me that it would be very shortly and that it wouldn't be unreasonable to purchase now and wait for the app to get released in the next few weeks. Now it's been a few months and still no android app. Quite displeased with their lies and lack of progress in developing an app for android which definitely is killing quite a bit of their potential customers. Being that I despise apple devices, I'm unwilling to purchase one just so I can use this item. It's really such a shame.
