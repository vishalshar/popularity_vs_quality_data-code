ORIGINAL REVIEW: Works like a charm with the lock! Had it for a week so far. Love how different codes can be set up to different phone numbers. No more leaving keys near the door! Noticed some bonus feature is that it actually buzz for a while if you get the code wrong multiple times, as if to catch attention that someone tries to get in but failed.UPDATE (8/20): Dialing the stars from 5 to 2. I have installed the keypad for just about 30 days; Problems started around 10 days ago when it won't unlock at all, but recovered by itself several hours later; Luckily we had our phone to connect to the lock directly. Then yesterday while everyone was out our dog sitter took the dog out using her code, but couldn't get back in after standing there for 15 minutes trying !!!!!! When I got back, at first the keypad had no response and no light, figured the battery must have died, but without further tempering the keypad works again later in the evening.... We use the keypad just about 2-3 times a day, each time once to lock it behind us, once to open again. I see from other reviews that this range of battery life seems to be consistent. But if it starts being temperamental at 20 days, this really means you have to make sure you keep the battery fresh within that time... which is... i must say, disappointing. I see August is recommending turning off the proximity backlit feature, I will try that and see when the next problem comes... hopefully you won't hear from me for months.UPDATE (9/20): The Keypad continued to be temperamental. The firmware update recently helped not much. Tried replacing both the locks and the keypad batteries at the same time using Duralock batteries. I now use keys to get back into my house. Possibly seeking a refund here. I liked the idea very much but this is turning out to be a slap in the face for spending money.
