Way loose.  Soon as you unscrew it and try to store this camera with the adapter, it will fall off just as easily as the Lytro lens cap.  It could have been made snug with a little more rubber on the interior.  The description says "grey" but the picture looks closer to white.  What arrived was a Gun Metal Grey much darker than pictured.
