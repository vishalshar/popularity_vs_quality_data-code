My cat loves this stuff, he sits by the refrigerator every night waiting for his treat.  The quality of the last couple of bags were horrible.  Yes, the original order and the replacement order were both bad quality. Literally the last couple of bags were mostly powder and the chicken were stringy and all dried out.  My cat kept looking up at me as if to say, "you expect me to eat this stuff?" .  Thankfully Amazon gave me a refund, so now I have to sift through all this powder to find some acceptable pieces.  I stopped my automatic order because I didn't want to get more of the same.  I will eventually try again but I am frustrated because I don't know what I am going to get.  Please Whole-Life fix this problem.  This stuff is expensive, but I am willing to pay only if the quality is worth it.  So if the quality is what it usually is this would have 5 stars.
