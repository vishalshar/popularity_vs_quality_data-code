Honestly - the teeny battery powered motor is so weak only a feather touch keeps the extremely loud contraption from stopping this thing all together. It is an utter waist of money. I'm astonished that this product was manufactured. A better use is to convert it to one of those contraptions that you use to drop liquid paint on a spinning piece of cardboard. PLEASE save your money.
