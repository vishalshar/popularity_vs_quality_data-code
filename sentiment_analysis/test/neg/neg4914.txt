I am currently following the Ideal Protein Phase 1 protocol.  The clinic I go to uses the InBody 570 scale which does a large amount of Body Analysis over and above your weight.  Without thinking, when I seen that InBody was releasing a wrist model I jumped at it.  I have not had my share of wearables, and this was the first one that I have owned that was worn on my wrist.Honestly, I was buying this one specifically, so I did no real research on any of the others.  A cursory glance at what other companies were offering felt like they all did about the same thing.  Definately some were more advanced than others depending on what your needs were, but the InBody Band was the first (I think) to do the body analysis.  So I think that when this one hit the market and it was reported that it would do the body analysis it instantly climbed to the top.  However, that is my uneducated opinion.InBody Band Google Search ResultsInBody Band ImagesIndustry Compatibility (0/10)I have had multiple FitBits (or FitBitches as I call them) and the draw to many of these wearables is that they not only have their own app where you configure and keep track, but there are widely used and relied upon apps like MyFitnessPal out there that can sync data from these units.  This isnt true (yet) for the InBody Band.  I dont know that anything else needs to be said about thatGeek Factor (8/10)I am not a product reviewer so I really dont know what else to call it but the Geek Factor.  Its a pretty cool unit.  Fairly small and not really noticeable on my wrist.  Lets face it though, what this unit claims it does is pretty cool.  There are two sensors on the back and two on top of the unit that are engaged and via some level of electrical impulses and probably a ton of math, it generates all sorts of Body Analysis numbers.It gives you your Body Fat Mass, your Skeletal Muscle Mass (I am guessing everything else here is just calculated), % Body Fat, BMI etc.  You have the ability to enter some data manually as well to round out the picture.  The unit also captures your the amount of sleep and deep or quality sleep.Accuracy (0/10)LOL.  I certainly did not expect this to produce the same numbers as the 10k scales.  However, I figured that the numbers would be consistent.  Either consistently high or consistently low.  I had it for about a week before I had my next weigh in so I would have a little bit of data before I weighed on the scale.One thing I noticed is that the numbers were all over the place.  Mathematically, everything mapped out.  If fat went down, muscle went up etc.  All of the graphs that it generated followed the same path.  However, the numbers didnt make sense.  I ran the test at pretty much the same time, in the same spot and in the same way every morning.  But looking at the numbers my muscle mass would show 127 pounds one day and 118 the next.  In this example, you would see the opposite for the fat.This was probably the biggest reason (SPOILER ALERT) that I returned it.Additional Thought  I am a big guy, this may have something to do with the accuracy, I dont know.  I wasnt going to wear it for a year to try and determine that.Functionality (0/10) DISCLAIMER: From my perspective onlyI suppose this could be higher but I dont know what the rules are.  As I ran the tests everyday and looked at the data it was giving me, especially with the numbers jumping everywhere, I just couldnt see where this data was going to be useful to me anywhere.  Trust me, the geek in me wanted this relationship to work out.As I already said, I really wanted this one to work out.  As a side note.  It also captures steps and everything like that, which I could have used but at $170 I wasnt willing to wear this thing all day then have to manually enter my numbers from its app to other industry popular apps.I am thinking that by summer time, once I have dropped a large portion of my weight, I will look this little beauty up and give her another spin.
