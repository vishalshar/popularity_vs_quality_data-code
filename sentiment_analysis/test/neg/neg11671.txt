THe stainless one I s great at keeping beverages hot for a long time!  (The black and red plastics don't keep hitbthenwntore drive into work) However, we are on our 3rd SS one.  The finish is pitted on all three and the orange anti-tip piece has broken on all three of them.  Great mug is they could improve the finish and the anti-tip piece- all have come loose.  Never been in dishwasher.
