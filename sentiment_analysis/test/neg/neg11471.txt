Worked great for about 20 days and now won't turn on. I had turned it off about 3 minutes earlier, turned it back on and nothing. It appears to be getting power when I charge it, but nada. I dilly-dallied deciding whether to return it or replace it and waited too long to try and return it via Amazon, will see what my options are with Outdoor Technology but not finding any kind of support page on their website.UPDATE: Bumped to 2 stars as I found the support link on the web page
