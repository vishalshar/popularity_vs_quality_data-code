I had higher hopes for this button.  I also have the flic button and was hoping this button would be better, but it is not.  Unlike the flic, this button only has two options-single and long press.  It's hard to tell when you're doing one and not the other.  There is a quick series of light flashes after presses, but I'm still unsure what they mean.  They could be responses to the length of time the stone is pressed or toggling a notification.  The plastic of the stone feels thin and brittle, but has held up so far.  I find myself having to press it multiple times, and sometimes go into the app itself, to get it to respond the way I want it to.  It's much more cumbersome than to just do the action myself.  I like the form factor, and the idea of this, but cannot recommend it unless both its app and hardware are updated.  It needs better feedback for completed actions and more reliability so that I can just press the button and expect it to work instead of opening the app and having to verify that it did.
