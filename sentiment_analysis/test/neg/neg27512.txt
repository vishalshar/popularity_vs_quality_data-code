I was in love with the Whistle for the first week we owned one!  Unfortunately our dog sitter informed us that it had fallen off during a walk and we were out of town.  Despite searching it was unable to be found.  We had given explicit instructions on how to attach the device after charging and know with certainty that it was attached properly to the collar loop.  Our dog is a hound and does a lot of head shaking when his ears bother him.  We are honestly surprised that this device came off so easily, especially something with this kind of cost and inability to track after it disappears.  We've made several attempts to reach out to Whistle and see if there's anything to be done, but there has been complete radio silence on their end.After reading a lot of other reviews on here in regards to Whistle and the previous company, Tagg, it appears that poor customer service is a common thread here.  I would have at least expected some type of response, but until we hear something one way or another I will stick with the one star review.
