WOW. Do not buy this unless you like vomiting. It tastes like orange flavored fake sugar. I bought the unflavored one with dha but amazon no longer sells this. I wish I could get my money back because it was a complete waste of money and I would not give it to my worst enemy. I was not feeling at all nauseous until I tasted this and now just thinking about the taste makes me want to throw up. Trust me....this citrus flavor is all wrong no matter what you mix it with.
