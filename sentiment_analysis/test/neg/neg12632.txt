The title is what sold me. I am a almond butter foodie,  it's one of my favorites treats. I tasted this, was shocked at how instantly disappointed I was. So I stirred, tried again. .. hoping SIME flavor would surface. ..nope. just the almond butter. There is no hint of vanilla or espresso.  The price if this item is fair IF you are getting an excellent product.  This was an absolute fail for me. Your local grocery store has a brand with flavors for $2 less that packs a huge flavor! So, if all you want is the taste of almonds and oil... this is your product .
