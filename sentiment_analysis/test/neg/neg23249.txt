I've caught three rats and two mice in our regular spring traps, over six weeks. I've had this trap armed (with Ultimate Lithium batteries, the strongest you can get) alternately in our basement and attic, along with the wire traps. Only once was this trap triggered (the light flashes to let you know), and there was no rodent inside, so it didn't even kill the one rodent (likely a mouse, in the attic) that went into it.
