Professional musician.  Very disappointed.  Sound quality poor.  Difficult to obtain proper fit.  Good in concept, but while probably ok for people listening on Ipods, etc (which have marginal sound reproduction capability at best due to digital file compression algorithms), for on-stage monitoring I would go with a higher quality system.  Returned after one day.
