The product team tried to release this thing as soon as possible and it just doesn't feel that the product is ready. They have a updater software you have to install in your PC to update the Dash. And the software doesn't work. As a result, they provide a "Rapid Update" which use the two separate earphones as USB flash disks and you have to copy the files to those earphones one by one. And, of course, the second one doesn't mount to computer and then you will be stuck in the middle of the update and the Dash just stops working. As you can see, the using experience really sucks while it should have been very smoothly. Anyway don't think the product is ready. DO NOT BUY THEM.
