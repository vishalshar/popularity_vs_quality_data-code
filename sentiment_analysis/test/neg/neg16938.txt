Pros:-Does the job of protecting the Jamstik (I have the V1, non-bluetooth version but this should also work with the Bluetooth V2 version)-Has a pocket for a few accessories.  I keep a small pick holder and some small iPhone style wired headphones and a small set of bluetooth headphones in the pocket (newer bluetooth headphones don't have that much latency, at least good enough for practice).- When it's time to go somewhere I throw it in my duffle and feel MOSTLY confident no damage will come to it.Cons:-Still a soft body case with fairly low quality.  It has very little padding and, let's face it, the Jamstik is basically a fairly fragile plastic device with thin walls, unsupported strings, and sensitive electronics.  This case will protect it against a firm smack against a corner or a 5 meter drop but much more and you are likely to need repairs.-Expensive for what you get.  In some cases it can be 50% the price of the instrument itself!-Not enough storage, would have liked to have a pocket for a iPhone or iPad so it could carry everything I needed to pick up and go to a quick impromptu park session in sweats or other attire that might not have pockets (or big enough pockets for an iPad).  This shows a lack of forward thinking on the part of Jamstik because they clearly designed for this sort of spontaneous moments of inspiration when the player might not have done a lot of pre-planning to have their full session duffle with them.---So if it does what it is mostly supposed to do and the cons seem to be a lot of preference, why 2 stars?---Simply put it is too expensive but is able to command the extreme price due to the lack of alternatives.Considering the Wi-Fi version of the Jamstik can be found for $100 with a bit of looking (as of March 2016) a barebones soft body case costing fully 50% the of the instrument price is inexcusable in my opinion especially for a piece of basic kit basic of this low quality.  I honestly can't see why it wasn't included in the box to begin with.I did a fairly decent search for something cheaper or hard shell or hand-made on Etsy or eBay to no avail before I finally broke down and bought this item.
