It would be a great fitness tracker but the sports band and accessories just kills it. I want to wear it all day every day but simply can't. It pops out 5-6 times a day. POOR POOR design by Misfit here. No improved made on what you would think to be the #1 priority.Update: Moved down to one star due to the poor service provided by  Misfit. They only offered to replace the sports band which doesn't solve the problem.This is getting returned before it falls out and is lost.
