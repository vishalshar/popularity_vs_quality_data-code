Pretty disappointed with my purchase. I've been a Fitbit One user for the last 2 yrs tracking steps and sleep. The leaf does not compare in accuracy including the period tracker. For a week, I wore both Fitbit One and the Leaf to compare the steps and sleep. Depending on how you wear the Leaf, it's wildly different from the Fitbit.When I wore it as a bracelet, I had 2,000 more steps than the Fitbit. Seems understandable that it would most likely pick up hand movements as steps. I then wore it as a necklace. This time, it was about 2000 steps less than the Fitbit. You might ask perhaps it's the Fitbit that is inaccurate. I can resoundingly say Fitbit is very accurate from wearing it for the past 2 years. My steps don't vary from day to day as I have the same routine most weekdays.  It would be a variation of about 1000 steps day to day. But with the Leaf, it fluctuated greatly even though my day to day wasn't very different.As for sleep tracking, it didn't pick up when I was awake in the middle of the night while my Fitbit recognized it. Now, the Fitbit isn't that accurate when it comes to sleep tracking but it's a lot closer than the Leaf. The Leaf seems to think I slept a lot more than I really did and says I slept over 8 hrs straight without waking up when the Fitbit picks up most wakings or restlessness.  One feature that I do like about the Leaf is that you don't have to activate or turn off the sleep tracker when you go to sleep/wake like you have to with the Fitbit.The period tracker is very basic and isn't really accurate about fertile and ovulating days. You're better off getting a free app that solely focuses on this. I know because I've used a different period tracker and it gets my next period date pretty spot on as well as the fertile/ovulating days. The Leaf has (again) wildly different days when I compare it to my other app.Pros:Aesthetically pleasingVarious ways to wear itCons:-Steps very inaccurate whether you wear it as a bracelet or necklace or clip on-Period tracker pretty useless-Sleep tracker very inaccurate and bulky to wear to sleep-Clip on feature needs work -- it's so hard to get it to clip on to your shirt because the clip is really tight and you have to use your nails to force it open a bit. I almost broke a nail doing this-Bracelet feature is inconvenient and prone to malfunction. It's hard to wear and once you have it on, the bracelet gets unhooked from the device. I almost lost it twice in one day because of the malfunction.-no long term comparison tracking. It's just day to day, I think one week at most.Overall, if you just want a fun, pretty gadget and don't really care about accuracy, this is the device for you. By no means am I an avid exerciser or health nut but if I have a gadget to do something, I prefer it to be accurate. I'm disappointed that I spent ~$150 on something I'm not going to use. I'll probably end up giving it to my 14 year old niece.They really marketed the heck out of this basic, inaccurate device appealing to people's eye for design but it turned out to be pretty worthless. I'm not sure why it gets such good reviews on here...some see to have received it for free which I think is a skewed review.
