I was excited to find some organic suppliments for my pup. I purchased the immunity as well as the joints formula for around $50. Now im upset because i have not even been using the whole recomended amount yet im out after 39 days of use. The container (which is a cardboard tube with a melted plastic baggy inside of it, which is just wrong and a poor way to package product) states two months for a 50lb dog. 1/4 tsp per 25 lbs. So 1/2tsp a day for a 50 pound dog, for two months is what it clames is in the bottle. I used less than a 1/2tsp a day for my dog and ran out of the immunity 39 day with 1 serving left of the joint formula. Im not the best at math but seems to me like im either being robbed or bixbi owes me some compensation...Pic of the bag. A screw top bottle or ziplock would have been nice...
