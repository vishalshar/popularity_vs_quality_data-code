1. The thing doesn't actually turn off.  Pressing the power button gives you the option to "Turn Off" or "Reboot" but choosing Turn Off seems to reboot.  It continues to broadcast its wifi network and consume battery and some data (even though I'm not using its network).  Lame!2. Even though it said it was connected to a 3G network I could not get it to send or receive data until I connected it to a second wifi network and downloaded the latest firmware update.Because it does not power off, I do not trust it at all to be charged when I arrive after a 12 hour plane flight, which is exactly when I need it.  Returning.
