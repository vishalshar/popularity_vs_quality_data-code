Causes allergies, gastric upset and very poor digestive supplementation. This is nearly 100% mushroom powder of various strains and reactions, regardless of breed are very poor. I have discarded this product as is also stimulates vomiting and weight loss. This is a breeding and boarding kennel with many champions over 35 years. I would NOT recommend this product based upon its digestive damage. A pig can digest mushrooms; a dog cannot. It also damages immunity, so whatever purpose it is being marketed for, think the opposite.
