Package was missing just the piece that plugs in to the power adapter that plugs into the wall. The prong part. Called customer support and they are complete trash. First the guy argued with me for ten minutes that it had to be in the box. Then afterwards the guy told me that I could just power it from my computer but that's stupid because my computer isn't where I want the camera then told me I could just go out and buy another adapter for it because they don't send replacements. Now the problem is you use your own adapter if it doesn't work or  you need to send it back they tell you that you voided the warranty because you used an unsupported power supply. The guy literally laughed at me on the phone when I told him that buying another adapter wasn't a solution to the issue. This product looked cool but its just another awful cash grab Kickstarter project that doesn't know how to support their product past shipping it day one.
