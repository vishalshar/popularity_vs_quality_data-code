Update 3: I seem to be contacting Tile every two months or so to ask for replacements.  I believe I am on my third or fourth replacement now.  I'm glad that Tile is sending me replacements but it's super annoying to have to be constantly replacing these things.  I've turned off my phone, closed the app, and turned off my Bluetooth just like they've asked, but nope still not working.  So I've sent Tile yet another email letting them know that another Tile is not working.Update 2: It's been about two more months since I originally bought my tiles.  The replacement that the company sent me is not working again.  Such a waste of money.  It's too late for me to ask for a refund.  Don't waste your money.  Tile replaced the not functionally one one already, I'm wondering if they will keep replacing them until I get a working one that lasts more than 2 months at a time.Update 1: I've activated two out of four tiles that I bought.  The second one worked for about 2 months and now it's not making a sound so that I can locate it.  I've contacted tile, three different times already (two for the soundless tile and once to let them know that their chat feature does not work), at the current rate of response. I down graded my review since 1 out of 2 activated tiles do not work and bad customer response.So I bought this Bluetooth fracker not cause I lose my keys or whatnot. It because I have a cat that wanders.  He doesn't go very far, just that he's a bit of a scaredy cat.  So when he gets scared I can't find him, inside the house or around the property.  So far the tile has worked when I needed to locate him.
