I have had these apple chips before and I love them, but the batch I received through Amazon was super stale and most of the apple pieces were broken into tiny crumbs.  I would not order these again.  The product itself is generally pretty good so try to find them locally if you want to purchase them.  Ordering them online was a bust.
