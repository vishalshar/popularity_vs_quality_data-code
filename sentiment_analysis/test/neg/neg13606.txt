Horrible.  Great technology  but you are on your own.  Rachio expects  each home owner to know how much water each type of plants needs,  each zone shade vrs sunsun,  each zone with different  sprinkler heads.  All these settings  are great but require you to be a gardener and a plant expert.Good technology  but not something  that can be successfully setup without a technical  expert.  Don't be fooled that it's easy.  We are losing plants in our house every  day...I have mine in my pool equip shed which has a roof and does not get rained on inside, HOWEVER as it is electronics, I bought the waterproof box too, so its sealed from moisture in the pool shed.
