I got one of these for our 5 year old son.  He loves it, and it worked well for a short time.  Unfortunately, it started acting weird after a week- some of the elements of the displayed digits don't light up well, and the AC adapter quit working effectively as well.Currently, I'm using batteries, but would really like it if it would use the AC adapter and all the digit elements would stay brightly lit, instead of making 7:20 look like 1:20, or stuff like that.
