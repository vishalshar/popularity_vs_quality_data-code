Bought this for kindergarten to provide a healthier lunch option.  I was excited to be able to pack cold/hot foods, instead of just a sandwich.  However, it has a few negatives.  It is heavy for a 5 year old. In our case, the food didn't stay hot ..so our son didn't eat the lunch anyways...because it was cold. It did better with cold foods, like cottage cheese and yogurt.  However, the handle broke off within the first couple weeks of use while he was carry the lunchbox in the hallway. As mentioned the lunch box is a bit heavy and is difficult for a 5 year old to carry without a handle.Maybe we just received a defective product. It is past the return the policy, so I suppose it is simply going in the trash.  Expensive mistake in the end.  I like the idea for lunch box..but unfortunately the lunch box doesn't work as advertised and/or appears to have some defects.  Hopefully someone can follow up and make a similar lunch box that actually does provide for hot and cold meal options.
