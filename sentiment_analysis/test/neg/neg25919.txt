Update DEC 2016DO NOT BUY IT  *Discontinued by Manufacturer* DEAD PRODUCTA couple of facts to start:1. Nobody can be demanding when pay $129 for a smartwatch.2. If your smart watch of $129 is both smart watch and HR monitor..it will probably fail in one, or both features...Knowing that I bought the P2, looking for a HR monitor most than a smart watch, and knowing through the reviews that the HR  won't be accurate.I was interested in knowing in which HR zone I was training in, so a few bpm off it could be easily handled by me..what I never expect was having dozens or hundreds of bpm off... like yesterday I was playing tennis, in the middle of the game my heart was pretty much off my chest and the HR was showing bpms..totally all over the place, from 65  in the middle of the game! followed by a 168 indication... well in brief: absolutely useless.Hopefully this is a software issue that can be address by Pebble in the next updates...and not a hardware issue that can be fix buying a reputable brand on HR.The smart watch side...(in which I was not so interested) seems to be fine, showing notification on a a sleek, and little toyish style watch.But still wearable during the day watch.This are my first impressions during the first week of usage.If I change my mind or if I have a different experience, I will update my review accordinglyFinally...You get what you pay for...there's no way around this statementHope this helps for someone looking for a decent HR
