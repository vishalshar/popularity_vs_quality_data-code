I used to love this product. For the past couple of months (about 3 refills), I've noticed that the crystals are bigger than they used to be. My vacuum cleaner no longer picks a lot of them up. Bigger crystals means less effective absorption of liquid. I used to use one refill for a month (with one cat). These crystals start to smell like cat urine in 2 weeks. $30 a month for cat litter is pretty cost prohibitive so I'm going to try a different brand of crystals in conjunction with a metal tray that I bought for the ScoopFree system. Do a little research and you'll find other crystal options for your ScoopFree box.It's too bad, because I liked being able to just put a lid on the whole thing and tossing it out, but these new crystals are untenable.
