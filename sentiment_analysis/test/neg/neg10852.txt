I had a rash as soon as I start using it, my skin is not usually sensitive so it did not  work for me. The interesting part was that the company was trying to reimburse me for my purchase to remove my review... They have insisted multiple times, my office number and my cell number. I apologize this is not ethical. I will not purchase any of their products.  I hope it works for you....
