This product design in a nice idea but the quality is not that good . I tried to use four for each shoe but it makes me feel so narrow then I used three for each instead, after two hours normal walk one of the laces broken, few days later another one broken so I thought is that because I have wider insteps ? so I give six laces which I left to my wife and let her try then same thing happened. Conclusion 1."One Size fits All" is not real I'm size 8 .2.Products quality need to be improved.
