We tested this item in an enterprise environment to see if this was something we could deploy to clients.  We tested the unit for 30 days about 10 times as day.This item is not reliable for commercial or enterprise use. The device would lock throughout the day when sitting on my desk inches away from the usb dongle. I saw a lot of reviews that this device has a mind of its own and it does.  These reviews are accurate.  I would be in the middle of typing and all of a sudden my PC would go into lock mode. We played around with all of the settings and really tried to make this work but it kept failing.  It works when you walk in to the room to unlock the PC but the Gatekeeper has a mind of its own. Typing in my password was easier and just as secure. This device really only comes into play if you are extremely lazy and cannot type a password.Also a quick note the battery was dead in less then 18 days and replaced. It dies again in 22 days.Sold on Ebay for $15
