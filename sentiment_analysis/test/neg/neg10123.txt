I got bored with this very quickly, after getting over the frustration of using it. If you buy it, buy the nubby cover. However, even that didn't make me like this. My dogs hated it and much prefer a tennis ball. I liked using my smartphone to control it, but there should be an automatic option that makes it run around unattended.
