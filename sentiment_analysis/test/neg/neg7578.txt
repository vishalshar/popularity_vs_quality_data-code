I was really looking forward to this toothbrush because brushing my son's teeth was a battle.  While this design and soft vibrate has made brushing his teeth much easier, I am disappointed in the quality of the toothbrush.  After only a few times of using the toothbrush one of the bristles came off. Given the price I would think it would take a lot to get them off.  A month later and now four are missing.  For that reason I am not sure if I would recommend this product as I was hoping it would last and stay with us through the toddler years.  It doesn't look like it will hold up.
