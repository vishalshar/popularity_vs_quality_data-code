I was very excited about receiving my Amazon Echo, I also ordered this LIFX color light even after reading mixed LIFX  reviews here. My Amazon Echo very cool, she does very well. I love that you can ask questions and Alexa responds or fulfills your request. So I ordered the  LIFX bulb (Bad Move)With in  5 minutes of receiving the Amazon Echo, Alexa was up and running including the Alexa app. 9Good Move)Now for the POS LIFX review, I spent the entire afternoon, restarting, resetting, deleting apps, reinstalling apps trying get this POS LIFX color working.I contacted LIFX via email, the only way to get customer support from LIFX, we exchanged 2 emails, I explained that the LIFX color would not discovered on the wifi network. LIFX sent me a link to update the firmware. When I downloaded the link to update a 50 dollar light bulb, I came to realize .. Duh .. The bulb needs to be connected to the wifi to update. I explained this to LIFX that my bulb will not discover the wifi, I never heard back from customer support.. I guess that may had Trumped them..I am so frustrated that I feel like throwing the bulb and the echo in the trash can, the entire afternoon wasted.. It's too bad LIFX doesn't offer a double your money back...This has to be in the running for top 10 worst products of 2016..If I may suggest to LIFX, in stead of putting you money into a Apple looking box (Well Done) I much rather have a working product, spend the money in making sure the product works like Amazon Echo and Apple have done.So Amazon.. Here comes a return .. Because of the quality of this bulb I have a regular light bulb that has to be turned on and off by hand.. NOT for 50 bucks.. RETURN
