Do  not buy this product. You might be drawn  to its surface attractions  but  this device will fail you  sooner than later. It is cheaper than its  competitors and the fact that the  battery can be  replaced is a plus. It  works quite well when it works. But quickly you will discover that  the  inside connections are so  poorly engineered  that  power will be cut off despite the battery  been intact.  Moving  from  warm to cold  will also shut  down operations  for a while.  And  worst still,  but rational  from the  point of  view of  a  seller  of  this lousy product,  the  pebble  company  will only accept  returns  within 15 days of purchase,  and  in addition  you  have to pay for the mailing  and  the restocking charges.  The  product is  a  nicely made to fleece  you. Stay away if  you do not want to be stung..
