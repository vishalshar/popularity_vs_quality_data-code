Ordered and received headset mid September. I have not had it for 2 whole months and the charging port broke. I am very upset because I spent $150 on this and was relying on the positive reviews. Over all it was a good head set. It worked well for my needs. I have used it on both my Xbox one and my PC.  Now looking back I see several others that had the problem I was. At first it was having issues charging even though i was using the cord they provided to me. Now the whole charging port is up inside the headset! I have contacted customer service but have not heard back yet. I will be beyond livid if this headset is not replaced, especially after reading others having this issue too.
