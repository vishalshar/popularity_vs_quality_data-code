I don't know if I received a defective one or not.  Altitude hold is terrible.  It oscillates up and down by as much as 6-7 feet (like its trying to find altitude but keeps going past and then over corrects).  It sinks to the floor, and then bounces up to 5 feet off the ground.  After a period, its like altitude hold turns off completely and I have to provide constant throttle (just like a a regular quad).  The little door in the back is a pain.  The wires are hard to get inside so the door can close, and the door latch keeps catching on the wires.  All and all, this is a HUGE LET DOWN form my original Hubsan X4 H107L.  Not sure what the "Plus" is for, but it sure doesn't mean better.  The space for the battery is huge, but they made the battery holder small.  The new battery is skinnier than the H107L.  I can force my old H107L batteries in, but its a tight fit and I'm a little concerned about getting them back out.  I guess the safest way would be to buy all new batteries.  The wire to the board is short making it hard to connect/disconnect the battery.  I dog in the air that flies like a bloated pig.
