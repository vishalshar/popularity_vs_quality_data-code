What really drew me to this drone was the included case and the added FPS recording modes.  I thought being able to record in 120 & 240 fps allowing for some nice slo-mo shots was pretty cool.  The other bonus was the remote control with the built-in LCD screen.  The problem with the drone was its erratic flight.  When compared to the DJI phantom 3, its flight and gimbal were sub-par.  It has a hard time hovering in one place, maintaining a constant altitude and position, and it does not pan from side to side smoothly at all.
