I have been using this for 3 months. It has gotten stuck a few times. Usually when it is stuck, I have my keys with me and I can unlock it manually. But the last time this happened, I was outside the house without my keys. Luckily I left my window opened by accident and I was able to climb back into my house. But I still cannot unlock it manually by turning the lock, or using the key. I had to remove the august lock entirely.This has gotten me worried because previously if it's stuck, I thought I can just unlock it with my keys. But now, I may not even be able to get into my house. Makes me wonder if I should just stop using the lock.
