I was really excited about these headphones at first. The styling is great and the sound quality was good (I'm no audiophile, but I couldn't find anything lacking). The only issue I had was the occasional headache from the pressure on my head, but I would just take a break for a while. Overall they were a comfortable fit for about 2-3 hours without a break.Unfortunately about a month in the left ear stopped working and I had to return them. It's a shame because I liked them quite a lot!
