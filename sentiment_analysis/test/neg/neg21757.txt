Bought this as an XMAS gift for you 5 year old:PROS:  looks good, comes with water bottleCONS: SO DARNED HEAVY EVEN I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING TO GOING - I mean, this is heavy and the crank shaft for the pedal was low quality.  The most important part of pedaling a bike is the transition from 11 O'clock to 1 O'clock - that moment when your foot gets over the hump.  On the bike we got, the gear had about 2 inches of give at the top.  This meant that when my kid, (or myself) was trying to "turn the pedal over" it would often just fall backwards.  Did I make that complicated enough?  Simply stated, the bike is HEAVY AND difficult to pedal resulting in a negative feedback loop.  If you are ok with slowly getting to a maximum speed of about 2 mile per hour, then this is the right bike for you
