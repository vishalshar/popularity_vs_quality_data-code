The primary reason I chose a LIFX bulb over other connected lighting options was because of its native Amazon Echo support. The idea of being able to simply say, "Alexa, turn my lamp on" or "Alexa, dim my lamp to 50 percent" appealed to me. And to be fair, the LIFX bulb is that easy to operate via voice. The smartphone controls are wonderful as well.The critical flaw, and the reason I'm returning my LIFX bulb, is its network connection. Each bulb connects directly to your wi-fi, and has its own independent MAC and IP address. This was originally the reason I purchased this over other products, because I wanted to directly control my bulb. However, the LIFX bulb seemingly refuses to maintain a network connection. I've tried relocating the bulb, moving it from other objects that might interfere with it, even locating it a few feet away from my router. I've ensured that my router is not being flooded with too many connections. Indeed, even when I can see the lamp on my network, voice and smartphone controls won't recognize the device. It is simply too unreliable for me to continue attempting to use.
