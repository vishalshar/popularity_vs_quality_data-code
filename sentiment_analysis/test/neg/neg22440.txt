Does not work near base station, does not work when you know your dog is gone. The whistle must figure out on its own that the dog is gone then allow you to track so it can take up to 15 min when you know your pet is not in the zone while they get further away. Battery life is very long, but the charger has stopped working so I finally decided to share my experience, try another brand maybe they work better.
