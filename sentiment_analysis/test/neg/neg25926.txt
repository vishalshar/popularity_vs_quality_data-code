I bought two of these for Christmas this year.  A week after I got them it was announced that Pebble is out of business and does not plan on any warranty support nor will they provide software support.  Amazon was great and provided a full refund for both.  Very said to see a startup company just sell off the company and leave all the supporters and owner out to dry. This represents very poor customer respect.  I am hopeful the Fit Bit may stand up in the future and support the users of the product but till then I am looking into Samsung for my wareable needs.
