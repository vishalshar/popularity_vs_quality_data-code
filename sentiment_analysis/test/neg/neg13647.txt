Would not register and it does not work without registering so we are unable to use it at all. When I try to register I get a message that says:"Oops.  There was a problem with your registration!Please email us at support@nowcomputing ... We'll get this resolved as soon as possible!"Tried registering on windows, Mac and Linux and all 3 gave the same error. I tried contacting their support multiple times and they have yet to respond.
