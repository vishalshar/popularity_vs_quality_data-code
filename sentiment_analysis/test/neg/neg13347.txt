I purchased this because my parents bought one and caught critters left and right.  I set it up in my yard and didn't get a thing.  Red light would flash and the bait would be gone......without a sign of the critter.  I tried to return it because I am sure it is defective, but I am 15 days over the 30 day return limit ( I was away on vacation.)  I am frustrated because of that!  I would like to try another one as it works so well for my parents. Can anything be done?JT
