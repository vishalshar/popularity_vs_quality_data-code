We purchased this product, as well as the actual Pet Loo, not quite a year ago or so.  We have Hairless Chinese Cresteds (2 of them) and we found we needed it after moving from California to Missouri....in the dead of winter.  Nothing is as pathetic as watching 2 naked dogs trying to pee in freezing temperatures.  I know I have a hard time when I'm shaking with cold.Anyway, our canine sun bunnies refused to use the Pet Loo, and unless they had to take a poop, they also started refusing to go outside and pee in the snow.  Hence, our opportunity to try the Pet Loo Stain and Odor Eliminator.  Sorry, it doesn't work any better than anything else on the market, and maybe even worse.  We spent a total of $300 on the Pet Loo and accessories and guess where it is now?  Well, actually, I have no idea where it is.  It blew off our moving truck somewhere in Montana when we moved back to the west coast, and honestly, we couldn't care less.  Guess that tells you what we thought of the Pet Loo and all their related products.
