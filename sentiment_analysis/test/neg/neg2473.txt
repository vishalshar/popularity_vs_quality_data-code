Pretty disappointed with this game. It has a great concept, but this is not the game I was hoping for! I ordered the game on prime while it was in stock and it took a month to get it. When it came the box was all smashed (not sure whose fault that is) but that should have been the first clue. The cards are wayyyyy too easy to understand and there were a TON of repeat cards. There are even cards with misspellings,terrible grammar and some of them don't even make sense at all.... not what you would expect from a game. The mouth guards are okay but some of them broke after only one use.  Also, not sure if this game has directions, but there were none in the box. I always hate seeing reviews when people just complain, but I'm telling you, DONT waste your money on this game.
