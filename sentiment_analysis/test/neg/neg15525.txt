I give two stars because when it worked, my wife and I loved it. We both work in healthcare for large institutions, and myself having been hands on with the Pop loved the passive nature. 80% of the time it was just a watch for me. But when I lost sleep, it would tell me, without remembering to put on a different tracker. That is when our tale turns sour. About a month in, the battery in my wife's died. Mine lasted several months on, purchased the same day, but I digress. She replaced the battery and we were back in business... For about a month. Withings support again diagnosed battery. We changed it. Again. This time, it went two weeks. Mine continued to go strong, and Withings invited her to change the battery again. She gave up and went back to her Fitbit, which I had lured her away from.My time came due. Symptoms of battery failure started at about six months for me. Outstanding, 50% of our purchase lasted as long as we hoped! On changing, which required quite a bit more of a fight, it seemed OK, until I checked my phone. An hour of fussing and no pairing. I'm a mobile developer who has far more patience when things do not go well. But this is my breaking point.It's great while it lasts, but it's clear this product needed more QC before release.
