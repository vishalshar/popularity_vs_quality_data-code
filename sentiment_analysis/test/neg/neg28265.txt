I purchased this game and received it in perfect condition. It was so fun I bought two more as gifts for others. They arrived and the boxes were smashed, with a major chemically smell, like paint thinner. I had to bring them outside as I'm pregnant and didn't want to be inhaling it all night. I didn't even bother opening the games because after reading the reviews, I'm sure they're the knock-off versions with misspelled cards and used mouthpieces.. gross! Research before buying!!
