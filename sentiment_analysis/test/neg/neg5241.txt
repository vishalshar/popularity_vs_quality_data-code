I couldn't really get it to work. I am not sure how it is supposed to work, but it didn't automatically set up my main stream items (e.g, Directv DVR, Denon AVR), and it wouldn't work with my Samsung Mini-Split and other components were not recognized, and the learned codes also didn't work. I tried telling Alexa to turn on my "DVR," "Satellite<" and a couple of other names I gave my Directv DVR, and Alexa couldn't understand me/find the device, no matter what I called it. ("I can't find a DVR in Timothy's ....") I also emailed customer support on these issues, twice, over two months ago, and never heard back. Maybe, for geeks with lots of time, and patience, it could work, I don't know. Didn't really work for me.
