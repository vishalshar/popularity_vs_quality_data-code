Fascinated by this concept when I saw an advertisement for this product (on Facebook, of all places), I  checked their website, then I checked to see if it was available on Amazon. It was, and the price at that time was very reasonable (I see it's back up to list price now). I think it works fairly well. I'm still trying to figure out how it's interpreting tension, but I allow it's probably accurate in that respect. The only time I seem to be focused is when I'm sleeping. That seems strange to me. I get regular periods of Calm.Seven-day battery life? Only in one's wildest dreams. Maybe I'm not supposed to wear it while I'm sleeping? I'm lucky if I get three days between charges. I have noticed it glows solid blue when it's supposedly charging, so maybe it isn't charging correctly? This is disappointing. My Fitbit One easily goes more than seven days between charges, and it tracks much more information.On the App, in Settings, there's an "I Lost My Spire!" area to tap. This is only useful if you can't remember if you mounted the Spire on your bra or your waistband, because it merely vibrates, and you'll never hear it. This is a joke, right? Or is it a feature placeholder for a future version?I agree with some other reviewers about the tutorial being intermittent in unlocking the next level. It took about a week to unlock from Day 1 to Day 2. Day 3 awaits, and I'll get to it eventually. My enthusiasm waned. I anticipate this is merely software bugginess, which will be resolved in an app update soon. Battery life is of greater concern.The website is spartan, designed as a sales page only. I have not tried telephone tech support, so I can't comment on its usefulness. The Support page is very basic.Despite the three-star rating, mostly for the abysmal battery life, I like this gadget. I believe it will be useful for enhancing mindfulness. And, maybe, I'll figure out the tension thing, which doesn't seem to completely track to when I think I'm feeling tense. But I could be wrong about that.Added on Ausust 3, 2016: downgraded to 2 Stars. Maybe it's me and I just don't breathe, but with the update the battery life may have improved slightly, but whenever I look at the app, it says it can't detect any breathing (believe me, I am still breathing). Frequently it says the Spire has been away from the phone for more than six hours. I'm never away from my phone for more than six hours. At this point is like to get rid of this junk. Can I sent it back? I don't even care about a refund at this point. I don't want it cluttering up my house. The updated app is pretty but is less functional.
