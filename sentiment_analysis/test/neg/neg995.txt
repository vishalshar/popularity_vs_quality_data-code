the battery compartment hard to open, It is too shallow to use a coin.  I had to pry it open using a screwdriver.  Luckily it closed easily after I had to bend it back into shape.  The band worked fine with my old iPhone 5, but I could not get any sound with my IPhone 6+, which means I'll have to carry around both phones for my grandson to play with it.  I think the battery part could use some redesigning.  Also wish that it was rechargeable.  Otherwise the product is a good start.  I am not sure if I would buy again, the design is not worth $55.
