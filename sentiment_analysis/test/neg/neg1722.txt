My first review in 15 years of using Amazon. I thought this was a great concept but it is total waste of money. I bought a two pack. One doesn't pair with my iPhone. The other paired but requires me to register the device in order to use it, but the app can't connect to the server. Total waste of my time trying to get this to work and total waste of money. I hope others don't make the same mistake.
