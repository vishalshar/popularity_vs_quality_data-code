I reviewed this before several months ago, based on the App giving it 5 stars, which is AWESOME! Our County uses the App linked to each school, with parents logging their kids illnesses, to notify parents when they log their kids symptoms that those symptoms match others from the school. WINNER WINNERI then went on to purchase 5 thermometers for the mother's of each of our grandchildren and for our home, where we still have a 9 year old son. Each of these mothers and myself have phones that are within a well year old. Additionally, many have Kindled and 1 as well as myself, was getting a new 10" Kindle for Christmas so I didn't expect a problem. I read the thing about 'will run on most Android phones running 4.4...' and knew we were all within that.LUCKILY, 3 of my 5 had just upgraded to iPhone6's, so they were ok. For some unknown reason, the Kinsa decided to work on 1 daughter's Android  though the company insists that it shouldn't. (We emailed trying to figure out why it worked on hers and not mine, because you CANNOT call, you email back and forth) Mine is an HTC Grand Max Plus bought for $500 in June because the screen is big and it had more battery life than the Samsung 6, it lasts 9 hours of constant use. It was also lighter and bigger, so a win....Until I tried to the Kinsa. So I emailed. And discovered my phone wasn't compatible, nor was my Kindle, the 3DS, my old phone that was a year old at the time.... So I gave it away in hopes it would find a home with someone in our County with children. I have discovered that this poor thermometer has had trouble finding a home, as even when a device is listed as being a compatible device, apparently it doesn't mean it will be a compatible device.Sadly, I think this is a great product idea. This is why I wanted all of my mom's to have 1!!! However- Major Thumbs Down for the Customer Service- Major Thumbs Down for the VERY VERY limited list of compatible devices- And a Even BIGGER thumbs down for the misleading line about 'Compatible with most Android phones running 4.4...' because this what customer service responded with in an email was 'If it isn't on the list, it isn't compatible'I guess what I was most shocked about was that you are able to buy a Bluetooth device, ear buds, chargers, etc that is compatible for any phone, and the APP is compatible, however they are unable to make the device work but for a very few phones.
