This product was very disappointing.First, I bought it specifically to use with my Amazon Echo. It never would connect with the device, despite following the instructions to the letter. I looked on the forums, and found this to be a common complaint. I guess I should have researched more on that before buying. Lesson learned for me there.Next, although it's advertised as "easy" setup, it was anything but. Again, followed directions exactly and it took many, many attempts to actually get it on my network and then connect with the app. Once i got the app, plug, and network all synched, it worked fine. But then, as mentioned above, it never connected to my Amazon echo - which was the whole point of the purchase.Last, and the last straw that broke my patience with this device, was the complete lack of support from the manufacturer. I contacted them, and they never replied, so I have no way to know if I just got a dud or if this is a documented error in functioning. Even though I never heard back from tech support, I looked through their documentation and there was nothing to help me there either. Very disappointing for a tech company that should know better than to ignore its customers who are trying to make their product work.I did see many comments similar to mine on the review page, so maybe it's not just my unit. However, I do not much care to find out since I am returning the one I bought and have no intention of buying another one from DLink.
