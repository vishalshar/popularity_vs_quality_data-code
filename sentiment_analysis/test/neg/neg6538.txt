Not impressed. I own a lot of drones from the DJI Phantom to the Xiro Xplorer and the Ehang Ghost drone is my least favorite. First off they start you off in training. You cannot fly the quadcopter yourself. Instead it's like yes'em master I will obey your voice commands and do as I'm told. Forget about pilots with previous experience, you must complete 3 training flights before you graduate, then it's on to avatar mode. Now let's talk about compass calibration. Keep in mind that your drone is turned on when doing this task, which means your gimbal is active with camera. It's the vertical part which causes your gimbal to react in a violent matter which will probably damage the gimbal over time. Why would I want to use a Ehang clone GoPro when I have the real deal. On there forum web site it states that the GoPro will not work with the Ghost 2.0 drone, however instructions say you can. Tried hooking up my GoPro to the Ghost drone, but could not get it out of USB connection. Which renders the GoPro useless. Had the same results with a GoPro Hero 3 & 4.The voice in the APP becomes annoying and distracting. It's kind of cool when first start the drone, but after initial encounter I was turning the volume down on my smart phone. Remember all you have is your smart phone to control the drone. You must keep the G box within 3 feet of your phone and in the direction of the drone. That means putting it in your pocket is a no-no. If your holding your smart phone with both hands around chest level high and tilting it to get a better view, where do they expect you to place the G box? Sorry, but I'm not going to mount it on the top of my head. I placed mine with velcro under my smart phone. That seem to be a mistake. Of course I was in a classic battle of the sun over powering the display screen. Which causes you to tilt your phone at an angle which is not in the direction of the drone. I was in a way point flight when I notice I was off a few feet to clear a top of a tree. I was in LOS (line of sight) of the drone. With a transmitter, the correction could easily be made and with plenty of time to spare. A smart phone is a whole different animal. I had to look at the display, then adjust it because of sun glare. Then locate the hover button. First press of the hover button the drone did nothing and the drone was approaching the very top of the tree. I then kept my thumb on top of the hover button and readjusted the smart phone and the G box. By that time the party was over. The drone hit the top of the tree and went tumbling down a few limbs before it flew out and was clear. Again I depressed the hover button, but the drone probably lost calibration and GPS signal. The drone then flew right back into the tree. Technology is amazing, but flying without a transmitter with sticks is really kind of stupid. A transmitter would have avoided the accident. Now I have a drone that is useless......
