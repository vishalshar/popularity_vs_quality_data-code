The theory is great, I'd love to keep track of where my pups are at any given time. Especially if they ever get out of the house on their own. However, the Whistle leaves a lot to be desired. You can set up a home base for the device, but once you're out of that home base the battery drains extremely quickly. We left our pup at my in-laws house, so she was outside of her home base, and the Whistle didnt even last for the weekend for me to track her activity or check where she was. Also, the location of the GPS is not very specific. It gives you a range, which could be accurate to a couple of blocks, definitely not precise.If the battery lasted, or the GPS was precise, this would be great.
