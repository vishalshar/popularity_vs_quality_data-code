I've got the windshield mount by iOttie and absolutely love it.  Unfortunately, their design for a bicycle just doesn't cut it for me.I'm using a Galaxy S5 in an ultra slim case - it's about the max size but it fits.  This mount is excessively noisy - no matter how much you tighten it up, it rattles.  That alone would be enough for me to get rid of it but it also does a poor job of holding the phone.  Any time you go over a bump you have about a 25% chance of mount loosening it's grip on the phone.  Fortunately, it's very easy to retighten on handed while riding.  Unfortunately, the S5 is held in so poorly that attempting to tighten while riding is quite likely to result in your phone shooting out of the case and landing very ungracefully on the ground.  After many attempts at getting things locked in just right so it'll be quite and hold the phone, I have given up.If you ride only on extremely smooth paved roads and have something smaller than a Galaxy S5 then you might get away with this.  If you are riding on an indoor trainer I might even highly recommend this.  If however you ride anywhere with the slightest bumping or have a large phone, this is not the case for you.One of the big positives notes on this mount is the forward positioning - it holds the phone just far enough forward that it doesn't get covered in sweat.  Unfortunately since it can't seem to hold my phone, that's not good enough.
