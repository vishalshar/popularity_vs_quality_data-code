It's great when it works, which is about 25% of the time after the first week.  I need to hold the power cord into the unit just so or the light will not turn on.  It kind of defeats the purpose of putting my phone it and walking away.  The company I bought this from did contact me about my satisfaction, and it's been several days since I wrote with my concerns and I have not heard back.  I'm considering returning it and trying a different brand.
