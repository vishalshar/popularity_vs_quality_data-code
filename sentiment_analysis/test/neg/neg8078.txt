I purchased his watch to use with my iPhone as I wanted a round watch instead of the apple watch. It was great! For the first 15 minutes. It still has major issues connecting to iPhones even though they updated. It was disconnected the rest of the day no matter what I tried so I returned it. Shame, it looked really good.
