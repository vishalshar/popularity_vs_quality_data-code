The manufacturer of this product has problems. This is supposed to be the 2nd generation or "improved" model. There is a faulty band and an improved band, but one does not know which band they are getting. One would assume that since it is the 2nd generation product, it would come with the improved band. Ours did not. The tracker fell out 3X in the first week of wearing. I contacted the misfit.com manufacturer, which was an arduous process to navigate. They assured me that a new band would be shipped and that they couldn't control what their 2nd party distributors (Amazon) sell. It has been over a month. Misfit was contacted a second time and still no band. The tracker is sitting on the vanity unworn. I ordered a different style of band on Amazon that had better reviews, but it was for the first model and didn't fit. If one purchases this product, the price should include a band that works and is secure, or the tracker is worthless. If  the band and the tracker need to be purchased separately, it should be indicated.  I am sending it back to Amazon and going with a Garmin.
