Rip-off for 35 dollars. Cheap plastic dollar store phone cover. Don't know why but glasses didn't fit right on my nose right after a while. The nose pieces aren't too durable. If you are looking to use these often I don't recommend which I tried doing. Glasses seemed kind of cheap too. Definitely not worth the price. Disappointed.
