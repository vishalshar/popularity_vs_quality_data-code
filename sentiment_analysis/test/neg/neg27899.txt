Product is in it's BETA stage at best in my opinion. I spent 2 days trying to get it to work and was on a support chat for several hours as well. I'm well versed in all TCP/IP and IEEE 802.xxxx protocols and have worked with internet applications since the early 1990'ties - so I get the inner workings just fine. I love the idea of such product and I will continue to look for another brand but Belkin. I managed to install the product, have the iPhone app find the switch and succeed through the whole setup and get a final screen saying the installation was successful. After hitting the "Done" button the app would just not find the switch so I was never able to get it working. Belkin's support is another disappointment. I was asked the same questions multiple times. This points toward one of two possibilities. Either the support staff know the product is faulty but can't admit this officially and therefore use delay tactics or the support staff is among the most unqualified staff ever. My take is that the components to handle the 2.4 Ghz band are not of sufficient quality trying to make the product as cheap as possible. That might also explain why the product does not support dual-band WiFi. Anyway after the time spent I can now see clearly that this product should never have been released to the public. Sadly I did not read the many negative reviews before purchase. I have now returned the product for a refund.
