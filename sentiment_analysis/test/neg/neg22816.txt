Thoroughly disappointed overall with this 14oz bag compared to the smaller 2.2oz bags in Organic Fuji Apple.Let me start off with my review of the smaller bag which would have gotten 4/5 stars.Taste: Absolutely sweet, tangy, with floral notes. It's like biting into a real apple without the juice, all the flavor is sealed in.Texture: Perfectly crisp and crunchy! All pieces were around the same thickness and consistency.Price: I enjoyed these chips and bought the measly 2.2oz bags for about $4.00 each or $1.80 an ounce (kind of ridiculous). They were worth the splurge every once in a while in my opinion, they were that good.Now, the larger bag review which I'd rater give 1/5 stars.Taste: I don't know what went wrong!! Maybe because these bags are larger and there is no humidity absorbent packet, some of these chips taste disgustingly sour. The delicate floral notes are missing and some taste burnt. Most of them in such a large bag have little to no sweetness, resembling nothing like a good organic apple.Texture: Again, it is off from the smaller packages. The texture in the larger bag is extremely inconsistent. Ranging from chewy, tough pieces to pieces as hard as burnt toast, and even strangely moist pieces!Price: The larger bags are the best deal, for two bags here 14 oz for $0.82 an ounce...it would be a deal for a good quality product, but not in this case!!
