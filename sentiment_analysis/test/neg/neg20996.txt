Well constructed of good materials but unreliable.  After a few attempts to set up and use, decided it was just not dependable and too much trouble to use.  The last straw was having to move furniture to get to it for setting up the link each time, when the whole point was to control power to a bunch of A/V components.  Luckily Amazon return policy is great.
