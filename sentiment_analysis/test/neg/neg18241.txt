At first glance these are amazing super water tight reusable bags. Of course it would take quite some time to break even vs buying disposable bags. but this is also great for leaving less of a negative impact on the earth. Nonetheless Im extremely dissapointed to see that before I even got any use out of them the Re-Zip portion of the bag had ripped half off.... Maybe i just got a defective pair so I would love to get another free order to try them out.... Ill change my review if that happens.
