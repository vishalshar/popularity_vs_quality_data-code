I've fought with many insoles at lower prices because they've always end up taking too much space inside my shoes, causing discomfort. Reading the reviews about how thin these insoles were, I was really excited. The pricing was definitely not exciting, but with the promise of absorbing odors and keeping my feet nice and fresh, I decided to take the plunge.Boy do I regret it.Here are my pros and cons about these insoles:Pro:+Comfortable!Unlike other better-known brands that target comfort, these truly felt comfortable to walk on. I've used them twice, the first time for about an hour or so and the second time for almost 8 hours. They are cushioned and they felt better than other brands.Con:-Too thick!They took up so much space inside my shoe, that they caused the shoe to dig into my skin and cause great discomfort. Sure, the bottom of my feet were nice and comfy, but when your upper part of your foot is being constantly squeezed against the tight fabric of your shoe causing discomfort, I came close to just ripping them out by the 8th hour and throwing them away right there and then.-Are not odor-absorbent!When your main claim is that you will eliminate odors and allow you to walk without socks, I expect that to be the case. Not so. Even on my small hour walk around my area running errands caused my feet to become stinky just like before. You don't even want to know what my feet smelled like the second time around when I was using them for almost 8 hours. I'm pretty sure my fiance was ready to call off the wedding right there and then. I was extremely disappointed because this was the one feature that sold me on these insoles.-Pricey!I think from now on I'm just going to save my money and spend it on the cheaper, better known brands. Sure, they may not be as cushioned as these insoles, but at least I know I can spend a fraction of the price and still get a decent supportive insole.Unfortunately, I don't see myself giving these insoles any more of a chance. My ultimate test was to see how they withstood my work environment. I work at a warehouse and do 10-hour shifts. I walk anywhere from 13 to 15 miles a day. Given my history with the discomfort these caused, and just how bad my feet smelled, I'm just going to write this as an expensive lost and go back to my other soles that have lasted me for a good year.
