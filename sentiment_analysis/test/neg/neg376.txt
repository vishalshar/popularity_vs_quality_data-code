I normally do not write many reviews. In this case it is required. First, I love the company, the Cameras, other Products and the Technical Support I always received is great! I have always worked through anything. The problem is this particular Motion Sensor, DCH-S150 , it simply is not ready for Prime Time. If they rushed this out to the public, that is sad.  The product will connect, but not all the way and also appears to have some compatibility issues. I have spent Tons of Time setting this up and tons of resets, from the switch, tablet, mobile phone, laptop, etc. Quite a bit of time also with the Technical Rep, doing the same stuff. But its not going to connect properly. How long should an average product take to connect and setup? What about a below average product to setup and connect? What about a way below average product? I have two houses, many D-Link cameras and other products in each, so setting up Wi-Fi devices is not really new. I know how to access my router and Wi-Fi devices. The box also says there is a quick set up guide in the box, there isnt. I bought several, all were sealed retail boxes, each one without any setup up guide. So I think all of this to the company would not likely be news to them on this particular Sensor. Technical Reps, even the best, cant substitute for a product that is this unstable. I really question how much they tested this particular product. What else is a customer to think? I hope this real life experience with this product helps others who are thinking about buying this. In any event I am going to return all of them, which is a disappointment, I think equally at the release of this product and also with myself, as I read the other reviews prior to buying, which all mostly said to stay away from this item, and I did not listen to those warnings. I figured those were the early adopters, bugs always happen first, etc. Stay away from this item until they have something that works more correctly for the mainstream.
