I have no idea why this gets such good reviews.  We cook a lot with basil and wanted a way to have fresh basil through the winter. We had an Aero-garden in the past so I had hopes this would work.  Well, it didn't. The basil grew slow and was yellow and pale after 2 months.  I tried contacting the company but they were too slow in responding. What grew was unusable.  Not worth the time and money.
