I bought 10 of these. They work for between 1 and 3 months. When they work, they work pretty well. But for $35 they are ridiculously priced. When you try to exchange them, the company gives you a really hard time. Too many hoops to jump through. They must know that they are failing left and right. If they were cheap, screw it, just throw them out. If they are expensive, replace them very quickly and easily. But expensive, and hard to return, not a good mix. Maybe come back in a year or two. Now, they absolutely suck. Price point should be $3. Maybe $5. And the rubber cases they sell for them all ripped within 24 hours. Sad because I wanted this to work. I tried one Tile, it worked a little better but it was twice the size and the battery is non replaceable. And I only bought one. I need to find the 3rd competitor in this market.
