Good looking socks shipped in a high quality box, so I got a little excited, but that's where the excitement ended. The socks are somewhat comfortable, but as another reviewer noticed, the socks are not all the same size! When I put the socks on, one sock was longer than the other!Than when I placed all six socks side by side, some socks were obviously of different lengths. I was quite surprised at Galivas' lack of quality control. I really don't have the time to post photos, but believe me when I say that the socks are not all the same length. Bottom line, I would NOT recommend these socks!!
