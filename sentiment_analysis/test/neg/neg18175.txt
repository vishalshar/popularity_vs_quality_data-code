Update: I wanted to share that the company has been in touch since I wrote this review. They've done everything they can to make it right even offering me a full refund. More importantly they have been genuinely interested in my feedback and it seems they've taken a lot of my ideas to heart for version 2.0. I look forward to seeing that one day.I really wanted to like this, but it falls incredibly short in every way. TL;DR To sum it up, you're trading an entire side of your carry on luggage for a useless front pocket that is a waste of space and can barely fit a half-inch thick laptop (Surface Pro 3 for example), but you get battery which you won't use to charge anything in-flight, and a useless app with features that serve absolutely no benefit or value proposition other than the ability to strike up a conversation with people in the airport or impress your friends by remotely locking and unlocking your bag.Long Review:- It's a few inches smaller than it needs to be for the maximum size on American Airlines Flights, what a waste.- The plastic material on the outside of the case is cheap, and flexible. It will take dings and paint scratches very easily, would have been better if it was textured and rigid.- The space is poor at best. you're only going to get to use one side of the suitcase, the other side houses the space for the external pocket. On the side where you can put in things, it is the same side that has the recessed rails for the retractable hand rail on the inside. So you're already at a disadvantage from a space perspective as you can only roll up items and stick them in the nooks and crannies. If you put even one pair of shoes, you're literally cutting your packing space in half. Don't expect to get more than 2 days out of this case if you typically pack shoes and or jeans or street clothes for the evenings when you travel.- The front pocket thing is small and tight. For all the space you give up losing one entire side of your suitcase, it barely fits a Surface Pro 3 (less than half an inch thick) in its pocket. If anything bulges in it at all, you won't be able to close it and lock it.- 0% chance you're going to take this down from overhead mid-flight and start charging your devices from the battery, unless the seat next to you is available to put it in...so the only real value would be when you're sitting in the airport somewhere. You know, where there are already plugs...- The app is useless. This is a small, small carry on - why would I possibly need to weigh it? They do not weigh carry on luggage ever.- The lock/unlock function is a silly version of a combination lock. It might be a cool gadget to impress your friends once, but otherwise serves no useful benefit.- GPS Tracker? Really? This is a CARRY-ON. So unless someone steals it, you're not going to be checking it anyway. What use is that?- IN order to use the App you *MUST* register on their site. Why do you need my personal information so that I can unlock my bag?- The charging batter is nothing all that special. Most of us are travelling with a battery backup in our briefcases/attache/backpacks so this is redundant.The purpose of this bag isn't well thought out at all. It's kind of all over the place with gadgetry they've just thrown in because they can, but serves no useful purpose. Is it supposed to replace your carry on entirely with the silly front pocket? If so, there's not enough space in it, and if you travel for business you're likely to have another carry on/laptop bag anyway for your laptop, documents etc...And if you don't travel for business, why would you spend $400 on a carry on suit case when you can buy a 10,000 mAh battery for a fraction of the price and put it in your carry on. IF you're any kind of serious traveler, this bag will only frustrate and annoy you. Poor space, bad design, cheap feeling materials and a useless app make this overpriced hunk of junk asinine.Again I really wanted to like this, but I can't find one positive thing to say about it.
