Had to return product.  Size of mount diameter too small for stem and handlebar.  The "out front" mount would probably fit better, but it's sold without the universal adapter.  Total price for the mount and adapter is probably cheaper than brands of similar quality (ex Rokform), but I'm not taking another chance with an order that I may have to return.
