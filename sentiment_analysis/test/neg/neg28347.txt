I thought this was a very cool idea at first, sort of a fun, nostalgia meets technology gift that my 3 boys would love. We could never get this to actually fly. We tried using the paper that was supplied and followed the directions, didn't work.  Then we tried using our own paper and airplane designs with the same outcome.  It flew for about a second and a half, then took a nose dive.  Great idea but save your money.
