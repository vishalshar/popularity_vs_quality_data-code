Whoever is selling this stuff is doing a disservice to what is otherwise a great product. I opened the box and saw a bunch of bags that looked as if all the air had been sucked out of the bags. When I sampled a bag it was stale mess. A friend tried another bag and it was the same. Amazon really ought to look into removing this item from the site.
