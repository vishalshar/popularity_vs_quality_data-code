I made the mistake of assuming that this included the full game especially at the $35 price. I never imagined a handful of new cards for a simple board game would cost that much. I looked on the watch ya mouth website and the same deck of cards are only $13. So save your money and go directly to the watch ya mouth website. Once again it was my fault for not doing my research.
