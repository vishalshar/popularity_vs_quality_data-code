Broke nearly immediately. I was such a huge fan of the first version of the Nomadkey I owned. It withstood a ton of abuse until finally giving up the ghost after probably a couple years. I went ahead and purchased a replacement from Amazon, and the lightning connector snapped right off. The problem seems to be that the metal piece of the lightning connector extends just to the black plastic jacket, and then seems to be connected via solder or something similarly week. In my case, that connection broke after mere weeks. I'm hoping this was a freak occurrence, but really unhappy with my experience this time around.
