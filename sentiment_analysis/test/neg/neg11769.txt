We were so excited to get this cooler.  Not only is the cooler very nice looking, but it had great reviews.  We received many complements on the cooler the short time we had it.  The cooler is heavy and even heavier when packed with beverages and ice.  It is a strain to pick it up, when it is not able to be wheeled to the needed destination.  Very, Very, Very disappointed in the preformance of the cooler.  Ice melted very quickly into water.  Nothing we did seem to prevent the ice from melting quickly.  We put the cooler in the shade and covered it with a blanket, with no avail.  Ice even melted to almost nothing but water during the night when the tempatures were in the low 60's.  Maybe the cooler we received was defective somehow.....?  The cooler was returned as it did not work for us.
