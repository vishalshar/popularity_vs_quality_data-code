Bought 2 devices about 2 months ago, after 1 month both devices disconnected, the app wont find it and even a reset does not work. Resetting the batteries has no reaction on the device. In the beginning (while it was working), I had the TrackR on my keychain hanging by the front door, and me sitting in the living room with my phone at hand could not locate the TrackR. I saw the Icon where it suggests that you attach them to your cat (which I tried with the second one) for 20 days I did not get a single signal about the whereabouts of my cat. (and according to the TrackR coverage Crowd GPS I should be surrounded by other tracks). Even standing in the same garage with the cat, TrackR did not indicate his location unless I was 4 feet away or closer. So if TrackR leaves the house it is pretty much lost. As of today I have not seen it connect to any other TrackR app besides my own or my app connecting to other TrackR to support Crowd GPSWIFI Safe zones still alerts as it is losing connection to the device.  I will post an update if I hear back from them.1st month was a disappointment, 2nd month it just stopped working (yes Both). So I opened a support ticket last week and have not gotten a response (other than the automated reply)
