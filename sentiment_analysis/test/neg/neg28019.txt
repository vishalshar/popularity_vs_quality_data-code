This makes a great water garden, but the pump and plants are NOT sufficient to keep the aquarium clean enough for fish. I started the plants for the water garden a couple of weeks before I added a goldfish. The plants did great and I'm currently on my third batch of wheat grass. I had no choice but to do a partial water change every week or so after I added the fish because the water started smelling bad and turning yellow. In spite of the partial water changes, the goldfish suddenly died after three weeks.  After the goldfish died, I decided that maybe goldfish are too dirty for this water garden and I bought a small beta. I cleaned the water garden, planted fresh plants and cycled the aquarium for about 10 days before I added him. He made it two weeks. After he died, I decided to shut it down. When I cleaned the pump out, it was literally filled with a brown slime, inside and up through the tube. I did start it up again for the wheat grass, but I won't put any more fish in it. I wanted to buy some water plants and a snail, but I'm afraid this setup will kill the snail too. It's a nice looking water garden, but it's just simply NOT a healthy environment for fish. Possibly some kind of filtration system could help, but I noticed a small crack starting to develop in the corner, so I'll probably just write it off as great in theory, poor in practice.
