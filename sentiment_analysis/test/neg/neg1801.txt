I bought this speaker because I read a good review, it was a beautiful speaker and it was capable of AirPlay, which is better fidelity than Bluetooth. The speaker works for a couple minutes then the battery dies. I charge it for days and leave it off for a couple days and the battery is dead. When I contacted their support, they told me I was charging it wrong. Now I heard nothing back from them. Nice looking speaker that sounds ok, but doesn't work. When it does, AirPlay is sketchy at best (which may not be the speaker's fault). It always starts up to a white noise rainstorm mode, which is annoying. Bottom line, doesn't work properly, their support would not resolve. Waste of $230.
