The myLab test kit promises accurate STI/STD tests without the awkwardness. It's for those of us who buy condoms anonymously on the Internet. (Yep, that would be me.) I ordered the 4-in-1 safe box. Unfortunately, I do not believe that this test will be accurate. Read below for my thoughts.First, myLAB Box testing is not an anonymous process. The HIV kit ships right away; however, the other tests require more information. The company emails you through Amazon to get your birth date and phone number before it ships the additional test kits. Amazon warns you that these emails will be kept for two years. Great. I sent them the information via email, and then the kits shipped.Second, the HIV test is a Home Access blood test. It uses a lot more blood than you would think. After collecting the blood onto a sheet, you have to let the sheet dry thirty minutes, then package the sheet and then mail it off to them. You have to wait a few days after sending off your test sheet before getting a result via a phone number. I prefer the OraQuick HIV test, which is FDA approved, and it is instant. For the OraQuick, you just stick a swab in your mouth, then stick the swab into some chemicals, and then there's a pregnancy-test-like stick that tells you if you're positive or not. (Thankfully, I'm not.) I don't know if the Home Access or the OraQuick is more accurate, but I would recommend getting myLAB kit without the HIV test, and then buying the much more convenient OraQuick.Third, the other non-HIV STI/STD tests are urine-based. Note that the self-collection of urine for the other, non-HIV STD/STI test is an off-label use. This fact is not disclosed anywhere on the website. It is only noted on the authorization sheet that comes with the test. An off-label use means that the kit was not approved by the FDA for this purpose. This isn't necessarily bad; however, I feel that this fact should be disclosed right off the bat before you buy the kit.Fourth, after I received and returned the first urine kit, I received an email that said I received a duplicate, and that I should use a kit with a certain serial number. Sure enough, a second urine kit showed up, and I filled that one up and returned it as well. However, I double checked and it turns out that neither kit I received and returned was the kit with the serial number that myLAB had on file for me. To summarize, I received kit X. Then myLAB said that I was getting a duplicate and should use kit Y. Then kit Z showed up in the mail. This is super-duper troubling because if they're getting the serial number confused, then the results would probably be messed up as well.Fourth, the packaging for the urine kit is uneven. The instructions say that you're supposed to pee in a collection cup, then use a provided pipette to drop about 2 mL of urine into a test tube that is pre-loaded with preservatives. You cap the test tube, and you're supposed to drop it into a sealed collection bag with absorbent cloth. There was no absorbent cloth into either kit, and there was not collection bag provided in the second kit. Then you put the bag into the box, put the box into a provided prepaid USPS Priority Mail envelope, and then drop it off. I have no idea if absorbent cloth or a collection bag is necessary for an accurate result. It's just that when you're dealing with medical testing, you would hope that there is a consistency from kit-to-kit that simply isn't present here.Lastly, note that the return bag for the urine test have biohazard markings on them, which are very conspicuous. So you may want to be careful about this bag.Bottom line: I didn't get the test results back yet, but I feel that the bungled serial numbers is a bad sign. And the off-label use issue is bothering me just because it should have been disclosed prior to sale.================Update. I received an email from the company as a result of my review. The company indicated that in the near future, users will no longer have to provide personal information through Amazon, which logs emails for two years. More importantly, the company indicated that the blood-based HIV test in their system is more accurate than the Oraquick test I advocated for. I did my own research and confirmed that this was the case. The blood test is more thorough and less likely to give you a false negative. The company also indicated that they sent me multiple kits because they were upgrading their systems.
