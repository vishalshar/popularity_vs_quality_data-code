I purchased about 9 months ago, the printer arrived broken and wasn't working properly. I took the side panel off to see if I could find the problem as I had waited patiently for it from Amazon, I found the broken part, took pictures, contacted customer service that said I voided the warranty from taking the side panel off and would have to pay for the parts that were broken.I fixed the part myself and the printer works great, their software is good also. But as a business owner myself and dedicated to my customers satisfied experience. I would never purchase another product from the people at CEL Robox.
