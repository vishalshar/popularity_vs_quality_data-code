This is a terrible product.  Got the metal version based on the other reviews.  The base is not the right size for all 3 of my cars, so it never fit right.  The design of the holders is very poor.  Even with a thin case on my phone, it did not fit well.  And worst of all, when I started using it my call quality was so bad and I could never figure out what was wrong.  Apple checked out the phone and AT&T checking my network but what was going on was that the holders blocked the antenna that is along the sides of the phone.  I had to stop using it because my call quality was so bad and dropped calls were unbearable.  Great idea, but a terrible product.
