I purchased this product as a birthday gift for a friend and they loved it! It's such a unique gift that can function as a rewarding activity. The packaging and use of recycled materials was also very appealing. Unfortunately, after a month of care, there wasn't any sign of growth. Through investigating online, it seemed that our particular batch didn't look like how it was suppose to. Reading other reviews indicates that there is a moderate chance of getting a "dud" even with proper care. Disappointing.
