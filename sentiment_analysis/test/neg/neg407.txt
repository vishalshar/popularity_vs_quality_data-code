Don't but this yet.  This could be the best ever charger for your iphone, but the construction quality is crap.  The top must have a design flaw as they sent me a replacement top for free email days after I bought it. But the charging slot is falling apart after 2 months of regular daily use.  If they can fix these flaws with Gen 2 or something then I would recommend it, but as of today, it needs to be returned.
