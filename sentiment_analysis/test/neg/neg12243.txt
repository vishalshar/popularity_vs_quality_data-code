I guess I should have read the reviews before buying this piece of junk. Here is the problem. The instructions say the set up is easy. First it asks you to connect your WiFi to the device. As soon as you do that you have disabled your connection to your home WiFi. When you go back to the App you have been kicked off the app and then you have to relog into the app. When I tried to log back into the app my phone went back to my home WiFi and disconnected my phone from the app. This went on for over an hour. Finally, I had to tell my phone to forget my home Network and finally got most of the way through the set up. Then the app kept asking for my home WiFi password. I typed it in several times correctly. It never accepted it. This product is not ready for prime time. I am returning it. If is that hard to set up, it should not be offered to the marketplace.
