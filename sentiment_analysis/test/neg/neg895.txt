This thing is good! But it doesn't connect to the Samsung Smartthings Hub. If you don't care about that. Then it is 4 stars. It also doesn't directly connect to the Amazon Echo. Or any of the hubs on the market for that matter. But you can communicate with it through IFTTT. D-Link needs to get on the ball and make their stuff compatible with Smartthings. Sales would triple!  The D-Link software is like an 11th grade computer science lab project. But the hardware appears to be top notch.  The only way I could get it to connect to my WiFi network was to disable security and have an open network with no security. So my options are pretty cool little siren that does some fun and handy things, or a safe secure network with out hackers attacking. Decisions, decisions...**** RevisedI knew D-Link made really crappy stuff but then I saw the way Belkin turn itself around and came out with the WeMo products. Well, D-link didn't do the same thing. Their products are still pretty crappy.
