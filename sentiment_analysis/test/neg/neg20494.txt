Have you thought about a couple of chopsticks and some tape? It swear it would work better than this ill-conceived part. The Gimbal Guard falls of with the slightest touch when put on from above, thereby not protecting you camera. If you try to install from below so you can take a hit on landing, you must use tape to secure, as the rubber runners on the Phantom legs prevents proper installation. Just look at you storage guard that came with you Phantom, those clips work, but not these.
