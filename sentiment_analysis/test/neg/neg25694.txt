Questionable quality control is the major issue at this time. When trying to test these light/speakers I screwed the master speaker into a lamp socket and it worked fine. When I tried to screw in the satellite unit into another lamp the speaker jammed tight and I almost lost the lamp because the device wouldnt come loose without damaging the lamp. It turns out that the thread on the speaker was deformed making it totally unusable.  At a price point as high as these speakers I would expect better quality control.I did test the one speaker that worked -- fortunately it was the master unit and not the satellite -- and found the concept of a light/speaker combo to be novel and fun. The light emitted was strong and steady while the sound emitted by the speaker was decent for its compact size.I was less enthused about having no choice but to use the Bluetooth phone app to control the brightness and volume.  I don't always have my phone with me 24/7 and since all of my music is on my computer it would have been nice to be able to control the lights and my music via a browser such as through a Chrome extension.As for the app itself the controls are basic yet functional. The initial BT connectivity was painless and once connected it was reliable. Powering off the light using the lamp switch cuts off the BT connection as expected. Turning the lamp back on re-initializes the pairing function between the speaker and phone but does not actually reconnect the two.  It takes about 6 seconds for the light to turn on from a cold start and about 3 seconds from a warm start.The light emitted from the device when the power is turned back on, however, turns on at full blast until the phone connects and the app is able to take control and is adjusted. The lamp cannot be controlled by a dimmer switch and the device does not save the settings when the power goes off.So the sequence to use this device is: Power up the lamp Wait for the light to turn on to make sure the lamp works Grab your phone Access your phones security Fire up the app Wait for Bluetooth to turn on (the app will turn on your BT for you) Reestablish the BT device connection Adjust the light brightness (default at 100%) Adjust the sound volume (default at 80%)That's a lot of steps to turn on a light and a speaker.So overall I like this light/speaker combination and would like to see it succeed.  IMO I think the app needs a bit of refining, especially in the area of control features and saved setting, as well as a browser extension for home use.Most needed of all, however, is quality control since this device is not inexpensive.  Having a set of speakers come off assembly with bad threads rendering half of the total product totally useless is inexcusable.
