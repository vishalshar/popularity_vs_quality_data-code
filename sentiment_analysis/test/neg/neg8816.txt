Leaks out of the bottom seal. First time I used it.Edit 8/28/2014What I've found is that it doesn't leak until you let it sit for a few hours. After a few hours the bottle leaks about a tablespoon, or so, of liquid from the bottom cap when you tilt it. Let it sit for a few more hours and it will leak again, and so on.
