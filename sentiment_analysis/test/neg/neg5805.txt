Not as reliable as I thought it would be. I put the device on my keyring, and in my pocket. I have a computer on the top of my desk. Even at this range, it disconnects. When it disconnects, you're automatically logged out of your computer. Very annoying. I ended up putting the receiver closer to the edge of the desk with a USB extension cord. Still disconnects. Not really usable, in my use case.
