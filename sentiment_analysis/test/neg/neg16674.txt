I think these things are really only useful if what you're looking for happens to be right next to you but you're just not seeing it (like in a couch crack or under a jacket).  More than 1 room away, and it's either "out of range" or you can't hear the chime.  And if it's right by you anyway, you probably would have found it with a bit more searching.  So for me, it's just not that useful.  Case in point....I attached 1 to my keys, 1 to my spare key, and 1 to my daughter's phone (via a key ring attached to her rubber case).  This was the one I was most excited for since she misplaces her phone a lot (usually in the house).  However, the very first time she lost her phone, the XY3 was no help at all.  It showed the last place her phone was seen as in the house, but when I pushed the "beep" button, it didn't beep and it said "out of range."  I walked over the entire house, car, garage, basement etc., pushing the "beep" button, and it never beeped or registered as being in range.  Customer service said it has to be really close and have a visual line of sight to the phone I'm searching with.  So if I'm that close AND I can see it, why do I need the XY3??General comments:  Registering the tiles was confusing.  What looked easy ended up taking 20 minutes plus an email to customer service, waiting for a reply, and then trying something different to get the app to read all 3.  1 tile appeared non-functional when I got it, but after removing the battery and putting it back in, it registered. The chime is not easily recognizable against background noise.  It sounds more like a song than a beep or alarm, which would be very easy to hear.  It's also not very loud.I did use another XY3 to successfully find my keys when they were buried in my purse, which was sitting right next to me. So these are not entirely useless.  But since it didn't find my daughter's phone, which is pretty much why I bought it, I feel like it was a waste of money.  I had high hopes for the XY3, but so far it has been a disappointment.
