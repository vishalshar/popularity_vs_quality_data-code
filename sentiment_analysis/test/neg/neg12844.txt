The concept is fine, but it does not work as well as I thought... My intention was to make sure I could find my 3 yr/old daughter in case she escape in a mall or park (it happens so fast, parents will understand this). Did not work, the response time is not as fast as I need. Besides, the sound is so low that I cannot hear it unless it is a quiet environment, I`m not 20 feet apart and the object is not under other other stuff (place it under your pillow and you won`t hear it).I`m trying new uses and will keep it, but definitely I wouldn`t buy it if I had the chance to try it first.
