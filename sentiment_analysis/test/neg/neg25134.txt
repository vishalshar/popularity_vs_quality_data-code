I really wanted to like this case but there's too many design flaws for me to give it more than 2 stars. Like other people have said the volume and power buttons are very hard to access. If my supervisor walks in my office and I can't immediately turn my cell phone off then I might get in trouble!! Also I feel that if I drop my phone the rubber case won't offer much protection. I think the screen will definitely crack. Also the price is way too high for a piece of aluminum and rubber. Would not recommend!
