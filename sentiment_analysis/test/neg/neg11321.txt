The GlocalMe box sometimes worked in China, sometimes not. In many cases it showed "No Service" or zero bars, in places where my iPhone, roaming had service from China Unicom. In some cases even if it had 3G or 4G service indicated, I could not make a wifi connection or visit any Internet sites (not ones that are blocked in China). And then one night I went to bed with 1GB remaining in my package, all my devices closed or sleeping, and when I got up the 1GB had disappeared and there was a message "Your account is in arrears".  I had to buy another 3GB package. Also, battery life was very poor (did not last a whole day of intermittent use). I cannot recommend this product.
