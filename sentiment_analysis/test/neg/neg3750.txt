Purchased this item for my fianc√© for Christmas and she was pretty excited about it. We sat down and opened it and followed the directions step by step and it has now been a few weeks and we're still staring at a dinosaur with a clear liquid and no glow. Not sure what the issue is but from reading the reviews and comments it doesn't seem like this is an isolated incident.
