Update 10/6/16:I hate that I spent so much on these bc the just don't stay put!  Great idea. Poor design. I'm on here now looking for another light that stays put.Original review:First of all, this idea is ingenious. Second, their customer service is top notch. They want happy customers and are easy to get in touch with, should you have any questions.  We now have two of our three toilets illuminated.  ?
