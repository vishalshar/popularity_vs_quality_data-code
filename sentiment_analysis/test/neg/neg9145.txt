I had high hopes for this product. As a media consumption product (watching videos - see note below regarding subtitles) the Glyph is just okay.  You don't need a perfectly focused (edge to edge) image for movies. 90% is fine. But for any other use case sick as virtual desktop or reading an ebook, you're out of luck. These are also very uncomfortable in all but a few use-cases.The issue is two-fold. First, it is next to impossible to get the outer 5% of the image 100% focussed (without considerable eye strain) and keep it focussed as you move your eyes to view it. This means that subtitles on movies are very difficult to read for more than a few minutes. It means that you will be able to read the middle of 80% of your ebook page, and you'll need to continually scroll to keep text in the sweet spot. It means that using it for a virtual desktop, you won't be able to really use your status bars or read webpages really.The second issue is rainbow artifacting as you rapidly move your eyes. You actually see the rgb pixels as you look rapidly from one side of the image to the other. It's disorienting.This is, in my opinion, a product for early adopters who want to see what the technology could be. I really want to love it, and I intend to buy the next generation if Avegant ends up putting larger and perhaps more complex optics to push the unfocused region beyond the image. I'd actually happily have paid $250 more if they would collaborate with a company like zeiss with expertise in optics. Even if they were 50% more bulky.Oh, and what's up with the white inner plastic? I had terrible issues watching movies on the bus. I got annoying glare reflections from the windows during the day and from the interior lights after sunset.That said, if you are part of the 2% who have the perfect head and facial shape (and short eyelashes to get close to the lense), and you intend to use these in bed or sitting is a lazy boy recliner in a dim room, go crazy. For the rest, wait until the next iteration.
