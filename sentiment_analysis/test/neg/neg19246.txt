A cool concept but it does not 'replace apps to control smart devices' for apple TV as advertised. Its mostly infrared only but customer service told me they are devoping compatibility for apps' I just have to wait. Also, you can adjust the devices angle to point slightly dowards towards you from a wall mounted TV, but then you must also adjust the angle of your gestures to compensate. Arm tired quickly. Returned.
