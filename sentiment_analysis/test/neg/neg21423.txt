a the actual picture was great. We were very excited about the quality.  However, about 2 months after purchase the charger port became detached from the device.  It has been stuck in the device.  We emailed customer service and have yet to hear from them.  We really liked the quality of the picture and wanted to get it fixed. but since we can't charge it and have not gotten a response from the company; we are assuming we have lost our money.
