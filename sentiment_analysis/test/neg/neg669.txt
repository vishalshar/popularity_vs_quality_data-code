I consider myself a pretty tech-savvy person. My technology is usually pretty new and I worked at a very large, very well known, phone/tablet/computer company for six years. We carried the 1st generation of this scale back then. I've wanted a smart scale for a long time but never could justify the purchase. I started a diet a couple of months ago and after a few weeks of plateauing, I was hoping a smart scale could help give me some more insight -- maybe my weight isn't going down because my muscle mass is increasing. I did some research and finally decided to take the plunge.I've really been disappointed with this scale since getting it.1) Setting it up wasn't the best experience. The technology here is confusing. Setting it up on my phone was easy. It joined my wifi, I downloaded the app, I stood on the scale, my weight went into the app. Then I helped my boyfriend set it up on his phone. It made him use bluetooth and then wifi. It was weird and clunky. He didn't like it.2) After I set it up with my boyfriend's phone, it stopped syncing with mine. I read their support -- maybe it has to do with the bluetooth -- but then I opened the app and 12 hours after standing on the scale, my weight was there. But then another day it never comes over. It works and then doesn't. But then sometimes it does again. Sometimes it waits a day and then I can see yesterday's weight. It doesn't matter if I open the app right away after standing on the scale. Usually nothing comes over.3) It is supposed to sync with MyFitnessPal. I even see a friend who uses it. His timeline will say that he lost a pound and it came from Withings. Mine doesn't do that. I don't know why. All the settings have been configured.4) Also for something that is supposed to sync with your other apps, the steps and calories are always completely different than what I recorded in MFP. I also don't like that this scale gives you a daily calorie goal (which was way too low). It makes those features of the app pointless. I've looked and my Apple Watch + MFP have me at 10K steps for the day and the Withings scale/app says I've gone 6K.5) The app looks NOTHING like the mock ups do. In fact, I was kind of upset. Why do they completely lie about what the graphics look like? The app is crap compared to how they make it look in marketing. It doesn't really make sense to me.6) It is supposed to give you the weather. I stand on it, not moving, waiting. It doesn't give me the weather. My boyfriend stands on it, and it gives him the weather. I'm pretty sure this scale hates me.7) It gave us a warning that it can't work over 5G internet. Get with the times.I read their support. I have everything configured. Maybe my internet is too fast (ha!). All I know is if you're going to drop $140 on a SCALE it should work a lot better than this.Sending it back. Going back to a non-smart scale.
