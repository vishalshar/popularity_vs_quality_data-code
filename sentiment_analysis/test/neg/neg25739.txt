This is a great concept and was glad when juiced came out with one that charges a new MacBook. Unfortunately when I hook up my apple SuperDrive to this via USB 2, my laptop says it's not compatible because the drive is not receiving enough power...even with the charging cable plugged in. What is even more frustrating is I paid the full $64.99 for it a year ago and now it's half off. Great look and feel for design but has some major shortcomings in performance.
