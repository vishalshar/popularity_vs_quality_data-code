I was really hoping this would work. Unfortunately it would not sync with my iPhone 7 to begin set up. Customer service was horrible, they kept sending same email message as if they never read my response describing issue. My iPhone is always running latest OS, I am one of those who update the OS as soon as it's released. I am very familiar with hooking up network items. I have many Belkin light bulbs, switches and cameras set up and also use kwikset kevo. All of which I have no issue connecting to my network and phone to access remotely. This was by far the worst item I ever tried to hook up. Again I am very disappointed because I really wanted this type of product.
