The tweezers are too weak and imprecise to work as a sliver gripper.  When you grip hard enough try and take hold of a sliver, the "belly" of the tweezers contact each other and cause the jaws to actually open!  That plus the imprecise fit of the points/jaws and lack of any real texture exacerbate the issue.  This is just a cheaply stamped out piece of metal that resembles a tweezer. Get a pair from the drug store....
