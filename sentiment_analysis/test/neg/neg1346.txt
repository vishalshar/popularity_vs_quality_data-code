I work as a desktop support administrator so I know 99% of problems in technology are user error. I've tried power cycling this thing 20 times, deleting the app on my phone, cycling my phone, and it absolutely will not connect. The initial connection is through Bluetooth, so I was standing right next to the unit, still no go. Had numerous emails into the product tech support, still no go. At a price point of $200, this thing should work flawlessly.God knows what kind of nightmare would have ensued if I actually got it working and heaven forbid I had to power cycle my router or modem.I implore anyone who reads this review to avoid this product like the plague, and go in a different direction for home security. Sometimes crowd funded items turn out awesome, sometimes they turn into this waste of time and money.
