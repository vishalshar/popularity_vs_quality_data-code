I didn't have any problem with the light.  In fact after several months the light still works.  The suction cups are HORRIBLE.  They will not stay on and I have tried various places on two brands of toilets.  This makes the product a waste of money.  This product is a scam until they fix the way it attaches to porcelain.  Do not waste your money.  Makes me wonder about Shark Tank credibility.
