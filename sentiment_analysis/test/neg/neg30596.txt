I first bought a quadlock for my bicycle and a Samsung Galaxy S5.  It worked great and I was very pleased with it.  It was pretty pricey but I figured I was investing in a system that I could then continue to use with new phones in the future.  Unfortunately, having replaced my phone with a Nexus 6P, it turns out that there is no case available and the universal adapter is not safe to use.  The reviews show that many people found that the adhesive fails and their phones went flying off their bikes.  I wrote to the company to ask if they had a better solution or could recommend an alternative adhesive but got a scripted and useless response that essentially said "no, we have no suggestion".  So unless you intend to stick with whatever phones they make cases for right now indefinitely - I would not recommend purchasing this system as it is too expensive for something you'll only get a year or two out of.  Too bad.Edit:  I see that the price has dropped considerably since I purchased the original base kit.  So perhaps it's worthwhile - but I would make this purchase under the assumption you won't be able to use it with any other phone.
