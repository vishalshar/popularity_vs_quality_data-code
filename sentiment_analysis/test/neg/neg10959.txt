Was excited to finally get one of these, as it can get wasteful buying such large quantities of herbs at the market (seriously, who goes through that much cilantro in 2 weeks?), but I'm not super impressed.Just finished with basil start-up, and while I had no mold as some other users reported, the basil is just meh. I don't get much of the flavor I'd expect. I'm also disappointed at the other refill offerings; would really love to be growing dill & cilantro in winter, but those aren't available as refills (shame on me for not checking first). Very heavy on flowers, which just seems silly.It was easy to use and set up, but that's about all I can say for the plus-side. I even got this as a Black Friday deal, I think it was about forty percent off the original price, but it's still not worth it to keep.
