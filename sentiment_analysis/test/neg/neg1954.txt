The concept of this item is outstanding. Form and fit is great too for backpacking. Regrettably, the flaw is the volume and temperature of the deliverable espresso! You do not get a full "shot" from this, just a sip. And by the time you complete the pump action the product is luke warm, at best. I was hopeful for a true shot of steamy espresso on my hike, but it did not deliver that. Excellent concept, just lacking in delivery.
