I like the device but it has issues that can't be overlooked and are big enough for me to say do not buy.Good-It tracks exercise and kept me motivated (but I work out on a treadmill and I found that if I left the piece on my wrist it would not track my exercise so I had to remove it and put it in my pocket instead, downside is that when I would switch it form wrist to pocket in the app it would not always take so that would be something to have to double check)-It tracked my sleep and I found out I actually sleep way less than I thought.  (unfortunately that is all it does, would be nice to get advice on how to optimize my sleep like some other devices do.)Bad-It falls out of the band constantly. I wrote customer service over this and they sent me a new piece to the band that was supposed to stop this, but it did absolutely nothing.  I wrote customer service at least 4x over this and there were no answers.  Finally after 4 months of wearing it,  it stopped syncing with my app again I wrote customer service and their advice was to update my app (it was already updated) and to turn on my app and let it update (but the problem was it wouldn't sync so this was no good).-Finally 4 months and like 2 weeks after purchasing it fell out again and this time I could not find it anywhere.  So now not only was my Misfit Shine 2 not working I lost it too and have nothing now.So as cool as this wearable is in the end it is not worth it because you will probably lose and be out money.
