If u do not pack the case with cards iPhone falls into the pit.  I carry my iPhone in my hip pocket the buttons protrude out and are constantly turning the volume all the way down and turning the screen off and on while in my hip pocket.  I cut the buttons out of the case to stop this.No protective screen cover comes with case.  They did make a hell of an effort to make a good case.
