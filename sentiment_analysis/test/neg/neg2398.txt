Left a lot to be desired.  I'm in LOVE with the concept and instantly bought this when I found out it existed.  Within 10 minutes my son was...do I dare say a tad bored!!?  We sat down and played together and he experienced excitement when he advanced to the next level, but when we noticed the next level was the EXACT same concept, but with different numbers, he lost interest.  "Again!" He'd say.  There seems to be about 10-15 different levels all surrounding the same concept.  Really!!!  That's all you can do with this amazing technology?Maybe I haven't gotten far into the game and I hope I'm completely wrong, but I was expecting more!
