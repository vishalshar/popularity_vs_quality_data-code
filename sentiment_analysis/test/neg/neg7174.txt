Solid. New model automatically switches to video when detected, no remote needed. Way better than the first model.- Battery life sucks- Picture quality is great, but it does need to be pitch black- Needs to be directly in front of screen, no angles otherwise the picture gets a bit messed up- Doesn't work with 95% of phones, ios, android. Pretty much HDMI or nothing.- Customer service is absolutely amazing. I had a defective unit and they upgraded me to the new one. Sent me a new remote and totally took care of me.- Size is perfect- Don't count on speakers, I mean really, why would you, its a projector not a tv.
