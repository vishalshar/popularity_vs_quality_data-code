Bought 3 pair for family at Christmas and used them for 4 days skiing in Utah. Walker talkies are a joke only worked one time at my house never on the mountain tried many times. The phone worked well and using Siri was also useful and music quality was fine. I don't play the music very loud for safety reasons. Seams to me they rushed the walker talkie feature for Christmas and will probably pay the price with a lot of returns.
