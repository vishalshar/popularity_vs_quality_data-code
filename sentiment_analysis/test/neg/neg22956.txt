I ordered my Relay G10 on October 5. I was very happ with it, until tonight, Nov. 22. While plugging the USB power supply in, the jack on the receiver broke off and fell inside the unit.  I am very gentle with my gear - this thing is clearly defective.  Amazon says I am outside of my return window, so now I'm stuck with trying to get warranty coverage from Line 6 - and we have a big Holiday show next week.
