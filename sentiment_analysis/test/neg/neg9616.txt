Very poor value.  I saw these at Walmart for less than two dollars each and thought these were the same since these cost two dollars each.  I got a tiny box in the mail, about the size of a drugstore novel and thought this couldn't possibly be these seasoning jars.  But they were.  They're less than a third of the size of the Walmart ones with the same price.  Oh well.  They don't taste very good either.  The nacho cheese tastes weird to me.  I can't possibly imagine anyone liking its strong chemical taste, but apparently some do.  Maybe I got a bad one.  They're all pretty bad, except the white cheddar, kettle corn, and ranch.  I use these on air popped popcorn along with spray butter to hydrate the powder and keep it stuck to the popcorn.  It doesn't completely work and still manages to go everywhere including into my lungs when I try to eat it and all over my counter.  It still beats plain popcorn though.  Get it from Walmart.  It's cheaper.
