There's a lot of hype around these and I have to say, I don't think it's very much deserved. I don't use these for travel at all. If they move around the brush even slightly, the brush bristles can splay and become damaged which I guess isn't a big deal if they're not very expensive or if it's just not a concern but I spend a lot on quality brushes and want them to last forever. Using these for travel doesn't help achieve that albeit impossible goal, but hinders it. Using these to dry brushes takes about a lifetime. It's not so much as I don't have the patience to wait, it's more that I'm worried that the longer my brushes stay wet/damp, the more susceptible they are to bacteria regrowth and the like. I kinda still use some of them for storage but only because otherwise they're completely useless.Would never buy these again. I feel like there was a good idea and great intentions and so much potential but they just fell too short.
