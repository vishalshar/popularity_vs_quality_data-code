I got my Leaf and loved it  its so pretty, it looks like jewelry. I had fun setting it up, and I looked through the meditations and did some of them. Most reviewers said that the tracking works best when worn as a clip, and it says that's recommended in the manual, so I did that. Each time I put it back on I had to bend the clip slightly to make it fit tightly.  After three days it fell off somewhere outside. So I guess the options are to wear it as a necklace or bracelet, which isn't as accurate, or wear it as a clip and risk losing it. As much as I liked it I won't be getting another.
