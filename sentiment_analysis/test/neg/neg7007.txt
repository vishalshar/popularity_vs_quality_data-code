I ordered two of these Picc line covers.  After throughly reading the sizing guide and meticulously following the measurement instructions ordered what was recommended for my bicep circumference.  The black one arrived and actually fits, the floral one was labeled an XL inside but the packaging was labeled xxs, the size I should have had.  However it was so tiny it wouldn't fit over my arm, it seemed like someone started with an XL and tried to alter it down to an XXS but made it too small.  The black one is an XXS and is at least an inch wider.  It works, but I don't love it.  I ordered one from Care & Wear and much prefer the design and functionally.  Bottom line, there are much better Picc covers out there, I'm returning both of these.
