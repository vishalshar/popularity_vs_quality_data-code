Bright spot in the center of the screen, chipped and cracked within a month (which makes 2 iphone screens that I have broken... ever) and the thumb print didn't work (it should have, it was not damaged and was plugged in properly).  This lasted about 2 months until I eventually had to pay for an apple repair which cost me less than this off market screen did.  Next time I'll do my homework and find out what the real repair at the apple store costs before I go this route.
