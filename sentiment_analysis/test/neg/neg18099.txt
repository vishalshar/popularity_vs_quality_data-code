I appreciate the idea but this doesn't work for me. I'm either too tall, too fat, or both. Regardless, I cannot adjust this to work properly for me. 6' 3" / 275lb. It arrived in a "thank you for supporting us on kickstarter" package. I guess they ordered too many for the kickstarter campaign and are selling the leftovers on Amazon.Very clunky to adjust. If you're sitting for multiple hours without getting up for anything then maybe that's okay. But if you get up to use a printer, speak with colleagues, fill up a coffee cup, etc. then it is not worth the hassle of getting adjusted back into this contraption.
