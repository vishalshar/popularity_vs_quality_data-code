It continually works out of the CD slot every time you move or touch your device. I have to put it back in every 3-4 days.2002 Mini Cooper S - iPhone 4s - Vertical the phone covers the gas gauge, horizontal, it does not.*Update* This is total crap. The roads in Michigan have finally thawed. I travel crap/dirt roads quite a bit. It will not stay in the slot. I tightened it so much the bottom bracket bent and cracked. The bezel of my radio popped off it was so tight. Not worth the money whatsoever.
