I had bought this product before from other vendors (three bags on amazon.com from Pet Zone USA in June and one bag in a local pet store in May), and I knew that my mother's dog adores this treat. So I was puzzled when I visited her last week and she complained that this recent (August) shipment of 2 packages was "bad--yellow and hard--not like the other packages" (of the same brand treats) we had bought before. Today I wrote the vendor, PetFoodDirect, and asked them to look into this. Perhaps there is a quality control problem at Whole Life, or maybe storage issues. After receiving the "bad bags," my mother bought 2 bags of the same treats at her local pet store and they were fine. The pet store lady told her that sometimes there are bad pieces due to being undercooked or not dehydrated properly--sounds like she'd encountered this issue before (which makes me think it is a quality control issue). Unfortunately my mom mixed the contents of the bad bags with her good bags, so I can't return them...but I'm eager to hear what the response is from Whole Life and PetFoodDirect, and I will post again after I've heard from them.My mother's dog does love these treats, and I can see why: they are light fluffy/flaky pieces of dehydrated white chicken breast--and look so tasty that I'm tempted to try one!
