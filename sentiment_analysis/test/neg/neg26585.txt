Unfortunately, the fine folks at Seek Thermal have seen fit to make their Android app limited to certain devices instead of just using generic Android api's so that it can be loaded onto any standard Android device. I haven't yet gotten around to finding a standalone apk so that I can sideload it onto my Ogima Android tablet [all of the small Android tablets basically think they're overgrown phones anyway, just lacking the actual cell radio components.] As smartphone prices continue to fall, this issue may become moot, but as of now, I still have no way of determining whether this product is actually worth the dosh outlaid for its purchase. Oh well, my own fault I guess for assuming that the vendor would take the programming high road... ::)
