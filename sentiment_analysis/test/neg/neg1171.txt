I was so excited when this arrived.  I like to stay away from plastic cups for my kids so when I saw this I had to try it.  It is great that there are only two pieces - easy to wash!  But, that doesn't matter if the quality isn't the best.  My kids have used the Lifefactory glass bottles and sippy cups for a long time and have dropped them MANY times.  They never break.  My daughter dropped this once (from about 2 ft off the ground) and it shattered!  I know it is glass and glass breaks but come on.  Not even my pyrex would do that and this is made specifically for kids - who drop things.  I would not recommend this!
