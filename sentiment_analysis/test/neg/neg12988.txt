BEWARE.Product worked great, however when removing the stick part that adheres the magnet directly to the phone, it turned my RoseGold phone yellow underneath it....BEWARE!!!UPDATE: Contacted the company. After waiting for over a month for a response, iOttie refused to even refund the money for the product, much less replacing the damaged phone. Their response was, "thats too bad". HORRENDOUS customer service. Their product, despite being labeled as "safe" and "protects" your device. I am sooo thinking small claims court is the next move. THIS is why people sue, you are nice and ask nicely for a refund for something a product they so very clearly label as "safe" isn't "safe" isn't frustrating.
