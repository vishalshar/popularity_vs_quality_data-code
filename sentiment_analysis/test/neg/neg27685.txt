If you have a dog chasing this around the house, you will have to re-calibrate every few seconds. It seems that any time this thing bumps into a wall, slides on the floor, or gets turned around by your dog, it will go the wrong direction, or the controller will say it's "dizzy" and you will have to stop and re-calibrate it. For me, that makes it pretty much useless indoors. It's probably much better outside, and when you don't have a dog chasing it. But in my case, I got it specifically for my dog to play with. I don't recommend it for that. I tried it with and without the rubber tires. It didn't work well either way.
