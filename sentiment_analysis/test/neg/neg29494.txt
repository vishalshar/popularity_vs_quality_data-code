I got the watch from Kickstarter. I liked the watch design as well as the interface but the watch is not for any iPhone users. I waited for about 2 months and 15 days for the watch to reach me but I wasn't expecting connection drops at least!Pros:1. Slick design2. Touch interface on the side (tickle touch)3. Clean interface, wifi inbuilt4. I like the watch faces5. Elegant packingCons:1. Being an iPhone user, I have to keep the Ticwear app running in the background which may not be an ideal choice for some people since it will consume more battery2. Connection drops even after updating my iPhone 6s to latest iOS as of 11/12/2016 as well as the TicWatch 2.3. Battery life varies from about 12-13 hours on light usage which in my case was just to check the time.4. It takes time to set it up the first time. It did work after factory resetting it for about 2-3 times and trying it again.5. Was expecting a better customer service but ended up getting a response not expected.Here's the email reply:"Hi,Thank you for your updates. recently we have noticed the connection issue with iOS device and it is caused by the iOS updates. Please update your iPhone and ticwatch to the latest version and the connection issue should be fixed. Meanwhile, it will be helpful if you can provide some screenshots for us to identify the issue on our end. Thank you for your time and support!Best,Noah"I did reply back on November 8 but still waiting for an answer.Well, I am an iOS user so would only stick on this side of the river. I haven't seen/heard any issues with any Android devices but will keep changing this review if I hear anything.
