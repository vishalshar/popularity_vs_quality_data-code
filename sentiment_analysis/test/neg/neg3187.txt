They look nice and when they work, they are handy.  Unfortunately, frequently the device just can't be found even when it's right next to the phone.  Some of that may be the app's fault.  The app cuts my phone's battery life in half and only works maybe 1/3 times.Also, I wish the button was the size of a fingernail and slightly inset, I did find myself accidentally setting it off when I leaned on my pocket.Finally, either the device broke after a month, or the battery died.  Either way I probably won't bother hooking up the 3rd one.
