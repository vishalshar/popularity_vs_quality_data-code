I was initially interested in this product to boost my wifi since the internet isn't the best in our house the set up was pretty easy plugging it in and it fired up immediately but i was never able to connect any of my devices despite a strong signal. neither my password nor the one listed on the device worked. After 3-4 hrs of unable to authenticate and unable to connect notifications im done maybe Customer support can help but I'll probably be returning this device not nearly as smooth as advertised.
