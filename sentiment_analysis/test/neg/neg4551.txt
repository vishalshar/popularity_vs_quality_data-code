The service from the vendor was excellent in all respects.  Having said that  I have to state the overall quality of the item is poor and not likely to stand up to anything but light, occasional use.  The results were adequate for prints up to 4x6,  (scrapbook sized prints).  Instructions are poor,  but with some perseverance you can figure it out.  If you only have a few slides to scan,  and you do not need more than scrapbook quality,  this is ok.
