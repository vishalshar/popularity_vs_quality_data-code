I read all the negative feedback about the disk falling out of the bracelet. Many people kindly answered my questions. And the MOOV company promptly answered my questions. So I went ahead and ordered the MOOV Now. I was SHOCKED; the engineering was worse than I could imagine. The disk is barely contained in the strap. I so wanted to like and keep this tracker. I didn't see how I could possibly wear it; I'd be scared every second that the disk was going to fall out. I just don't get it: the engineering on the disk itself and the app is so first class. And then the way they've set up the strap as if it's an afterthought. I'm very disappointed, because I really wanted to use this thing, but not like this. Please, MOOV, fix the strap so that the disk is really secure. Also, the strap is itself seemed a bit too flimsy to me. I was also concerned that it would come loose on my hand. The "clasp" didn't seem very claspy. Back to the drawing boards, my friends.Moov NOW Personal Coach & Workout Tracker (2nd Gen), Fusion Red
