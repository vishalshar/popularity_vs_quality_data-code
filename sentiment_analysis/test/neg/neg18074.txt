This hard drive is piece of crap. It died within less then 2 months of use, and I can't get a replacement.Got it on March 4th 2016, it's May 9th and the drive is DEAD. Disk Utility and DiskWarrior say "Directory cannot be rebuilt the partition map may be corrupt"I've used it with care being careful to eject it every time. All of a sudden it won't be recognized and it can't be repaired. I had organized my NI Kontakt Libraries in there and took me months-now it's all gone.I can't do a return because it expired a month ago. I've had this crap for only 2 months, it dies on me make lose lots of important work, and now I can't even get an RMA.Screw this, I feel cheated. Don't buy this
