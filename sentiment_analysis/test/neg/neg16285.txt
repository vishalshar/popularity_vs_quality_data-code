I purchased this case in February of 2016. I loved the case until a couple weeks ago when the black trim strip surrounding the phone began peeling off near the power and volume buttons. So far I can still push it back on and it will remain in place until I pull it in and out of my pocket or purse. I love how slim the case is and that it has the magnet for mounting it on the dash. I have even dropped my phone several times and the case does seem to be very protective. If it wasn't for the trim issue, I would have given it 5 stars. It cost too much to have an issue like this after 5 months of use.
