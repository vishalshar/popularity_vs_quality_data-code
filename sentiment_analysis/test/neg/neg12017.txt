After 1 week the zap function was only working with the app but not manually. I tried the hard reset as suggested on the homepage of the company but this did not restore the function. I also contacted the company and asked for support but did not get any response to my request.Two additions to my previous comment:-The strength of the device was set to 100. Therefore, this cannot be the reason why the manual zap function was not working as suggested by Maneesh Sethi.-Only after my critical review I was contacted by the support service of Pavlok. I was asked if I would be willing to update the review on Amazon upon fixing the issue and that they would send me two colored bands of my choice free of charge.
