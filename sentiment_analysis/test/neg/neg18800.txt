I was excited to try this product for all its different features. I get up early for work so the simulated sunrise was a big selling point for me. However the light is not very bright at all. There are really no instructions just a youtube video that does not give any really information other than the inital app set up. Once set up and tried once the clock can no longer connect to my phone. A constant error message comes up of unable to connect.
