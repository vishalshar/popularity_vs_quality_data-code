I have given this a few too many hours.  The App and idea are great BUT why does it only pair with one device?  Why can't more than one android control this thing.  Most good headphones pair with 2 bluetooth devices.  My car pairs with 3, so why can this device???  I may return it cause it is not much good if I am the only one in my house that can control everything.  Echo integration would be cool if it was reliable.  It works but unreliably as the action word "anymote" is not easily understood and Echo is not patient enough to accept a full sentence.
