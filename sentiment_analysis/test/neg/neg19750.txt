I received the Bragi Dash last Thursday December 29th,2017. I was hoping after watching this for over a year and reviews saying things were getting better after firmware updates that the product as a whole would be better... Unfortunately, I was mistaken. I first read the instructions, and watched all the tutorial videos online before I even received the bragi in the mail. Needless to say, I was a bit hyped. so, upon receiving them, I opened the packaging and set them in the charger and plugged it to my computer as per instructions to "activate" them and let it charge. After that was done, I proceeded in fitting them and beginning the pairing process. This is when I began to notice things were not all well. The right ear paired immediately, but there was nothing going on with the left. I found that the touch interface worked (the right ear would still notify me of settings I changed with the left ear interface) but no sound... to the troubleshooting forums I went! I tried everything! resetting it, taking the right earpiece out and bringing it closer to the left while my finger was on the sensor, putting it in and out of the charger several times to let the two "sync". nothing... Then, for no reason I can figure out, it started working.. and I was able to finally pair my left with the phone, since you have to put in a code in the app that the left ear, and only the left ear reads to you at the time of pairing. It worked!!!! finally after 3 hours of frustration and after letting it charge for 6 and another like 30 minutes fitting the earpieces and trying different ones... a very long set up process indeed! and I was tired. so feeling good with my accomplishment I placed the bragi back in its charger and went to bed.The next morning, I awoke and was feeling good and decided to try my new Bragi out at the gym. So, just to make sure they were good to go, I popped them in my ears. To my dismay,  no noise from the left ear. I started all over again with all the troubleshooting steps, all the while muttering unsuitable words under my breath. 4 hours passed and still nothing. I thought to myself, why on earth would a company have a product that worked this horridly straight from the box? So finally, I resorted to going to the Bragi customer support page and logging a ticket. This is the only way I have found to get in touch with their support. No phone number, no internet chat, just put your request in and wait till they can fit you in when its convenient to them. Today is January 2nd 2017. I am hoping that the slow response time is due to backup from Christmas/ it was New years Weekend. However, I will update once I receive a response. But at this point if they can't fix immediately or overnight me a replacement this are going back and I will stick to the reigning champs of headphones in my book, Bose. and these will go down as just another failed upstart. Good ideas, and it would have been really nice to have complete wireless freedom, but its main purpose was a headphone and for no sound to come out of one ear made these useless.As for what little experience I had with them, they seemed to work well, pairing was a bit cumbersome and the app is a not super user friendly, but maybe in time they will get better/ I will get used to it? The bluetooth pairing was strong, no issues with it dropping or "sputtering" after trying putting my phone in all my different pockets. It was able to take my heart rate and it seemed on par with what my apple watch was telling me. The fit of them in my ear is good, but the plastic sensor nubs that stick out do start to agitate my ear after a bit, especially if I'm having to change setting by tapping.As for the touch interface, the swiping gestures work well, however the tapping gestures I find you must tap fairly hard, which in turn jabs those sensor nobs into your ear.Overall, If these worked, I'd prob give them 4 stars. Are they with the money... idk... for complete wireless freedom plus the fact that they are waterproof? ... maybe... But, as they sit now with only one earpiece working, they are not.To any perspective buyer, I would just warn that from my research and with my experience I would be very wary with this purchase unless you have the time an patience to deal with the highly possible event that your new Bragi do not work as advertised straight out of the box.Update as of 1-10-17After I sent in the initial ticket the Bragi customer service contacted me the following Monday with instructions and files on updating my headphones. Nothing worked to resolve the issues in the left ear. It normally took them a day to respond each time I responded, and the whole email customer service thing is a huuuge con in my opinion. Finally, I a guy namedRichard from Bragi asked me for proof of purchase and serial. I'm we so they could look into a replacement. I replied with the info, then nothing... I haven't heard from Bragi in almost a week with no word on a replacement or any other word regarding fixing my defective headphones... I would now give a negative review for this product if I could... it has been a horrid experience and I will most likely return them and get something else.
