I was trying to get a place for my small dog to go potty since I work long hours sometimes and she can't hold it. I think the product could be great IF you start out training a puppy on it. Mine is a 1 1/2 years old. She won't use it even though I bought the upgraded grass. But my cat likes to sleep on it and scratch at the grass lol!
