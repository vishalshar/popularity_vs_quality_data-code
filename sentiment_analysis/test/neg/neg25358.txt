I read all the reviews and most of them liked this item. I can live with the 10 second delay to start the video feeds , but after the delay in sending the notification of movement, that is too long. And when trying to review the video feed it takes more time to connect to the server. So by the time you have an idea of whats going on to sound the alarm, it would be late again.  Today the servers must be down again, 'cause I just can't seem to get connected. Just wanted to test the system again to make sure before I return it. I'm connected via ethernet cable on a TP-Link n600 router and an iphone 6.
