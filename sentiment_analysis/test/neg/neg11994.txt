Great concept of being able to monitor individual circuits, but this unit is damn near impossible to install safely given the size of the unit and the amount of wires.  I have a brand new 200 amp panel that was installed less than 5 months ago that's only 70% occupied and even then, I still couldn't find the room to locate the unit safely where it wasn't contacting live terminals in the empty slots.  The wires that came with the 100 amp CT's were too short since my power comes in through the bottom and the unit had to be located at the top of the panel.  So I had to splice in some wires to make them longer.  Then it becomes really difficult to install all the individual  CT's and route all the wires so they're out of the way.  It becomes a real rat's nest really quickly.  But the biggest pain is finding a space to mount the CURB unit itself inside the panel.  It's really big given where they expect you to locate it.I was able to get everything wired up and used their website to set everything up.  Everything seemed to work fine as I went around my house turning things on an off and watching the power numbers change.  So the unit seemed to work fine but the interface on both the website and iPhone leaves a lot to be desired.  It's not very refined at all and very clunky.  The way it presents the data isn't all that useful and the charts get really busy.  So one I got everything working I spent the next 2 hours trying to clean up the installation in the panel so I wouldn't be embarrassed if an electrician came by to service something.  It was just turning out to be way too much work and I still didn't like where the CURB unit was going to have to live.  This really needs to go in a subpanel of some type and the wires for all the CT's need to be MUCH longer to allow for that.  This whole idea of trying to get it installed in the main panel is a bad idea and probably not the safest.  Maybe it was just the design of my panel that made it so difficult, but like I said, it was a brand new 200 amp panel that was only 70% full.After spending several hours getting everything installed and checkout, I decided to rip it all out and return the unit.  I'm ordering a more compact unit from another vendor that only monitors the mains and solar lines.
