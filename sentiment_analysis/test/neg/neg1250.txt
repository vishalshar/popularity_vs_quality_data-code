38 days after I bought this on Amazon, it stopped responding to my double-taps. I unpaired and re-paired it to Bluetooth, but no luck. All the other features are working for now but at this time, I can not double tap and see a colored light response.:-( I am super bummed because I've read all the reports about how poor misfit's customer service is and of course since I got this from Amazon, I am just outside the returns window. If Amazon or misfit does not make this right, I will not repurchase.
