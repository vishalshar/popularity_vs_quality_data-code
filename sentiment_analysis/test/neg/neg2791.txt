BUYER BEWARE - I gave this product 1 star because it did not do what it was advertised to do and it's a hassle.I bought this gift having read the reviews and I thought, "maybe the poor reviews are just the people from the infomercials that can't handle life and all it's wonders". When I first got this gift I was very impressed by the packaging, (and most reviews will tell you this) but when I tried to sync the device to an iphone with the app, it wouldn't sync. I tried multiple times for about a half hour and decided this product was not worth the trouble; especially after reading many reviews saying it would unsync if you got too far away and I couldn't imagine having to sync this thing multiple times a day.If you want a cool looking bracelet this is probably the right thing for you. If you want a tracker that WORKS and is HASSLE-FREE this is NOT the right thing for you.
