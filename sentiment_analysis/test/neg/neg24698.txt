Product does not work well. Right out the box it was hit or miss whether it would actually log my vehicles position when parking. Started at 4/5 times success rate. But that's really not good enough if you're relying on it! Then it basically stopped working after 3 months. Battery wasn't dead, just would sync only 1/5 times. And eventually only when I manually pressed the button. Now after 4 months, the battery is dead too. I just threw it into the garbage.Not to mention, the app is lame. Would not have minded though if the hardware actually worked.
