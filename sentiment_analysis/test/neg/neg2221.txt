Worked for a year then failed.  Replaced by manufacturer with a refurbished unit that was DOA.  After three weeks of stupid suggestion from tech support, still getting runaround (our number now goes directly to voice mail and cannot speak to a rep). Ruined hundreds of dollars of plants.Total waste of time and money.
