I am sorry but it did not do nothing for my 3 dogs.  It seems one started barking and then they all start.  Only stopped when I commanded them to stop barking.  I can not have this when I am not home. This device did not phase them in the least. I have since surrendered one of the dogs to a rescue which I was needed to do regardless. Its much better now, although I really want to find something for my 4 lb. little dog who has a very high pitch voice.  Last resort is to get him debarked if my one neighbor complains further.
