We received this game as gift from Amazon along with started kit which works fine but coding game... I'm not sure if this is software issue or quality of this specific game but it doesn't recognize numbers for instance 3 many times is not recognized at all, directions are also buggy... Not sure if I'm the only one person having this issue but we are definitely returning it back to Amazon. See my video + picture attached. As you can see the number of steps is 3 but software selects 1 step and it happens many times.
