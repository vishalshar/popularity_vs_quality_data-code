First let me say that my dog loves it.  Now let me tell you why it got only two stars.  I gave it one star because it used deceptive advertising. I gave it one more star because my dog loves it.  Now it says the laser creates random patters- It doesn't.  It has one pattern- a circle. The circle turns into an oval when it's shining on the floor.  Now within this one pattern, the laser follows the oval and simply doubles back on itself in another set pattern that you'll notice after watching it for about a minute or two.  I don't like being deceived.
