We started using the ScoopFree one year ago. For the first 10 months, it was a dream- a single refill would last at least 14 days, sometimes more, for our 21 pound cat. Odors were contained even in our small apartment and with the litterbox in a poorly-ventilated room. Sure, the trays are pricey, but for eliminating the several-times-a-day scoopings, litter tracking, and cat smells, totally worth it to us. We ordered these 3-Packs on Amazon Subscription in order to save a little. I was a total ScoopFree evangelist- I would tell strangers in the cat litter aisle about it, I tried to convince my parents to buy one. I was completely sold.Beginning with our second-to-last order, the cartridges began to fail. Not just a little before their usual time-to-change date- sometimes as early as the first day we installed them. Nothing quite as delightful as walking in to the laundry room in the dark of morning and stepping in congealing cat urine. The entire box would be soaked through, with urine puddling around it. At first we thought, since the inside of the trays had seemed so waterproof in the past, perhaps the cat was peeing outside the box and the box was soaking it up from below. So we tried elaborate schemes to pee-proof the outside cardboard, including wrapping the bottom of the box in plastic and raising it slightly off the ground. No dice, the box would still be soaked through within days. We went through 8 cartridges in less than a month, six from this supplier and two we bought at PetSmart- and all failed. Not only was this rate of use financially unsustainable, it was a huge hassle, requiring us to take the soggy tray to the trash and clean up the urine puddles.Note, before they began failing in this spectacular way, they never failed even a little- not one refill I used before the this was even slightly damp on the outside when I went to change it. The plastic liner and waterproofing on the inside did their jobs admirably. But apparently if they fail even a little, they fail all the way.We tried all kinds of troubleshooting and the box itself seems to be working just fine, with a clean, smooth-operating rake. I can only assume something changed in the materials or manufacture of the refills. This is very disappointing, as I LOVED this product while it was working well, and I became accustomed to the "set it and forget it" ease of the system. But replacing a $20 tray AND cleaning up cat pee several times a week is an unreasonable tradeoff just to avoid scooping a few times a day. We've gone back to a normal litter box.
