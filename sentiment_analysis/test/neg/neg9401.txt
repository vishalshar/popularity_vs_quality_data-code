The XY3 works pretty well on its own. Mine beeps when I use my phone to tell it to beep. The range is pretty good- around 30 to 40 feet. But the company is making the app worse as time goes on. They just removed the ability from the iOS app to have it only use your location when you're using the app. So you either grant it full-time access to your location, or you grant it no access to your location. The catch is that it won't connect to the beacon unless you give the app location access.So the company has tried to herd its users into a box where they grant full-time location services access, thereby letting them drain your battery fairly quickly, all while not even truly running in the background. They apparently think this won't cost them their customers. I do think it will (and should) cost them their customers.
