Just like plenty of other customers have already reported - the altitude hold feature is defective, the quad will not keep altitude and keeps climbing when the throttle is in center position. Based on the number of reports, this appears to be a common flaw in this quad and I would stay away from this unit. Really unfortunate as I used to like Hubsan products.
