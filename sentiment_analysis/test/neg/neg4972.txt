Please note, this product has changed.  The original product was called Bare chocolate bliss crunchy coconut chips.  The ingredients were Coconut, Coconut Nectar, Unsweetened Chocolate.  Now, it is just called baked crunchy chocolate coconut chips and the ingredients are Coconuts, Cane Sugar, Organic unsweetened cocoa.  We originally liked this product based on the sweetener used and the flavor.  The new formula is much less delicate and in my family's opinion not as good as the original.  We had signed up for subscribe and save of this product with the old formula.  The when the new box and packaging arrived we did a blind taste test just to verify our original impression.  Needless to say we cancelled our subscription due to the unfortunate changes to this product.
