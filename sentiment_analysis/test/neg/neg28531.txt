The first thing I'd like it point out is that the Oco is NOT the Simplicam. The cameras look the same, but the software you end up with is very different. The Ivideon software that the Oco uses is inferior to Closeli, which Simplicam uses. Ivideon on Android is very buggy and slow.Another thing to point out is that although the product page says the camera is always recording, it is not always uploading the recordings. Recordings are uploaded 15 seconds before motion is detected until 15 seconds after motion is detected. This means that you're leaving the Oco to determine what "motion" is and it kind of sucks at that. I had to work with support to try and tune mine so that when my 90 pound dog walks into the room, it will detect her movement as "motion". Would I have to do that same for a burglar? Who knows!?!? This wasn't an issue with my Dropcam and my friend which a Simplicam says it's not an issue with that either.Too bad I realized all of this after the 30 day guarantee was up. I would have returned it had I known how bad this thing is. After the free year of recording is up, I'll go back to paying Dropcam $10/month for better recording and motion detection.
