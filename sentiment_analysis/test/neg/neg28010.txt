First, let me say I've been a loyal Rokform customer for years and will continue to be for two major reasons.  First, they have the magnetic case that no one else offers, brilliant.  Second, their customer service is second to none.  That being said, this case is something of a miss!  There's a major design flaw that I'll discuss later and it's the reason I have sent three of these cases to the landfill.We'll start with protection, it does a nice job,.  The construction of this case is hard plastic on the outside with a substantial rubber lining firmly glued on the inside so the case is one piece.  The rubber lining extend around the side and front to make a bumper and hold the phone securely.  A little too securely as youll see later. I would imagine this rubber lining gives good shock protection, but I really dont know that much about physics etc, seems nice.  Good protection all around, but you could get better from an Otterbox, so if thats your thing just be aware you could find a more sturdy case if youre willing to sacrifice look and feel.  Those two things are important to me and I dont drive nails with my phone so this case is great for me, five stars.Ok, heres the design flaw I mentioned earlier.  The mounting plate is interchangeable with a plate that doesnt have an opening, cool idea poorly executed.  Since this piece is removable it adds nothing to the structural integrity of the case which means that tiny little sliver of case between the camera hole and the edge of the hole where you swap out plates is all that holds the case together right there.  On every one of the 3 cases Ive gone through, this piece breaks the first time you remove the phone.  Since the phone fits in so tightly thanks to that rubber bumper you really have to contort the case to remove the phone, which you should do occasionally to clean out the dust and sand that gets in there and will scratch the phone.  When you contort the case, that little sliver under the camera hole cracks.  It doesnt fall out because of the rubber lining holding all the plastic bits together, but after continued use you start to get several cracks and broken pieces.  This is probably just a cosmetic issue, but if Im paying this much for a case, I want it to be well designed and in one piece!The other thing I really don't like about this case is the buttons are way too hard to push.  You kind of get used to it, but not really, bad design.  It's a real bummer that you spend this much on a new iPhone 6 and then lose all the touch and feel of the device.The good news is, Rokform agrees and stands by their warranty.  Each time Ive had a broken case, I just email them a pic of the break and they send me out a new case.  One time they were out of the white case, so they sent me a red one, then sent me a white one when it was back in stock!  Hence the reason Ill always be a Rokformcustomer.After 3 broken cases I wound up asking Rokform to replace my case with the iPhone 6 Slim Case - Mountable Clear which they were happy to do.  The iPhone 6 Slim Case - Mountable Clear does not have an interchangeable backing and the case is in great shape a few months in.Conclusion, Rokform is awesome, but go with the iPhone 6 Slim Case - Mountable Clear case!!!
