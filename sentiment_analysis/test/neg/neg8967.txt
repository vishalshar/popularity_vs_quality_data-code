Was easy enough to set up. The app has a few quirks and the system didn't want to recognize the sensors without a few minutes of playing with them but has worked fine thereafter. I'd have given the product 4 or 5 stars except for the annual fee. It's easy to not notice the fee in the Amazon description and it's not clear what exactly I'm getting for my money. Definitely will not bother to take the system with me next time I move.Update: Had a number of false alarms. After some searching, I contacted their customer support and the latest firmware was patched to me. It's weird that it couldn't be automatically patched or done through their app, but it worked and the false alarms stopped. Fast forward a couple weeks and I've noticed that the app is frequently unable to access their server and gives a "Server Maintenance" error. This means that you can't disarm your alarm and have to unplug it to make the beeping stop. It's annoying any time but is extra annoying when you have a sleeping baby with you.
