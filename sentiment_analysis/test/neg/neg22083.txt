First off the positives, band is attractive,light and comfortable. If it was just jewelry it would have gotten 4 stars. However as a fitness device it fails. The vibrations are incredibly weak, useless in fact. Set an alarm for 7:30am and slept right through it. Don't buy this if you want activity tracking and vibration notifications of calls. Also, it recorded no sleep data and I had 10 steps without even getting out of bed. I sent it back.
