I bought this as I'm on deployment thinking I could run it off my first gen kindle fire hd or even my new Asus Zenbook running Windows 10. Unfortunately it doesn't work on anything that utilizes an HDMI Type D port. I bought a couple of adapters thinking one might work but no such luck. I was however able to run it off a friends iPad that had the lightening to HDMI but that doesn't do anything for me. I was really excited about this purchase and would love for it to work but it doesn't seem like that is going to happen. If RIF6 has a solution to my problem I would be willing to try it out but if not, this little cube will just have to be returned.
