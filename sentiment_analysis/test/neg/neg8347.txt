I am having problems with my "Go" not tracking my steps correctly. It may track only 311 total steps for the day while my iPhone tracks 3,290.  I have  contacted Customer Service repeatedly without getting the problem resolved.  They are very slow in responding, returning my e- mails only once a day.  My Go has never worked correctly.  The sleep tracker works perfectly and I am very happy with that.  At this point I am becoming very frustrated!
