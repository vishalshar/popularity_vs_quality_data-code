These seemed like such a good product and for the first 3 week they were.I received this product and excitedly added them to my everyday trainers (sneakers) I quickly discovered that I had to use 2 Hickies to replace one lace (I put this down to me having large feet Size US 12) this meant that I could only put the Hickies on a single pair of shoes unlike I planned. And for the first 3 week they were great, I had one come undone as I was rushing to put them on but thanks to the design it was simple to tie back up.But then DISASTER STUCK one of them snapped, it was out of nowhere they had not had harsh weather or to much pull. So I replaced it with one of the spares that I received when they arrived, but sadly they have continued to fail one after the other. Its a shame as while the product lasted they where great. And I have constantly wondered if it was in something I had done. Sadly I will not be replacing as its cheaper to just go back to laces.Conclusion: Great conceptual product, To small for a male on the larger shoe size. And in my experience not built to last.
