Bought this for christmas and after following directions on the package nothing happened.  I consulted mycology forums where the members recommended de-chlorinating the tap water by letting it sit out overnight and then resoak the package.  Still nothing.  Tried a 3rd time, nothing.  Will contact the company and edit this review based on how they respond.
