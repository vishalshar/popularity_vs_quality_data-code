Requires expensive photo batteries and goes through those FAST.  Killed one mouse.  Replaced batteries after a couple of weeks.  Unit started to buzz.  Made sure there was nothing in the trap.  Flipped the power switch a few times, reseated the batteries and thebuzz stopped.  Checked the unit 3. Weeks later.  No mice and dead batteries.
