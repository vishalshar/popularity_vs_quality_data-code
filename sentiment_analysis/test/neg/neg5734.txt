The concept is great where it gives the audience the feeling of multiple cameras pointed on the subject at one given time, but the technology behind it is very disappointing. Very poor response to auto tracking feature, output is limited to 720p which is pretty much granulated and noisy on the subjects that are at least 10 feet away. I do facebook live streaming for my church every Sunday and before Mevo, I used to live stream via my iPhone. The video and sound quality conducted from the iPhone is very much superior to the Mevo camera. I was very excited about this camera, but very much disappointed with its performance. Hopefully they will improve this product with a 1080p output and better response to auto tracking.
