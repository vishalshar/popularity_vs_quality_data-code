My oldest grandson asked for this for two years, so I finally got it for him.  It is very cute and I think he will love it, but I tried it out and it doesn't respond well to the hand signals.  Sometimes it works right and sometimes it doesn't work at all.  The dance mode is adorable.  Maybe he will have more luck with it than I did.Update - he opened his present tonight, and it would not work straight out of the box.  It would turn on, but would not balance or follow any commands.  We will be returning this.  He was very disappointed, and so was I.
