Shipped with almost dead batteries!  I ordered two sets of three finders (6) and they started acting up within a few hours of setup.  Checked the batteries and all six were less than 3 volts!  Probably should have returned but I really wanted to try them out.  So, I went out and bought six new batteries.  They do seen to work well with new batteries and I would have given them four or five starts if they were delivered with good batteries!  Come on XY Find It ship your units with fresh batteries.
