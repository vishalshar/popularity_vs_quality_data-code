So I just received this kit today and it is nice and I think we will have lots of fun with it if it works. However, if you would like to make your own for about 1/4 of the price (or less) you can do it easily. It does take a bit more work and takes more time because you are inoculating the substrate on your own but it would be a fun experiment with the kids. I wish I would have thought about it before I bought it. Check out youtube and  search "Grow your own mushrooms easily" or something similar. All said, I like the idea of the product but wish I would have spent the money on something else.5/15/13 Update: this product didnt work and we never got mushrooms. Amazon and the seller were great and refunded my money.Too bad because this looked like a great idea and I see that it has worked for others.
