Nowhere in the description did I see it mentioned that this computer has an internal battery which cannot be removed by the user.Of course this completely prevents you from "carrying a spare battery" but there are bigger problems.First, in three years when the battery life has diminished to a trickle, you will be owner of a fine boat anchor.Second, In my experience, when a **major** crash occurs and the computer freezes and even CNTL-ALT-DEL will not work, the only thing that works is to remove all power from the computer.  Which is not possible with this computer since you cannot remove the battery.  I am NOT looking forward to the first such crash for this computer.I will update this review as I get more experience with the computer, but already I think we have a show stopper.UPDATE 6 JAN 2017So far, the computer's performance has been fine.  I added an extra 8 GB of memory and a spare 500 GB 7200 spin HD that I had laying around.  Installation was painless, except that you need to be sure to use a 7 mm thin hard disk drive (9.5 mm is standard but will not fit in the spare hard disk slot on this laptop).  For the types of games my daughter plays on it (stuff like Minecraft, Portal, CS:GO, Fallout New Vegas, etc.), it has been more than powerful enough.The screen has also been more than fine.  I think the ones who are complaining about that are professional developers. I do not believe that this computer is intended to be a professional game development or professional video production platform, and it is unrealistic to expect it to serve as one. I think if your profession is video producer, computer game developer, graphic artist, etc., then maybe you need to think about spending more than $900 on the most important tool for the job which puts a roof over your head.Finally, so far we have not experienced any crashes that we could not recover from without removing power.  But I still do not like having an internal battery which cannot be removed by the user.  I would not have purchased this computer if the description here had mentioned that, I would not purchase such a computer in the future, and thus the one star rating remains.However, if the lack of a user removable battery is not an issue for you, then I would give this computer 4 1/2 stars, marked down only by the somewhat less than ideal track pad and some minor fit-and-finish issues.
