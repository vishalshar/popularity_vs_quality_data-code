I bought it a month ago and I still have not heard it play.I sent it back because it would not play a CD and it sounded like marbles where loose in one of the speakers.When and if I ever get it back and I can turn it on...I would be  more than glad to give a comment.Until then I gave it a one star only because that was the least I could give.
