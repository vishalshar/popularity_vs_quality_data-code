At first I really liked this phone. About 4 months into use the battery stopped charging. I had to send in the phone for a replacement.It took 2 1/2 weeks for return of my repaired phone. Shortly after the gps stopped working properly and the gorilla glass shattered on a very low drop. I am hoping somebody from Posh Mobile or Amazon will read this review and make things right. Not real happy with my Posh Mobile experience!
