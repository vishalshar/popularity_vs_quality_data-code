Changing my very positive review.This siren initially worked.  However, exactly like my D-Link Water Heater Sensor, it completely failed when I had to make a change to my Wi-Fi system.A replacement of the water heater sensor worked.  Now I am facing a replacement of the Siren.These things are difficult to set up with the iOS/Android app and they DO FAIL.Even worse is D-LINK support.  It's horrible.  Their webpage to request a return authorization does not work.  Try emailing them and they don't respond.  Try faxing them and they don't respond.  This is a horrible company to deal with should your product not work.
