Probably like a lot of folks, I purchased this bag because I saw the owner of the company pitch it on "The Shark Tank" TV show. On Shark Tank, entrepreneurs pitch their business idea or product to a group of successful, wealthy investor/entrepreneurs and hope they will invest in their idea. If you saw the episode, you may recall (and if you didn't I'll tell you now) none of the sharks invested in the product. My wife and I couldn't believe it. What a cool looking bag!!  What a great design idea!  Those people had to be crazy!!Well, there was a reason they didn't invest their money.This is supposed to be an over-your-shoulder tactical bag that you can use as an Every Day Carry (EDC) bag. Wear it on your hip, swung to your back or around front for easy access and/or safety of your stuff.  Despite how awesome and well designed this bag appeared in the demo on Shark Tank, in person it was a very different story. When I received it, my gut reaction was not, "YESS!!!" (which I had hoped it would be). It was more like, "Really??"  The quality of the materials used was disappointing. The bag felt thin and lightweight, but not in a good way. It felt cheap and definitely not durable. The stitching looked to be poorly done and there were tons of loose threads that needed trimming.  And stylish?  "Ish" would certainly be the best descriptor. The front to back depth of the bag was very disappointing. It I could fit a couple of good paperbacks in there at best, and some random small accessories in the handful of external pockets and that would be it.The so-called phone pocket on the strap is tiny. I think it really is supposed to be a knife pocket for people hiking or camping, and the designer hoped it would do double duty.  It can only handle a little flip phone from the 90's--not the wide phablets and iPhones most people have today. There is a front pocket with a magnetic closure. Sounds like a good idea and it probably is if you don't put a phone in it.  I put my smartphone in it, since my LG G4 would not fit in the "phone pocket," but the magnet kept turning on my screen. NOT good. In general, the zippers on the additional pockets were not ergonomically positioned and were awkward to use.Overall, I hated the way the bag felt and how it hung on me. No matter which position I tried it in--over one shoulder, moved toward my back, swung to a front-carry position, with very little packed in it, with a lot packed inside--it felt flimsy, unbalanced and uncannily awkward. And it really didn't look good. Even my wife commented that it looked awkward and kind of cheap.  Considering the hefty $65+ price point, I felt ripped off and very disappointed. There is nothing about this bag that suggested I had purchased a premium product.  I returned it a couple of days later (I really gave it a shot to change my mind) and replaced it withÂ MOLI Tactical Outdoor Multifunction Sports Sling Pack Backpacks-28l-one Shoulder Backpack,nylon Fabric,waterproof Coating,adjustable Belt,many Inner Bags - Great for Outdoor War Game or Hiking, Camping Activities-Black. THAT bag is far superior and almost everything I hoped Man-Pack would be.I guess the Sharks really knew this was not a worthwhile investment. Man-PACK Classic--"For that reason, I'm out!"
