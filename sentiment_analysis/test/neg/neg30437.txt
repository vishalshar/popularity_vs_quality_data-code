I really wanted to like this. it looks fantastic in the photos. The specifications all sound good. The design is thin and clean, and the Lightning passthrough is terrific. The build quality, however, is atrociously poor. There is a small port cover over the top-located Lightning charging port. Mine broke off the very first time I used my short fingernails to pry it open. Poor construction, or poor design? Why not both! The phone slides into the case, and there is a top piece that snaps into place to enclose the case. This top piece does not fit all the way, I cannot get both sides to fit flush. Because of this, it comes off in my pocket almost every time I pull it out. Again, poor construction, or poorly designed? Why not both! Finally, the way you activate the case's charging ability is by holding the volume button. Doing anything with the case requires pressing the volume buttons. I cant help but thing it would have been easier to simply have a switch on the case... I get a little tired of turning my volume all the way up on the phone to charge the case. This is clearly a poor design. The materials the case is made out of show fingerprints and marks easily, and mine has already received a few knicks. There are several problems with this product, and I cannot recommend anyone purchase it. Like I said, I really wanted to like this, and I am extremely disappointed.Also, their Indiegogo campaign misrepresented the phone's specifications. It states "200%" more power. Maybe I am just being picky, but technically it is 100% more power giving you 200% of the original. They also advertise here that early Indiegogo backers get the phone for 50%. Apparently Amazon shoppers do, too! Good thing...
