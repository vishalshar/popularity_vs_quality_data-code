We brought these gummies because our daughter has problems with constipation and needs fibre in her daily vitamins. I had read a few reviews and wanted her to have something she will eat and like. I was excited for her to try these new ones. I was trying one as well as her. The first bite was good and tasted fine but after that they didn't taste good that all. My 3 year old spit hers in the trash and I felt like doing the same. Very disappointed in this product. looking for something new
