Seemed to work fine for a few months, until I just tried to take my case off and the top corner next to the front camera has cracked. Amazon says I can't return it, bummer. Probably won't buy another screen from them since it's obviously not very strong, cracking with just a little pressure as I pulled the front cover of my case off.
