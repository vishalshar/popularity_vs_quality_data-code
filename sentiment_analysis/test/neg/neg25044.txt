I received this for my birthday from my boyfriend. The product came scratched. Also, after watching the instructional video on how to put together the printer, I realised my pieces were already put together. Clearly, this has been an opened, used printer. The red error light was also on until I charged it for 2 hours, and inserted my phone. Only then it turned green, let me print out a picture, only to turn red again and an error message popped up on my phone. I needed to then reset the printer and the app on my phone. Printed out another photo and the light turned red again. I printed 4 pictures in total and all are of bad quality and have a white stripe at the end of the photos. I held the printer in every possible way to try and avoid the white strips but no luck. this product is a joke. I'll be getting a refund for sure. Don't buy this product.
