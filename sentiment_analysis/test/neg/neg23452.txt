Does not work after Wifi setting.I have tried FAQ and all of their supports for resetting, but still not work, just blinking 3 times.Even I request exchanging, but the replacement does not work on the same issue.I do not know why not, but I am using several Homekit products, and this product only annoyed me in setting.I returned it today ,again
