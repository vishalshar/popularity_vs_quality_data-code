I carefully reviewed this product before purchasing, and knew there was unclear testing regarding how well the filter performs.  Based on taste and observation, I would certainly say it is a valid concern, but it pales in comparison to the bigger issue, which is that this filter has a fatal flaw in regards to design that, in my opinion, will lead to it not being around for very long.  It is easy enough to separate the plastic top from the glass carafe after use, and to remove water from the carafe.  However, if this is all that you do, within 1-2 months, you will likely have a significant mold issue on your hands.  See the attached picture.  The filter housing, which does remain damp, does not have adequate circulation when not in use.  That means it won't dry adequately, and will likely attract mold quickly enough.  That leaves you with two options. One is to clean and dry the inside housing carefully between use, and the other is to keep it refrigerated and hope the cold environment retards mold enough to keep it from forming.  I remain suspicious whether either would be enough.  The filter itself doesn't seem as if it can be adequately dried.My next issue  is the filter itself.  I remain highly suspicious of how well this filter actually works.  I have had other water filters in the past, and currently use a Berkey filter.  It seems to be a general rule that gravity filters take some time to actually do their thing.  The water has to trickle through a charcoal or other medium a slow enough pace to adequate remove metals, chlorine, bacteria etc.  I certainly question a filter like this that appears to filter very quickly.  Too quickly.  About as fast as you pour the water in, it comes out the holes in the bottom of the filter.  Although I never took the time or money to do a water analysis on the finished product, based on taste, it did not do an adequate job.  Perhaps that is an unfair assessment, as I may be tasting something they never claimed to be able to filter out, such as chlorine.  But it only serves to back up my already existing suspicion.  They state that testing is currently being performed but insinuate that they are limited from publishing just how effective it really is,but I highly doubt that is the case.That brings me to support.  You will notice that there is no phone number to call for support.  I found one with some searching, and the recording states that no messages left will be returned, and directs to the website contact form.  I tried that, and two weeks later, no response.  And if you look at the warranty policy, the only acceptable conditions for a return, based on Soma's website, are that it has to be within 30 days of purchase, and it has to be unopened.  That protects you from an incorrect order, but does not offer any protection if anything at all is wrong with the product.  It certainly doesn't allow for a return based on a mold problem.Based on these factors:  mold, inadequate customer support, poor return policy, and insufficient filtering, I would caution anyone from purchasing this product.
