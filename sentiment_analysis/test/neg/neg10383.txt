Disappointing!  My son's therapist recommended this toy because he loves to play with the felt story boards in her office.  We ordered the bright & beautiful Marine Rescue Center... got it home, took it out of the box, tried to build the structure pictured...no luck!  The magnets are so weak on this thing that one little tap and the whole thing comes crashing down...and that was with an adult who was trying to be careful.  No way this thing stands erect as a toddle is playing with it.  After about 20 mins of trying to just get it to stay together, my son looks at me said "I don't like this, you should take it back."  And my husband said "how much did we pay for that?"  Exactly....It's junk ... definitely not worth the $50 price tag ... on it's way back to the show room!
