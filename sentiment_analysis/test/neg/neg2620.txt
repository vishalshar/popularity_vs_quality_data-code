The idea for this product is great, but the product itself isn't terribly useful.  I started to suspect that it the measurements were not accurate when I started to see significant swings in the readings, especially for CO2 and VOC, with no significant changes in my home environment.  I ended up buying a professional CO2 monitor to compare the readings against, and they were way off.  The CO2 monitor gave me consistent, and reasonable, readings, while the Foobot varied widely.  Customer support recommended that I reset the device and move it, which worked for a few days before becoming unreliable again, showing CO2 levels way north of 2300ppm in an old, drafty house with windows open vs. around 450ppm for the CO2 monitor.  When I followed up with customer support, they told me there is no way that the Foobot would be off, regardless of the evidence to the contrary.  They also insisted that the wide variations from week to week, with one week normal and the next week really high, must be due to a change in environment.  I've given up on the product - hopefully someone will come out with something similar that actually works.
