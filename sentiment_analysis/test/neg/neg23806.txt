I love the colors.I hate how flimsy they are. Not even as thick as a cheap picture. My autistic 1 year and 10 months son will not play or work with them alone, but he is still a baby and can ruin a "card" in half a second. Not worth the money... For 125 $ you would expect hard cardboard or even plastic/laminated cards.
