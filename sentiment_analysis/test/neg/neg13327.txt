I have the FLIR One, the first generation, and did not like having to slip the camera on to the iPhone - it meant taking off the Mophie case and it was hard to get out of the inner sleeve.  It was cumbersome and had to be charged since it has its own battery.  I bought the Seek XR because it was compact and plugged into the iPhone's port.  However, it is an incredible disappointment.The basic flaw is that it does not allow you to simultaneously take a regular photo and a thermal photo.  This might not seem important, but keep in mind that objects the same temperature, such as all inert objects in a room that are not exposed to any source of heat or cold, will look the same.  In the visible light, you would see all the zombies in a room.  The thermal camera would see none of the zombies since they are all dead and presumably room temperature.A richly packed book case will be a blank wall.  Let's say there was a mouse behind the books.  You might see it if its heat comes through the insulative properties of the books, but you would not be able to locate it because all you would see it in a fog of books all the same temperature.  However, if you could see the normal photo and the thermal photo, one on top the other, you'd be able to locate the mouse by seeing what books it's behind.I worried about this initially since the Seek visibly has only one camera, but the Thermal+ feature seemed to address this.  However, one has to manually align the images, which is a pain and not easy to do, and then it does not fuse the images, but provides you with two separate images, which you compare side by side. Consider the photos I attached the half thermal/normal is the Seek Thermal+ mode and the two separate photos it can record.  The two others are from the first generation FLIR One (which had to attach to an iPhone 5).  Note two things.  First, at the same distance, the Seek image is much closer - great if that is what you want, but I find it is too large.  The wider  image is of the subject at the same distance, but taken with the FLIR One.  The Seek normal image is taken with the iPhone's camera, but with a digital zoom to match the Seek.  Further, even at the staggeringly lower resolution of 80x60 because it fuses thermal and visible light, you really feel you know what it is you are looking at.  The new FLIR one is 120 x 160, but I don't have one.  Still, the Seek boasts 206 x 156, which seems worth it for the higher resolution, but I'm not seeing the gain in resolution over 80x60, though perhaps it is because I am being fooled by the fusion.  The main thing is the FLIR One has two cameras.I'm a researcher who does thermal imaging in the field with serious instruments, including a drone-mounted thermal imager, but I like having one on my phone to explain to kids, students, the public, and just for goofing off (where are those cats in the dark room?).  But comparing visible with thermal is really important.  Imagine it is not a mouse behind the books, but a hot electrical wire or a leaking pipe - locating them in real time would be ok, but recording what you "see" would be very limited.  The new FLIR One isn't out yet, but it also has two cameras and is priced lower than the Seek.I hope this review helps.  The main point is one needs to see both the visible and the thermal and Seek does not do a good job of this which seriously limits the camera's utility and its fun.  I'm sorry I bought it, but my fault.  It's an innovative and novel device, just limited in its utility.
