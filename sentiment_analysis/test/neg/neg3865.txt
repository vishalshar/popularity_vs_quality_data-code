TERRIBLE execution of stated promises. Purchased two of these bags and travelled to Hawaii. Tested the location feature and the app said our bags were on a different island than we were on. Contacted customer service and was given ZERO help whatsoever. So if you are buying this bag with the intent to use the features that come with it, you are going to waste your money.
