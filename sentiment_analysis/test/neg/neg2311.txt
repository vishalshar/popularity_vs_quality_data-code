Once correctly configured, if you sit with good posture the whole thing will stay in place, if you slouch; it slips off. That's a fine reminder if that's what you were looking for, but it does nothing to correct or proactively promote sitting with good posture.  In addition, it's pretty cumbersome. I returned it.
