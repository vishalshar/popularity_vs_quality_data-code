Let's get right to it. Do not buy it this! Let's not talk about the wait time, let's talk about the actual problems. It's does not hold pressure, it leaks. I've disassembled it and reassembled it snuggling everything up tight. Bad seal design, not to mention they put super glue on this to try and fix it. All the "brass " is scuffed and miscolored, not polished at all. It's not even all brass for the tap section, curved piece us just chrome plated on the outside. The insulated double layer body has bends in it with stuff in between the two layers. You can hear it when you shake it. The pressure regulator is alright, and the handle is the only thing going for this product.
