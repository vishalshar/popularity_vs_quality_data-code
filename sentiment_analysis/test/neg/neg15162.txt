It is! It is! (This is useless!)Although the attached AC adapter has 2.0 A output, only the attached cable can flow less than 0.5 A!This makes no sense! The included cable is defective.(The cable attached to SMART HOME KIT was also defective as well)I live in Japan and can speak only Japanese. I raised a problem about cables to littleBit and it is very troublesome to exchange it with good products. Since there was no choice, I had to buy a USB voltage/current measuring device and an Anker PowerLine+ Micro USB cable. sad. . .
