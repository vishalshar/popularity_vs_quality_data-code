Didn't work for me. I bought two because I went to a shared birthday party and I thought why not give the same card to both of them just in case the bad review that I read happens to me where it dies fast.The first one started and the song was so quiet. When he pushed on the button which was supposed to get louder and louder and NOT turn off, turned off and didn't turn back on.The second one started and was also quiet. She pushed the button to make it louder and it got a little louder and then turned off also.It was such a let down because the idea is so funny, but nope. The stars didn't align for me. :(
