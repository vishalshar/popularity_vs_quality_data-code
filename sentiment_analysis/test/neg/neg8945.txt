I loved it when it first arrived....  cosmetically better than most trackers, easy to set up.The reviews are true, it pops out relatively easily.  I temporarily lost it several times and had to go back searching... in the house while doing light chores, on a run, walking on the beach (that gold color matches the sand really well).Just over a month in however (as soon as I could no longer return it) it stopped recognizing my activity and stopped syncing with my device.  It buzzes repetitively but no longer functions as an activity tracker. I was optimistic but ultimately disappointed.
