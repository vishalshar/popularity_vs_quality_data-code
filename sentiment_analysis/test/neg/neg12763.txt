Terribly poor equipment. Yes it will give you everything they advertise, well hopefully someday as advertised but I know I did not go from 20% body-fat to 9% overnight and stay there. That is my goal but not fact. Two weeks later I am still waiting for the pulse tech to work.Buy a cheaper one and forget the weather report which is the most accurate reading on the damn thing.
