Great at first...pump suddenly stopped working after 4 months...cleaned it regularly with a vinegar solution...tried pipe cleaners and forced air to dislodge any clogs...nothing worked and the company was totally unresponsive...very disappointing purchase and the 1 year warranty appears to be a ruse.
