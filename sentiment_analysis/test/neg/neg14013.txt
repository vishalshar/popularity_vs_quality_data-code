I thought my son and husband would love these...turns out the sound has to come from the iphone...so unless you plan to put your phone in your kids pocket while he plays with his friends...this is all but useless as an actual toy.  Simple amusement for adults perhaps...it did have a lot of sound options but they didn't really change based on your movements to very much.  All in all, the reliance of being close to the phone to make the sounds made it annoying more than fun.  It needs it's own built in speaker.
