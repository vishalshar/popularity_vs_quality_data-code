It helped with morning sickness in my first trimester, but isn't worth the price. It doesn't taste great and if you let them sit (unopened and still wrapped) for longer than a month after purchasing they are so rock hard they are practically inedible. There are more afforable options out there that get the job done. I won't be ordering these again.
