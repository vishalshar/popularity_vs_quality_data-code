I bought some. . I still have it. .  dated "Use before August 2015".  Well, today is May 11, 2015, and the stuff is all ruined.  I could tell by feeling the package.  But I opened one of them anyhow, and sure enough, it's already 'cured'.Still stinks, too.This really aggravates me. .Totally threw my money away.
