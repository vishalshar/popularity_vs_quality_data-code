Bought Two Leeo, one for each level of my home. One Leeo, out of the box stuck on 77Â° temp reading and 45% humidity and would NOT function with my Security System 2014 Z-Wave linked Smoke Detector, nor with the Carbon Monoxide detector. It would NOT work with my brand new 2nd Generation Nest Protect Smoke/Carbon Monoxide detector! It was basically a $50 night light. The Second Leeo "Seemed" to work until I tested it.. It Failed to alert and failed to indicate any Alarm test about 75% of the time! (Only worked correctly 25% of the time) the Leeo units were both within 10 feet of the detectors and Still Failed! Tried resetting, deleting phone App, changing phones, NOTHING worked. Contacted Leeo customer service (both phone number and email) got NO answer and No help. Five days After I'd returned them both to Amazon, customer service finally called. Amazon is Amazing and refunded everything.  Leeo is NOT a company I would ever do business with again! I mean come on.. This device is designed to save lives... One Leeo 100% Failure, Second Leeo 75% Failure.. I'm NOT betting my families lives on those terrible odds!
