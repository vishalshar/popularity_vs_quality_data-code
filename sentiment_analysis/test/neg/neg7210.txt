The tray "trap" is not wide enough to cover the size of the tray leaving two holes on either side for foul air to escape. Changing from the disposable trays to this increased smell significantly and I had to change the tray about at about 20-30 sweeps instead of 70-80. This basically made the cost effectiveness of this product disappeared and stunk up my house. This product needs to be re-engineered. Item returned.
