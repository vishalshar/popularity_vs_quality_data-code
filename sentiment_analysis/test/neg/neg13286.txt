Don't waste your money on this product.  The band is designed so that if something catches it, it flips over and the tracker falls out.  Even if you're extremely careful, sooner or later you'll be in a rush somewhere, this will happen and you won't realize it until too late.  It can be caused by anything - catching on clothes, the strap of a bag, etc.  You'll be lucky if you own this for 6 months before you lose it.  This happened even though I was wearing the device securely and according to the instructions provided by Moov.  Look online and you'll see that it happens very frequently.
