My 11 year old daughter purchased this kit for her father as a Christmas present.  He loves to pick mushrooms in the wild so she thought this would be the perfect gift!  It was a huge disappointment!  He followed the directions exactly and no mushrooms resulted!  I called the company for a new kit and my call was never returned.  Buyer beware!!!
