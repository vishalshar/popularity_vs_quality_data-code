If I could return this I would, unfortunately I missed the return window, but this consistently had problems failing to connect with my vehicle and my iPhone 6. Their support team keeps telling me a workaround strategy, but who wants to go through the hassle of cycling through the Bluetooth, and waiting to get a connection before driving. It would be great in practice if this just connected reliably and with minimal effort. Tragically that's not the case and if I could return this I would.
