This product promised to be the best solution for wireless presentations. Well it fails to provide a consistent connection. I contacted support to troubleshoot, email is the only option or at least phone support is not available on the site or offered via email. I was promised a fix with in a week for the bug but it actually took 3 weeks to come out with a beta that didnt fix the constant disconnects from the wireless. This is not a device for the enterprise environment.I would not recommend it. Not having phone support is a deal breaker. A lot of wasted time via email. It is not cheap so I was expecting better. I just wasted $300 as the return window expired and the manufacturer wont refund the money because I didnt buy direct. In the end they got the money from the reseller but the customer got jacked.
