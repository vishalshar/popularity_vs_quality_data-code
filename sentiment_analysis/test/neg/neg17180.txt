I couldn't find any reviews comparing the speakers I was interested in, reviewing the features I cared about...so here it is!I was looking for a speaker to be 'portable' (size and battery life, more on this later), rugged (or at least replaceable), and loud enough to fill a reasonable outdoor area with sound without distorting.I compared:- Logitech UE Boom, $180, 2100mah battery http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CM0XHNS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1- Braven BRV 855s $234, 8800mah battery, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DP3QE90/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0- Fugoo Tough, $230, 4400mah battery, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IBJ3OBO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0- Sharkk Mobile Boombox, $64, 4400 mah battery, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ES2BQ7M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1RUGGED:The UE Boom, BRV855s, and Fugoo are all plenty ruggedized. I could buy 4 Sharkk's for the price of 1 Fugoo, so it's replaceable enough for me to not mind that it's not rugged. Everyone scores even!COST:The Sharkk is litterally 1/4th the cost of the BRV 855s and the Fugoo, 1/3rd the cost of the Boom.  Sharkk wins for price/value by a mile.SIZE:The BRV855s is much larger than the other 3.  The UE Boom, Fugoo, and Sharkk are all about the same size, while the round soda can shape of the Boom makes it more portable and versatile, I feel like.  The D-ring on top is nice, I could clip it to my pack or something.  UE Boom wins for size.https://www.dropbox.com/s/6ihz2t88hs18uxf/2014-12-20%2013.27.49.jpg?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/cj7x23w8zcpkr3w/2014-12-20%2013.28.31.jpg?dl=0BATTERY:The UE Boom claims 15hr battery life, but that doesn't seem likely given the tiny (by comparison) battery.  I hear reports of less than 4 hours on a full charge.  The Fugoo and Sharkk have a 4400mah, while the Braven rocks 8800mah and a 3A charging port to top off your phone. Braven wins for battery by a lot. A side note, only the Braven requires a proprietary DC adapter to charge, the other 3 can charge from standard USB.LOUDNESS:Here's where it gets good, this is really what I cared about.  I want to fill up an outdoor area, and get people moving!  To compare, I cranked all the speakers to 100% and switched them back and forth on the same track.  The Fugoo Tough was sorely disappointing.  I updated the firmware and started it in 'loudness' mode, and even then it was by FAR the quietest, and had by FAR the most distortion. Yuck.  The Sharkk sounded much better (still a little distortion, but not bad), and got much louder as well. Not quite as loud as I'd really like, but very loud.  The UE Boom got a little bit louder than the Sharkk (it was noticeable, but not huge), while distorting less.  The Braven blew them all away! WAY louder, very minimal distortion, and then putting it into DTS mode seems to make the speaker really project the sound even further.  VERY impressed with the Braven, this thing gets LOUD.SOUND QUALITY:The Fugoo is pretty much disqualified from this category due to all the distortion at max volume.  That said, it sounds reasonably well balanced until it begins to distort.  The UE Boom seems to lack mids, and completely lack bass on some more bass-heavy songs.  It's helped by the EQ in the UE Boom app, but not a ton. The Sharkk sounds surprisingly good!  A bit tinny, but plenty of bass, present mids, good clarity.  The Braven blows them all away again!  Bass is punchy and extends low and tight, sound is balanced, mids are present, highs are crisp and not sibilant...shocking how good this thing sounds!  DTS mode kicks it up another notch by offering a surprising amount of soundstage from a couple speakers placed inches away from each other. Braven wins hands down again!NOTES ON 'DOUBLE-UP':The UE Boom and the Braven 855s allow you to pair two of the same speakers together for a L/R stereo pair (yes, this would be $360 for a pair of UE Booms and $470 for the pair of Bravens...a ton of $$).  I have used two UE Booms in double up mode extensively - DO NOT BOTHER BUYING TWO UE BOOMS.  There is a serious bug with the Boom that causes audio to speed up and drop out when paired in double-up: http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Logitech-UE/UE-Boom-audio-drops-out-every-few-seconds-while-in-Double-Up/m-p/1333545/highlight/falseWith how much sound one Braven puts out, the idea of having two working as a stereo pair is really exciting...but also really expensive.CONCLUSION:I'm keeping the Braven!  This thing gets significantly louder, sounds better, and has more battery life than the other units, while being able to charge my phone.  It is larger, and requires a proprietary adapter to charge, so it gets docked a couple points for that.If the size is hard to stomach and you don't need quite as much sound, the UE Boom would be a good choice if you can deal with the shorter battery life.  The fact that you can charge it from any USB should help with that. It's got a good shape, the d-ring is handy, it sounds pretty good, and gets nice and loud too!If you simply want to be amazed at how much quality you can get for $65, get the Sharkk!  This thing is surprising at every turn.  Plenty loud for most people (any indoor setting, etc), good battery life, small enough to tote around, and CHEAP!  If you're worried about damaging it in the rain or something, buy two!I really wanted to like the Fugoo Tough.  It's easily the most rugged of the speakers, and seems really well designed, with all sorts of cool accessories to clip it to bikes and poles and things.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't sound good at the volume levels I need, and so I can't recommend it. Also, the voice prompt dude is REALLY annoying. 2 stars, it's not usable as a speaker for me despite how much I wanted to like it.
