I loved this Shine until it totally stopped syncing on day 31.  The Misfit website had trouble shooting information, but that did not work. I emailed customer service and was told to complete additional troubleshooting.  When I emailed customer service with my results, I received the following notification, " I noticed that you are trying to link your Shine with a Samsung Note 4 running Android v5.1. This is a known problem due to unstable Bluetooth connection when upgrading to Android v5.1. Our technical team is working hard to regularly release update to enhance the syncing performance."  There was no offer to replace it and of course I am now outside of the Amazon return window.
