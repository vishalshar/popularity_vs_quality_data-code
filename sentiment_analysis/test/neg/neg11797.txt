Being a Child Passenger Safety Technician Instructor working with Law Enforcement and Fire Rescue personnel all over the Country for 30 plus years, I was very interested to see this product as I love to see new innovations in the field of child passenger safety. The quality of the Mifold was fine and the claims were impressive, but it I feel it stopped there.  I tried five different kids of varying ages on the Mifold. The belt fit was ok", a little too low on the thighs in my opinion, but certainly not up on the abdomen.  Before we had even left the driveway, the kids had moved forward on the seat to fold their legs over the edge so I had to take them out of it.In a real world setting, a child does not behave like a crash test dummy and when they have no BOOST, which this seat lacks, the child slides forward on the seat to get comfortable.  In order for a child to be able to fold their legs over the vehicle seat, they will slide forward, leaving a gap behind them, which in turn loosens the seatbelt. This is exactly what an actual booster seat should be designed to prevent. Booster seats are designed to position the seatbelt AND to boost the child up to prevent the child from slouching or sliding forward on the vehicle seat. The Mifold seems to only address the belt positioning.I am not happy with the product and definitely not convinced of the safety and will return it.
