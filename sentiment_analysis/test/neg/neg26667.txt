I held off writing a review on these for a while, hoping that the experience would improve.  I really, really wanted these to do what they claim they do.  These would be awesome if they actually worked.  Unfortunately, it's actually more convenient to use regular, non-smart bulbs.  My major issues with the product:- Occupancy detection is more trouble than it's worth.  You have to get way too close to the bulbs for it to pick up motion.  They won't turn on just by walking into the room, you need to get right under the bulb and move around.  Also, if you're sitting still in a room, say reading or watching TV, you have to remember to go into the app and turn off occupancy detection or jump up and down under a bulb every few minutes or the lights will go out.- Since occupancy detection doesn't work, the only way to avoid having to go into the app all the time to control your lights is scheduling.  Unfortunately, this feature randomly doesn't work at all.  For instance, I have my lights scheduled to be off during the day when I'm at work.  About half the time I'll get home from work and the lights will be on.  The app tells me that they're off and that the schedule is running, but it's not.  I did figure out that if you have two schedules back to back with no time in between, the second schedule will never work.  But even accounting for that, scheduling is unpredictable at best.  Right now (about 8 pm) my app tells me that the lights in the bedroom are off because a schedule is running, but there is no schedule set up for this time, which I can confirm in the app.- Ambient light detection seems backwards to me.  My living room gets a lot of natural light during the day, there's no reason for the lights to be on, but unless I manually turn them off the Stack lights will run at 100% in the brightly lit room.  It seems to me that they should realize that if the room is already bright they should turn themselves off instead of trying to outshine the light that's already there.- At least a couple of times a week I am either unable to turn on my lights or unable to turn them off until I go unplug the hub and plug it back in, then wait for it to restart.  That's pretty annoying when it happens when I first wake up in the morning or when I'm trying to go to sleep.- Very often the app will say one thing when the lights are doing something completely different, like telling me the lights are off when they're not or vice versa.  Most of the time changing the light settings will sync the app and lights again.  Sometimes I have to reset the hub.I'm really disappointed because if these bulbs worked like they claimed to work they would be the best thing ever.  As it is, I have to spend way to much time manually managing my lighting and dealing with unpredictable behavior.  Notice how many times manual management is needed in the points above.  It's honestly easier to just use light switches and dumb bulbs.
