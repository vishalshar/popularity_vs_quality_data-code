I'd purchased these originally from the local supermarket, and my dog loved them. I could not find them in the store anymore and searched high and low before finding them on Amazon.  I purchased what I thought to be the exact same product only to find that this particular 'batch' wound up making her so sick after just two small pieces that I wound up having to toss the entire bag right out in the garbage while contacting the vet because she could barely walk from excessive vomiting. I would absolutely never repurchase this product.
