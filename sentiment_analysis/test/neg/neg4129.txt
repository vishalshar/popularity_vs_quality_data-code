Returned after a week. Followed all the instructions, killed a mouse the 2nd night, so was happy. Since then, I put the bait (peanut butter) all the was into the back of the chamber as instructed, not one kill for 10 days. Also light blinks on sometimes signaling a catch, theres nothing there.Extremely difficult to clean the inside to put fresh bait, because you cannot open other side.Just get mouse bait stations. You wont catch mice but they will take the poisonous food back and die.Also cant get wet; My mice hover around the back of the garden by the pool machine, the neighbors sprinkles spray this every night i have to put some cover on it or move it where I dont want it. Disappointed. Some days the peanut butter bait is gone (fairly deep into the thing) but no catch! Sometimes light blinks like it caught something only to see bait is there, or gone, but no mouse.
