I bought this to repair two cords which had split and frayed near the connectors. I applied it according to directions, and at first it seemed to work quite well. I waited the full cure time before using the cords and the product seemed flexible and perfect. But within three days of use, both cords were split and broken right through the Sugru. Very disappointing. I should have just bought new cords to begin with.
