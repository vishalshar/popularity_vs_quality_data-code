My first review that included 3 pages of reviews with the company was taken down by Amazon.  I do not agree but thats life.  I will make this short and sweet.  Please look at my past reviews, I only review when it is very important.I received the package it showed it was a scooter on the package.  I am very lucky it did not get stolen.  Upon opening the package the cardboard padding was not in the right place.The front brake disk was bent.The front disk break calipers were so tight that the front wheel would not move.The rear break was so tight that the rear wheel would not move freely.The shrink wrap on the electrical by the exhaust was loose and not covering the wrings.The air filter had no locktight and came off on my first ride.  When I went back for it it was stolen.  (I live in Puerto Rico)When the motor would get to full temp it would not want to start unless it would cool down completely.I can not make it up the hills in area code 00913.  When I try the clutch slips and burns, I can only go as fast as a slow walk.  I expect the clutch springs are out of spec.After using 10 pounds of propane the motor runs slower.The frame is very heavy compared to a Goped.My steering came loose when I hut a bump making the wheel turn 20 degrees to the right.  I crashed.  It is now very loose and I have been forced to buy two very large 1"+ sized wrenches to attempt to fix it.  In San Juan it cost me $29 a piece!The none of the bolts have locktight or nylon fittings.  The vibrations from the motor shook them loose.  I was forced to replace the missing screws and buy locktight.  That cost me about $24.The rear wheel's disk break was put on in a manner that it covered the valve stem.  A few hours of work I reattached the disk break moving it clockwise exposing the valve stem.The front wheels break would align correctly after 1.5 hours of work.  TIP ***Finally I was forced to take two soda can tabs to use as a spacer to make the front wheel spin freely.The throttle and the front and back break levers were not tight enough and moved around.  Also the bolts on the handle bars are not stainless because the are already rusted.  I keep this ProGo in my apartment not outside.After 4 oil changes the oil is very black very quickly.  That is not a major deal, my issue is that it randomly leaks oil.  I have been cleaning up oil every week in my living room.  I am trying to find where it is coming from.  If anyone know how to fix this please let me know.  I don't want to get oil in the trunk of my friends cars.  I keep the oil at the lowest approved level.  That has helped but it has not stopped the problem.I weigh 154 pounds when I hit a bump the front disk violently hits the road jarring me, bending, nicking the disk.  Then the nick removes some of the precious little break pad I have left.The placement of the propane makes no sense.  I can not ride two people on it and I can not put all my wait in the back which is needed for potholes.The take down knob gets so tight you need a tool.Inside of the handlebars were very rusty, but I don't think it matters.Things I did not know.The disk calipers only move on one side.  When you press on the handlebars only the left side move to grip the disk.There are no rubber or urethane bushing/gaskets/washers used on the deck.  Now when I stop the metal deck rattles really loud, like a old car.  It is a bit embarrassing.Good things.It is a good price.The motor seems to be of good quality.The tires have good traction.I love that it runs on clean burning propane.I love that is was quiet and is a four stroke.No gas smell.Starts every time when the engine is cold.I called Amazon for help.  They were great.  They said "just mail it back we will pay for return shipping"  I told them that this is a new start up and I would like to try to work with them because the shipping back and forth would be over $100 and I don't mind trying to fix it my self.I called ProGo with the number Amazon gave me.  Busy for two days, no voicemail.  I sent an email.  8 days later I sent another email asking them to CALL me.  I got an email in reply.  I was told by the guy "I am dealing with some family issues".  He promised to mail me everything and said I can attempt to fix the issues and it will not void my warranty.  I asked him for that in the email, never got it.I had to email him about what parts he told me I needed before he would mail them out.  I did that the same day AND I sent pictures.  No parts arrive the next week.  He sent me an email saying he needed pictures before he could mail out the parts.  I told him I sent pictures in the last email and you said you were sending the parts 2 weeks ago on the phone.28 days after getting my scooter I said I am forced to returned this because it is almost 30 days.  He tell me the parts are in the mail.It really felt like he just strung me along for 30 days on purpose.  The replacement parts did not fix the breaks.  Out of the first 30 days I owned my progo I rode it for the first 5 days before it broke.If you call ProGo and the guy has a thick north East accent and attempts to intimidate you on the phone you know you were talking to the same guy.  I posted our emails in the first review that Amazon took down.  So I will not do that this time, but I do have them if ProGo states I am not telling the truth.I saved ProGo $100+ by not exchanging it expecting that they would be thankful and be more helpful.  As a small business owner I get new ventures are hard.  The sad thing is I ended up paying the $100+.  As a result this review should be for a ProGo that cost me $504 not $404 plus the cost of taxis for the 3 weeks I was waiting for parts.If you get a ProGo for $400 with none of the issues I had you will be happy with it as long as you are planning on using it FLAT ground.  You also need some handy skills.  You get what you pay for.
