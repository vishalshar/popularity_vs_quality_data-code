this is a very attractive pitcher and i wanted to love it. the top of the container would stick a lot making pouring water very messy since water would go everywhere. the main problem was after about 4 months the pitcher developed black mold on the filer part of the water pitcher. it was visible from the outside and the first time i was able to get the mold off but it kept growing back. very unappetizing for a water filter. i am going to order another brita today.
