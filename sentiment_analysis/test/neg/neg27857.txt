Why do I keep blindly hoping these things will work? Just like every other similar product, the motor is weak to the point of being useless, and unlike other products it doesn't even have a sand papery texture. It's just covered in plastic bumps.Also it needs to be adhered to the bottom of the shower but as there is no indication I'll be able to remove it without causing damage, I instead opted for the suggested alternative of setting it on a towel and using it seated, outside the shower.It did nothing. I don't mean it didn't perform perfectly, either. It literally had no effect whatsoever. It's also very challenging to stand on one foot, holding your foot at the right angle without placing any pressure on the device (even light pressure stops it... They call this a safety feature in the booklet, which makes sense, except  the ridiculously light touch you need to use seems more like an excuse to explain away the weak motor) for extended periods of time.
