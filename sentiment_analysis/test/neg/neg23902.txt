I was really looking forward to making use of this product. When I finally got it and put it into my Macbook (Macbook Pro 13" Retina Display), it didn't work. I tried with both a 64 and 200 gigabyte micro-SD card. It didn't work both times even though both micro-SD cards were compatible and not faulty. Overall, this product disappointed me but I think mine was just faulty. Once I get a replacment, I will be sure to update my review.
