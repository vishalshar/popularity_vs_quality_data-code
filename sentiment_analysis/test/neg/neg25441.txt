Technically, it does what it says it does. It plays sound. Except when it spontaneously powers down, in which case it makes no sound whatsoever. Sometimes the sound is a hideous pop, like when I pause my dvr, or it's only four channels, when the base speaker four feet from the center speaker mysteriously drops. I'd had enough, and I moved on. I only wish I'd saved the boxes; don't make the same mistake.
