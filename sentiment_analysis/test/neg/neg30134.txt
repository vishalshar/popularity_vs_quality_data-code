I really wanted to like this yet had a feeling I would not. Not because of anything to do with the product but because I just recently found out what a vine reviewer is. I skimmed the article and still dont know much aside from the fact that there is benefit in it for them and they are top reviewers yadda yadda you probably all already know.Why I don't like this product:The magnet is weak and does not stick on my ipad air or any of my cases in any realistically feeble manner whatsoever. I would bold whatsoever if I could. If you rotate your ipad at the normal speed you usually would to switch orientations the pencil is going flying. This happened to me once or twice before I completley gave up on the magnet. Maybe its a minor thing but aesthetics and feel are a huge reason why I wanted this stylus. That was a big part of that for me. Lol.If you think your writing, journaling, note-taking, or anything else along those lines you are wrong. The tip wears out SO fast - but even when its on its so big and clunky and difficult to right with.The only I will say is the palm rejection is AWESOME on NOTESHELF. I dont really use paper much because I just doodle but I do not see how if I found myself so frustrated with this stylus a serious artist wouldn't.Also it is extremely fragile. I was using the back end to enter a text via the touchscreen keyboard. I was in a hurry sure but I was not tapping any harder then I ever would with my finger. The eraser jammed into the back and now only works half the time.Seriously I really would suggest not getting this. I was stuck between this and the adoint type one which is just as bad if not worse because what if you dont want a damn screen protector? The adoit I got SCRATCHES your ipad, and is terrible to write with with a screen saver.Summary:I dont write reviews often as you can see and with good reason. Its just that I was looking at this thing i got like 2 weeks ago for 74 bucks and it just kind of sucks. You CANNOT have a screensaver with this and you CANNOT not have one with the adjoint or whatever so both suck and have done me no good. Dunno what to try next or if I should just use the cheap ones and forget it. (It being like a serious bada** stylus that can write and drawer well and work with or without screen protector and that lasts for more than a day and that does what it advertises)
