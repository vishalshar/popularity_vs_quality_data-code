I received a notification to update the OS. After installing this update, the phone did not reboot. I researched solutions for wiping cache, data and factory resets.After none of those worked, I contacted OnePlus customer service directly who gave me a literal copy and paste solution from a website that I'd already found.The only new solution they offered was to turn my phone off for 12 hours, charge it for another 6 hours, then reboot. I use my phone for work and family. This is completely unacceptable, but I did it (thank goodness I kept my old phone). Of course, this solution did not work.This inferior software and inadequate customer service is evidence of a substandard company. DO NOT BUY.
