I had the Blossom for about 3 weeks before I decided to return it.The hardware is second to none. This really is a top notch product from a hardware perspective. It hit all the points I was looking for. Clean design, nice LED light, can be used outdoors, easy wire setup, wireless and a single power source. The hardware engineers really built a fantastic watering controller here.The downfall for me was the software side of things. The app is very limited (more of that below) and it had many bugs that shouldn't be there. Here are my gripes.1. The app doesn't tell you which zones will be running next or give you a historical graph of what ran, when and how long. It'll say that a zone is running tomorrow at 3am, but if you have 12 zones, you don't know which ones those are.2. There was a bug where it wouldn't work if your times were set between 12am-2am. I had this confirmed with their support and it seems like a big oversight to me. In the middle of summer with no water for 2 weeks, 2/3rds of my lawn died.3. The system will use "smart" settings to change the duration of the water but it won't tell you why.4. Can't select different days and times to different zones. You can pick ONE time per day for all the zones you want running on that day. If you have 12 zones, lets say, and want to run 3 zones on Monday at 3am and another 3 zones on that same Monday at 3:30am, this is not possible.I ended up buying another smart watering controller by RainDrip for $85 that is not quite as "smart" as the Blossom but it's much cheaper, got a $80 reimbursement from my local watering agency (Blossom was too new and they didn't have it listed), and there are no bugs; it just works.I really wanted to like the Blossom, I really did. I even went as far as using the money out of my own allowance and not out of the joint account setup between my wife  (mind you, buying this was basically spending one month's allowance). This should've been a joint account expense but I wanted this so much I just bought it as if it was my own toy. That's how much I wanted to like this product. Amazon was as amazing as ever with their customer service and I returned it probably on the 25th day or so. What a shame.
