This lock is too inconsistent!!! There's been too many times I've been stuck outside of the door constantly refreshing the app until it finally gives me access to unlock the door. I bought this solely for the auto unlock feature as I approach, and it only works maybe 70% of the time. I missed the return window because of the holiday unfortunately, or this would be sent right back.
