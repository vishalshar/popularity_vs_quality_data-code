I followed the directions exactly, misting twice a day every day, for almost two months before I gave up. Only got a small bunch coming from the bottom, and it took almost 3 weeks from the soaking to harvesting. After that nothing really grew. The other side has no luck either. I am disappointed given how much it cost and how easy it was advertised.
