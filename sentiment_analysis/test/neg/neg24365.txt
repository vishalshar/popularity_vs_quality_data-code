I used this mount on my full suspension mountain bike for the past 4 months. This last weekend the mount broke while I was riding down a long hill. Luckily my IPhone ended up with only minor scratches on the screen, but that was purely because it fell into loose dirt. I quickly stopped and picked up my phone. The "Quad" portion of the mount was still attached to the case. The plastic piece that is under the blue lock collar is what broke.
