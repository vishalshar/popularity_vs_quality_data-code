Birthday Gift - I was excited to receive the MISFIT RAY, fitted my lifestyle and what could be a great product....However,Device - Misfit RayI am technically savvy, having a number of items that work via Bluetooth technology.I opened the package, fitted the batteries (3) supplied and dowloaded the required software from the Misfit Web Site.IPAD AIR 2 - IOS 9.3.2.Entered my "personal" details including Email address / weight / height etc....then started the "sync" process between software and device.The lights started flashing on the "RAY" but the software could not find the device - 3 options provide, Try again, Contact Customer support, Cancel process.Having tried a numnber of times - I found the FAQ's on the Misfit Website, Replace batteries / power off IPAD / Power off Misfit RAY.Tried all several times. Finally Emailed Technical Support (Oh Dear....)Misfit - Customer Support.Firstly - every "technical response" from MisFit takes them 24 hrs.Second - you never get a response from the same techical support person, so there is no level of "continuity" and they do not read the "Previous Thread".Ony suggestions I received over several days were - change batteries / reboot IPAD / Reboot RAY, are the lights flashing. YES to all these "suggestions" on DAY 1 & Day 2 & Day 3 and Day 4 of their 24 hr reponses.If you buy this product - do not rely on their technical support team - probably better to ask your Dog / Cat / Wall / The TV / A Fireman / A Neighbour.You will get a more meaningful, faster & better response.Summary :I probably received a device that had a problem with the "sync" functionality. Read other reviews some are the same.You would have thought that there would be some QA control / testing carried out during the manufacture process ?.Technical Support - Forget it (Save your time), it does not exisit.Due to frustration and lack of technical support - I have now returned the item to AMAZON for a full refund.A missed opportunity !....could be a great product.There are other products available on the market.
