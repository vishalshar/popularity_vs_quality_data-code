I have now had my second Pulse Ox fail in less than six months. The first one evidently failed after a pretty sweaty run. The second one failed I GUESS after I got caught in the rain without an umbrella?!?  Anyway, clearly this product is an epic fail in the real world. And why did I buy a second one?  Because I was naive enough to buy the blood pressure and body weight analyzers too, as I wanted an integrated suite of products. But the weak link was the Pulse OX. Do not buy this!
