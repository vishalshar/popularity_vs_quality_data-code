The quality seems to be inconsistent within the spool.Some parts of a print are fine and give a solid result, then later in the same print it will create a weak spot that feels like chalk and has the same strength.(none) Then back to solid. Eventually every print fails and the printer ends up air printing or creating spaghetti.Have tried different temps and layer heights, nothing seems to help.Prints with ColoFabb BronzeFill, CopperFill, etc all print perfect.
