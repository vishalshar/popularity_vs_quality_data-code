I wrote the company directly in hopes of dealing with this matter. They have not written back. I charged the unit fully upon receipt. Used once when Droid Maxx was down to 25% battery. It charged to 51% then was out of juice. The product advertises that it can give at least one full charge, if not more. Clearly this was not the case.The reason I gave the item two stars is because I was looking for something small and sleek. If there are units that work better, this would indeed be small, efficient and great.
