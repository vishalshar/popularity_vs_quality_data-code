I've had this product installed for just over a year now and I'm very dissatisfied with it's performance.  The hardware appears to be good, except for the lack of a connection for a rain sensor shutoff.  It was easy to setup both the sprinkler connections and the WiFi, it only took me about an hour to replace an old timer box controller & install the app on 2 smart phones.  However, that's the end of the good part of the review.The software that runs in this controller is pretty much useless!  This morning was the final straw.  We woke up & the sprinklers were running, we checked the app & it said it would water from 04:00 to 16:00, 12 hours!!!!  The smart watering feature has a tremendous number of bugs, we continually have to monitor it and adjust the watering times.  There is no way to stop a watering cycle without unplugging the controller.  We tried turning off smart watering & using the timed watering feature, we set the duration to zero for zone 3, nothing, it would not turn off the zone.  I finally (again) had to go unplug the controller to get it to stop.  Well, that's the last straw for me, I'll be replacing this with another controller this weekend.When I purchased the unit, I installed the phone app, contacted the company & they said they would have a web app, with watering reports & other information available shortly, that was over a year ago.  I registered an account to be able to use that feature as soon as it was available, but the last time I tried to log in, that feature no longer exists on their web site.  There is no information about any development of a web app anymore.  I'm done with it!  There will be a trip to the local store to purchase a Rachio controller this weekend.Anyone want to buy a used Blossom?
