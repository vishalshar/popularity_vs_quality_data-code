I tried these hoping that they would spice up air-popped popcorn and alleviate the need to add butter to give it some flavor. Unfortunately when you add the powder to air-popped popcorn it all just kind of sinks to the bottom of the bowl. The flavor was ok but theres really no way for it to "stick" to the popcorn without adding butter. :/
