This is the second unit I have purchased. I waited too long to return the first one which never killed a rodent. The second one worked well for 4 times and now will "trigger" and allow the mouse /rat to eat the bait and leave. The best new brand name batteries and also rechargeable types made no difference. Yes, these are made in the USA but it seems like Chinese quality. Now 4 days after the return window I am stuck with $100.00 worth of worthless junk. I recommend the old fashioned snap spring type mouse /rat traps. They are not as simple to use but the work very well. `
