Not a purchase for someone interested in a device that performs continuous HR monitoring. The step count appeared to be somewhat accurate, compared with other monitoring devices I own.Pros:Good looking device. Sleek and modern appearance. Strap uses a latch & buckle to secure the device to the wrist.Cons:No continuous HR monitoringHR checking hardly ever measured.  Approximately 1 out of 10 try's.Sleep monitoring very inaccurate.
