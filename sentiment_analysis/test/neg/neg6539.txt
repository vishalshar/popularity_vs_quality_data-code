I really wanted to like this drone but the manual and instructional videos are sparse and incomplete.  There was a 4K camera that is included with my drone but NO documentation on how to use it or get the video it is supposedly shooting.  The user is supposed to guess I suppose.  It flies well but the camera is what is supposed to be the other half of what you are buying the drone for.  The app you download for flying the drone works ok but once again there is no documentation on how to use the camera.  It is such a shame to go through all the work of making a nice drone and camera only to fall flat on a simple thing like INSTRUCTIONS on how to use the product.
