Returned after trying it for 2 weeks. The makers of this product seem to think me an idiot.Packaging is nice and what you would expect from a top-class gadget.Setup is easy. But too easy: There is very little explanation as to what is going on (or what to expect). I eventually figured out that there was a process to 'train' or 'calibrate' the buzzer to your child's needs - over the course of a few nights. The problem is this 1) I don't like not knowing what to expect 2) when your kid is having difficulty sleeping the last thing you need is something that will make it unpredictably worse.Furthermore, I consider myself a very tech saver user. I didn't appreciate how the device is locked into a 'simple user' mode without any real control over what it is doing.
