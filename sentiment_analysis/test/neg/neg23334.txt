I was so excited to get this for my daughter and now I don't even know what to do. Multiple pieces do not fit or work correctly, parts have obviously been returned before and no way to get ahold of the company to talk to anyone about it! The only option I have is to return the whole thing, which would suck because her birthday is tomorrow and it's her big present. And also, I don't want to return or replace the whole thing, just the parts that don't fit or work.
