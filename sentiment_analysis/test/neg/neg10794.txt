Well I apologize for how gross my armpit looks, it hasn't been shaved in several days due to the excruciating pain this deodorant causes. I've been using this brand for several months, and kept wanting to like it despite the horrible irritation it caused. It does a good job of controlling odor for at least 8 hours, but wetness is still a problem. It causes awful irritation that I'm only able to get rid of by stopping the deodorant. You absolutely cannot shave and then put this deodorant on right after. I used to shave every day and now I try to get by with every few days because of how bad I flare up. It's definitely the deodorant. I decided enough was enough today when I couldn't even hold my arms to my side because of how much my armpits hurt. For what it's worth I tried the lavender, jasmine, and scentless and they all did the same thing. I really did want to like this product.
