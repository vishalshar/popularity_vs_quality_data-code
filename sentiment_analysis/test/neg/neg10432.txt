I bought this drive because of my experiences with other Dane-Elec flash drives.  I put about 5 Gigs of data on it but when I tried to read the files they were corrupt.  I was able to delete some but the others were unreadable and had strange characters as file names.  I plugged the drive into my computer and did the usual error fix and repair.  Windows said it was fixed but the files were unreadable.  Next I did a reformat.  Again Windows said there were no errors but the files still remain.  I have tried to contact Dane-Elec but all of the emails bounce back.  It could be I just got one that defective.
