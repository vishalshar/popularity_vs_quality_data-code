This review is from: SmartyPants Adult Complete Gummy Vitamins: Multivitamin & Omega 3 DHA/EPA Fish Oil, Methyl B12, Vitamin D3, 180 count (30 Day Supply) (Health and Beauty)For anyone considering these Gummies...take into account the fact that one "serving" includes 1200 IU of Vitamin D which can easily lead to hypercalcemia. When Vitamin D3 is synthesized by the skin there are feedback loops to prevent creating toxic levels of D3, but when ingesting D3, there are no biological controls. Furthermore, because of health concerns around sunlight exposure, there are *no* recommendations for how much sunlight you should get, therefore, the recommended dosage for D3 is based off an assumption you will receive zero sunlight--which is ridiculous. In the EU the suggested daily intake of D3 is 5ug, and 1200 IU = 60 ug...six times the recommendation. And again, this is assuming you live in a cave.My recommendation is to vitamins your vitamins if you already have them by eating only a half serving a day, and then I discontinue use of this product while it continues have 1200 IU of D3 in a single serving.Here is an excerpt from wikipedia about D3 toxicity:ExcessFor more details on this topic, see hypervitaminosis D.Vitamin D toxicity is rare.[18] It is caused by supplementing with high doses of vitamin D rather than sunlight. The threshold for vitamin D toxicity has not been established; however, according to some research, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) is 4,000 IU/day for ages 971[51] (100 ľg/day), while other research concludes that, in healthy adults, sustained intake of more than 1250 ?g/day (50,000 IU) can produce overt toxicity after several months and can increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to 150 ng/ml and greater.[18][52] Those with certain medical conditions, such as primary hyperparathyroidism,[53] are far more sensitive to vitamin D and develop hypercalcemia in response to any increase in vitamin D nutrition, while maternal hypercalcemia during pregnancy may increase fetal sensitivity to effects of vitamin D and lead to a syndrome of mental retardation and facial deformities.[53][54]A review published in 2015 noted that adverse effects have been reported only at 25(OH)D serum concentrations above 200 nmol/L.[55]Published cases of toxicity involving hypercalcemia in which the vitamin D dose and the 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels are known all involve an intake of ?40,000 IU (1,000 ?g) per day.[53]Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult a doctor before taking a vitamin D supplement. The FDA advised manufacturers of liquid vitamin D supplements that droppers accompanying these products should be clearly and accurately marked for 400 international units (IU). In addition, for products intended for infants, the FDA recommends the dropper hold no more than 400 IU.[56] For infants (birth to 12 months), the tolerable upper limit (maximum amount that can be tolerated without harm) is set at 25 ?g/day (1,000 IU). One thousand micrograms per day in infants has produced toxicity within one month.[52] After being commissioned by the Canadian and American governments, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) as of 30 November 2010, has increased the tolerable upper limit (UL) to 2,500 IU per day for ages 13 years, 3,000 IU per day for ages 48 years and 4,000 IU per day for ages 971+ years (including pregnant or lactating women).[51]Effect of excessVitamin D overdose causes hypercalcemia, which is a strong indication of vitamin D toxicity  this can be noted with an increase in urination and thirst. If hypercalcemia is not treated, it results in excess deposits of calcium in soft tissues and organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart, resulting in pain and organ damage.[18][21][39]The main symptoms of vitamin D overdose which can occur are those of hypercalcemia:anorexianauseavomitingThis is frequently followed by:polyuriapolydipsiaweaknessinsomnianervousnesspruritusultimately renal failureFurthermore, proteinuria, urinary casts, azotemia, and metastatic calcification (especially in the kidneys) may develop.[52]Other symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include mental retardation in young children, abnormal bone growth and formation, diarrhea, irritability, weight loss, and severe depression.[18][39]Vitamin D toxicity is treated by discontinuing vitamin D supplementation and restricting calcium intake. Kidney damage may be irreversible. Exposure to sunlight for extended periods of time does not normally cause vitamin D toxicity. The concentrations of vitamin D precursors produced in the skin reach an equilibrium, and any further vitamin D produced is degraded.[53]"
