You can't assume that a bracket that attaches to the floor and is capable of  holding a tablet won't wobble some.  This one does to some extent but I was able to keep the mount close to the center console and that helps a lot.  It certainly is a better solution to have my 7" GPS mounted to this versus (with a little wobble) versus it falling off the windshield every 15 minutes.  All components seem to be of acceptable quality and in my opinion, reasonably priced.So after installation I realized that the kit was missing a bracket that should help minimize the wobble.  I contacted the manufacturer and was told that I had to deal with Amazon on this problem or I could return the item to them for $10.00.  WTF, I suspect this small injection molded part cost well under $1 to produce and with a little postage could have had a very happy customer.  But that isn't their business model.  I may now return it to Amazon and purchase one of the other models that are available.  So 3 stars removed for this silly, unprofessional exchange with their customer service department.Okay, so now they lose another star because they just don't understand customer service.  We're talking a small part that could be sent via USPS in an envelope.  They would rather I return the whole thing versus sending me this little part.  I am re-thinking my "acceptable quality" comment...if all the parts are there, then it isn't really acceptable.
