I purchased this in Aug 16. Unit is good and works fine. Configuration also simple.Now after 3 months, I changed my phone and reinstalled ivideon app on iphone. Now the app wont let me remotely access the camera, and asks for monthly subscription charges. The listing clearly says no monthly subscription whatsoever. Disappointed.
