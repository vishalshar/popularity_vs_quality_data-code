Was soooo excited...could finally just use one of many mason jars I have as my water bottle at work, no worrying about toxic plastics, no settling for a tiny metal container that tastes funny, it was just awesome when I started using it. The comments from co-workers about moonshine were fun too. However, after about 1 month of use, it started to get harder and harder to remove (to refill with ice/water or switch to a . after 2 months of use, if it is screwed on tightly enough to prevent leakage, it is impossible to remove without holding under a scalding water faucet for a period of time or putting it in the microwave for a minute or two.Basically the gasket is made of such cheap garbage rubber that after 2 mos, it has broken down to the point that the top is more frustrating to use than it is worth...the search for something good continues - this product is NOT good.
