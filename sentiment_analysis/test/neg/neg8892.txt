I ordered one for myself and later ordered a second one for a family member.  The second one arrived late after two delays.  The sleep tracker is all over the place.  I work nights, so I sleep during the day.  I emailed the company to verify that it will work when I sleep during the day and it took a week for them to reply that it will.  However, for the first week and a half it would only record sleep on my off nights, when I actually slept at night.  Now, it will record my sleep during the day, but the last 1.5 - 3 hours will also show up on the next day.  I can check the app on a work break at 3 am and it will tell me I've slept from 18:00 to 20:35 (6pm - 8:35pm) that very day.  Also, I can not set the Idle Alert to start at a pm time and end at an am time.  I am unable to make use of the Idle Alert, because of the time setting restraint.  If the sleep tracking is so off, then I'm not sure I trust the step/activity tracking.  The only good thing I can say, unless they make improvements to the app, is that it has a very long battery life.
