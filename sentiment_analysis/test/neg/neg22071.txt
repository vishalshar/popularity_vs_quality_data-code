QA no longer exists. My first sleep pill worked. This one wouldn't pair. So typical of so much crap coming from amazon these days. If the time spend on the box and packaging was put into testing the product, this review could possibly have gone another way. Maybe a little pride in your product? I'm an engineer and a developer, I understand things go wrong in manufacturing. Thats why there is QA, or at least there used to be.On the bright side, I get to wait a few days and try again. If the next one happens to work properly, I'll update my review with what I experience. However, getting a defective piece on christmas definitely means this will be the "crappy gift" we will be telling everyone about this year. Congrats!
