On balance, I don't like it... needs one more fret... also, its only good for chords... can't keep up with scales and picking.  The 'bridge cover' is also flimsy, and the little plastic switches that the strings actuate are made of flimsy plastic too.  the plastic switch for my high 'e' string broke on its maiden voyage, and I had to improvise with a paper-clip.  Do they sell replacement flimsy plastic switches?
