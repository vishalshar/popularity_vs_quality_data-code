I love the idea of this Harness. However, where the buckles are positioned on the Harness, it rubbed on my dog. Causing raw, bloody open wounds, under both his arm pits, and one on his chest. I was horrified to see this when we got home. His wounds were treated and he had to wear a tshirt for 2 weeks, till it healed. I'm too afraid to try this harness again. I really wanted this to work for him, because he pulls so hard, he chokes himself in a regular collar.Also, where they show you measuring around the chest, is not accurate. During our walk the harness,no matter how tight i strapped it, kept pulling up under his arm pits. The harness does not stay around his ribs, but pulls forward under the arm pits.
