Cost a fortune to bring it to New Zealand. It arrived today and I found the NZ iTunes store doesn't have the app. Lodged a query with the support website and didn't hear back. Finally got the app sorted and the device won't pair with my iPhone 6. In fact, when the Thync is in pairing mode it does not even show up as an available device. The support website had one suggestion for when pairing didn't work but it made no difference. I have lodged another query with the Help Desk and I will update this if I ever hear back. I am a very experienced user of technology and this is a very poor experience. Even my cheapest bluetooth gadgets work without these issues.Update: I also called Thync and they told me to press the power button in time with the light. It paired immediately and now links perfectly each time. It is worth noting the support desk still has not responded to any of my emails about the difficulties I was having!Ok, so when using it something does happen but it is so subtle that finding the so-called sweet-spot is a farce. The calming strip made me feel ma bit sluggish quite quickly, but a longer time did not improve or increase the feeling. The energy strip did not do very much. I will persevere and keep updating my post.Update 1: Used the calming strip before sleep and it did not help. In fact, I had the worst night of sleep in ages. My pillow suddenly felt hard and way too big and I had some terrible nightmares. Could have been a coincidence so I'll try it a few more times.Update 2: Ok so the energising strips seem to work reasonably well so I have added a star. I mainly bought it for the calming function which is too subtle so I am probably going to return it because it does not do what was promised.Update 3: The latest iOS update removed the app from my phone and won't allow it to go back on. This is because it is not available from the New Zealand iTunes store. This device is now unusable unless I buy another device and set it up for a different country.I emailed Thync about this issue soon after my purchase and I still have not heard back. No worthwhile support for a product that does very little.
