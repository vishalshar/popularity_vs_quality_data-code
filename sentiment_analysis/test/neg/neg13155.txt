Sleep tracker does not work, whether attached to a sleep shirt, necklace or bracelet.  Contacted the company to find out how to manually adjust my sleep in the app and was told that capability is not available yet.Breathing app is useless, you have to log into the app in order to go through exercises that then list you had low accuracy.  I have googled the heck out of the accuracy and still have no idea what that means or what the benefit is.The vibration for the alarm is soft, but that is OK since I didn't plan to wake up to it.  On a shirt collar you may not notice it at all.Finally, (and most frustrating!) it doesn't even work as well as a $5 pedometer.  I work from home and go up and down stairs all day in my split level to take out the dogs, do laundry, make lunch, etc.  I started wearing a cheap Walgreen's pedometer in addition to the Leaf.  Regardless of which way it is worn, the Leaf picks up on less than half the steps I take. The only positive is that it is pretty, but you can't even buy a replacement leather bracelet if yours gets dirty.  After a week mine is already fraying on the sides.Bottom line: I am calling Amazon to get this waste of money returned.
