Wish I could give half-star. This product is awful and halfway done. Comes with instructions and a little baggy of stuff for you to assemble, as expensive as this is you should expect better quality. If you like to do IKEA projects this is the perfect gift for you. It came in a plain brown box, barely taped and with no "cushioning", sounded like a maraca when we received it. We diligently opened it to find the Robot toy.. bouncing around in the box, with a baggy (like replacement items) for you to assemble and finish what they forgot in the factory. This toy for being so expensive should perform better and should be packaged in the right way. I will upload pictures soon.
