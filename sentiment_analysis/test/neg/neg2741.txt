Not recommended.  The bottom grate, which is secured only by the narrowest fringe of plastic, kept popping out. Then, after light usage for 12 months (once every 1-2 weeks), the dial stopped working: no matter which direction I turned it, the temperature just went up. Finally, it maxed at 212 degrees and cannot be turned down. I tried the tiny reset button at the back, but it doesn't actually work, since on my machine it can't be depressed  any more.  (I even tried running the thing out of water to force an automatic reset--supposedly a safety feature on the machine--but it kept running.  Scary.)  So, now I'm out $199 and will be buying the Anova as a replacement.
