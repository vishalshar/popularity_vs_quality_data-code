I really liked the idea of the XY3 3rd Gen Item Finder--a light, compact hexagonal disk that you can attach to your key chain and use it to find the location of a multitude of things--from your cell phone (which it will "ring" even when turned off) to those keys (which you can track down through the Bluetooth app, to, theoretically, your parked car.At least that's what they say on paper.  Reality proved to be another thing altogether.  The first sign of trouble was setting it up after you installed the app on your phone.  It was less than intuitive, the instructions were insufficient and the actual app was tricky to navigate.  After  some trial and error I finally got it "paired" with my phone and my keys.I don't seem to have problems misplacing my keys as much as not remembering where I just put my phone down.  I put the XY3 to the test, pushing the triangular button on the disc and, lo and bold, it activated a musical chime on my phone which was loud enough to locate.  At least it did it the first time.  I haven't gotten it to work again since.It also has been having issues showing where my keys were (they in the immediate vicinity--actually right beside the phone) when I test it.  It will some of the time, but not others.The only thing the XY3 seems to be consistent in is running out my phone battery time, which it does quite efficiently if I don't remember to turn off the location finding.All in all, while a great product in theory, it's still got a long way to go in practice.
