Does not maintain its grip on your phone.  I thought it seemed flimsy right out of the box.  And sure enough, it lived down to expectations.  It seems to hold fine at first, but don't be fooled - I noticed its grip loosens with even the least bumps on the road.  It's not even that the phone begins shifting in the grips.  The ratcheting mechanism itself springs free with every moderate bump.  I can't see risking my phone with this gadget.
