I have had my ThinCharge case for 3 months now. The first month was great and the charge would completely refill my phone from 10% to 100% with some charge still left in the case.About 1.5 months into the case it began to act strangely. I would plug my phone in at night and wake in the morning to find that my phone nor the case had charged at all overnight. After some testing of different outlets and chargers, I discovered that the case and phone would initially start charging for about 10 minutes after plugging in, but then stop charging while still plugged in and remain that way until I unplugged and re-plugged only for this to happen over and over.Now I have to charge the phone and the case separately, but am starting to notice that the case definitely doesn't hold the same charge as before. And now, the top part of my case, which seems to be notoriously fragile among other ThinCharge customers, has broken its clip and no longer stays in place.Needless to say, I am sorely disappointed in the case despite such a great start. Even recommended the case to many friends who struggled with battery life, but now I don't think I would recommend the case to others.
