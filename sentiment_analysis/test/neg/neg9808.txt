I was looking for a laser that used regular batteries because the one we had cost less that the replacement batteries. When I saw the picture of the laser making a random pattern on the floor I thought that would be great for my cat.It came with no instructions on how to operate it. So let me tell you what I finally discovered.When you press and release the power button the device will turn on and the laser will move in random back and forth motions in an oval. It only does an oval and the oval never moves. The laser just traces back and forth as it moves around that oval. You can adjust how far away it makes the oval by manually moving the mirror. The pattern show in the description CAN NOT be made by this product.Once the device is turned on, you can press and hold the on/off button for a short time and the laser will stop moving. Now you can pick up the device in your hand and move it by hand to create the pattern shown in the product description just like you can with any other laser product made. I did not return the product because it is a good bright laser and uses standard batteries and that is what I was wanting, but I would have chosen a different laser if I had known that the laser would only move in a fixed oval and could not possibly make the pattern shown in the product description.Until now I have been able to trust the product descriptions on Amazon. This causes me to wonder how much I need to question on other product descriptions. I am more disappointed that Amazon did not insure that the product description was honest and true than I am that the product was not as shown.Amazon, can I still trust you?
