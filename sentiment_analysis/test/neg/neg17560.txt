I do like the look of it.  The only reason it's got two stars.  It's prettyThe reason I bought it was to help with stress. I read that it would follow my breathing and alert me. It does not follow my breathing at all.Even though their website talks about breathing yet I cannot find anything about it in my app.  Nothing.  Do I need this to meditate, no you can learn that for free online. It really helps me with nothing.  The app just shows me how much I've "worked out" but it's not accurate in my steps like my fitbit is.  It will track meditation only if I use theirs and of course tracks my period.......  had a hysterectomy years ago.One thing I actually hate about it is that it doesn't track my sleeping correctly.  They (the developers of this) assume that we all go to bed after 9pm.  You cannot go to bed (well you cannot be tracked) before 9 pm.  What if we get up early like 3:30 AM or 4:00 AM?  Apparently who ever designed this was unaware that people work different hours.Okay they updated the software.  I'm not impressed and no I'm not staying awake until 9 pm.Need help?  My new Fitbit Charge 2 not only tracks my heart rate and walks me through a calming breathing method..... without needing my app on my phone - just the tracker but it also tracks my walking, biking, running, stairs calories burned AND no matter when I go to sleep it tracks it.  It's a bit more expensive and will not track your period..
