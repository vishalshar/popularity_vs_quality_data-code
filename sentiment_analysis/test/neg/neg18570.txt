EDIT 12/15: I decided to downgrade my review from 3 to 1 star. Customer service has been NON-EXISTENT. No replies via Facebook or email or support ticket (2 months, 7 follow-ups, 0 response). Facebook shows that they have read my inquiry. What did I contact them about? How to change the email address associated with my account. Imagine contacting them about needing repair. Am never buying or advocating Kuna again. They obviously don't care about customer service, and for that very fundamental basic, I've downgraded the review to 1 star.-------Original review from November 9, 2016:When Kuna works, the device is great to have around the home. It was fairly easy to install and came with a higher-end type of packaged feel.However, during Halloween 2016, "a small number of servers" had issues (according to Kuna), although it took every one of our cameras offline, including my brother's and a bunch of people all over the country. This raised a serious design flaw... When Kuna's servers are offline, the camera should still function with the local Wifi. One should still be able to turn on or off the light without the cloud as well. However, one could neither see the camera nor control the light during the server outage.Seems like a serious (and potentially dangerous) design flaw to me. Somebody could take this flaw to their advantage knowing that they can break into homes during Halloween (and I'm sure that mentioning this in this review won't help the word about this flaw from spreading, but Kuna NEEDS to know and so do their customers!)Kuna, are you guys working on a better solution to address this serious flaw? This seriously goes against your motto of, "Protect what matters to you most". Like my home. My FAMILY.By the way, the iOS app works more reliably than the Android version.
