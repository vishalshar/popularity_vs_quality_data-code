Solid charger, but the car location finder does not work. It only worked once. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it worked once. I also noticed that the position of the phone affects the direction it points. When I was walking in the direction of the car, it would point in a different direction.  I have a Galaxy S7. Maybe the software needs to be updated.  The meter alarm went off once. I would have gotten a ticket if I counted on the app to remind me. I give it two stars for the solid charger.
