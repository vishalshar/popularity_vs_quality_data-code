This was terrible. Fantastic idea, but terrible execution. You are much better off buying the whiteboard paint or a standard whiteboard. This is very hard to install without bubbles and since it is a whiteboard the bubbles effect the quality. Also, it peels on the side so you are constantly pushing the sides up instead of focusing on your product.
