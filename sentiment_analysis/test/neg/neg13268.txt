This thing is WAY over priced for what it is... The "tricks" it does are spin... and, well... spin.  It does need to be recalibrated frequently but, we didn't experience the need to have to do that as often as one of the reviewers (though - I'm not denying it's an issue)...  The videos that are shown on their website are deceiving as well as, they make it appear to go much faster than it actually goes.  I got this for one of my girlfriends daughters for Christmas... she's already getting bored of it.  Honestly, you could get three good remote control toys from Radioshack for this price of this... and, each one of them are going to be more amusing than this thing.  The novelty is - kids think it's great being able to use their phone as a remote.  It has led lights that flash when you use it... and, it spins.  That about sums it up.  All that for $100.  If it were $40 or less... I'd give it 3 stars... If it were $20 or less 4.  It would have to be free for 5 stars cause, again - I'm just not that impressed.
