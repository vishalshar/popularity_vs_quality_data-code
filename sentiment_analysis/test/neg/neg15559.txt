I saw this bottle in a local bike shop last summer and then I finally ordered one from Amazon for my birthday a couple of weeks ago. I really want to love it... I love the idea that it stays cleaner, and it's reusable so I'm not putting endless plastic into the landfill, but it leaks. The bottom screw cap leaks, and even the top screw on lid leaks for me too.  It's fine if I use just plain water and the drips will just dry but if I put flavour packets in it then I have to be careful not to shake it without a towel around it. Otherwise red or purple drops of water are everywhere.. the floor, my work clothes, my running clothes, the cupboards.  It's a pain. I'm going to use it for awhile and get my money's worth from it, but when it leaks too much or gets old I won't be replacing it! Such a bummer, I was so excited!
