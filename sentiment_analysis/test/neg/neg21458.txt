I had a metal one that I LOVED.( but then it stopped keeping my coffee hot in less than a year)  I bought this as a replacement. Coffee stayed warm for like 1 hour. My drink doesn't stay hot at all. I'm very disappointed. I am in the process of sending this one back for refund- do yourself a favor and stay away from this product/brand.I tried to return this product as they have a 100% guarantee - UPS picked up the mug to ship back to Mighty Mug - Two weeks later a looked and  they had closed the ticket and never credited my credit card - The worse Company EVER!!!!!  I am out $20 and no mug - There are better mugs & companies to deal with  "  Stay away from this bunch"
