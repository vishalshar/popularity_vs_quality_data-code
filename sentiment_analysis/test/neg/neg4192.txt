As mentioned elsewhere, this is a re-branded version of the Cheerson CX-10WD drone available on Amazon and elsewhere for around $40. It is a fun little toy, but the connectivity is inconsistent, the video stream is laggy and freezes often. If you are interested in this drone because the video streaming or supposed VR capability, I recommend against this model. In has some very cool tech and is fun to fly around until the battery dies after 5 - 10 minutes, but I feel the advertising of the product falls far short of reality.
