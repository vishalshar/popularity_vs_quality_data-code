Save your self the headache. the first one I got, I couldn't even connect to it through the app. The app is a mess it crashes more times then it works successfully. When i received the replacement i was able to connect after a hew times and only the Ethernet directly, not WiFi. Once connected I couldn't pair my UE Boom speakers, after about an hour i ws able to pair one, then when i paired the other one, it would unpair the other one so I was never able to pair both plus anything else. This unit and software is a mess and needs a lot of fixing before it is ready for market.
