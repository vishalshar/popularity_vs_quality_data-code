I have to agree with the one other customer that said this product is useless.  I too used a whole packet in my fireplace without success.  In fact I tried adding more when the fire was dying and it wouldn't catch fire.  I can only assume that those who rated it highly used a lot of kindling and effort.  My logs are over a year old and I can usually start a fire with kindling and a lot of fanning.  What good is this if it doesn't decrease the kindling or work.
