These taste awful compared to other gummy vitamins I've tried. I bought them because I was taking two other kinds - a daily multi and a daily fish oil. I wanted to cut back on the number and just take one per day. Well, the serving size per day on these is SIX!!! That's 60 calories too. Like half a candy bar. And they taste artificial and bad.
