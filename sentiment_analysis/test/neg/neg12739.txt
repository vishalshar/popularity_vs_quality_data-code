I think this fits better for certain body types. I felt the "pull" and the straightening and support felt good...but I could not keep the straps secure on my knees....they were only secure if I lifted my heel off the floor...like I was on tip toes.  The design is not the problem...it appeared to be a great producr...just not a lot of use..because who really has time to just  sit :(
