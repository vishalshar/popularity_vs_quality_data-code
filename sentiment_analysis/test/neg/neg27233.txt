My experience:1. Bluetooth connection cut out all the time and finally the right speaker stopped working when using bluetooth.2. The buttons on the speakers worked great with gloves.3. Walkie-talkie feature is stupid, I didn't by it for that and to me there is no point for having this feature because you can call or tell Siri to text someone while using bluetooth on the speakers4. Sound volume definitely is the loudest out of any helmet speakers and I would say the sound quality is average/good for what they are.5. Surprisingly, talking on the phone on bluetooth was crystal clear and worked flawlessly.I had to send in my chips since the right speaker stopped working and am waiting to receive a new set. After reading other reviews it seems outdoor tech has some quality control issues since some of the devices sold work flawlessly and the others have bluetooth issues like me. This bluetooth problem also seems to come from the fact that have separate bluetooth chips in each speaker. I expect that a company would have better quality control issues for a $130.00 product. When they worked I loved them, but I'll have to see if my new set has the same issues. Don't buy these for the app.
