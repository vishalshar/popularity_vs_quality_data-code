Works but not as expected. I normally do not take the effort to write a review but thought would do it for this one as it does not perform as claimed. The product claims that it holds 27,000 mAh and can charge an iPhone 11 times.  I have a iPhone 6 plus and I use chargeTech to charge it during the night. However, it can only charge my iPhone 4-5 times. After 5 times, it definitely requires a recharge. Even while charging the laptop, it will charge only if the laptop is turned off. If the laptop is on and charging, it will keep on switching between "plugged in and charging" and "Plugged in but not charging" cycles. This is even when I am using a Lenovo laptop with an adaptor capacity of 65W which is way below than the advertised 86w that I bought.
