I live in the United Kingdom and ordered the CUFF for a Christmas present for my daughter. Stupidly I assumed that because the CUFF was shipped to the UK it would work in the UK. By the time I discovered otherwise it was too late to return the CUFF to Amazon. The reason it took so long to figure out the CUFF was no good was because no one at CUFF would reply to any of my e-mails and not being on Facebook I was un aware the issue had already been raised there. Once I discovered this I tried to contact them via Facebook but once again they refused to reply....mmm some kind of patter developing here. There is no mention of this issue on the CUFF web site but then why bother? Just carry on shipping what is essentially very expensive jewellery and ignore the complaints. A guaranteed money maker.With any luck the fact that this is on a public forum I might actually get a response, although I highly doubt it.
