Returning. Shipped with a dead battery. No worries. I can buy a new one. It happens. Really wanted to like this item. The concept is drilliant. But the play on both iOS and Android, multiple devices also, was laggy and didnt have the wondrous interplay described by other reviewers.  A strum on beat didnt equate to a strum in time to the track. Tried multiple tracks. Again, so so so wanted to enjoy this. I lost interest in a short time and my kids lost interest even quicker because it didn't play to the music. We are a musical family.  I wish the developers the best because this is a fabulous idea.
