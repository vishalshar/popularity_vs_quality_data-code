I had great hopes for this little thing.  I set it up (from the terrible directions given in the almost non-existent manual), put it on, and it worked really sporadically.  I did everything I was supposed to:  charged it completely, set the posture I wanted to maintain, and then turned on the posture reminder mode.  Sometimes it would buzz when I slumped - other times (and most times, actually) it did nothing.  It was extremely disapointing.
