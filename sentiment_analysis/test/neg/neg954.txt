Don't Bother! I got this for Christmas And it worked for 2 weeks and then weird things started to happen like "Slow Relay" So i unplugged it and plugged it back in and nothing the same thing over again. After 2 weeks this radio has a mind of it own. Then when I did get it going 3 hours later keeps saying "Are you still listening?" Shuts off. So this radio is packed and put away until someone can work out the bugs out of it.
