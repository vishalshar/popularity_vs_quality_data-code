This is the second bag I have order of this food..my lil Yorkie/Chi loves it..unfortunately I just opened this bag that I received and it was full of baby ants..when I looked in between the outside creases of the bag there were brown ant eggs..this is not acceptable. It was obviously sitting for a long time in a warehouse or somewhere..I expect fresh quality holistic food that I buy for my lil boy..this is so disheartening. .I will no longer buy from this company.!!!!!..
