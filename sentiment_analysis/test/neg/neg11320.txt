This device looks beautiful, a little thicker verson of iPhone, sort of clean look. I was trying to set up the account, and while doing so for 10 min it used up the free 100MB! It's still not able to connect to my cell phone in the meantime. I decided to return this device, as this can be nothing but frustrated.
