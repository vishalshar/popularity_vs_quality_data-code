Read review knew about connection issues with bluetooth but hoped-for the 2.2 to fix issue but it did not, I couldn't even use them outside songs would skip constantly due to connecting issue, I couldn't even have in my pocket had to buy a holster for my phone, but I didnt mind since I mainly wanted them for the gym but even had issues with them connecting as well couldn't even walk more than 3 feet before I had issues, great design but not worth 280 dollars I paid for. Going back to my reliable jaybirds x2.
