Does not work at all.  I set it up exactly as the instructions state, and after all, it's pretty basic.  Had brand new fresh batteries and the light blinked when the unit was turned on to indicate it was ready to go.  On several occasions in the morning the light would be flashing, supposedly indicating a kill, but no critter.  Bait was disturbed and some gone but so was the mouse.  So anyway, huge waste of $45.  I will be sending this back.
