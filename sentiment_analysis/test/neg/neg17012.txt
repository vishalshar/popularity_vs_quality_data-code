So far, not impressed at all. I feel like I wasted $100 for a gadget.It tells me that I'm tense when my breathing is perfectly fine, and "focused" during a heated argument.Edit: one week later, feeling like it's completely useless. Dropping to 1 star. Not sure how this is getting 5 stars review. It does nothing logical. It vibrates for no reason, it's annoying as hell.Complete waste of money.
