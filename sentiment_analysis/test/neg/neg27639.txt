I was skeptical when I ordered this given all the bad reviews, but I figured I would just send it back if it did not work. I wanted something that would work with Echo so I could turn lights on and off with my voice. The wiring was easy. I downloaded the app and the switch connected to my network immediately. I programmed the light to come on and off several times, and it worked. I was getting excited! Then after 2 hours, it lost its connection and would not reconnect (the switch was literally 8 feet from my router). Even the manual switch stopped working. I could foresee hours of frustration with this thing, so I sent it back.
