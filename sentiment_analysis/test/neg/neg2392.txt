Make sure you wash it first.  I wore it out of the package and it turned all my picc equipment black.  The tape, the tubes, my skin, the dressing, all black.  The tubes cannot be cleaned and I no longer can see if the tubes are filling with blood. I had to pay for an extra nursing visit to change the bandages, Unfortunately the tubes cannot be changed.
