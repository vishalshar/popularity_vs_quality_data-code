I purchased this phone August 29 so it hasn't even been 6 months and my screen went completely out. I tried taking battery out for a hour to see if it would reset but it never did. Throughout the couple months having the phone it would glitch. I dropped it once other than that there was no damage to it. So after that experience with the posh phone I will never buy another one.
