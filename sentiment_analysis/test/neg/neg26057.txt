I bought several of these and they all broke. The motor shaft snapped, but the motor runs great while the other starts intermittently and backfires. It was working fine on the test runs after some minor brake adjustments, but no longer (valves need work?). In theory these sound awesome and I could have sold all of my friends one, but after literally dragging two of them for 3 miles through downtown DC today after brunch - dont think they will be buying one anytime soon.... It's too bad, because I loved the idea of these, the fuel is so easy to buy at any drugstore and they are fantastic for high density urban areas and outlast any electric skateboard.
