It might work as advertised, but we are in the 21 century.  4 buttons on the bottom of the device? You must be kidding me. I cannot press them in the order they asked. I cannot even see them so, most of the time, I am not sure which button I pressed. So, if you like surprises, buy this, it is for prime time.
