These laces look really cute in the shoes, but I should have listened to the other reviews that I read before purchasing them.  They make the shoes too tight across the top of the foot and have no give to expand even a little bit.  After a few minutes, the pressure was just too much and I had too remove them.  Unfortunately, I am a week or two passed my return window - so I'll be keeping them.
