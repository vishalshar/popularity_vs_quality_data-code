This is the second time I am trying to leave a review and it hasn't been published. I am VERY dissapointed after buying this product. I bought it as a Christmas present for my son because looked so nice the image and description of the product. Then, I received a small box that nothing has to do with I was expecting. I didn't return it immediately because I still thought that the idea of a 3d pen was good, although I felt robbed with the price I spent ($100). Yesterday I went to Barnes and Noble and I found the same product, with the size, dimmensions and accesories I was expecting from the beginning and with the same prize!!! If I haven't see the real product in front of me, I would never know how looks like. I must return it. Very disappointed!!!!
