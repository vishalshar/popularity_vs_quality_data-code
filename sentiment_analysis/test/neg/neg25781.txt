These headphones are truly useless.  They're marketed as a fitness headphone,  but you can't use them from more than 10 feet away in any practical situation.  Furthermore,  even if you are within arms reach of your phone,  they will cut in and out unless there is a direct line of site between your phone and the right ear bud.  Bragi's solution?  Wear your phone on your arm!  Better yet,  why not just connect your phone with a wire directly to the ear bud?!  So terribly disappointed in these.  The only scenario I can use them on now is flights where I can put my phone directly on my tray table.... And as long as I don't move... Perfect sound.
