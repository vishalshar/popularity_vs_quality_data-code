Based on reviews and endorsements I had expected it to taste like something other than chickpeas.  Wrong!  Have tried it twice,  and both times it smelled and tasted just lie what it's made from.  Also,  the texture didn't hold up well.  I made goulash with it,  and had to throw most of it be use it turned to pea mush in record  time.  Regular pasta will hold together much better.  Going to try it in a cold tuna salad with peas,  to see if it can survive that.  I need to try and use up the remaining boxes somehow.  Won't order again.
