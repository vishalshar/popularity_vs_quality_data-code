I already know how to play guitar, I purchased the Jamstik for its MIDI controller capabilities. Bottom line is the latency and response of this is just not reliable if you want to player anything past a 1/4 note. Random notes arbitrarily sound off even if you stay within those confines. I tried playing it one a variety of different systems and daws the latency is just terrible. The reason for the ONE STAR review is because JAMSTIK has flooded Youtube and other sites with deceptive videos and reviews. Its basically false advertising.  I tried this device on a Mac, a beast of a PC, an Iphone 6 plus, and an Galaxy . Across the board it is not usable, and for the price you are getting ripped off. I really wanted this thing to work.Beware of fake reviews and demos of this product.
