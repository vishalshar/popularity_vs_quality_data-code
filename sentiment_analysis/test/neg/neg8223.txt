Im giving this 2 stars since the quality of the plastic is excellent.Just like other reviews here my drone crashed but luckily it was only 6 ft off the ground. Before taking off I tested the installation to make sure they are secure and will not hit the propeller. I even let the motor run a few times while it was on the ground just to verify that there will be no contact once the propellers spin.These do not give enough clearance when the propellers flex when heavy wind blows on them.Im just glad I did not have any damages to my gopro 4 black and solo. I will be returning these since they are useless now and just pose a risk to my investment.
