Stylish, rugged with top of the line hardware specs, but is not ready for primetime IMO! Looks like company has to still built entire eco-system of applications around phone's OS. For my Android phone, I couldn't find supporting phone or messaging application on my watch after struggling to make it work for 8 hours. Then the picture became clear when I read FAQs and TROUBLESHOOTING tips on imcowatch.com website and I quote- Question: "I cannot start a phone call from my cowatch." Answer: "The cowatch doesn't currently support being able to start a phone call from the watch. However, in an OTA update, we will enable  a speed dial container to start phone call to preselected contacts." Similar caveats are given for other smartphone features for Android and iPhone capabilities. If I can't send/receive phone calls and SMS on my smart watch, it is no longer consider as a smart watch! So, Please read carefully what it is capable of doing and what it couldn't at [...]  before making your decision. Don't be mislead by nice videos on YouTube or other promotional sites. To me it is no brainer, this phone has to go through lots of trials and errors and turmoil for that reason I am out!
