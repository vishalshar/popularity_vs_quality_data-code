This knife is a joke. It works for the first 2 passes over the cold butter and then it actually does the exact opposite. Instead of transferring your heat from your hand to the kife to the butter, it actually transfers the cold temperature from the butter to your hand. Your hand gets cold and the knife is no good.Have to say the idea was nice but it doesnt work. The product in it self was very nice and good quality. Wished it would work.
