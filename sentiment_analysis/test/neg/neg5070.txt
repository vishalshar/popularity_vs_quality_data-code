The coding game is useless without the game system (base with red reflector).  You'll need to go the the Osmo website and purchase the game system for $19 for the coding game to work.  I re-read the description and nowhere does it say you need to purchase additional game system. My son was eager to play with this as it was a Christmas present.  Amazon needs to update description to indicate the ******GAME SYSTEM IS SOLD  SEPARATE******
