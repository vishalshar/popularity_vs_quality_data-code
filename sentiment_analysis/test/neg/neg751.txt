If I could give it a zero star I would.  It paired up instantly no problems there. For my firstfind my car.  I could see my car but the signal and direction seemed to be upside down.Then I went to another spot left the ZUS ap running inthe background and it did not recordmy second location.The third time next day it said pair your device again. It took me over 4 times and it still didn't pairI am returning it.  I then went on and read the reviews MANY OF WHICH SAID THE SAME THINGTHAT THE LOCATION FINDER IS INACCURATE.P. S.  I did try the map and again it had the map upside down.If ZUS would like to send me a NEW one that they are sure works I'd be happy to use it again andgive it an honest review if anything changes from this DO NOT BUY RECOMMENDATION.
