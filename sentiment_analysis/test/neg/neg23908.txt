This product had me extremely excited. I purchased it as a supplementary piece to my Amazon Echo after their integration was announced. My experience so far has been that the AnyMote works fairly well from the app (with some quirks that I don't necessarily believe are its fault), however, the voice integration with Alexa has left MUCH to be desired..As far as the product and app itself, there are limitations that I've encountered that appear to be related to the devices in my household, which are no fault of this product, but are still frustrating nonetheless. AnyMote basically functions via your smartphone's Bluetooth connection. This means that in order to control it, you must have Bluetooth enabled on your smartphone, and the AnyMote app must be running in the background. In an age where almost all devices are WiFi-enabled, I would have traded a battery-operated IR blaster for a wired & WiFi-enabled device at this price point. On to the quirks-- some IR devices in my household appear to only support the "Power Toggle" function, not "Power On" or "Power Off". My primary goal for using this product was to make use of the macros that would allow me to turn on my TV, cable box, and surround receiver. My TV supports the power on/off function, however, my cable box and receiver only support toggling. What this translates to is that if at any point someone manually powers on/off the devices or uses the device remote and their power states are not consistent, my macros don't function as intended. Example: TV is off, cable box is on, receiver is off; run the macro to turn everything on-- TV will switch on, cable box will toggle off, receiver will turn on. It's fairly frustrating. The only other complaint I have with the product itself seems to be chalked up to IR devices in general. 90% of the time using the app/macros, I have no issues. 10% of the time, one step of the macro will be missed. The AnyMote is sitting on my coffee table with direct line-of-sight to all of my devices, yet sometimes a portion of my macros won't execute properly. Resolving this takes more time than actually just using the remote.The real issue I have with the product is the proclaimed Alexa integration. The voice functionality of their Skill/app is pretty bad. I'm hoping that it's just a software issue that will be resolved eventually, but Alexa has serious issues with tapping into macros configured using the AnyMote app. There's a "sync" function within the app that I'm assuming is supposed to "push" new macros/updates made via the app to the Alexa Skill (?). This seems to work about 50% of the time. If I create a macro, run the sync function, and try to execute the macro via Alexa, she'll respond saying she couldn't find a macro by the name of "X". If I run the sync function again, then issue the same command to Alexa, she finds and executes the macro. If I walk away for an hour, come back, and try to execute the macro, Alexa will advise that she can't find it. Sync again-- she'll find it. Additionally, naming the macros was fairly difficult as they're pretty complex chains of commands. The macros seem to work well when you keep the name to a single word, however, when you extend the name to "turn on cable TV", the chances of Alexa actually interpreting your phrase and mapping it to a macro is slim.Overall, I'm hopeful for what the product can do in the future, but for now, I'm pretty unimpressed as a whole, especially at the $90 price point. There are alternative products that are not Bluetooth- and smartphone-dependent that I may need to try.
