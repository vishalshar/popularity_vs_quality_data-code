Well, I finally busted a screen... having had Iphones since 2007 and never breaking one.  I had high hopes for this screen repair.  The first package I received was delivered promptly and was not terribly difficult to install.  There were a few issues, the instructions are incorrect in a couple places and the bezel for the home button was not properly cast making the button depress when you screw the back plate on.. all very fixable.  The phone powered up nicely and at first the screen looked ok.  Nice colors and bright.  Then I noticed that the painted(or printed or silk screened) border was larger than the OEM screen and made my screen smaller.  Then I noticed the Proximity sensor did not work (the cause of this is debatable as some say it is the screen itself, some say it is the LCD light bleeding from inside the assembly) and the touchscreen acted a bit wonky.  Texting or emailing turned into a struggle, having to type things three times to get it right.  I reordered another screen and prepared to return the first.  Installed the second screen last night after comparing the black border (the new one looked better).  The new screen functions better but is definitely not a retina display... it has a purple\blue hue to it and looks even worse when viewed from an angle.  Every time I look at it I am disappointed, and I use it a lot.  I would suggest you take the time to send your phone into apple to receive a proper screen that will perform like it should.
