The version I received was a knock off from China ? First of all, the package arrived completely smashed! When we started playing, we realized there are a ton of misspelled words, duplicate cards and a crap ton of phrases that don't make any sense. Don't waste your money on this game! Buy it directly from the website. Trying to get my money refunded.
