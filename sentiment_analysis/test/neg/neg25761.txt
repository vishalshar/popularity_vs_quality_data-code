After what I thought was much and careful research, I ordered this and the August Connect so my wife and I could remotely access the lock from our android phones as advertised.  I installed the lock, plugged in the connect device then uploaded the app as directed.  The first screen you get when you launch is to set up an account.  Just for reference I went to the account setup tutorial on the August web site.  The screen on my phone looked completely different from what it showed I should see.  Entered first name, last name, required phone number (odd) & email as instructed.  Clicked "next" and got a page telling me I was now required to supply a photo (odd again).  Choices were to upload from gallery or take a selfie with phone camera.  Neither option worked, though both did if I accessed them outside the app.  So, unable to set up required account to make product work, I was forced to call into tech support.  After long, long hold, tech came on and struggled with it for quite a while, then said he would just set up an account for me and I could change my password later.  He couldn't do it either, and after another long while on hold ended up telling me they had a system wide "issue" and for me to try later.  I asked to be called back when fixed rather than me get frustrated continually trying to load non-working software.  Never got call.  Two days later I tried to email tech support again and more than 24 hrs later was sent a reply telling me they had seen issues like this with phone that had no memory or storage available with an offer to set up an account for me.  I replied with specifics about my memory and storage (1/3 of memory still available, 98% of storage) indicating that couldn't be the problem but supplied them the necessary info AND a photo to set up the accounts.  Crickets since then, another 24 hr. +.  I haven't seen customer or tech service this bad in more than 10 yrs, and am returning the product as I told them I would if it wasn't quickly and reasonably resolved.  Question:  Why do I have to pay return freight costs on this defective product?  This really chaffs me and I am a long-time and loyal Prime member.
