Though I was hesitant to buy these based on some of the feedback I read, I thought I'd try these for my son, who has special needs, to help him when I'm not there to tie his shoes.2 broke within the week and another broke the following week.  In the few months he's had these, he now only has 3 left on each shoe.  ARE YOU SERIOUS?My son is not athletic, preferring to spend time building Legos and playing with dinosaurs so it's not like he's working these hard in anyway.The concept is great and to help my son, I had really hoped these would work.  But the actual product is horrible.
