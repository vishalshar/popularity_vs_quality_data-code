Excited about the product potential use ... disappointed of the actual use. I had a clean wall and removed the bubbles ... came home the next day to start a study group and found the large one crumpled on the floor. :( apparently it didn't stick ... Keeping the other clear boards on the wall by using pushpins .... This is more like a half star
