As soon as you put your head under water, the sound kicks out (both using bluetooth and playing local song files). The water also triggers the touch controls, making it impossible to listen to music while swimming. I actually consider this false advertising, the video with the swimmer listening to music is total nonsense. Also, the max volume is still quite low. I can't believe I spent $300 on a product so worthless, at least for water use.
