The headphones never connected. We fully charged them and did everything correctly and the Bluetooth would not connect. Very disappointing as these were my fianc√©s big gift and they were very pricey and such a bummer that they wouldn't even connect right out of the box. We sent them back right away for a full refund and I will be getting him the Apple AirPods instead.
