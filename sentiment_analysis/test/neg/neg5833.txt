The only reason I am giving this a 2 star is because it did not work for me.  I loved the way this product tasted!  I was so excited that I found something that would replace sugar and taste like it.  It doesn't have any awful after taste.  Unfortunately this product did not agree with me.  It gave me terrible digestive distress after just using 1 tsp in my coffee.  After researching further, I found that this can happen with some people.  I must say, I was so disappointed.  If this doesn't bother with your digestion, then this is the product for you.  It tastes great.  Better than all the Stevia products for sure!
