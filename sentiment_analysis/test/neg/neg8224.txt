I agree with the other posts asserting that these prop guards will make your drone crash. I was flying my Solo in open air, nothing around. With a little bit of wind, the Solo's props will flex. A small amount of prop flex will cause them to come in contact with the prop guards, which then shatters your props, sending your valuable drone plummeting to the ground. DO NOT BUY THESE PROP GUARDS.
