I ordered this one because it's pretty and it's big. It claims to be able to cover a larger amount of area but I don't find that to be the case. Iv'e used it for the past 3 days and I don't think it works any better than the smaller $30 range ones that I've bought.  If you want something that looks good then it's okay, but if no,t the less expensive ones will do the same thing.
