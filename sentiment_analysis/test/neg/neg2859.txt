It was great while it worked. Setup went well and the bulb was recognized in the LIFX app on my Asus Android Tablet and linked to the Echo Alexa app. Firmware updated successfully. Voice and app control both worked for a week, then became unresponsive. I reset the bulb (5 on/off cycles), re-installed from scratch and all was well. Every few days, it would become unresponsive and need a manual turn on/off, then OK. BTW, it's less than 5 feet from the router on a small network - 2 pc's, one tablet, Alexa, 1 WeMo switch.  Another week or so later, it became unresponsive. I've tried everything - deleting profiles, un-linking from Alexa, rebooted everything (router, modem, computer, Alexa) multiple times. Downloaded the windows version of the app and tried that. I can sometimes add the light (in either app), log it onto the wireless network, name it, etc.  Sometimes it just hangs when 'reconnecting to Wi-Fi network'. Other times, it completes successfully, but Alexa no longer discovers it (EVER).I mean, this is supposed to be fun & easy, right? (The only other Alexa controlled device I have so far is a Belkin WeMo switch, which has worked perfectly 100% of the time.) This bulb is going back to Amazon. As irritating as this experience has become, I'm not sure that I'll try another one.
