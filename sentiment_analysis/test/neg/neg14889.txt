We are five weeks into the school year and nearly half of these have snapped in half rendering the shoes completely unwearable. These were for my 9 year old daughter who isn't crazy, just runs in PE and recess and plays volleyball. Very disappointed. Save yourself the hassle and get lace locks, the silicon material of the hickies just doesn't last.
