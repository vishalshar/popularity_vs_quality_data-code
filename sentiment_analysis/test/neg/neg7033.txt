I've been putting this review off for a while, but finally have some time to kill so here it goes...After doing a lot of research for the "best" car mount on Amazon, I ended up trying this one based on reviews and price. I needed something that would hold my S6 from the windshield and withstand vibrations and heat so I could use my phone to record my racing events. All the reviews I read regarding these aspects were positive, so I gave it a shot. I purchased it at the end of July and have only used it a handful of times due to the product failing... To be fair, Arizona heat is brutal in the summer and is likely the cause for this product failing. More details below...I'll start this review with the positives:The design is excellent, with plenty of adjustability and user-friendly functionality. Also, the suction cup holds extremely well once it's stuck to something.As soon as I received the mount I installed it on my windshield where I wanted the camera angle from my phone. I had an autocross event the following weekend and the mount worked excellently. The phone was steady the entire time and the mount held up to the 100+ degree heat just fine. The mount actually did better than my phone that day... my phone kept overheating and shutting off during the event... I decided to leave the mount up on the window since I had it in the perfect position already and it held up so well.Now the negatives:Two weeks go by after the event and I started hearing slight rattling noises coming from the windshield area. I noticed the main joint and the ball joint on the mount had become loose. I tighten them back up, being careful not to over-tighten them since it's all made of plastic and it was hot out, and the mount held up fine again for a little while... then everything went downhill.A few days later I go to put my phone in the mount and come to find out one of the rubber pads in the holding arms fell out. I finally found it on the floor of my car (black carpet) after searching around for 10 minutes and stuck it back in the arm. The heat must have melted the adhesive enough to make it drop from the mount. The joints also became loose again. This time, instead of tightening them down more I decided to remove the mount from the windshield and only use it for racing events because I thought the constant heat was too much for the plastic parts.The suction cup was a pain to get off the windshield. I was able to get it off using the suction cup tab, but the entire time I was peeling it off the window I thought it was going to tear or leave a bunch of adhesive behind for me to clean up. Thankfully it all came off intact. I put the little suction cup protector back on to protect it from getting dirty while I stored it in my apartment away from the heat.A few more weeks go by and another race comes up...The suction cup protector nearly tore the adhesive off the suction cup while I tried taking it off. I don't think it was ever meant to be put back on and taken off again. After getting it off I put the mount back on the windshield and put my phone in the mount. I had to tighten the joints a little bit to keep everything from moving. Everything seems fine on my way to the event and the phone was held securely. Then halfway through the day I notice my phone starting to move around. I go to check the joints and to my surprise I am able to ROTATE the entire mount from the suction cup. I'm pretty sure this wasn't a "feature" of this mount... Somehow the suction cup became detached from the mount on the inside and there's no way to lock it back down.In addition to this, the main joint became loose again and the tightener stripped when I tried to make it tight. I was VERY careful not to over-tighten it, but as I started to put tension on it to hold the arm steady the threads slipped. It was as if the threads became soft and couldn't hold their shape; again, probably due to the heat. The ball joint also wouldn't hold steady anymore. I had the locking collar tightened all the way down to where it wouldn't budge anymore and the cradle still moved around without much force.Since that day the mount has just been sitting in my apartment collecting dust...I'm very disappointed with this mount, but in all fairness the 100-115 degree heat is probably what caused the issues. I think the reviews about it holding up to high temps got my hopes up. Either way, I'm stuck having to buy another mount now and I can assure you it won't be left in my car on hot days and it won't be another iOttie mount.If you live an area that doesn't see temps go up over 100 degrees you'll probably be safe buying this mount, but I can't say for sure.
