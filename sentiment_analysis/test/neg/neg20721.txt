I really want to like this product but am greatly disappointed that other reviewers were correct on its inaccuracies.  Out of the box it is a very nice to look at and very easy to use and sync.  However at the end of every day I am upset to see that I only take 200 steps per day (I am not a vegetable) or that the sleep tracking isn't working at all.  The bracelet is scratchy and uncomfortable and when clipping to clothing the accuracy is even worse.  Nice start, needs major improvements.
