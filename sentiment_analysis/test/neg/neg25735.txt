This device is terrible. You have heard others say it gets hot - it gets incredibly hot. I would say about 60 deg c.This happens the minute you plug in power and have the laptop open.So if you want to charge your laptop and phone with the lid close - that's fine.What I wanted was a device that would give me USB2/3 at the same time as SD and to be able to charge the laptop.This does that except I am too afraid to leave this plugged in for long so it's no more useful than unplugging the power to temporarily use a USB adapter.I have got access to a thermal camera at work and when I have a chance I will add some images so you can see this thing gets stupidly hot.After about 4 uses the SD reader failed. Not surprising given the heat. The is junk. DON'T BUYAnd Amazon do not offer any warrantee beyond their return policy.I don't think I will ever buy from Amazon again!!
