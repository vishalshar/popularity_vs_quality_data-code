First, I love budget phones... Huawei Honor 5X is one of the best phones I ever bought for under $200. I was buying the Posh Mobile as a backup phone and wanted a large screen phone. I really liked the Posh phone when I opened the box but that's where it ended. Very sluggish, glitches ext. GPS did not work at all. I think Posh needs a little more tweaking and they will be a great company like Huawei.
