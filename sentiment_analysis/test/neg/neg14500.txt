The concept was interesting, but considering the cost of the product, I think it's capabilities are severely lacking. I was thinking it would be able to do motion tracking at least on the level of modern console remotes (considering this is the same price or more expensive), but as far as I can tell, it only has accelerometers. This is about as useful as a Bluetooth enabled tamberine.The app was well made and diverse.
