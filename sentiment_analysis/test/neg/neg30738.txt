I'm overall pretty disappointed in this case. I shopped around and researched lots of potential cases, and granted, I had originally decided on the earlier version of this case (the one that includes a magnet with the kit). This one does not (the magnet mount was my main motivation for trying a non-Otterbox case).Also, the case was loose on my phone, meaning my phone slid around a bit inside it. I padded the inside with the screen protector masks. For $40, I feel like it should just fit. The rubber bumper does indeed seem silly, and it tries to pop off when I put the phone in my pocket. I wonder how much shock protection the shell offers on its own, since it's just a layer of hard plastic?Lastly, the mounting system is a little tricky. It takes a decent amount of force to lock/unlock the phone from the mount. I'm worried how this will effect the case's longevity over time.Anyway, I'll keep it as a backup (since I love my otterbox, but it's on the verge of breaking) and keep searching for a better case.
