I had high expectations for this controller. I enjoy home automation and IoT, and thought the Blossom had promise. After a year of no app updates to improve their sorely lacking functionality, my Blossom has died. I've tried power cycling and resetting the unit, but it does not respond. I'm trying to contact Blossom for a replacement under warranty. We'll see how that goes. I'll probably sell the replacement unit and use the $ to buy a Rachio.
