I'm still playing around with this thermometer but it doesn't measure accurately. I am a nurse and thought for my own kids this would be fantastic. I love the app and the idea of logging symptoms and seeing history for each child. However the thermometer measures very low both under the tongue and under the arm. Not the quality I was looking for based on the reviews I read.
