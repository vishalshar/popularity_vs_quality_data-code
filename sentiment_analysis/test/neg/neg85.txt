These docks are garbage, quite frankly. When you use a genuine Apple cable (which of course is the only cable that works, you can't use a third party one like Amazon Basics), the devices wiggle around when they are placed on the dock. Why? Because the way it sits, it has the connector, then the plastic piece, then it meshes flushed with the dock. So rather than the device sitting almost flush with the bottom of the cradle, it's balancing a few mm off the dock. With an iPhone 6+ and iPad mini, the results were downright meh. Further adding to the problem, despite the fact that it was threaded properly, the Apple connector isn't firmly in place. Because you take the cable and thread it through the "adapter", then stick the adapter in the cradle. So I found that my connector would tend to push slightly down and up...basically, it's just not a great device if you own an Apple product. If I owned an Android, the cables that come with it are one piece. That is, there isn't an "adapter" really, it just has a micro USB. It wouldn't push around, the fitament would be better, you name it.The dock itself is heavily constructed and feels well-built. But the overall fit of my Apple devices is terrible, and the interaction with the genuine Apple cable is very poor.
