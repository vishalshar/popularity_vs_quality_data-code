I really want to like it but it is going back.  The Bluetooth is terrible.  My phone needs to be about 4' away max and not in my pocket.  If they come back with a better version in the future I will reconsider.  The app is also often not connecting to the earbuds.  I downloaded the app on Android, Iphone and sideloaded one on a Blackberry.  The mic is working very good and the conversations are crystal clear on both sides.
