Sadly, pebble is going down the drain, they've been bought out by another company.This is a great time to buy a heavily discounted watch, full price, not so much.This can be looked at as a 'no frills' watch but it really isn't...  the monochrome display isn't as entertaining as a full color touch screen so if you're looking for entertainment look elsewhere.  Displays incoming phone number and reminders on the watch, has a heart monitor and displays steps (though I haven't calibrated steps yet) and does the rest of the things that make up a good smart watch.Has a good iOS app and I believe it can link Apple's "Health" system but I don't feel the need for that so I haven't experimented.For the price it's a great deal.Beware:  Pebble seems to have changed the model names on these watches:Amazon sells a "pebble 2" that's actually a "pebble 2 SE" as it's called on the pebble web site, the difference being that the SE doesn't have the heart monitor.  I'd you want the heart monitor from Amazon buy the "pebble 2 + heart rate"' which is the  same name that the pebble site gives it.Also the pebble web site has a spec sheet page that shows the "pebble 2" as having the heart monitor... I got bitten by that one and had to send mine back and bought the "pebble 2  + heart monitor" that I wanted in the first place.  Not a big deal if you pay attention.
