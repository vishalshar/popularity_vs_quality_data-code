Edit: Still find this watch to be beautiful, but that's where it starts and stops. I wore my FitBit today with it, and after only 4 hours my Withings has counted 3717 steps and my FitBit has counted 5382 steps. That's over a 40% difference..not even close! Entirely unacceptable in my opinion.These watch has real potential. It's attractive, tracks sleep and steps fairly accurately, and doesn't stand out on your wrist like the competitive fitness bands do. I also love that I can swap out the bands for any 18mm band for day to day wear.But here's where its major downfall: apparently, the only activity that Withings sees as "exercise" is running/walking and swimming. That's right, when you manually log activities, it doesn't count towards your weekly 150 minutes of activity goal, which is absolutely insane to me. So the weird butterfly at the top of the app with the wings that fill out depending on how well you're doing? The one for exercise is always empty, regardless of whether you're laying on the couch all day or spending 18 hours per day at the gym.The app is also atrocious. Laid out so poorly and takes forever to refresh.Finally, the silent alarm falls short. You can't set multiple alarms, so if you like to get up at one time during the week and another during the weekend, you can't set alarms accordingly. You must change the alarm manually. You also can't quiet the alarm once it starts going off you have to wait for an excrutiating 8 vibrations before it will shut off.The bottom line is I want to like this watch. And I'm hoping that since most of my complaints are app driven, that they can update this soon.
