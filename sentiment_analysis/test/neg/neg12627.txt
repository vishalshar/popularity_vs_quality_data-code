I love the brand and quality of the product, however the listing title is misleading. I searched for the Hip and Joint treats, saw it titled as such in the listing, and placed the order. I didn't realize until I opened the package that I ordered the Skin and Coat treats. When you add this product to your cart, you have to go to your cart and look at the title, not the picture shown (they contradict one another).
