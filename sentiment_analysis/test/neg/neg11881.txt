I hate to say it, but the ones who posted reviews saying that it's not loud enough and/or doesn't work properly were right.You know how LOUD the musical cards are that you see in stores? They're usually loud enough that I quickly close the card out of embarrassment, because it's almost always a horrible earwig of a song that immediately gets stuck in my head. Well, this was maybe a fifth as loud as those, if not quieter. FAR TOO SUBTLE for what's SUPPOSED to be a PRANK greeting card! Don't dare give this to someone in a busy restaurant, because no one will even be able to tell a song is even playing!And to think, I was dumb enough to pay for expedited shipping on this. I paid $18 for a card to help celebrate my mom's 70th birthday, & she never even realized it was a joke card!!!I was really hoping that people were being overly critical on this one, but NO. They were SPOT ON. Until some MAJOR, DRASTIC improvements are made in the design, DO NOT BOTHER.
