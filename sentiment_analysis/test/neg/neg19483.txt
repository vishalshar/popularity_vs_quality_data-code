I generally love the case as it provides very good protection including screen protection.  There is just enough of a lip around the phone to allow for the phone to be placed screen down while not allowing the screen to touch the surface, even with a glass screen protector on.However, the card band or wallet function is not optimal.  Any card I have in front becomes damaged.  The quarter inch or so that the card is sticking out rubs in my pocket damaging the card.  I now have two cards that are peeling due to this.  Would be fine if the little band was high enough to completely cover the cards.Finally, the cut-outs for the data/charger and audio are very small.  I find it very hard to fit anything but the default apple cables into the phone with this case on.  If I do manage to force the cables in, they eventually fallout or do not make full connection.I've stopped using this case to save my cards and to allow charging and AUX cable use.
