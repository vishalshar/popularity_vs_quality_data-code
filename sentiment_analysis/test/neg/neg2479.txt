Where do I start, the pulse ox heart rate feature is not user friendly. You have to remove it from worn location,to use it.The battery life too short, requires recharge every 3 days.The wrist band,not comfortable. CONSTANT updates to phone app,which maybe ok if you need hourly metrics.I would neither  recommend or even gift my current Pulse Ox device.Hopefully newer generations will be better.
