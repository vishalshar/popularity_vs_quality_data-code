So far, so "slow". I bought this as a more reasonable option to my current AXIS and OPTEX laser scanner setup. The only issue is by the time its detected a person,car,animal etc and told you on your phone, its already 20 seconds behind. That doesn't do it for things like presence when you are home, only presence after the fact. Anyone else have similar performance issues ?
