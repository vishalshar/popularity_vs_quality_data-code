Does not use your wireless router.  Will not notify your phone unless you are in Bluetooth range.  And it stopped working after 5 minutes, could not get it to work again.  Does not reach between walls.  Way too expensive.Now if it used your wireless router and messaged your phone and it worked it would be worth the money but it doesn't.
