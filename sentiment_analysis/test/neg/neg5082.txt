I bought the Tado because I wanted a middle ground option between buying a (not so "Smart") Air Conditioner (which typically relies on a vendor app with limited functionality, no real interaction with other services - such as nest - and uses some cloud service that might disappear at any point in the future) and having to build the control electronics myself. Alas, the Tado relies on both an app, and a remote service, but I was willing to overlook that in return for the promise of using IFTTT type integration with other products in my apartment. Plugging it in and downloading the firmware update was straightforward, but that's where things went downhill quickly. The app was clearly written by absolute novice programmers. Beyond that, there was literally a screen (after I had programmed it with the codes for my AC) in which it said it would randomly cycle through temperatures on my AC - which it then did and would not stop. After killing the power and convincing it to reset, it was vaguely possible to remote control my AC with several more steps than you'd possibly think were reasonable, and none of the remote integration features.Don't waste your time with this unit. Buy one of the others, or do what I'm going to do and build yourself a remote control using a SBC (RasPi or similar) and an IR interface. It'll cost you less, work forever - even after the company making this goes away - and you'll have complete control over the experience. This device is another one of those "Internet of S***" products that are entering the market without real execution in mind.
