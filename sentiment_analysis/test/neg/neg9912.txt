So I bought a Ghostbed mattress and boxspring, and I was happy during the trial period. Then they sent me an email touting their brand new pillow! As a happy and loyal customer during the trial period, I thought "why not try the pillow." Surely they must appreciate a loyal customer buying their new product right at launch -- these customers must be their core!Fast forward a few weeks. The mattress gives more, and I am not getting the quality sleep I did at the beginning, and Ghostbed's sales of their new pillow are not as expected. So they email a 2-for-1 special deal for the pillows. The most loyal customers who bought on day one get nothing. I email Ghostbed expressing my disappointment."Ryan,I am disappointed. I was among the first people to order the Ghost Pillow as soon as it became available, and now you offer this special if I would have waited."The initial response is understanding and empathetic of my situation, and the "Dennis" is copied, with a hint that he should make the situation right:"Hi Andy,Let me forward your email to Dennis.  He might be able to help us out!Ryan MonahanChief Brand OfficerGhostBed | Crafted Perfection"Dennis does not respond...for a day...a week...two weeks...finally I send a follow-up email asking where this stands. I receive no response. I send a second follow-up email. I receive no response. I email the original gentleman who was empathetic (Ryan). I receive no response.So I have to say, this pillow is nothing special compared to other products on the market, including many that are less expensive.If the product were the only question, I would give it a 3 based on the value for what I received, but the unprofessional manner of not responding earns them a 1. I would have given them a 3 had marketing just responded saying that they could not do anything.Hello Ryan, Dennis? Anyone there? Your company is "Crafted Unprofessionalism". Buy the same or better quality pillow from a better company. Cheers
