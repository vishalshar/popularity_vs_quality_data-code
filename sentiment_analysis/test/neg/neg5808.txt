This thing has a long way to go before it is ready for prime time... I wanted to love this device. I really did. In fact, on the surface it should be able to do what I want. Why does it get 2 stars then? For one, check out the other reviews... none of them verified Amazon purchases which makes this vendor seem more than a little shady to begin with. Second, the signal coverage is deplorable. It seems very much sensitive to how "exposed" the FOB is to the the receiver, so if it is in your pocket then you could have your computer lock on you randomly when swiveling around in your chair for example. Second, it doesn't always immediately lock either when walking away.I work in cyber security so I am very familiar with regulatory compliance and what would be considered "secure" and what would not be... This device is **NOT** secure the way it is designed and I would NOT trust it to protect sensitive data or meet regulatory requirements. The major overlooked security flaw? I run a VM in a second monitor off of my macbook. While the GK software DOES lock the Mac OS, it leaves the Windows VM completely unlocked and open!!!! Wow, not much security there guys! Some ideas if the vendor is reading this... Fix the signal issues and maybe offer a 2FA solution too... And especially fix what I would consider to be a MAJOR security flaw that it leaves a VM completely open and unlocked which anyone with a lick of tech knowledge knows that this is just an opening to be able to bypass the device entirely...FYI - It does not use the mac OS login, it uses a screensaver and thus is very "buggy". Overall great concept, but this like I said is not even CLOSE to being ready for primetime or for use in a business environment.
