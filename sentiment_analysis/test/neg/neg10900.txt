To say that this mug won't tip over is not really a true statement.  Understand that it must be tightly secured with the suction cup at the bottom in order to prevent it from tipping.  If the surface it is sitting on is not compatible with the suction cup it is no different than any other mug.  My son did enjoy spending over an hour testing it out on various surfaces and with a variety of force behind tipping attempts so if you are in the market for a novelty item without high expectations go for it!
