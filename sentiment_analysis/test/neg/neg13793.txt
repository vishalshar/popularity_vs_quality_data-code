My 8 year old loves this set.  Comes with just a few sticks so definitely buy more replacement filament.  Pretty easy to use. UPDATE: First project went well.  With my son's second little project the pen jammed.  Removed the nozzle and nothing was clogged in the nozzle.  Will be returning.  So sad, because it was great while it worked for 30 minutes.
