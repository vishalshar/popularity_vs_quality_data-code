I bought this Shine 2 to replace my Fitbit, which I had lost twice, in two years.  Forget about it!  The first 4 days I wore the Shine, it popped out of its wristband 4 times; and once the entire wristband popped off.  In addition, it's hard to get data off it.  My Fitbit sync'd automatically with my Windows laptop, via a USB dongle.  The PC application which I downloaded and installed for the Shine doesn't work - when I try to open it, it says I have the wrong serial number, and it closes the app.  The kicker here is, I was never prompted to provide a serial number when I installed the app.  And the sync with my Android smart phone is not automatic, it has to be manually run; plus, it only works if you have an Internet connection.  No Bluetooth.  This product is a waste of money.
