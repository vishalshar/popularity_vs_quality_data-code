Their customer support is awful. My tracker quit working 3 weeks ago and they've made me do everything from pressing buttons, to power cycling the base station, to moving the plug, to taking pictures of the pins on the tracker/base station...none of this has helped. The tracker is dead and they won't do anything to help me. They stopped replying to emails a week ago. You'd think they would ship you a box to return your broken devices, then immediately send you a replacement, and then they can troubleshoot the device on their own time. Instead they've wasted almost a month of my time and money trying to troubleshoot an obviously broken device. If I can ever get ahold of them again, I will be asking for a refund of the device and the year of service that I've paid for already.
