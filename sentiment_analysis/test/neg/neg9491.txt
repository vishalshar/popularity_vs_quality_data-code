Do not buy this. It requires you to turn on the camera and then push the filter on. When you do this the gimbal is actively trying to stabilize so you risk damaging the gimbal. There are other manufacturers that allow you to leave the filter on unlike this one.To be fair I read that they are launching a Cinema series filter that can be left on in January so until then do not buy this product. Now I have to pay shipping to return it. ARGHHHH!
