I got my Misift 3 weeks back and absolutely loved it. It is super-accurate, looks good and I was so waiting for better bands to come out so that I could rid myself of the tacky plastic.And it gave away in just 3 weeks at the worst possible place. My Shine 2 slipped out of the band while walking around a theme park. No jostling, no jerky movement, just like that while walking.I found it in 5-10 min but unfortunately with so many people walking over it, it's now full of scratches. Works - it's amazingly sturdy but looks ugly.DO NOT BUY THIS TILL MISFIT FIXES THE BAND ISSUE!!
