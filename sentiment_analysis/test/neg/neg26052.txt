Ok...so in reality, this is actually just a "rebirth" of the Goped PROPED Scooter. Literally, the same thing. I wish I had known that first, it's actually kind of sad this was a succesfull kick-starter when it's just a knock-off of an old failed idea.Anyway, the propane engine does not have nearly enough power, and it is not reliable what so ever. The packing is awful (first one I got the front rotor was bent completely in-ward)It's a good "IDEA" but not a NEW one, it's flawed and that's all there is to it. Maybe if they could actually put a motor on it that is reliable and has GOOD power, that would change it, but really, this is just a knock-off of the failed Pro-ped, even the same awful LEHR motor is on this scooter.
