I got this for myself, used it for 12 hours total, gave it away. I can't see how such a ridiculous design was ever released. The leaf itself is huge on a wrist and doesn't look quite right on. The device is just too thick. As a pendent it's too large on an average chain. I didn't bother trying it as a clip.Synching the device with the app is supposed to take a quick double tap on the device. It took on average 12 taps and a couple of ranting outbursts, then it would synch. Here's the kicker: I am a HIGHLY active person on a normal day but on the day I tried the leaf I was doing yard work all day. That means I canvassed my yard dragging leaves and plants for 8 hours at least. The leaf registered 156 steps. My Fitbit recorded miles of steps, but as I was walking behind my lawn mower my Leaf buzzed to alert me to move. At that point it just pissed me off so I gave it to my mother in law
