Seriously puzzling product due to inadequate, scattered, documentation.  Initially, you power it up, install the Gramofon Setup app, follow the instructions (first putting your device onto the Gramofon's own wifi network), ultimately type in your own home wifi network details (including password, which must not contain certain characters).  My network's password did contain '!', and, since '"' and '?', as I recall, were listed as not allowed, I thought *maybe* '!' wasn't, either, so I changed my password (requiring us to alter this on all connected devices).  That appeared to get us further along, but the AllPlay app was never able to detect the Gramofon on our network.Just now, researching this a bit further, I'm seeing that you can get far better results if the firmware is updated.  I purchased mine on Amazon on September 18 (one week ago; still not functional), and mine has firmware version 1.2.26.  Reading here,[...] I see that, if I update to 3.0.15, things could look better.  In fact, in another Amazon review, the purchaser raves about the results of this update.  I'm ready.  Oops, the caveat with this is that reference claims the following:  "If you use a firewall, please make sure that port 7547 is opened to enable the upgrade."Hmm.  How desperate am I to open up my firewall?  I'm not, really.  The documentation isn't specific about whether this port must be accessed outbound or inbound; if it was outbound, I'd be fine with it.  But, if it was outbound, why didn't my device automatically reach out and find and install the upgrade?  Roku does that, I think.  Let's see if anything happens if I restart the Gramofon (could be, it did pull down the upgrade, and needs a restart) ...  Nope.  No luck there.Let me figure out my MAC address, for this device, file my support ticket, and see what happens.  I will attempt to clarify the part about opening up the port, and what use my MAC address could be to someone not on my network.  We'll see ...
