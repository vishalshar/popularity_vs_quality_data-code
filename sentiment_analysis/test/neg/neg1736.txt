I had high hopes. Ive bought hundreds of products off amazon. This is my first review as i feel as though this product is being misrepresented here on amazon. I cannot understand why there could be so many positive reviews.... it's suspicious to say the least. Perhaps because I am a Canadian attorney this makes me skeptical about virtually everything... news flash everyone lies lol.I bought this about 3 months ago on the basis of the reviews on here. I bought the main unit and extras... But I've been woken up constantly by excessive vibration and magnetic distortion alerts. Look it up on their site. They don't have a solution. With magnetic doors they say to move it down a bit.. doesn't work... I wish they would have the same product with motion detectors or something else like traditonal sensors if possible because otherwise it's a great product. Great app etc. But the sensors are simply unreliable. And I do have extendors installed etc. I am very techy and post graduate educated. Now I'm off to try and find something better sigh. Going to try the sabre system.  I had the skylink one before this and it was junk too. It's was nice and simple on off type alarm but it started mixing the.modes up (ie the slide button toggle broke).Firmware update on korner didn't fix my issues either.Another thing to take note of is its not loud enough. I would say it's about 50 decibels. I'm no expert and I don't have any measuring device. I'm just doing a proportional comparison as between it and my 85 decibel smoke alarm. My system also suffered from delay times in motion and the alarm. As an example, I came home one night and opened the door. I had left the alarm on and forgot to turnnit off on arrival. I was up the stairs and rounding the corner of my split level style house before the alarm went off. What does this tell me... the killer would be in my bedroom before I even was wake lol.Finally, at no time did korner support suggest my product was defective or offer a switch. Therefore I do not believe the unit was defective.
