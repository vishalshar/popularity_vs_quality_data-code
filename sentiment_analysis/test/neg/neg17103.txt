I cannot get my two cats to even sniff it without immediately turning away. I have one cat that typically eats anything put in front of him. So, this was the first time he completely rejected a food source. I looked closer at the actual food and it looked like the makers put fish head or some type of grainy looking inner guts. There were some sardines, but even for cat food...it looked really unappealing.
