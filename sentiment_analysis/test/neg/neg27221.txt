Worst $300 I've ever spent. The latency is frustrating, to say the least. The sensitivity of the fret-board might be okay for someone playing 1 note every 5 seconds, but if you try to play anything remotely quickly, you get a silly-sounding cluster of notes that you aren't trying to play. The fact that this guitar is being marketed as a learning tool makes me disgusted. How is any beginner supposed to learn successfully on an instrument that  entirely disregards the importance of keeping tempo?? With the ridiculous latency, I could pluck a string twice in quick succession before even hearing the first note come through the speakers. I hope this review saves someone else a week of their time (3 days for delivery, 5 minutes of disappointment followed by 5 minutes of throwing it back into the box and taping it up for return, and another 5 days for a refund).On the bright side, because of this piss-poor excuse for a musical instrument, I was able to experience Amazon's return policy for the first time. That was the best part of my Jamstik+ experience. If Amazon allowed me to rate this lower than 1 star, I wouldn't hesitate for a moment. 0/5 stars
