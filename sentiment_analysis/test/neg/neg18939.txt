waste of money, kills battery super fast, and then its very hard to unscrew and put new batteries, i bought 2 brands of the top rated rechargeable and still they die super fast in 30 minutes, also the robot balance is not that great, i bought it for a Christmas gift and it came in an ugly box without the brand packaging, I don't recommend at all .
