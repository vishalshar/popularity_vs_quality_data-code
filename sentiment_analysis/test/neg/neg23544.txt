Had some issues getting it setup at first. Seems like with most of these sticks the firmware on it has to be updated by resetting your router. Wish they had a 5 or even 7-pack option, as my apartment has a lot of windows. Once I finally got it setup, the stick kept going offline or disconnecting. I've never been able to use it for 3 consecutive days in a row so I'm returning this product ASAP. I really wanted to support a cool startup, but they still have kinks to work out.
