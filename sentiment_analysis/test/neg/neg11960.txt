This adapter is very handsome. The space grey version doesn't exactly match my MacBook Pro's finish, but it was close. It is compact and seems well made by appearance.The problem is that when connected, the adapter would only work if it was angled into the USB-C port of my computer. Not good. Hopefully the manufacturer will sort this out and get a better v2 product out.
