This is an ingenious product to get that last bit of that favorite lip gloss from the bottom of the tube, but it's a bit overpriced and the quality of the product doesn't match the price.  I would suggest coming down to 7.99 or 8.99.  Nonetheless, it works great and I've extended the life of my favorite color
