terrible customer service - originally their windows app didn't even work so I had to buy a cheap Android tablet to set them up.Works fine with Echo once you do - it easily finds them on the network.lately I can not connect to either bulb so I have two $40 LED'S I'm controlling via a switch. I changed routers and the only way to re-connect them was to delete factory reset them but that still doesn't work. It's been at least a week since I followed up to their e-mail that I'm still having problems, provided detail on what the problem is and still no response.I do not recommend you buy these until they get the bugs worked out. Also the price has almost doubled in the last couple months since they released two new models at a similar higher price. I paid $29 for mine.
