So far it is very disappointing. I got one small tasty mushroo, then it went dormant. The instructions say to spray it twice a day, but no guidance on how mush. This appears to be a child's  project to show his first grade class. I thought I was buying a kit that would produce mushrooms for me to eat on a regular basis. I was wrong. I do not recommend it. Save your money or buy some other kit. This is a total waste.
