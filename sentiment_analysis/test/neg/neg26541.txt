No good! I bought this unit because I travel a lot but the software does not work correctly. I set it for "Smart" watering so I wouldn't need to worry about the weather and what not when I was gone. I have 9 zones and all were set for about 15 minutes which should take about 2 hours and 15 minutes; however, on the home screen it said it was set to run for 8 hours. Which one was correct? I just cant take that chance. There are other software bugs too such as, I ran a cycle earlier today but it says the last completed cycle was yesterday. With this system you can only set the system to automatically water once per day.I am going to purchase the Rachio. It costs more but it appears to work properly. And you can set multiple waters per day for different zones.
