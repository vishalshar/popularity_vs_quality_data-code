Not the best choice case for kids.  This case has no screen cover, it is a rubberized case that goes around the outside and back of the iPad.  I would not recommend it for use on a kids iPad.  If your kid carries it with the handle, it sort of pulls the case away from the iPad, and allows it to wiggle around a little and could possibly fall out on to the ground
