I thought I should promote these new interesting invention.. seems like I am wrong. The product does not stick to any thing.. day 1 it was good, it stuck in glass and wall. Day 2, my phone fell twice since the product did not hold it. Now day 3.. it's mere paper . Does not stick to anything.. I trashed all of the packaging , that's the only reason am not asking for refund
