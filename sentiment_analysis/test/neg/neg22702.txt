I have owned Moov for approximately two weeks. I love the concept and the actual device. Before purchasing I spent hours reading reviews and learning about the pros and cons. One of the most consistent pieces of feedback I found, across all forums, was that the disc slips from the band and many people have lost the device. I decided to move forward knowing this big problem existed and played it off to those folks having a defective band or bad luck. I made sure to keep the band tight around my wrist to avoid any slippage and it worked. Today, I glanced down and noticed that THE DISC WAS GONE! It had slipped out at some point throughout the day and I didn't notice right away. Now I am out $80 and the device is gone.For a problem that is so well documented and known by the company, and with little in the way to address the issue with customers, I can say that the Moov is a WASTE OF MONEY. Unless you are going to duct tape the device to your wrist, you might as well take your $80 and spend it elsewhere.With this problem, it truly isnt a matter of IF the device will fall out, but WHEN it will fall out. So DISAPPOINTED and bummed. I would give it 4-5 stars if not for the s***ty design.
