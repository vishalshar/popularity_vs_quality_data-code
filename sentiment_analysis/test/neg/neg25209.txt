I wanted so so badly to like this phone, I really did. And the first couple weeks with it were awesome. It's incredibly stylish, and the layout is super intriguing--the graphic designer in me is still mourning the fact that I am no longer going to use it. But I need form and function, and this phone is all form no function.The camera is awful--it's slow and only in perfect lighting situations do the pictures turn out. As a social media manager I need to be able to quickly take and post images, but with this phone I can't even crop an image in their gallery app so I end up having to use 5 apps before I can, and the picture still looks bad.I can't play music and use maps at the same time, so that makes long car trips super annoying.The group messages are spotty. Sometimes they work, sometimes they just flat out don't and I miss crucial information from my coworkers and friends. Not. Cool.The regular messages are spotty. It has major issues downloading any pictures of gifs that are sent to me and sometimes just text messages and I have no idea why this is.The battery life rarely lasts a full day, and since they don't include the "quick charger" (which is pretty lame) you're stuck with wall chargers you already have that might take 5 hours to charge your phone. Thats insane.The finger print scanner is garbage. GARBAGE.Despite my thousands of issues I am still sad to leave this phone because it is so pretty and lightweight. And I will say that their customer service is awesome, but this phone is just not ready for 2016 it needs more time. I would consider going back to it once these issues have been ironed out.
