I bought this for my 7 year old son.  The package arrived within two to three days (Prime member).  The app was easy to download, the set-up was simple and the instructions were clear.  My son was excited when the drone first took off, which was immediately, by the way, however, it did not "handle" well.  Although the drone took off within 2 seconds of pressing the app on my phone (I was not able to really use my tablet; it only took off once...the directions even state the drone is for your phone, so make sure you can use your phone to work the drone, even if you mostly intend it for tablet use), it did not respond to the directional on the app very well.  The drone moves 2 or 3 seconds after you move the directional on the app, but not necessarily in the direction you intend to move it.  The drone would typically change 1 or 2 directions, after I moved it, then it would continue its own course until it landed itself a few seconds later.  It seems to only fly up, off the hardwood floor, not the carpet.I tried using it outside, but the app would not connect to the drone.  The app connects with your bluetooth and I was within range of our Wi-Fi, so it should have taken off of the driveway.  Overall, I think the drone hovers for about 30 seconds - 45 seconds during its first flight, but if you start moving it around, it tends to land itself quicker and flies for about 15 seconds afterwards, until it sits for a while.  The battery lasts a while, so I would obviously like better control of the drone while flying it longer, perhaps at least a few minutes.  If the battery lasts as long as it does while flying, then while landing, flying, then landing, etc., etc. then it has potential.  However, the drone needs to be more in tune with the controls in the app.  Hopefully when we play with it a little longer, it will help hone our operational skills more, but it really appears that the controls just do not respond to the drone very well and it cannot be used outside.
