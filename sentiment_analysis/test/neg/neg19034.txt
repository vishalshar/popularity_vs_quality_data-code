Confusing setup. Gave up on Bluetooth and went with wifi. Works fine but I wanted more data (bone mass, hydration) and this scale does not do it.It does not sync the weight with my Fitbit Charge 2 but it did automatically import my Apple health data from my Apple Watch. I liked that but I do not want to be required to enter my weight from a wifi scale manually into my Apple Watch or my Fitbit Charge 2 or my Jawbone 3.
