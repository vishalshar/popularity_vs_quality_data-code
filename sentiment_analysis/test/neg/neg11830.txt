Thought the one sided zipper went from peak to leak but only to about a foot to the end. This does not allow it to flip over when just wanting to lounge.  If you want no bug net at all you can flip the whole hammock over but if you have the ridgeline attached under the bug net this procedure requires you to remove the ridgeline through very small grommets which I thought was not convenient.  There are loops you could run the line on the outside but the use of ridgeline bags is out of the question.  If you want a hammock with a net that you cannot partially flip off or change to netless without a major operation then get this.  I also thought the sewing was poor.  A lot of loose threads and the bag that holds the hammock was very poorly attached.
