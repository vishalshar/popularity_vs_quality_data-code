Every time I used Device I experienced headache and nausea. I did read several reviews of users that shared experience. When I contacted Quell with  concerns about this issue, the sales representative denied device could cause headaches or nausea. Also the band that holds the unit  was stretching so much out of shape the unit was pulling off from electrodes. The company acknowledged that. However, denied the unit would suddenly go from the calibrated set to a spike in intensity which caused pain. When the unit was replaced it id not happened again. I had to ask for a replacement.  The technician was still trying to explain what shouldn't, I am saying what is. I am experiencing the discomfort he was not. The electrodes was to last one month (2 electrodes on one sheet. 2 of those to a package)  $40.00 pack.. Showing every day made that impossible.  Finally I requested refund. I am responsible for return shipping. I have been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis so chronic pain and spasms was something I looked forwarding to some relief. even if to be able to sleep. any small amount of relief to some is a huge amount for me. Unfortunately the device did not work for me. May not be properly written. So hope you get the point
