Loud speaker never worked & now screen becomes scrambled occasionally. I never dropped it. It is a dual Sim but if u decide to use to Sims u can't use a memory card (1sim + 1 memory card) OR (2sims + NO memory card)  That's how they fit. Now I have to pay like US$60 to ship back a phone that cost $170bucks. Talk about unfair
