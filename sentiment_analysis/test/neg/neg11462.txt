Performs elementary notifications and will turn a smart plug or a siren on and off. What I find is the lack of applet services support for IFTTT. It would be very useful to arm and disarm motion based on a trigger.  Currently,  I do not find any D-link support for the "That" in IFTTT for this motion sensor. I suppose you could plug this device into a smart plug and control arm/disarm support,  but I would hope that D-link has plans to release applet service functionality shortly - until then, the "smart" capability of this device is very limited.
