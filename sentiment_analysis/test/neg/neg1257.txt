Brand new Ray purchased as Christmas present. After going through the lengthy setup process the device is refusing to link with this message: "the device is linked with another account"  The only help on the misfit website is for hand me down devices, have the previous owner unlink it.  Since this is supposed to be a brand new device I have no way to do that.  The only way to contact Misfit is via email there is no phone contact number.  I'll be returning it and cannot recommend it.
