Ordered the adult size. Put them in my running shoes, excited that I wouldn't have to take the time to actually tie them and that they wouldn't come untied and went out for a run. I had to stop halfway through my run to undo a couple of them because they made the shoes too tight (even though I had them "laced" as the image showed for a loose fit) and making my foot hurt. I took them out of my shoes when I got home and have not put them in another pair. Since I didn't pay much for them, I didn't bother sending them back, but I won't be using them again. If they were just a little longer, they would have been great!
