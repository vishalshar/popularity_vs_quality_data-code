DO NOT BUY THIS!  I had the first Shine in 2014 and liked the tracker, but it fell out of the band 3 times...and on the third time I never found it.  When I saw they had a Shine 2, I wrongfully assumed they would have fixed the problem, but in the first week of having it...it has already fallen out twice, so it is getting returned tomorrow.  My mother also purchased it and after a week and a half, lost it today and can't find it.  Band is useless!!
