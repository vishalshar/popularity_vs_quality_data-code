i purchased this as a Christmas gift and it arrived on November 1st.  it sat in the package and i wrapped it for my child and he opened it on Christmas day.  it doesn't work.  we have wasted time and energy trying to make it work. we've used the app and looked online for instructions and i've concluded that it arrived broken.  because the return window has expired, i cannot find anyone to complain to or make a return with.  i spent $58 on something that is completely broken and i can't find a way to even have a conversation about returning it.  do not buy this item.  it has been nothing but a ridiculous PIA.
