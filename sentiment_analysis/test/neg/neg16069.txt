Bought this to use with my echo, the description says works with Alexa, maybe, but only if you have a NON Amazon device.You have to download the app to register the device ant to contact customer support, the app WILL not download on my Windows desktop, there is NO Amazon app so my 2 kindle fires are useless. So I have a very expensive on off light bulb and no way to reach customer support. I see from other reviews lifx does not offer support, but they like your money.Sending back for a refund, will try a NON LIFX product.If you are a Amazon only user, BEWARE!!!
