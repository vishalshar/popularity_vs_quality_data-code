We ordered this for our vacation home late last spring. The look of it is fairly cheap as far as the build quality and the silly non functional and useless VU meters.  We got it mostly for the bluetooth and CD player both of which worked reasonably well. It is FM only and the reception is spotty.  The remote is tiny, pretty limited and would be easy to lose.  When it comes to hifi, I am pretty spoiled having owned and listened to quality systems, but thought the sound quality while not great, would suffice for a vacation home.  More headroom for the volume output would be good but it got loud enough for us.  So generally, for 80 bucks we were reasonably happy....at first.Well we returned a few months later this fall and the stereo powered up fine the first day, but the second day would not power up at all...I mean nothing lit up nothing worked....the system was essentially dead as a doornail.  I called the company as we were still barely within the 90 day warranty and.was told to send it back and they would send me a new unit.  I thought that sounds pretty fair, but then was told I have to pay to ship it there (to New York) and include a check for 10 dollars to for them to ship it back.  10 bucks to ship back seems ok but once I got it boxed up weighed from our location shipping to them was close to 30 bucks.  We decided to cut our losses and rather than chance getting another one of these that may crap out again, to apply the 40 bucks we would have spent shipping towards a Sony system which is far superior.  Yes it was about twice the cost, but it sounds at least twice as good and has a much better appearance and build quality to it, sounds MUCH better with plenty of headroom for the volume, and the remote is more full sized and is fully functional. Hopefully the Sony will hold up but sadly it is hard to count on any of these massed produced chinese products.I would definitely recommend avoiding this product.  Don't be enticed by the low price, in this case whatever you spend no matter how cheap is too much.  Needless to say we are very unhappy with this product and it is where it belongs....the landfill.
