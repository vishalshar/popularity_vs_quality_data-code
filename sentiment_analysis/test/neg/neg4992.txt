Sure is a great idea, and it's amazing when it works.  Unfortunately, that's maybe 20% of the time.  My son-in-law the tech genius installed it and the Smart Lock for me.  The 15-minute installation took all afternoon and into the evening of the first day.  Because of issues and problems we'd read about, we bought and incorporated - at initial install - new Apple AirPort Extreme base station (its signal can be read 6 houses away), the August Connect (and yes, we did the 2-hour firmware upgrade), an AirPort Express to act as a signal booster (just in case), and a 6-hour UPS to be sure no problems with power surges or outages. It worked fine the first 4 days, then the problems started.  On the fifth day, he spent another 6 hours troubleshooting and doing everything recommended.  No luck.  By then it was 8:00 at night, lock and camera were completely non-responsive, so we decided to call August the next day.  But the next morning, the lock and camera worked flawlessly.  For a day.  That was yesterday.  At 8:34 a.m. today both were working, but have been non-responsive ever since.  Problems seem like maybe they're an August issue at their end (it transmits video to their servers, whether or not you want it to; it's the video that hangs).The Smart Lock almost always works, but the Doorbell Cam almost never does. If you're depending on it to help you monitor activity at your entrances, you're almost always out of luck.  Too bad, it's potentially great.  But it doesn't work.  Suggest you buy something else.One more thing: nobody, and I mean nobody, realizes it's a doorbell.  So nobody rings it until you stand on the other side of the door and yell at them to do so.  It doesn't look like a doorbell.  People don't recognize it as such.Follow-up:  it actually works maybe 10% of the time.  The other 90%, it tries to connect, with a spinning ball, but doesn't succeed.  If you leave it connected because you're expecting a visitor and want to be sure it'll still be connected in a few minutes -- your iPhone will get so hot it burns your hand (this is my fourth iPhone, I have never ever had an iPhone overheat.  Until now.)No, this is not User Error, and it's not installation errors, nor is it firmware problems, nor is it Internet issues.  We've checked all of that.  It's the Doorbell Cam.Buy something else.
