The Lytro is a novel idea with great potential but isn't quite ready for prime time.  If you are looking for quick low quality pics to post on a blog or facebook you may be satisfied with the results.  If you are serious about photography however, you will be very disappointed with the image quality of the photos.  The camera itself is built very well and is easy to use. After shooting a few hundred pictures with it, I consider it more of a toy than a camera.  It should probably be priced more in the $125 range than $499.  Hopefully the image quality will improve through software upgrades and someday it may be a great product.
