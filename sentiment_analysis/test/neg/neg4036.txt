I got these for my niece who's 9 and her parents want to get her interested in engineering. so they were excited when they got the toy for Christmas. They started to play with it right away the next morning, but the pieces didn't snap together really well. My niece was struggling with it and even my brother in law tried to help her, but it was just not working out. so we had to return it. I'm sad that it didn't work out. I also gave out two sets to my son's classmates during their birthday and I feel bad that I didn't vet the toys very well before selecting them.
