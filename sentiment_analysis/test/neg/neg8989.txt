UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW: Not only did I have problems getting the farm to grow plants, but at just a bit over two months into owning the product, my pump completely stopped working. Back to Roots customer care admitted they found out the pump is not intended to be an internal pump and there was a flaw in the quality of the tubing. I'm waiting for the replacement pump but to be quite honest, I'm going to go buy a fish tank for my beta that isn't an eyesore that reminds me of money poorly spent and that will be much easier to clean.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I was super excited when I saw the Back to Roots Aqua Farm on the lightning deals list- the concept is phenomenal! I was aiming to purchase it for my own use to see how easy it was, with the intention of supplying one as a Christmas gift to a couple of families with children of the right age at the end of the year if it seemed appropriately low maintenance as the product implied.I'm horribly disappointed with the product.The package includes wheat grass seeds, basil seeds, and mixed lettuce seeds. On my first attempt to grow things, I did four pods with lettuce seeds and a fifth with basil seeds. Sure enough, they sprouted up their little heads! I thinned them down to what appeared to be the best sprout per pod, trying to do so with as much delicacy as possible so as to transplant the thinned seedlings to a pot outside if possible (why waste good plants?). Within a week of thinning the plants, they started drooping and falling over, and within a course of days every single sprout was dead without any sign of why- they were hale and healthy for a couple of days after thinning, so I know I didn't damage the delicate young plants.Baffled, I tried a different set of seeds- I've gardened before, and had a package of green bean seeds still. The package had produced good producing plants for me before (for growth in pots) so I knew there couldn't be anything wrong with the seeds. So I planted one in each pod on the aqua farm. Within a week, I had moldy, smelly seeds.The worst part of this situation is that when I reached out to Back to Roots customer service, their answer is that I didn't have the farm in a good place for light (despite it being three feet from my sliding glass door to my balcony, that had no blinds on it), and that I need to buy a grow lamp and/or buy established low-light plants.If you're marketing an item that in the pictures shows as being set on a kitchen counter and otherwise indoors, why are you suggesting purchase of additional products to make your product work? It's extremely misleading and causes a very bad customer experience. It basically means that the entire product is useless unless you get it in direct sunlight constantly. And why do you tell me I have to put more money into your product to make your product work, even if you mean only to purchase an established plant? Again, bad customer experience.While the overall product is mechanically functioning as expected- the pump is working fine and the water flows through successfully- the fact that I can't grow anything in this is why I rate it as a 1 star. I purchased it to be a farm, not a fish tank.At least my fish is pretty.
