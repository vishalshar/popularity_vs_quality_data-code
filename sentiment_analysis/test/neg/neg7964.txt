Didn't work - top bulb in cover not coming on.  (There are two in these units - one in the cover to sanitize from the top, and a second in the bottom)  Called PhoneSoap company to see if they could send me a replacement bulb but they wouldn't.  Bulbs are not replaceable by customers.  They had a great opportunity to impress me with their customer service but they failed miserably and only said to return it to Amazon.  Not even a mention of getting a replacement until I specifically asked.  All they said was that I'd have to arrange it through Amazon.  A better company would have said "I'm very sorry, let me overnight a replacement unit out to you immediately".  And since they've completely soured me on this experience, I'll also point out an issue I've seen brought up in other reviews:  the design of this thing is quite flawed.  The thing turns on whenever you close the lid.  So when you're done sanitizing your phone, you open the lid, take your phone out and then have to either leave the lid open or you have to unplug it.  Who's going to do that?  Most people will simply close the lid again, causing the unit to come on for another cycle.  Result?  You will use your bulbs twice as much as you need to, cutting their useful life in half.  And as I mentioned earlier you can't replace them.  You have to ship the the entire unit off to PhoneSoap for replacement.  Dumb design.
