When I first saw this I was pumped at the idea of a thin case that will charge my iphone 6 and use the lightning cable. The idea is awesome but this product hugely disappoints.Big Fail points below.1) The charging port is on the top of the phone which is extremely awkward if you're like me and sometimes use the phone while it's plugged it.2) Not protective at all, this case claims to protect the phone but if dropped you're screen is not covered and will shatter.3) No dedicated charge button! Instead this thing charges via the volume button, hold down for 3 secs. Half the time only my volume went up and nothing was even charged. Sometimes it would in fact work to activate the charging case but even then the phone itself didn't always pick up the charge.4) Slow charge - On top of all of this when everything finally did function as it was supposed to, the phone took forever to charge down from 5% and only charged up to about 60% before the charger died which was under the promised amount.Try Again ThinCharge...
