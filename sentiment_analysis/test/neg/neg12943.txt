UPDATE WITH WARNING for June 18,2016. Others had said that the battery don't last and they are right. No battery should discharge in a couple of weeks of non use. This speaker will soon become a useless brick because of the battery. I only had this a short time and I don't think I used it more than 8 or 9 times. I would give this 0 stars because I spent too much money for this item to go bad so soon with little use. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!I think it is overpriced because I did an comparison with an Altec Lansing in a store. The Fugoo does have better base so I went for it over the Altec, but other than a small improvement on the base the Altec is a  much better deal.Pros: Sounds GoodCons: PRICE and the Blue Tooth pops in and out as I move away from connected device. I haven't tried this with all my devices yet so I leave this open to evaluate if the problem is my connected device or Fugoo. I will update this in the future.Loudness - I will not call this is a con because it is subjective and this device doesn't  proclaim to be a loudspeaker. If you understand basic electricity and science you must know everything has its limits. I find that this speaker is loud enough for me in the house, but it wouldn't hurt to have it a bit louder for outdoor use, but its loud enough and even louder when plugged in to an electrical outlet. I don't understand all the negative comments on the loudness especially since my hearing capabilities are not that good, and I'm fairly satisfied with the DB output of the speaker.Bottom Line: Check out Altec Lansing, and if you have the time some of the other brands in the store because what sounds good to me may not sound good to you. If you can't do that than just buy Fugoo, and you should be satisfied with the sound.
