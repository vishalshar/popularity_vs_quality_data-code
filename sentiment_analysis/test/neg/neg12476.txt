I liked the cooler...but the blender does not stay on to blend.  It screws itself off...I've left messages on the website at the coolest cooler sight and Amazon...but no one has tried to help me figure out how to fix it...they just sent me a replacement cooler...which does the same thing...I kept it...because it is a cool cooler...I like everything about it, but the whole reason I purchased it was because of the blender...everything else works as described.
