TOTAL CHOKING HAZARD!! So I bought this because my previous experience with freeze-dried items was that it easily melts in your mouth - you don't have to chew it too much (similar to those yogurt drops that most babies snack on). I have a 1 year-old who just has one lone tooth and I figured this would be a way for her to get her fruit servings since some fruits she can't really chew. I had tried the Brothers All Natural brand of apple crisps but I wanted to try something organic. This seemed to fit the bill and it had freeze-dried peas too, so I figured that was a win. WRONG. My child gagged terribly on a piece and almost choked on it! When I first opened it, the pieces looked sort of weird, like they were dried fruits rather than freeze-dried fruits. I tried the peas and it was really crunchy and hard - I could eat it because I had molars, but I knew my child couldn't chew them, so I took the peas away from her before she could eat those. While I was doing that, she began to eat one of the fruit pieces and that's when she choked! She brought it up, I got it out of her mouth in time, and noticed that it hadn't really broken down. So I ate one myself and I really had to chew it - it didn't really dissolve and actually got stuck in my teeth! I've never experienced freeze-dried foods like that and that's when I realized that there was a reason the pieces looked more shriveled up. It's almost like they freeze-dried dried fruits or something, because I didn't think freeze-dried food should be that dense and chewy.Another reason this gets a one star is that the price of the amount is ridiculous. The individual bags are very small and in total I think there's a small palm-full in each bag. Five bags cost me (at the time I bought this on Amazon) $8.68. That's just craziness. I get that it's organic, but seriously?(I do have to give Amazon credit for their return policy - I got my refund credited within an hour of returning the snacks. Actually, I didn't even have to send it back. So I can give 5 stars for the return policy.)So if your toddler has molars already, it could be an option (although the price is ridiculous). But otherwise, I would stay away until they're older and can chew through stuff. I think this should be labeled that it's for older kids - older toddlers may enjoy it. (Or not, because, honestly, the peas were pretty gross. Even thinking about the taste right now makes me want to gag. And that's coming from a woman who loves brussel sprouts.)
