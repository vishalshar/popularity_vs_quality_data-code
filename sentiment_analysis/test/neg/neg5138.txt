So the product was working fine. But the band you are wearing it on is a joke. I lost it after 1 month. I am heart broken. It has a wrist band thst the rubber goes around, then a thing that snaps on the back. I experienced it popping out once in a while so I was very careful. But today it's gone. I researched many of these bits before purchasing. I cam not afford to replace. This is very disappointing.
