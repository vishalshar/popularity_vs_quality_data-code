We live in the country so we used this to track our new puppy so he wouldn't get lost.  He did wander off but the tracker didn't work.  Apparently one of the copper prongs didn't spring back out completely, so we got a false reading of a charged battery but it drained quickly and the battery died so they couldn't track him.  One month later we have never found our puppy.  We trusted the tracker would keep him safe but it totally let us down.
