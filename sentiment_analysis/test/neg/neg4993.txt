Not ready for prime time. After first one would not connect (Tried 3 different routers), returned and received replacement, second one would not connect either. I also have an august lock and august connect, both of which work fine and connect fine. The product is sleek and on the outside looks well designed. After many e-mails back and forth with their tech support, nothing ever resolved. Tech support stopped responding and my e-mails went to black hole. If they ever get this connectivity issue fixed, I would try again as I really like their design.
