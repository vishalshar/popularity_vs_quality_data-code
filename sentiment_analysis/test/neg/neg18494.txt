Don't buy if you use a Roku Streaming Stick. They won't advertise it doesn't work with it, even though they say it works with "Roku" devices.Instead, they'll tell you to get a different streaming system to work with their device and say "we never said it DID work with the Roku Streaming Stick."Deceptive and sneaky.
