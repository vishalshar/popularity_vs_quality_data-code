When I read the other reviews on Amazon, I got excited about the spire device. So I went ahead and ordered it. I often times feel myself breathing incorrectly when I have big projects or major deadlines so I wanted a way to track my breathing to reduce my stress level. The device sounded like a solution but fell short in the end.Pros:LightweightEasily paired with iphone 6 via bluetoothEasy to wear and did not pinchSoftware easy to loadCons:Repeated connection loss (via Bluetooth)Graphic interface not enough to see how to improve realtime breathing with goalsProfile kept dropping off and asking to set up deviceToo expensiveBottom line: If you are looking for a tracking device in this price range there are far better products on the market. Hopefully the bugs will get fixed with a firmware update. Unfortunately, I have to return the device. It is not worth the money. I paid 149.99 on Amazon.
