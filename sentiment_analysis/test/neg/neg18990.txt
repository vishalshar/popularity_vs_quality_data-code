This is what by today's standard should be a simple device to produce. It would be worth $250 if it worked reliably. It does not. I am experiencing dropouts several times a week, which is annoying. My former analog device from Belkin never failed me until it dropped dead after 10 years of service. That unit was $113. jedthefish@mac.com
