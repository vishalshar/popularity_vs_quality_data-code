I took a gamble when I bought this. If this were the only "budget" IR camera out there or the only one for iPhone, I would say yay! But it's not, so let's face facts of today's market (Mar 12, 2015).Pro: Way more pixels than FLIR One!Con: Despite 5.3x more, the image quality doesn't quite show it. As other reviewers have mentioned, more noise, incorrect values. Values in some pixels (20-40%) are too high or low on a flat surface that should be constant. Often looks blurry (2 in to 8 ft; whole range).Pro: wider range of temps.Con: incomplete spectrum (aka smaller palette) . It seems to skip some values and round up/down. That may explain why the image looks dithered rather than smooth. Analogy: reduce any color image down to 4-bit or 16 color. The images look like that.Con: Screen/image does a poor job of showing temp differences meaning that if you are looking for an active wire that will not be more than 1 degree higher, you cannot. My Fluke laser IR could and I know a higher end FLIR could too (idk about FLIR One).Pro: The low cost of this brought down the cost of FLIR One by $100! More competition means healthy market and better for sellers.Con: That price drop from FLIR means this price should drop about $50 to be worth it (somewhat)Let's talk about software. Clearly the Seek camera has more pixels, but lower quality than FLIR. And the software?Pro: the app is free and does the bare minimal that you would expect from a thermal camera. You can change colors and read the temperatures.Con: You can only read either the average of center pixels or you can see the min and max. You can't tap or move the cursor.Con: there is no legend to tell you what these colors mean and they always change. WHY?! It's about as good as a laser thermometer, except those are very precise and accurate and more informative. My Fluke laser IR thermometer will give me min, max and average too.Con: Seek: 1 app, FLIR: 5-8Con: No replay or post analysis. You cannot read the temperature or other parts of the image. WYSIWYG. With FLIR, you can do all sorts of stuff after taking the image.Other notes (things I wish Seek had):Pro: Seek will (IDK when in the future) release an SDK. That means that you can write applications and possibly do all the things that it currently lacks features for.Cons: By the time that happens, FLIR will have releases FLIR TWO (or whatever their marketing calls it) that will better compete with the threat of Seek.You can download the FLIR One apps on your phone and download demos from them. Then play around with them and see the difference. Flir ONE has a 720p visible light camera augmented with their 60x80 thermal. Seek has 206 x 156. FLIR=6,080 px, Seek=32,136. The difference is 5.286x more.Con: FLIR gives you a battery so it's not harming your iPhone. My phone got really hot with Seek after using it for 2-5 min.Con: Seek puts tramp stamps (their logo) on every picture you take. FLIR does not!Apparently Seek knows that the camera is blurry and they made another version that can focus. $50 more and still doesn't look that great from the sample images I saw online.I'm going to keep playing around with this. I'll find my insulation issues and the sell this. I may buy Seek in the future, but the product is not ready and cannot compete (yet) with a company that has been in business for decades longer.Just a note and I don't know if this is normal for FLIR cameras. You can see reflections quite well. I think they need a narrow band pass filter because the camera shows my temp in my laptop screen and a mirror, not the screen/mirror temp itself.
