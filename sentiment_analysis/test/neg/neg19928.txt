This is a mildly interesting device that's ultimately a gimmick, and I can't think of any reason to recommend it to anyone.You don't need to focus!  That's the problem it solves....but the truth is that this isn't really a problem.  It's also not really solved with this camera, as any movement turns the photo into one huge blur streak.  Even still pics come out grainy and dark, if the lighting isn't perfect.The hardware/form factor is unique, but feels like a pre-release mock up.  The lens cap is useless....plan on losing it.  The zoom function works decently enough, and it's kind of cool -- but it's completely un-intuitive.  They should have put some kind of visual cue to let people know where to slide for zoom.  The view screen is painfully small.The software....is not bad, once you get it connected.  I use it on Windows and have no complaints here.But, again, I recommend this to nobody.  It's not good for snapping pictures of the kids, and will be utterly useless for photography buffs.
