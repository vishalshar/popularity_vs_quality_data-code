This camera had all the features I was looking for - especially both motion and sound alerts.  The iphone app loaded fine but the camera could not be found by the device after trying 2 times.  I came back to try again and the app didn't recognize my password and Forgot Password closed the app repeatedly.  I even tried via my iPad.  I had to create a new account to get the app to start but after 4 attempts the camera still could not be found by my device.  My modem connects to my earlier version Apple TimeCapsule to create my wi-fi network.  No WPS button so I tried to manual set up each time.  After investing 3 hours trying to get this going, I will sleep on it and start looking for a replacement that works.
