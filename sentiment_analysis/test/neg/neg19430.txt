I am a Chinese and my English is not good?I've sent in a support ticke,mine still doesn't not levitate. It makes an attempt but only shifts to one of the sides (on top). I believe I have a broken version.But ten months have passed without a good deal,I need help and I do not want to waste my money?Can you please send a replacement or I'll have to request a refund. Thanks.
