I thought that I would give it a try.  Turned out to be a mistake.The turn mechanism to tighten down on the universal ball joint to "lock" the screw seat into the position that you want would not turn by hand.  I had to resort to using some WD40 in combination with physically turning the mechanism with pliers.  This should not be needed if it was well crafted.  This resulted in some scratch marks on the paint (I believe it is cast aluminum with black paint, but could be wrong).Then there is the fact that it is expensive.  It is easily 3 times the cost of a typical, cheap "security" camera mount that will do the same job.  And many of those "cheap" mounts seem better made.The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one star was because of the strap connection adapter that allows you to mount it to a pole.  The mount is actually two pieces: 1) the main mount that has a flat base with three screw holes for screwing to a flat surface (this flat base is hidden in square base you see in the picture); and 2) the square curved pole attachment base with two metal straps.  In my case, I will likely just be mounting to a flat surface, so the pole adapter is likely wasted for me.  If you want to attach it to a pole, then it might be worth it for you.
