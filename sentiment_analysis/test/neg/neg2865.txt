This WiFi is just terrible and is so upsetting to use. I bought it to use in my bedroom so that I could turn the light off after reading without getting out of bed, but it disconnects from the network and/or the associated App does not connect to the light so I can't control the bulb. It's essentially a really expensive regular light bulb most of the time. I waited, hoping there would be firmware and/or App updates that would fix the issues and now it's too late to return it. The App does not have a reset/reconnect button so there's no way to cycle and reconnect. Closing and exiting the app does nothing.  My apartment is not large and I have strong WiFi signal throughout, there doesn't appear to be any network issues as my laptops/phones stay connected and I have very few issues.
