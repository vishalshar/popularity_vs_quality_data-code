I was hoping charcoal soap was the answer to my acne issues. It cleaned my face squeaky clean but unfortunately that wasn't a good thing because after 2 1/2 weeks of use I broke out on my cheeks and for head which never happens. I also ended up with a crazy amount of white heads on my chin and itchy dry patches around my mouth.  I had to stop using it and return to the face wash I was using before which cleared up the break out this soap caused but still does nothing for my cystic acne. Oh well, my search continues.
