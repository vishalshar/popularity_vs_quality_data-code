They taste okay, but have at least twice as much sugar as needed. I ate less than the recommended portion size, and it made my mouth sore, as if I had eaten Cap'n Crunch cereal.. I think that it is probably common for people to purchase this as a good, low sugar/starch alternative to other common snack foods. If I want a high carb snack, there are many choices. This was a big disappointment.
