the bag contains all hard, broken pieces, like the bottom of the barrel was scraped for this bag. very diasppointed. it is so hard the pets will not eat it. what a waste of my money. i get this product every month but now i need to reconsider and possibly seek other options. whole life has nerve sending out such crap. someone should take the time to inspect the products they are sending.
