This watch is trash and should be taken down.  The text messaging doesn't work at all and there is no solution.  I tried to sign up for the forum but that ended up being useless.  This watch sucks that's the long and short of it.  Amazon obviously doesn't care what they sell anymore to allow trash like this on their site.Update:  I was able to get text messaging to work.  However, in my opinion, this watch is useless.  The calendar only shows the events for that day,  if you want to see what's ahead you have to check your phone which defeats the purpose of a smartwatch.  The apps store is very limited and what is on there is pretty much useless for me.  Also, there are just not enough watch faces. I know they are just starting and  I really wanted to like this watch especially knowing Pebble is no more.  However, it is too limited and unfortunately, I'm going to have to send it back.
