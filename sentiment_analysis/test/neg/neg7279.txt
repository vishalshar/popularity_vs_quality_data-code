The Tile Slim is Tile Inc's latest product, but the Cons still outweigh the Pros -Pros: it can find your wallet, but ...Cons:Range is very limitedIt requires you to hear the Tile to find your wallet. That's not possible if your wallet, keys, tiled item is covered, in a seat or chair crackYou have to pay to recharge it annually, so the cost goes up. Tile should make that fact very,very clear.Summary: I plan on returning the 4-pack that I bought and will wait for a better product
