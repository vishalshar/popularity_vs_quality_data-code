Let me start by saying I have owned a Misfit Shine for over a year. I love it! So I thought the Ray would be a nice upgrade.First thing I noticed was that it wasn't tracking as accurately as the Shine. About the time I purchased the Ray I pulled a hamstring so I wasn't running, I thought that was the issue. When the hamstring was well enough to walk some distance I started doing little test with the Ray. Still not tracking the correct steps or mileage. (Now I know that the Ray isn't pinpoint accurate, but it wasn't even close)Second I noticed that the sleep tracking was wierd. I know I slept longer than three hours. So wth?I did all of the tricks to try and get it working...uninstalled the app, turned off the phone, removed the batteries, installed new batteries, reinstalled the app....several, several times.I have contacted Misfit and we are trying to fix the problem because it is to late to return the Ray.I hope to get this resolved. I love the look of the Ray and the extra functions that it performs, however because of the issues I am only giving one star. I will update later if I have any luck with the company. I fear I will be stuck with a dud.
