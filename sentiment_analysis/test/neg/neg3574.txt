Set up did not work. No matter what, the app could not find the Luma to set it up even though the setup wifi network was visible. Plugged the apple router back in and it works fine. I was hoping for better coverage, speed and control. Clearly that did not happen. Maybe the competing products are production ready. This one for sure is not. A real disappointment after waiting 4 months for it to ship. They might get it right on the next version, but this one is not as advertised. I returned the Lumas.
