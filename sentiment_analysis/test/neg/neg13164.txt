It's a great idea/concept, but need some serious work. I have a nice router and fast internet (50mb up/30mb down) and the image is often distorted and there are so many connection issues. I can understand the lag between the internet, home wifi, and the unit being a few seconds delayed, but when you watch and then have the images gets all grainy and lined it's like come on. Is it a connection issue, server issue, or product issue??The product is built solid and was shocked how far it launched treats. I think it may be a bit excessive, but I have pea size treats if they were closer to the 1inch I guess it wouldn't go flying cross the room. The cat also isn't afraid of the noise, which is great.Overall I bought this to see my cat and I can't say I always can. I am forced to reconnect several times before getting an image and then the quality is spotty at best. If this thing was cheaper I don't think I would mind, but at its current price point it really needs to work right all the time and just not a small portion of it. Is this a common issue with this product or could it be a defective unit please let me know. Either wise I may be returning it for a refund.Update: Continued camera/connection issues has lead to me returning the product. It's a great concept, but the company needs to work on making it work 100% of the time.
