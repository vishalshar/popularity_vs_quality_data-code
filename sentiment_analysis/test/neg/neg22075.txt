I would love to be the first 5-star reviewer of this product. But I just can't. I bought the Pivot Power Genius because I wanted to be able to control a lamp in my living room via wifi. I thought about a getting a Wemo, but I also needed an extension cord to get the lamp plugged in behind my sofa. So, what did I find but something that claimed to be both a wifi control device and a multi-outlet power strip that gave me the 15 inches of cord that I needed. yay!The device comes with fairly simple instructions. Download the app, create an account, plug in the strip, then follow the steps to communicate between the app and the device. But it never did work. I powered on/off the device, deleted and reloaded the app, and zip, nada. Doesn't work. "Unable to contact the server". It appears that lots of people on the Quirky Forum (which I wish I had read prior to ordering this) have either had trouble connecting or trouble making it work consistently. Quirky personnel encourage people to call in to the support line to get help. But why should consumers have to call in to an 800 number for help using a silly $60 product that turns on/off a light?  They shouldn't be shipping this product with as many failures as it seems to have according to their support forum.I will give it one more shot, but if that fails its going to have to be returned, sadly.
