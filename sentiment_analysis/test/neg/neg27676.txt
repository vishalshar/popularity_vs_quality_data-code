1 month later it would no longer connect to my wifi. Tried resetting and it just doesnt work anymore. Dont waste your money.UPDATE:This device works ok however the app that comes with it is not very user friendly. Unfortunately, this device is nothing more than a glorified wifi switch without a good app to go with it. I have figured out after hours of trial and error that you need to disable remote settings and all that nonsense from all your devices that use it. (not an easy task if you set it up with multiple devices) There should be a master reset option instead of these things. I tried using the help on the app without getting any either.I have tried this both on an iPhone and an android phone. They are equally difficult to manage and maintain. Sometimes the remote access feature does not work for me at all so I would have to be in the wifi network to use it.I think a lot of improvement is needed for this device to be useful at all.I'm leaving this with a 1 star review because all it's done so far is annoy me with multiple unintelligent settings and terrible re-setup.Update 2016:Other than a 5ghz wifi band incompatibility, after it is set up,  it works very well with Amazon echo. I am bumping this up to 2 star because the app still isn't good with it but is functional and very convenient with echo.
