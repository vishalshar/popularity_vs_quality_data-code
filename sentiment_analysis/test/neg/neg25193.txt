I purchased two Narrative Clips and experienced several problems, including:- The camera does not work reliably. Sometimes it takes pictures, sometimes it does not. The intervals between pictures are not always 30 seconds.- There is no feedback to tell if the camera is on or off and if the battery is charged while somebody is wearing the camera.We used this camera for research, paid participants to wear it, and sadly it was a waste of money as none of the pictures got recorded. The good thing is that the design of the camera is discrete and the design of the software is pretty intuitive.
