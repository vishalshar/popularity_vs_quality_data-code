They make good products. I've purchased from them in the past.  This past iteration, however, the left bottom screw hole did not have any thread. I replaced the whole screen (which fit perfectly and instructions were good), and the last two bottom screws were all that were left before I found out about the defect. Ouch. So now there's a piece of tape holding the bottom screw in place. The moral of the story: make sure you didn't get a dud by testing the screw mounts on the bottom. Manufacturing defects happen, but it's still disappointing when it happens to you.
