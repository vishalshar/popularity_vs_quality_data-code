Bought it for my elderly father. Set-up was far too difficult for him, and there is a charge for everything, including Voice Mail. The package deals offered don't really exist, as all they allow is phone calls; no voicemail, texting, etc. It costs 10 cents per picture to send or receive pictures.  Entering phone numbers into the Phone Book is very clumsy, as is Voice Dial. The phone isn't loud enough for a senior who is hard of hearing. One has to request Voice Dial, as it isn't automatically included, even though it's free. The Voice Dial stopped working twice, and we had to get the phone replaced, going through the set-up all over again.  Any senior smart enough to set up this phone is smart enough to use an iPhone, with far less aggravation. Buyer beware!
