Don't know if I'm doing something wrong or not. I Used it right after receiving it and it did fine. Tried to use it again this past weekend and it only registers 00% when I turn it on. I set it on the weight listed on the collar of the propane tank and after it identifies that wgt., it is supposed to show the percentage of propane gas left and the estimated cooking time available....it didn't...it  just went back  to the 00% on the start button. I read the instructions again and tried it following them...same result. I know there is gas in the tank because I checked it with a hand-held scale that is pretty accurate and it read almost 1/4 tank of propane gas left. I had read the pros and cons submitted by other purchasers and I thought the pros outweighed the cons substantially, so I bought it.
