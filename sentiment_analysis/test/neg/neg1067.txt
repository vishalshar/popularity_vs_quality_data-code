I had hope this would give my natural lashes a little more color, but it really doesn't do much for that.  It is definitely not a replacement for mascara as it is very thin and barely shows on my lashes.  I did notice a slight change in my eyebrows if I applied and wore overnight, but very subtle.  I have blonde eyebrows  growing in with my darker ones and hoped to color those a little.  I've seen a very slight change so I probably wouldn't go to the trouble to apply nightly after this is gone.
