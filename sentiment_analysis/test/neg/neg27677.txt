The first Belkin switch set up easily, and other than the 10 minute firm wear update and having to reset the router, I was impressed with the set-up process.The second one was a different story. It could never locate both switches. Following the less-than-specific troubleshooting instructions on the Belkin site I reloaded the App. That erased the first switch and forced a reboot of the router again.Finally the second switch was installed, but the first was MIA. Went thorough the set-up process for the first switch, finally installed it and the second switch disappeared.UPDATE 12-23-2013:Belkin support has confirmed that the WeMo devices can only be used on a single wireless network. That means you cannot have devices at work and at home, or at both a main and second home, and control them with a single mobile device.Belkin support wrote: We can only use the WeMo app to manage multiple WeMo devices if these WeMo devices are connected to the same wireless network. If you want to manage multiple networks, you will need a different mobile/tablet to manage each network.UPDATE 2-9-2016:Unless you like tinkering with devices that never work and always need to be reinstalled, go with a real smart home solution.I have never experienced a loss of contact with my SmartThings system and devices. The WeMo devices are able to be relied on about 20% of the time.
