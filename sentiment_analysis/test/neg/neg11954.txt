** July 25th, 2016 update below **Nonda said the issue was caused by a problem with the welding and they are aware of it. Their responsiveness leads me to believe this was simply a QC issue and not a systematic problem so I have adjusted my reviews below to be less harsh.** July 19th, 2016 update below **Nonda processed my refund quickly. Their customer service appears to be quite responsive and eager to make things right so kudos to them for that.** Original review below **Nonda's adapter is marketed as a USB 3.0 device but it transfers at only USB 2.0 speed which is not what the description statesI tested it with my Samsung T3 SSD and MacBook 2015 at got the following results:1. Samsung T3 -> T3's cable -> Belkin USB-C to USB-A adapter -> MacBook = USB 3.0 speed2. Samsung T3 -> T3's cable -> Nonda adapter -> MacBook = USB 2.0 speed3. Samsung T3 -> Belkin USB-C to USB-C cable -> MacBook = USB 3.0 speedYou can see the photos which show the difference in speed. I am requesting for a full refund since this product clearly does not do what it says.
