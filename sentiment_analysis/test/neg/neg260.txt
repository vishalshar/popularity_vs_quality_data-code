Worked for a moment, BT worked the first time but failed later the same day. Only one side would light up. I contacted Bragi direct to troubleshoot the problems. I have never put so much effort and hours into getting a defective product to work. 1 week per response via email from Bragi ( I know they are small but..)  After a month and a half Bragi said it needed to be sent to them to fix. I told them I bought on Amazon and they said it needed to be returned by the resaler even though it was their product.After all the hassle of these not working I decided to return for a refund.Idea is fantastic, product was useless, customer support at Bragi was horrible. I will wait till a more reputable company builds a similar product before buying again. Bigger companies tend to have better customer service. Buy at your own risk and time.
