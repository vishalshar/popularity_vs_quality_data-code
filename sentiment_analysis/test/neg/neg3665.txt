This coffee maker only lasted about 5 months before parts started breaking. Very cheap quality. I would definitely not recommend this brand to anybody. The seller couldn't even bother to let me know if there are spare parts I can purchase to replace the broken parts. All he cared about was that the return period has expired. Not very good customer service. Very disappointed.
