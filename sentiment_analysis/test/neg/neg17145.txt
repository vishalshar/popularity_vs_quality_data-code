I really wanted to love this phone.  But I am so disappointed.  The Bluetooth does not work. None of my devices can find it no matter what I do, and I've never had trouble syncing with my car, even on the windows phone.  The phones GPS keeps dropping out and the battery life is crap, after just 20 minutes today it had dropped to 80%.  The phone freezes up often in both Facebook and Instagram.  I've had it less than a week and am returning it.
