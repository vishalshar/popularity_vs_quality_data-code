I love the idea of this, but it falls short in a number of waysPros:- It's comfortable to wear and unobtrusive.- It does what its supposed to - reminding me to be mindful when I am not being mindful on my own (with a vibration that occurs when I've been tense for more than two minutes.- I love the visualization of my breath, which is particularly helpful for me being that i'm a very visually-inclined person - it's incredible how much this helps me focus during meditation sessionsCons:- It KILLS your iPhone battery. I've never had a peripheral or app that has crushed my battery life so quickly.- Faulty charging?  This is now the second Spire I've ordered that has not been able to charge.  The first lasted about three weeks or so before it stopped charging.  The second one wouldn't even charge once.  I'm certain I'm doing everything as I should be.  So I'm concerned that the charging mechanism (wireless) isn't made well enough.- False positives: it gauges times of tension incorrectly.  Calm is measured by slow and consistent breathing, Focus by faster consistent breathing and Tension by faster yet inconsistent breathing.  So, whenever I'm speaking - on a business call for instance - I am not breathing consistently given I breathe depending upon the length of a sentence or whether I'm speaking or listening, or etc. As a businessman, I'm on the phone pretty much all day, which means, that it appears that I'm tense all day long.All-in-all, the cons outweigh the pros.  With that said - I love the idea so much, that I'm going to try ONE MORE TIME, and buy a third Spire with hopes that it charges without fault, and realizing that I can deal with the battery drain and false positives.
