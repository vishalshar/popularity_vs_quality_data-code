This worked once for us. The first time our girl barked, she looked around in shock - what was that?! Silence. My husband and I knowingly smiled at each other. It worked!! Alas, turns out the sound wasn't enough to keep her quiet. She later resumed barking to her heart's content, despite the presence of these tiny devices.That said, returning the product couldn't have been easier, and we were really impressed with the devices themselves. They feel well made, it was easy to see if they were working (a red light flashes when they are emitting the sound), and getting those tiny button batteries in and out was very easy. If your dog is responsive to the sound, I don't doubt these devices would last a long time.
