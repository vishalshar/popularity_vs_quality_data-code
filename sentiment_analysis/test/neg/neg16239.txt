I purchased two Robocopp devices for my wife and daughter. I read that it sounds as loud as an ambulance. When I tested the devices, I found that they are not nearly as loud as claimed. If I were to activate it on a city street, I would be surprised if anyone paid any attention to the sound if they heard it.
