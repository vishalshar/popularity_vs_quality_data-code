This tracker is beautiful. For being a black tracker it is elegant, on the smaller side and holds a charge longer than most trackers. I had a few issues with it, hence the 2 star rating. The first most important issue was that the tracker tracked my sleep the exact opppsite of my Garmin Vivofit 2. It trackedlight sleep as deep and deep sleep as light. I also watched a review video before I bought the product. The reviewer had an Android phone and the Andriod app.  I thought the iPhone app would be similar. It is NOT. You cannot edit anything. You can't edit sleep, you can't add a workout. This was a deal breaker for me. When I emailed support about the app they said they were working on the iOS app but that it would be months before the same functionality would be available. I ultimately returned the tracker. I would have kept it if the app were the same as the Andriod version and if the sleep tracking worked properly. Such a bummer because I really liked the way it looked.
