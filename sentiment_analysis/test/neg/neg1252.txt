At first I really liked this product but after using it for about a month and a half no longer feel the same. The edges have started  to chip  along with some of the paint. It only seems to track my fitness if I run or walk. I biked 5 miles today and it tracked nothing. The Bluetooth regularly disconnects from my phone and it will take a long time for it to reconnect. Honestly I have found that this is not changing my life or effecting my fitness and it was pretty much a waste of $100 for me.
