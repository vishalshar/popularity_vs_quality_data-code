I bought this screen instead of the dozen cheaper ones on ebay etc.. hoping it was better quality but it came in busted. Only the backlight seems to go on but nothing appears on the display. I put back my broken screen and that still works fine. reseated the display cables and still the same issue. Looks like the display controller is busted.I am currently overseas and can't even easily send it back
