Do not buy this mug if you drink the beverage, one can only sip very slowly from the mug. One has to attempt to suck the beverage out of this mug.  Filled the mug with water and poured the water out which took almost five minutes.  Very disappointing. Seems to be a poor design.  Was tempted to change the location of the vent hole but decided to not use the mug.
