I was so, SO excited to find this product because the concept is both clever and efficient. Who has the time or outlets to charge their emergency charger and phone separately when the two can be combined? Initially, this was a 5 star purchase for me. Great looking product, felt quite well made, very portable, and intuitively designed. I used it every day at least twice a day and could absolutely justify the price tag.Within 4 months, though, the product began to break down. The fold-out plug separated so that the two prongs would have to be folded down separately when I wanted to plug the battery pack into the wall, and one prong became very loose in its socket. I would have to push the loose prong back into its socket to get the battery to charge, and as time passed, even pushing the prong into place did not allow for the battery to charge. At this point, the product didn't work as an emergency battery or a phone charger. To be clear, this product was never dropped or treated with excessive force. For the price, a lifespan of only a few months really isn't justifiable. Truly sad because this product would be perfect if it had a bit more longevity.
