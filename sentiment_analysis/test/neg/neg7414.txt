first one we received was broken, the port for the power connection was broken out of the box, made for a disappointed kid on Christmas morning.  had it replaced and while it worked initially, but continued to freeze and eventually just kept saying no signal, even tho all our connections were correct. not worth it.  We got the 7 inch Rasperry pi official screen for half the price even after we added a case, two more steps for set up but worth itit.
