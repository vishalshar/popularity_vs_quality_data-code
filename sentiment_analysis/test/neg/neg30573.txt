The bottom does not close appropriately; a slight bump and it opens discarding the contents. I took this diving to San Carlos, Mex and everything was on the bottom of the ocean. Luckily, it was only 30 feet to the bottom with a clear view for me to retrieve my wet contents! You will also have to be sure to lock the lever and "rattle" it a bit to ensure it's locked in; I thought I had it locked-in, but this too allowed the GoPro to almost float off. If you buy make sure you teather it to your bcd with a retractable cable! I mounted it on the left or right chest of the bcd; it got in the way of either: the regulator tubing or the low pressure hose inflator to the bcd when reaching for it. It's a great concept, but there is something better. I hope this helps.
