The included magnet is not reliable.  It failed on the first day I used the device and I lost it somewhere.  I  was not engaged in any particularly strenuous activity that would have knocked it loose and I wasn't wearing a thick shirt that would interfere with the magnet.  That being said, during that one day  the device seemed to function as described so if you are confident it will stay it may be worth a try.
