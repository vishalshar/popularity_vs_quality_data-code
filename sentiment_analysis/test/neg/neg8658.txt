Came in wrong color and not reliable.  I have several tile bluetooth locators and they work much more reliably.  I tried this one because I liked the pretty color, and then I didn't even get the sky blue I ordered, it came in bright green.  Too much trouble to return, so I used it, but I have never gotten it to actually locate anything.
