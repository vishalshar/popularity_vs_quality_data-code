This thing is always falling apart. I ordered a filter online and it took forever to replace and in the mean time went back to the old way (paying a quarter to fill a bottle at the supermarket) which tasted a lot better. I forgot about the filter until I got an email offering me a coupon for a new item because of the delay. Why would I want another item that needs a filter when there is a problem getting a single filter. But the new filter finally arrived and so I tried it since I paid for it, but the water is weird looking, cloudy and blueish. I don't get it and am not comfortable drinking it.
