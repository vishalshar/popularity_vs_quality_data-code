The phone looks fine. If you are interested in looks go for it.  This phone however has the lowest ring volume. The phone will literally be beside me but when it rings, sounds like it's in a room far away from me. no matter how much you increase the volume...still is very low. This is horrible. I would return it if I could ....i'm all the way in Jamaica so that's a real challenge for me.
