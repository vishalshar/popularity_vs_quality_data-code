I got the pencil out of the box with the eraser function faulty (which should not even be happening). The Fiftythree team subsequently told me change to the extra tips and they would send me a set of replacement tips. Therefore, I did as I was told and strangely, that solved the eraser problem. However, when I gave the Fiftythree team my address, they then told me they couldn't send me the tips because they don't mail to international customers. That to be is just an excuse. I was upset, but I let it go.What happened in the next few days is just unacceptable and ridiculous in my opinion considering how much I paid for this product, which by the way came out of the box with problems. Firstly, after connecting, the drawing tip often goes into blending mode randomly. And then came the part where it doesn't draw at all even though I tried drawing from different angles with the drawing tip. And lastly, I have random disconnections where the pencil just disconnects for no rhyme and reason. I have looked at the troubleshooting and both the tips according to the troubleshooting, appears to be working but when it comes to the actual drawing, it gives all sorts of problems.I am utterly disappointed with this product. For those considering to get this, I would say STEER CLEAR.
