why in god's name have such HUGE amounts of vitamin B??? there is research now showing elevated levels of some B vitamins in pregnant women are associated with autism in children. I'm not making an causal claims but 2000% of the daily value of any vitamin is ridiculous and should be categorically unsafe.
