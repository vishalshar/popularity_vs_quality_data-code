I am a college student who frequently uses this pen for note taking on my iPad as well as drawing on the Paper app. I bought the pen through this Amazon FiftyThree official seller. Here's my review after using this pen for about 2 weeks:Pro:- It's a solid pen for the Paper app. I especially like how I can smudge with my finger when I'm using this pen.If you are going to use the pencil ONLY for the Paper app, and quite INFREQUENTLY, I recommend buying this.Con:- I've been using the pen for ONLY 2 WEEKS, and the tip is starting to wear out already. On BOTH SIDES. Currently, I see both sides of my tip wearing off and I think I would need to replace it after using one set of tip for about a month. I'm really disappointed with this, since I don't want to keep on buying the replacement for $8 every month. I'm currently thinking of using the FiftyThree Pencil for infrequent use for Paper app only, and try buying another JotPro or something along that line for taking notes...- The pen works better on one side than the other, so I frequently have to turn the pencil over if I'm on the wrong side. This is not a huge problem, but gets very annoying at times. Same with the eraser part. One side works better.- Tip is a bit shaky. Since you have to frequently pull out the tip to recharge it using the USB portion that is on the opposite end of the tip inside the wooden part, I think the seal get loose and the TIP DOESN'T STAY TIGHT TO THE WOODEN PART. I think this could be a design problem? Or maybe it's just my pencil that had everything going wrong.Conclusion: I'm currently using it, since I haven't ordered the JotPro / or some other disk type stylus for taking notes, but I really wish I had bought something else. After having bought this pencil after very thorough research about stylus pen, I expected something better. The build quality of this Pencil is not worth my $60 + tax investment. Also note that I'm just a bit upset that the tip is already wearing off.
