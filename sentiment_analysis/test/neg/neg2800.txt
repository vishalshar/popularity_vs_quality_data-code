I'm tired of using notebooks, carrying a bunch of pens and pencils just to jot an idea down quickly (and I'm An avid Apple user, so the Note is not for me). So I looked into Pencil and Paper by 53. The software looked alright (more on that later), and the hardware sounded promising.Hardware:It's big. Not uncomfortably big, but it is a blunt instrument rather than a fine tool. 'Surface Pressure' is a load of baloney. It's iOS 8's (not Paper's) way of seeing how much of a finger is on the screen during a press. It may work well with a finger (I don't know any apps that are using it) but it doesn't work in the Paper App or with Pencil in my testing. It isn't detecting the amount of stylus or finger in realtime, so you don't get a sense of how much pressure you are applying or how big the resulting dot will be. I never got it working in Paper with lines, but I can only imagine that it's just as bad. 'Surface Pressure' is misleading because, without significant research into the marketing buzzwords, it seems as though it refers to pressure sensitivity. Despite the advertising and images and videos showing tips with coils in them, PENCIL IS NOT PRESSURE SENSITIVE. Shame on them for using the deceptive marketing to make it appear as though Pencil is worth $50 and shame on me for spending it.Delving deeper, and forgetting pressure response, the large nib on Pencil is... blunt. The amount of give there is in the rubber itself lends to significant marking of the iPad's screen as the rubber wears onto the screen (hence, replaceable tips). The give in the rubber makes it very difficult to identify where Pencil is connecting with the screen. You never truly know where a line is coming from. Worse, though, is that the size of the nib obscures the view of the display, so connecting lines seamlessly was nearly impossible. The eraser function is interesting but, again, blunt. It responds by a toggle in the eraser, not by gyroscope, meaning the function must be used with quite a lot of the eraser on the screen. This turns a fine correction into a swath of destruction.Bluetooth worked fine and was reliable. My Pencil shipped with firmware 55 and needed to update to 74 when I first connected. Updating was relatively painless, but took a whopping 8 minutes. I was frustrated, to say the least, as you can't do ANYTHING else while updating. No switching apps, no turning the screen off, no home button presses... Nothing. I was disappointed. My Pebble runs an OS, apps, display, etc. (in other words, a much larger and more complex update) and can handle a new firmware update in just under 2 minutes. Pencil could easily improve this, but 8 minutes is insane for such simple functionality. Then again, you probably won't see too many firmware updates, so it's not a frequent occurrence.The design is gorgeous, even if it doesn't lend itself to function. It looks like a carpenter's pencil. Very nice.To be clear, hardware-wise, you're best off avoiding this for an Adonit Jot Touch or even a cheap stylus from Walgreens/CVS. Pencil offers no features that command a 10x price increase over the basic capacitive stylus, and weak-to-unusable copies of features that come in other units that are just $25 more. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, and I'm returning mine.SoftwarePaper is a very nice looking app. You'll probably pick Paper to use unless you own one of the other two apps that integrate Pencil. Opening the app, there is a carousel of notebooks and pinching brings you to a page flipping view, and all the way to the content page itself. Then, you tap the tip of Pencil to the pencil icon, wait for the spinning to finish and you're good to go. Easy.Unfortunately, you're only good to go in Landscape. There is no portrait orientation for this app. Huge oversight. Then, if you want to see your Pencil settings (like control what a finger does, toggle palm rejection, update firmware...) you have to go to the beginning of the app and press the '53' icon. I had to Google this. Developers have been using the cog for years now to indicate settings. Further, it's incredibly unintuitive to move out of the content view. Swiping from the left and right to move pages was hit and miss, sometimes blurring everything under my finger. Finding the undo function was equally baffling, and I've found that it is some combination of two fingers moving up and down. I am still lost, and with the amount of mistakes the software and hardware designs are going to make you make, it's quite an important function. There are no buttons at all in the page-content view. There's a tray for brushes and colours on the bottom page that you can hide, but that's it. To leave a notebook you pinch. Why there are no buttons alongside the sliding tray, I don't know.Functionally, it's not bad. It puts lines down on the screen and saves them between sessions. Again, though, it has massive failings. There was no visible export, share or save function, short of iOS's built in screenshot function. Palm rejection worked, for the most part, but I don't think it's intelligent. It just picks if Pencil is touching, a finger-size non-Pencil is touching or anything else is touching. It's blunt, much like the hardware, leading to a lot of miscategorized touches and errors. You also need to disable multitasking gestures, as Pencil and Paper can't override those system-level detections. Again, very blunt.Paper is also an in-app purchasing nightmare. With Pencil, you can use every tool. Without Pencil? It's anywhere from $0.99 to $6.99 for each tool, and it's divided by Pencil, Marker, Brush... Even the colour selector is a purchase. Tools have no options, brushes have no patterns, there's no RGB, hex, CYMK, etc. selection in the (paid) colour chooser. In short, the tools are poor, will make you poor and don't even allow you to test them out before you drop another $50 on a tool.On the flipside, Pencil works with two other apps. I'm not sure more are coming. I didn't buy those other two apps, though reviews suggest they are better than Paper. I couldn't find much on the Pencil integration, though.In short, don't bother with this product. It is a blunt instrument that isn't capable of much beyond your finger or a $5 stylus. 53 has really botched this for the sake of cost, while charging way too much for it. It is NOT pressure sensitive, NOR does their implementation of surface pressure work well. The accompanying app is equally poor, implementing features in a haphazard and nonsensical way. Detection of the Pencil, finger and palm are inaccurate, causing more frustration than productivity. AVOID! Save your $50.
