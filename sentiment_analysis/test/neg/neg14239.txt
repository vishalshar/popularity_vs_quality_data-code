Overpriced toy that may frustrate children.I think I am the first one that actually paid for the robot and posting review.Likes: It doesn't have cheap toy feels. Hardware feels quite solid. It comes with a charging base and a fetch ball included.Dislikes: its voice recognition is so poor it doesn't understand any of my children's voice commands. My boy is so frustrated he almost cried when the robot only responded to grown-ups. You have to say the exact "words" with rather low adult's voice tone. Self charging rarely works. When the dog barks, it has a noise in the background sound.  Since there is no chance its firmware could be updated by the user/consumer later, we are stuck with the frustrating robot. BTW, my son wanted to name it "Rover" while waiting for its delivery, you can only call it "Chip" with a deep grown-ups voice. One of the reason it doesn't feel like a real dog is it doesn't do anything, motionless between commands.
