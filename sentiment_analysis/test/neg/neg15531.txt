I read the comments on the failures of the Withings Activite Sapphire and I asked about why there are many disatisfied customers, then I made a mistake to purchase it.  On opening the box it failed to adjust the minute hand, so I went and put a new battery and it worked but only for a few days and then the minute hand stopped again.  So I try to call customer service and I see not number. I feel a form online and I get a response in a couple of hours - hurray. They start by apologizing and offer to replace if I give my address and copy of invoice. I send it and I get back an email from another customer service agent telling me my complaint is being sent to tier 2 team for assistance that will tell me my next steps. Suddenly it's not shipping of my replacement watch.I give it one star for the nice looks. But it doesn't work and customer service is painful for a customer that has failure from day one and has to wait for instructions after a clear statement from customer service that it's faulty and must be replaced.  How about an apology for not being able to immediately replace the watch as promised by the first customer service agent. I avoided giving a negative feedback wanting to give customer service a chance first but that was disappointing after the initial polite agent.  Judging from my experience and other similar failures in the watch, it is Unreliable and customer service is painfully unsatisfactory.
