I liked it at first but the past 2 weeks I'm having problems with it tracking my sleep correctly, it's not right at all.  I have contacted customer service but they just say they'll get with their developers.  No deadline or option to replace it for me.  I wish it worked like it did when I first got it a month ago.  :-(  At the moment all it is is a fancy pedometer.
