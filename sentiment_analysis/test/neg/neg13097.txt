It should be noted there is no AM radio with this unit, but I am giving it a low review due to the turntable. I was not expecting top of the line quality for this price, but I also was not expecting the turntable to make a squeaking noise as it rotated. I might have sent it back, but I would expect about the same, so I'm just cutting my losses with this. The speakers and CD player work decently.
