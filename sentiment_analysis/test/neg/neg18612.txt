I had high expectations for this product and was very excited to receive it. However, when it arrived i was immediately disappointed and surprised by the quality of the materials used. The strap was/is already fraying in multiple places. Each time i take it on and off it appears to wear considerably. I also ordered the Quad Lock poncho and although the product is a wonderful idea, again the quality is disappointing. Both the poncho and the case itself are actually loose, so the iphone doesn't feel secure in either one (they stretch out very quickly). When running the phone bounces side to side way more than any other armband i've tried (even the cheaper ones). I ordered this product mainly for the convenience/ease of removal and attachment (of the phone to the armband) without a hassle, however it isn't all that easy--the locks don't attach without several minutes of effort. I ordered a $10.00 armband off of amazon at the same time and that band is actually comprabile if not better sadly. I am disappointed in the product, I was so looking forward to using it and the price is not really justified by the quality. I am hoping it is a fluke defect of just the band i ordered but I am still weary to order another one to see--especially when they are so expensive in the first place.
