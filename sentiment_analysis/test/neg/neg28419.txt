I'm an Ayurveda Practitioner, Reiki Master Teacher, Yoga and Meditation and Mantra Instructor: this is just another processed product with good marketing but unhealthy qualities.  If you want to get over a Red Bull addiction and need something to do it, this might help as a bridge. Not something to spend money on for health benefits, though. Get a good book, do a web search, or ask a local expert and learn to make your own herbal teas!
