I purchased this to give a bit more life to my daughter's 4 year old Macbook Air.  It worked OK for about 2 months albeit with a bit slower performance.  After that, we had quite a few problems including the user accounts becoming lost in login three times, painfully degraded performance on login and app launches as well as the final straw of not connecting to wifi access points to which it had been connected for months.  While I don't know if these problems are truly attributable to the Tardisk, we've removed it an rebuilt the machine form scratch and it's much better and she didn't have these issues prior.
