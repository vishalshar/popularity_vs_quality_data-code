This was purchased December 2015 for a Christmas gift for my 9 year old son.  It was the main item on his holiday wish list and Santa delivered!On Christmas morning, he was very excited.  We opened the box, set it up (which was all easy) downloaded the apps on an Ipad and an Iphone and we started to play and figure it all out.I give 5 stars for ease of setup as the magnetic connectors for the track are great, the app download was seamless, the syncing of the cars was A+ but all that ended when I noticed the $100 that was spent was barely played with a few days after the holidays.I am not giving this 2 stars because the product did not work or anything like that. I am giving it 2 stars because after a few hours of play it gets rather boring.The thing is, this is a play on 2016 slot car racing that I remember when I was a kit.  Slot car racing was fun because the cars would fly off the track if you did not slow down on turns or use the controls correctly.  The cars don't fly off the track with the Anki Overdrive track. They just go around and around and you use your app features to slow down the other car.  To me, they were close but just did not get this product to the point of something that kids or adults will want to play with for long periods of time.Ours is currently sitting under the ping pong table and has not been touched for months.
