This product was definitely not ready for release. The most I could use it was about 4-5 minutes because after that it would lock up my device. I tried it on an LG G3 and it locked up, I also tried it on my Kindle Fire HDX with the same results.  Even if it didn't lock up I think I would have returned it for the following reasons.1: It requires you to take the case off of your phone because the USB connector isn't long enough as it was made to mount flush on your device. They could have at least included a small extender for people with cases, which is most of us.2: The resolution is horrible, maybe I'm just spoiled by the $2000 Fluke FLIR camera that I use at work.  I got it so that I could look at board level components and it was impossible, it just doesn't have the resolution.3: The software is very buggy (besides locking up).  One time it showed the temperature scale as 5,456,678 to -3,239,956 (must be global warming).  Other times it would rotate the screen even though I hadn't rotated the device.  Also the temperature was consistently off depending on how far away you are from the object. There is also a horrible delay, 2-3 seconds, so you need to move it very slowly.4: The app makes you sign in every time you want to use it.The only good thing I can think of about this product is the packaging.  A very nice box with magnets so that it was very easy to package back up and return.
