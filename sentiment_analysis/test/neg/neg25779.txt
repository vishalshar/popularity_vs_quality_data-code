I love the concept, but the execution is poor.  I'm fairly tech savvy and I couldn't get them to work after two hours of trying all of the troubleshooting suggestions on their website.  The left and right units seemed to charge and sync properly and were able to connect to a PC.  When I put first put them in after charging, no sounds or response to anything at all.  After updating the software, they would make an initial chirp when I put them in, but nothing after that.  Neither the left or right would respond to any touch commands.  Using just the right alone in "right only mode" I could get it to respond to some touch commands, but not successfully sync to my phone or activate the internal music player.  I suppose it's possible I could have tried to work with customer support to try to find a solution, but for $248 I expect headphones to work without a lot of effort on my part.  I sent mine back.Also, Bragi's attention to detail seems a little lacking.  There are some conflicting instructions on their website, the app, and on the packaging.  The url for support printed on the packaging is a broken page.  Seems like that would be an easy fix to have it automatically re-direct to an active page if they decided to change it after having the packaging printed.
