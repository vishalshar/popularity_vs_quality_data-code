I don't want to be unfair here but I gave a single star because I lost these glasses within a week of purchasing them.  They fell out of the case while I was traveling.  The concept it awesome and the actual glasses work very well.  The case attached to the back of the phone does not hold the glasses in effectively enough to prevent loss.
