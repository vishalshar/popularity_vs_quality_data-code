The app does not work at all on my Dell Venue 8 or my LG LGL33L. This is seriously pathetic. It crashes before it gets past the intro screen and goes no further. Do they quality test this app at all? No, they do NOT, because if they did, things like this would not happen. No quality control and a very poor product. If you enjoy having your time wasted, buy this pathetic, worthless piece of trash for $200. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH. Absolute worthless garbage, DO NOT BUY THIS SCAM OF AN ITEM. THIS IS A SCAM AND THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE SUED INTO OBLIVION.
