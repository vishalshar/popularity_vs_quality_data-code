This Dac/amp works..period!! Very impressive sound. Good job in terms of sound. I do agree though that the plastic is ugly. After looking at the marketing photos on Amazon and their web page the production V2 looks absolutely nothing like the photos they show. To me sadly as much as I like the sound quality. I'm beginning to wonder what's really under this ugly piece of plastic. Perhaps the interior components are also misrepresented and poorly constructed. Could be 100% better in terms of the exterior. Especially for $300.00. If your going to sell this change your advertising photos and be truthful.
