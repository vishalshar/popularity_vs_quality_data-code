I got this for my kid's science project.I received a clearly used/previously opened set.Cloud bit didn't work at all right out of the box.  I went online and did some research; it said something about the cloud bit maybe allocated to someone else's email address previously (or something).science project was due to 2 or 3 days -- no time to exchange, and by the time I got the time again to try to exchange, refund period expired.
