Let me start by saying that I really wanted to like this camera. There are quite few options on the market for internet-connected security cameras, but the Toucan stood up, with it's two-way audio, free recording of up to 2 hours and the ability to control the light socket through the app. The installation was fairly easy, I had to drill two holes in the brick wall of the house, then use the provided screws to attach it - took less than 10 minutes. Setting up the app was easy as well. However, once in service the camera start showing it's flaws.First of all this camera is designed to be installed directly under a light source, which might sound like a good idea at first, but the motion sensor is so sensitive that even on the lowest possible setting it gets triggered by all the moths and other bugs that get attracted by the light bulb above it. Speaking of the light bulb, after day and a half the ability to turn the light on or off from the app stopped working and I could not make it work again - restarting the camera, installing new light bulb etc...nada!The motion detection gets triggered 30 times a day even on the lowest setting with no apparent moving objects and sometimes it misses moving objects like cars entirely.I can not recommend this camera to anyone at this point and will be returning it.
