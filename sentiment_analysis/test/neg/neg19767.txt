One of the most disappointing products I've ever ordered!  Don't buy under any circumstances!  Its a total waste of time and money! I had such high hopes for this suitcase.  Sounded like such a great idea. Who doesn't want the perfect carry-on bag that does it all, right?  The reality is  - while it is a good looking suitcase from the outside - it has half the interior space of a normal carryon this size...and who the hell wants that these days!!!!!!!There is barely space for a pair of shoes, a couple shirts and a toiletry kit.  And the laptop opening is laughable....maybe you can squeeze an i-pad into it but not much more.  Makes you wonder how well all the other so-called marvelous technically advanced features work.I only gave it ONE STAR because there was no option to give it a ZERO!  What a pity the designers did not come up with something smarter.  This should be up for a RAZZIE AWARD in 2016.  Cause it SERIOUSLY SUCKS and is going back in the mail tomorrow morning for a refund.tcs
