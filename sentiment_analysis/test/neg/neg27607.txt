APP requires IOS 8 even though box says IOS 7I usually do not like to continually upgrade and can not use this with my current phone because I do not want to upgrade to IOS 8Also it only has a 6 hour memory when you are away from the device. It was not clear to me that you had to have your phone or device with you at all times which defeats the purpose. I had a rather tense day and received no vibration. I am very dissatisfied with the Spire.
