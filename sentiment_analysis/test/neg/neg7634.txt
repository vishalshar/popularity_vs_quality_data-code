Didn't even sprout, I thought it would be a perfect solution for the winter months. I brought in my thyme, oregano, parsley and rosemary in the pots from my deck for the winter months but my basil only seems to last a couple of months so I thought this would be a great solution. All of my other herbs are flourishing, harvested some yesterday as a matter of fact, but this basil didn't even sprout.
