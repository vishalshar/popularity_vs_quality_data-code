I ordered Watch Ya' Mouth Family Edition that stated that it was the trademarked/authentic edition.  I received an edition that was not as promised.  The box was completely smashed.  There were no instructions sent.  There were multiple duplicates of the cards sent in addition to many of the cards having spelling errors such as "baskerball."  I ordered this as a Christmas gift for someone and am very disappointed at what I received.  I also ordered another one later that same day so I unfortunately have 2 of these unusable games.  I would not recommend that anyone buy this product from the seller "justgoodgoods."
