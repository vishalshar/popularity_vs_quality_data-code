The Shine 2 device is an example of expensive electronic trash. DO NOT buy or believe it will somehow be better for you.  Device does not keep accurate or representative activity records.  The foolish non-sensical misfit 'point' system uses some meaningless algorithm to attach a 'point' level to recorded activity, yet repeated activities of the same type and duration will yield drasctically inconsistent results in both misfit 'points', steps or whatever calculated metric their equivalently useless app generates.  For example a repeat of a ~5k run on successive days will result in anything from 1/4 to 4 times calculated points, steps or distance.  This feedback renders the device effectively useless.  There is also no way to change the metric recording of the app, you can only have your misfit 'points' listed which, as mentioned vary wildly and inconsistently for the same actions, activity or exercise.In addition, the android app is useless  For some odd reason the app will not sync (download) activity records from the Shine 2 unless location is enabled on the android device and there is a data connection (not just a wifi connection, but a cellular data connection.)  Why does a little step recorded that has no GPS or tracking capability require my location or a data connection?  Within the first 3 weeks the battery died yet the app always indicated the battery as full.  Another app failure.To top this off, the included wrist band is only a way to lose this little $99 disk shaped piece of sh-.  Within minutes of first wearing I was scrambling around hunting for the thing several times, so chose to only use the little pocket clip.  In regular use the Shine 2 also loses it's time/clock sync resulting in the watch function also being unreliable and useless.Misfit support has been marginal at best, just running through "try again' advice and repeated steps that request more and more information.  My frustration is at an end with this thing and it is being sent back to misfit.  Unfortunately, Amazon will only allow returns for 30 days and in my desire to try to get this to work that expired.  I am left with trying a warranty replacement which will be with a ... refurbished unit.  Very displeased and unimpressed. Avoid misift products.  Mine is not a unique experience either, with two coworkers having similar issues.
