I personally dont like to give a product a bad rating, I 'd rather not write a review . But I am very unhappy with this product. I received this product 3 days ago. It's 27,000 Amp Chargethech model. After I fully load the charger and my MacBook pro 2011 was completely discharged, I connected the charger to my Mac. About 2 hours later it charged my computer all the way to %70 but the charger was completely drained and there was no more juice on it. I did the exact same thing for the second time and it was even worse. I am not an expert and I really dont know if this is exactly the way it's supposed to be. I was reading a review on one of the Ankers products (Anker portable charger 26,700) and a customer was saying if you have a Mac with USB_C, it will charge your Mac 4 times! I also emailed the customer service to inform them of the issue but havent heard back from them yet. If I were to give a real rating to this product it would have been only one star.
