The lock itself is great. Easy to install, easy to operate. The app is useful, although sometimes drops connection with lock, despite proximity to lock itself. Using Homekit, the product absolutely fails as advertised. Not sure if it is an Apple thing or an August thing. Either way, I have yet to be able to find a setting with the lock or iOS/AppleTV that will allow for one to lock/unlock, or verify locked/unlocked remotely -- it just fails. Having reset all my devices, locks, and network, I'm about to pack it up and send back for a refund. I'm sure there is a way, just have not found it yet - not sure I want to invest more time. This shouldn't be the user's issue, it should be solved before shipped.  Product does not work as advertised - I believe August should be refunding, and reducing the sale price to accommodate the lack of advertised functionality.The lock works perfectly as a non-homekit device (bluetooth connected).<30 Day update: PANIC!!!! Wow!!! Was this tested? Not even 30d in, and I have had enough problems that I am cannot recommend this. First, it's bulky, the knob is freakishly big. Second, if you have the Smart keypad, get ready to get really annoyed with the batteries only lasting ~20d, WITH NO WARNING THAT THEY ARE GOING LOW.  SAFETY  CONCERN?!?!!!  Last, HomeKit is hit or miss - never consistent - and with something as important as getting into your house, this should just work.Honestly, the concept is great - but it is not ready for consumer use.
