I used this over the weekend for a long trip and when I removed the product from my dashboard, it also took about a millimeter of dashboard with it. Now every time I look at my dashboard, it reminds me of Sperm Whale with Giant Squid suction mark scars on it. I am extraordinarily angry with this product as I am meticulous about the inside of my car and keeping it orderly. Thanks for ruining my dashboard, iOttie.
