I was really excited to do this project with my kids. We homeschool them and this month was fungus! We waited our ten days, then two weeks, still nothing. We misted 2x a day. Did not remove the plastic except where we were told to cut. We even visited their website and tried re-soaking both sides. After a month, we gave up and threw it into our compost. My kids were so heart broken. We're on a tight school supply budget so this really ruined our month.
