This is a nice concept but needs more R & D . I put new duracell quantum batteries and this didn't have the torque needed. When operating it sounded like a sick grinder. It definitely needs a stronger motor because when lightly touching it slowed way down or even stopped a few times. Plus the 1 inch of adhesive velcro is laughingly not enough to anchor down this beast. Mine came loose the first try, 4 suction cups would probably do the trick. I returned mine and is not worth the $60 I paid for it. did not contact the company because I did not want to wait close to the 30 day amazon return window.
