I'm returning it.  The camera does a decent job at motion detection (when it works, which is maybe 40% of the time).  However, there are many false positives and missing of events.  The max recording is 10 seconds, which is not enough time to capture something happening.  Also, there is a bug when filming outdoors, the video goes completely white.  The fix was to disable the "Frequency" option, but even when disabled, the white-out still occurred (including a video).  Too much fighting with this camera with not enough functioning is causing me to return it.I was looking for a network camera that used wifi 802.11AC, supported mjpg and rtsp streaming, 720P resolution, infrared night vision, FTP upload support, remote viewing, and cost less than $100.  I also wanted the option not to push my footage into the cloud.  I came across the DLink DCS-935L.Network configuration was easy; I hit the WPS button on my router, then held the WPS button on the back of the camera.  It got on the network quickly, and I was able to connect to the camera webpage for configuration.The camera configuration web interface is decent, however there are a few flaws.  As others have mentioned, the web interface uses Java and ActiveX, which are security risks.  Also, the camera has an internal certificate which expired on September 3, 2015.  This means the plugins will not load in your browser without changes.  I called DLink Support about this and spoke with Briegan (AR004214) who walked me through disabling browser security.  This allowed the plugins to load properly.  I can see how this process would turn many users off.Once I was able to load the plugins, I could configure the camera.  I enabled Motion Detection, and set up an FTP server.  I'm still tweaking the motion detection sensitivity...I'm at 85% right now.  When the camera detects motion, it uploads an MP4 video clip to the FTP.There are some cool features regarding ftp upload, image manipulation, automatically rebooting the camera, and backing up configuration.  I'm glad these options exist because I wanted to avoid the cloud configuration.  The DCS-935L gives you the option to use the cloud, or keep it local.Once the camera was setup, I was impressed with its performance.  The Java and ActiveX plugins are a security risk and should be changed.  Also the expired internal certificate makes configuration difficult.  However, the video quality, features, and cost make this camera a good buy.FYI, here are URL's to access the camera's feed (change "camera_ip" with the IP address of your camera):Realtime Image Snapshot: http://camera_ip/cgi/jpg/image.cgiRealtime Video Stream: http://camera_ip/video/mjpg.cgiH.264 RTSP Streaming (Port 554): rtsp://<username>:<password>@camera_ip:554/play1.sdpMJPEG RTSP Streaming (Port 554): rtsp://<username>:<password>@camera_ip:554/play2.sdp
