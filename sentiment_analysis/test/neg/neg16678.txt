Since my wife constantly misplaces her phone I thought this would be the perfect solution. What a surprise to find that while the idea is great, the execution is horrible. 1, The setup asks for information that has nothing to do with function. Why do they need my email?  2. The range has a mind of it's own. Sometimes 10 feet, sometimes nothing. 3. Killed the battery on an iphone 6 overnight. You cannot find a dead phone. Three strikes and out, little piece of junk.
