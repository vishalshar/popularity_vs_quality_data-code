I am updating my comment because Tardisk COO contacted me the day after I posted my comment. The have an awesome costumer service. However, the product itself is difficult to install and my Macbook turned itself into a mess during the installation process (even before I put the Tardisk into the slot). In my opinion, the installation process is something for specialists, or, at least, for someone with good knowledge about technical aspects of the OS X.After returning the Tardisks I've bought, the Tardisk costumer service offered me a gift card to make up the trouble I went through.If they develop a easier to install device, I'll be happy to try it again. But it must be really "with one click", like their Youtube advertisement says.
