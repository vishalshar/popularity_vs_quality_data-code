I received a counterfeit/pirated copy of this game. I ordered one from a guy named YaoYao Adams and not one filled by Amazon.The game is fun and funny but the mouth pieces came in an unsealed bag and the cards were just wrapped in rubber bands and badly damaged.The cards also have some major spelling/grammar mistakes. (See photo for examples)Buy the real version!
