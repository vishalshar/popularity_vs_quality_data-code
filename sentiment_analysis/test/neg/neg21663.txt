Only getting a second star because I like the concept. The problem is, half the time it stops working. It turns off on its own, won't play the alarm with music(I've tried every option), sometimes the dimmer button won't work, most of the time the other buttons on top won't work. That's not even addressing the app issues. I am SO mad that I purchased this and wasted my money.
