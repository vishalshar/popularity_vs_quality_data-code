I was very disappointed with this product. I was so excited that a company had finally made a slick and professional looking smartwatch that I could wear to work and not feel like I had a toy on my wrist. and on top of that, it was compatible with my windows phone. the battery life was impressive for sure, but unfortunately I ran into a lot of connection issues between my phone and the device. the Bluetooth would disconnect if I was more than 20-ish feet away from my phone, so I couldn't even go downstairs to the kitchen without it disconnecting and me not receiving any notifications. when the phone and watch were out in the open together the connection worked like a charm and was very responsive with only 1-2 second delay in messages. but when I put any type of barrier between my phone and the watch (like placing my phone in my carrying case that attaches to my belt) the connection would become extremely inconsistent and the watch would constantly be notifying me that it was disconnected and searching for my phone. the devices were both on my person with only a 2-3mm thick barrier between them and it wasn't able to maintain a strong connection. that is unacceptable for me. I used this device for a full week hoping that the connection issue would resolve itself over time, but the more I used it the more apparent it became that the Bluetooth technology inside the watch was just too old or too weak to maintain a strong connection.my phone connects to multiple other Bluetooth devices in my house and stays connected through walls without any issue, so I'm convinced that it wasn't my phone that was causing the issues. I returned this product after 1 week of use, but I hold out hope that the second generation version will improve upon its predecessor. a decent first try vector, but I'm gonna have to wait for your second attempt.
