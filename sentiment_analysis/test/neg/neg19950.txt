I was very disappointed in this product. It would have been great to have used in therapy, however the pieces were misprinted when it arrived. They were still in the mold and had to be punched out, yet the faces and and heads of the animals were on multiple different pieces. Someone at the manufacturing had fed it into the printer incorrectly. I returned the product.
