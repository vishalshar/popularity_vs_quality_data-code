I was doing schoolwork then it randomly shut off. The battery was fully charged (I unplugged the charger 10 minutes before it turned off) I was sending documents to my teacher and POOF the screen turned black. I then press the power button to turn it back on. The light LED light and the airplane LED Light flash blue but the screen was still black. Does anyone know how I can get the screen to turn back on?
