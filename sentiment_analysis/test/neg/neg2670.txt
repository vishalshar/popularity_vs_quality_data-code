The idea is good, but it feels like two different things going on here. The car and track is completely irrelevant to the cards and the app.  The car just continues around the track with no real purpose to the game. The app and cards coming to "life" are pretty neat, but I wish I could have just gotten 20 more of the cards and created an entire world of these. I'm really glad I found this when it was on sale.  Wouldn't recommend.
