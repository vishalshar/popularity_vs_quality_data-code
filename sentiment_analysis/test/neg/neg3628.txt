It's pretty, but it just doesn't work. I have a TDS meter. My tap water is 228 ppm. I run it through this filter and it's  220 ppm. Ummm.. that's not taking anything out! I figured so as it runs through the small filter so fast. I'll stick to our zero filter which honestly gets it down to zero ppms.
