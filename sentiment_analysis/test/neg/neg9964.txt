I really like the idea of a weather station that is WiFi and which talks to my iPhone.The UI on this is very clean and pretty.Ability to add more sensors is great!So what's the problem?Well there are a few. First off the accuracy of each module is not very good. I have 4 modules and if all of them are sitting next to each other I will see a 2ÅŸ difference in temperature (not too bad) but a 20% difference in humidity (really bad) so one module will be at 45% and another at 64% and the rest in between. There is also a difference between the CO2 readings even if you follow directions to synch them.Second problem is all your weather data is belong to us. Meaning the weather station sends all your info, including sound level in your house and CO2 levels (both can determine if someone is at home or not) in CLEAR TEXT across the internet to a datacenter that this French company uses. Not smart!Last problem is with Support. I have had a ticket open to them for over 3 weeks to resolve the humidity issue (I want to get a replacement sensor or two) and they have not bothered to even contact me for more details. Completely unresponsive! So BEWARE this is a French, not a US product and support will be provided accordingly.
