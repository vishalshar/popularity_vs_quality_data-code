I was so excited about these slim glasses but the idea is better than the instantiation. For me, it was a fail on several fronts; I couldn't get the glasses to stay on my nose no matter what I did, the case kept twisting and eventually detaching from the phone and the lenses scratch way to easily. Now I realize these are not designed for long-term wear, I was really looking at them as a quickie solution to reading a menu in a restaurant, or a label in the grocery store, but I found myself frustrated across the board and especially after seeing scratches on the plastic lenses after a few weeks, I gave up all together.It's a great idea and maybe after some refinement, I'll try again.
