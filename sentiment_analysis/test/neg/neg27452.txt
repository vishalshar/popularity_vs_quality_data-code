I was very excited to get this game and play it with my family over the holidays.  It turned into a huge disappointment.  Several of the cards had phrases that didn't make sense, others had spelling errors ('No fork cup noodie?' 'Baskerball tournament?' 'Lost singht of land?' 'Have a Sreaw loose?') As much as I paid for the game, and as long as it took to receive, I expected a quality product.  Big disappointment.
