I regret my decision to be an early adopter for the Shine 2. Initially, I thought it was great. It's beautiful, and it tracked very well. The biggest problem was that it kept flying out of the wristband. Misfit sent me the same wristband as a replacement, and it was already broken.I figured I'd just deal with it and buy a new band when they came out.Now, the Shine 2 won't sync with my computer (and isn't telling the correct time). I assume the battery might be dying, but I'm probably just going to throw the whole thing away and go back to Fitbit.So disappointed.
