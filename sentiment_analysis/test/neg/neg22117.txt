We buy this product at least once a month.  This time the chicken was very hard and super dry.  Had a totally different color and consistency.Gave a sample to our cats and they threw up.You would think at 60 plus dollars a bag this company would have quality control personnel in place to assure the quality of their product.I returned it and waiting for another bag. However I'm not sure that I feel comfortable with this product any more.
