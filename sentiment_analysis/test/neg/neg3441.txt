Very sad item.  Secure (hidden) networks must be made visible to link it.  It won't relink by itself after a power or wireless network failure.  And, generally does not seem to do it's job very well.After buying this and trying to get it going initially, I went looking for more info than D-Link supplies (which isn't much.)  That's when I saw a lot of negative comments about it.  My bad for not having researched more before I bought it.I have a use for a few more devices like this, but they certainly won't be D-Link products.
