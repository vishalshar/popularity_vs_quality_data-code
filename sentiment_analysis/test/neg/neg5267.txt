***UPDATE***I still stand by everything I said, but will no longer be purchasing this from Amazon, but instead from CHEWY.COM.I live in the mountains far from any store I could purchase this from, and almost ran out and had to deal with issues of switching because they changed the price from $44 to $70. This isn't the grain free, and all the other 50 pound bags are around $50. Why the sudden change? As I said, love this food but will now be purchasing from CHEWY.LOVE this dog food. I spent a long time researching a dry food to mix with my dogs raw food diet as I do not feel fully confident I am adding all the blends of nutrients they may need, and it is awesome. I have never had an issue with their poops (be sure you are changing foods gradually and correctly as I would bet this is most people's issues when having negative switching experiences), it is rated 5 stars on dog food advisor, a,d I like that it is mostly meat MEALS which have countless times more protein than just the meat. The price is amazing for the amount and all the factors that matter to me, so I will continue to purchase :)
