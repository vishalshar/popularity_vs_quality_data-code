When your little one suffers from night terrors you are willing to pay any amount of money to make them end  and Lully takes full advantage of the fact.  For $130, they offer you a vibrating hockey puck.  I made the further mistake of paying $70 for the premium software  for that, you basically get a calendar.The science is valid for ending night terrors, however, dont waste your money on this product.  Night terrors tend to occur at the same time every night.  Keep track of when your child is having the night terrors.  Once you know the pattern, about 15-30 minutes before he would normally have the terrors, go to him and stir him (ideally, you want him to be slightly awake without fully waking up)  just enough to take him out of his sleep pattern.  Keep a calendar of the occurrences and times and with some trial and error, you can minimize or eliminate the night terrors without throwing away $130-200.
