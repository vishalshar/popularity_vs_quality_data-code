I had such high hopes for this product.  As a new Father I hoped to use it to close the 1,800 miles between us and our new Son's Grandparents.  I am already have 2 Amazon Echo's so that was not a functionality I needed.  I set one up at home and shipped the other to Grandma!  My Brother, an IT professional set up the other.  We both found the software to be clunky and it took several attempts to connect the two units.  My Brother downloaded the phone software and never could get it to connect.  Then there is the device itself.  It is quite heavy and the provided stand has zero adjustment.  That means, placing it on the counter we had to back it so far away to catch the vertical frame that you could hardly see the baby on the other side.  My Mom's was on the table next to her chair, being non-adjustable and frankly a rather small screen forced her to pick it up to use it.  The weight makes holding it a poor option.  I can not overstate how useless the stand is on this device.  I know why it is not adjustable as the face of the device is so heavy any other angle would risk toppling.  The provided wall mount, really???  Wall mount this!Then there is the video quality.  The camera is very sensitive to any light behind the subject and burned out the image loosing all detail.  Front light was glaring and the exposure was terrible.  This made the picture grant and with bright and dark areas.  Finally, another review indicated he turned the privacy settings off for a remote connection we found that not to be an option.At the end of the day this product is substandard to Skype on a tablet or PC and Face time is WORLDS better, especially with the new IOS software.At the end of the day I am returning this product because I feel like the functionality and image quality was way overstated.  My solution is to buy an old iPad and give it to my Mom so we can Face time.Finally, I loved the idea of supporting a start-up but this was is a total disappointment in my book.
