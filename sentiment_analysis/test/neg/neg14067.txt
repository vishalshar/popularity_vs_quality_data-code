I had this now for over a month. Great concept but disappointing implementation. This controlled is supposed to water the lawn based on weather info related to local forecast and rain fall. However, it can not do this reliably. Example the last two weeks of July in my area of KY have been dry and hot. The device decided in the middle of July that the next watering cycle will not take place until August 1st!. This is despite the fact that I set the Smart watering section of the Blossom app on my phone to wettest setting. So I have been having to start the sprinkler manually daily via the app. But even that is not reliable. I go to the "Run Sprinkler" section of the app and set the time for every station for 25 min and hit "run sprinkler". The first station starts and runs for a few minutes then it quits. However, the app still shows the sprinklers running. So I "stop sprinklers" via the app and repeat the process to run the sprinklers again. Usually after as second or third attempt it will finish a full cycle. I called tech support over these issues. They acknowledged the problem and said the engineers will be working on fixing the problem "on the back end", the meaning of which is not very clear to me, and that they will keep me updated via E mails on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I asked how long will it take to fix the problem, they said they did not know but they will update me via e mail. I never got an e mail and the issue is not fixed as far as I can tell. I wanted to give it one star. But I gave 2 for the concept. It needs a lot of work and a more dynamic support to stabilize the app, improve the weather decision making algorithm and add functionality to the app. One frustrating thing for me was that since the app is not able to react to the weather correctly, I had to manually start the sprinklers every day from the app. There is NO function that will allow to set a daily schedule that will start the sprinklers automatically every day on set time regardless of the weather. If you want to do this you have to access the app every day and go through every station that you want to run and set the run time every time every day. So in brief, unreliable weather algorithm, unreliable manual operation and laking in functionality.
