I actually REALLY hate to give this a one star review. The thing is, it works. I really love the way it feels cool on my scalp. I also love the way it disappears rather than a starch based texturizer. Unfortunately, it leaves this weird, sticky, dirty feeling texture behind. I've read that that's part of why it works so well, but, frankly, I have used cheap dry shampoos that work as well and don't leave a weird sticky feeling behind.
