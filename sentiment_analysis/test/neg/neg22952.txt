A right angle attachment with the same muting device needs to be available for the transmitter. Also, the transmitter will not go all the in my Ibanez bass and therefore cannot use. I have a Spector 5 string with passive pickups and a tone booster rather than a preamp as my active Spector bass has. The passive bass with tone boost is incompatible with the wireless, making a ton of noise. A regular 1/4 to 1/4 cable must be used when I play this instrument because it gives a noise-free signal unlike the wireless. If I have a wireless that makes noise on one bass and therefore have to use a standard cable and the transmitter does not fit in another bass and a standard cable must be use on that bass as well, it defeats the point of having a wireless system. I can use the wireless on 2 basses and must use a standard cable on 2 others. I make Many guitar changes so this is a major pain. May as well not use the wireless. On the basses it does work on the sound & signal are great.but not being on a right angle makes the transmitter hit against your leg All Night if you plan to move at all which I Do All The Time!
