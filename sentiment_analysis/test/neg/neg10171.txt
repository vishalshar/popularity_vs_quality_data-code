I'd write a negative star if I could.  Was not able to get it to synch or download updates.  You reach customer sup port via email and it takes 72 hours for a response.  They made suggestions which failed but now I have to wait another 72 hours for another response. Replaced battery twice which is not an easy feat because the screws are tiny and the gasket doesn't stay in place.  It comes with both a chain and a leather bracelet.  The chain is low quality and I would be afraid of it breaking if I wore the Leaf on it.  You don't get to chose the bracelet size through Amazon and the one they sent was too small and it was falling apart after 5 days.  I wore it 5 days without it working because it is attractive.  But it is too expensive to function as jewelry only.  GREAT concept; poor execution.
