I just received it after purchasing through Amazon and will post a better review after using it over the next few weeks.  To be honest, I wanted to like it. I wanted to like it real bad.  Here are a few of the issues I found:1. Sorry to say, the instructions left me a little dubious. They are not complete and don't really explain all the functions.  For example, if I didn't see the instructions for how to set up the tare function here, I would not know how to do that.2. The product claims to be accurate to 1/100th of a lb.  I purchased the fish grip jr. and it weighs roughly 11 oz. but 6 out of 10 times I attached it to the scale it did not register the weight at all.3. The instructions for calibrating the scale seems a little ridiculous - one of the last steps is to place a 25kg weight on the hook to calibrate and if it reads 'PASS', you are set. How many people carry a 55lb + weight at home?4. The app was easy enough to set up on my smartphone and blue tooth worked perfectly but the integration of the scale and the functions are not real user friendly.  You still need to enter information on the phone if you want a complete picture of your catch - or - is it that the instructions are not clear?Anyway, I have many other scales and I am hoping that I either did not calibrate the scale correctly or I have a bad scale, but I do not trust the weight it shows - I took a 5lb and a 10lb free weight and tried weighing it on all my scales and this one gave incorrect weights every single time and not just one consistent incorrect weight.  Again - I am not sure but hoping it is because the calibration test could not be completed or perhaps I read the instructions wrong?  Not sure who to contact but will try to work this out by my next fishing trip when I will use it.
