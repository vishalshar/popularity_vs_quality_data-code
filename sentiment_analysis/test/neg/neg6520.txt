Somewhat disappointed, given my expectations after owning two MacBook Air cases prior to this purchase.  The MacBook Air cases fit the computer perfectly. This case fits the WIDTH perfectly but leaves a 0.25" squishable air space under the MacBook while stretching the sides of the case at the bottom corners of the MacBook.  The reason appears to be a radial mismatch between the computer and the case - the case has a larger corner radius which may match the corners of a MacBook Air rather than the MacBook.  In other words: it seems they changed the overall dimensions of the MacBook Air case without adjusting for the corners of the new MacBook.On further inspection, I found that because the MacBook is not where it should be due to the corners not fitting.  Bad fit.  Defective design.
