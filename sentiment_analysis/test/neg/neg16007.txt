I was expecting something more sturdy than what I received. The lettering on each side is a sticker that will inevitably come off, and the bulk of the product is plastic (which isn't durable). My device came with a loose CPU on one side as well.The flash light and camera are in no way discreet, each clearly labelled. You will get asked quite often, by strangers, if you are recording them.Over all I was very underwhelmed. I went out on a limb on this device, and luckily the investment wasn't too steep. I would stay away from these.
