Cannot follow through on a simple voice command such as "Set alarm for 2 minutes." Although watch does indeed register my dictation correctly, the watch face then states: "Will set alarm in 24 hours." Huh?  Cannot connect to Wi-Fi at home, and instead says to input the password on the Ticwatch Companion, which I assume is the app I downloaded on iPhone. However, the app itself has no place for me to input such information. If a simple countdown alarm cannot be set on a watch, what's the point of owning a watch?
