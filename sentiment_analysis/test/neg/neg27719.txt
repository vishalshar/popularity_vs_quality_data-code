Extremely disappointed. I had a Rokform case for my iPhone 5s previously and it was so reliable so when I needed a new case for my iPhone 6 Plus I thought I'd buy a Rokform case~ when I got it I was skeptical because it seemed the quality went down a bit. Unlike the case for the 5s this comes in one piece instead of two plus the bumper.Bought mine in February it's now March. And the sides are literally ripping off. So expensive for garbage. I can't even fathom how upset I am. It's not like it's a cheap case. So now I have to go on the hunt for a new case.
