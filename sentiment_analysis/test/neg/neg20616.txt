I bought this for my dog who seemed to get out of the yard.  I was able to sync it OK and find her when at home.  We took her in the car and the Pebblebee wouldn't find her current location even though she was in the back seat.  It showed her at home for the first 10 mintues, and then every 5 minutes or so it would show where we had been, not a current location.  Not much help to find a dog on the run.
