The app can't find it.  The sparse help directions don't help.  Some kind of manual at least explaining what different beeps mean would be nice.  As is, I have to conclude it's DOA.  I'll update this review if I hear back something useful from support.Update: tried a second unit with similar results.  Maybe these are not compatible with the iPhone 7?
