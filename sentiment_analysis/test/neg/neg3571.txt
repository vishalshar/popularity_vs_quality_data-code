We purchased this in pre-order and got 2 of the 3 packs because of a large home. First, the options of 3 pack is selected but all you can choose is 1 or 3. It asks for how many stories your home is, I selected 2 stories, so now it forces you to put 1 on the second story for the initial setup. I needed multiple on first story before moving to second story. So the third one connected but was showing on second story. So I ignore that and just try to add another luma from the app. Never connected. Even if they were 10 feet from each other. Not only big problems connecting from phone to device, even though the phone is less than 5 feet from the device. But also none connect to each other. So I removed the other one because maybe the system thinking it was on the 2nd floor. Now only the first 2 work. None will connect to the phone anymore and I get the error 'there was an error retrieving an IP address for your luma: the data could not be read because it is in the incorrect format'. This happens on all 4 of the remaining luma devices. So basically I have 2 luma working great and 4 extremely pretty bricks after 3 hours of trying to get them to work.I do IT for a living, I'm no novice with setting up networks, I understand the devices connect with Bluetooth to each other but emit wifi. I get it, but it isn't working. You can contact me here and I can provide any details you want. I google'd the errors and searched your app help and website help and could not find the error.Could be a good product but right now the software just isn't good enough. Unless this is repaired I do not recommend.
