We absolutely love this! Have them in all 3 bathrooms! UPDATE....... 3 out of 3 Failed within 2 months!!! You lose the Blue First then gradually the rest.  I did an Autopsy and found the same thing on all 3. The connector where the LED hooks to the cable is a pressure connector (No Solder) The copper from the 4 wires only touches the LED leads by about 1 mm. The copper corrodes you lose contact. You lose light. Not waterproof at all. Your sticking it on the lip of a toilet, Don't you think the Humidity is going to get in there?  Such a wonderful concept destroyed by shoddy construction! Oh Well .... It Was to good to be true.
