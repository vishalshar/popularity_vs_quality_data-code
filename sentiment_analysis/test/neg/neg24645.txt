According to all of the positive reviews, this seemed to be perfect. I really need to be a bit more skeptical of positive reviews. Amazon may have more than I expected. Anyhow, the mesh side of this pouf is not as soft as much cheaper poufs, the microfiber side causes the entire unit to not dry well in a 24 hour period, it doesn't hold lather very well due to the small surface area, and it's much overvalued. Sorry to have been duped!
