I bought this to give as a gift but the packaging wasn't very attractive so I purchased something else. I kept this and set it up myself. I was pretty annoyed that no instructions came in the box and you have to go to their website and watch a video. Thank goodness I didn't give it to my step mother as I had planned, video instructions would have annoyed her even more than they annoyed me! Everything sprouted besides the mint, it hasn't done a thing. With no watering instructions I've taken my best guest, they look a little dismal and I can't see myself replanting them to grow further. Can't say I would recommend this.
