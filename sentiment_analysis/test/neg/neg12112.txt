We moved from a house with a large back yard to an apartment with a balcony so I thought this would be a great solution for the extra potty breaks between walk for my standard schnauzer and mixed terrier.  Both dogs only want to play and eat treats on it.  They are 9 and I guess "teaching a dog new tricks" isn't going to happen for my pups. I even invested in the upgraded artificial grass, tried putting pee pads on it, and even brought some scents back from the dog park to see if I could trick them.  No dice!  I may try some regular sod or one of the sod delivery services.
