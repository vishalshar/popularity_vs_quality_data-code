Immediately out of the box, it does what it is intended to do- sticks to your car dash and holds your iPhone (although it's a bad idea to try it with a Plus sized iPhone- I tried it with my 6S Plus and my wife's 6S).  On the first day, the heat of the car caused the included adhesives to detach from the dash after which point they never really stuck again.  Fortunately, there was no residue left on the car that I can see.  Without sticking to the dash, this simply can't hold the weight of an iPhone.I gave up on this cable as a car mount, so I brought it inside to use at my desk only to find that it no longer charges or transfers data.  I do not know if it was the heat in the car or my manipulation trying to get it to stay on the dash that broke it, but broken it is after very little usage.In summary:-Do not use if you have an iPhone Plus.-Do not use if you live in a climate where the temperatures can exceed 70ÅŸ F.-Do not try to bend it very much.The flexy steel lightning cable is a nice idea, but this one seems to be of rather poor quality.
