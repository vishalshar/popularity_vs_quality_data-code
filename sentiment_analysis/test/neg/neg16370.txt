Do not buy! The gameband worked great for about two weeks. Now the display works only intermittently and when it works, the clock will not display the correct time. The support team for the gameband at support@nowcomputing.com has not responded to any of my emails for help to fix this. They apparently do not stand by their product and the warranty is meaningless.  It's very unfortunate that they cannot support this. My son was looking forward to getting this for weeks and now it is a huge disappointment.
