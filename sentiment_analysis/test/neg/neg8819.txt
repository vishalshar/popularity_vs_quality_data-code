I like this water bottle because it has an awesome drinking spout.  It is robust and thick - unlike many that break off way too easily.I do like being able to clean it from the bottom.BUT.  It leaks every time I refill it for 3-5 sips.  Then it is ok.  But it just consistently leaks when I fill it up every time.In the end totally not worth it for that reason.  I still use mine though.  So I suppose it's not that bad.
