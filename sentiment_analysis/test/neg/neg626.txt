I am totally disappointed with the "Triby".  The main complaint is that it only holds a charge for two days.  This is not acceptable  for a gaget that adheres to my refrigerator. I would not recommend it to most people.  It would be acceptable for children, at $169 it is expensive for the functions it provides.  I bought the "Echo" for $180 in December 2015.  I was so impressed with it, I bought the "Dot" for $90 in March 2016.  Having such a good experience with these two excellant products, I purchased the "Triby" for $169 in May 2016.  Again, the "Triby" is not something I, in good conscience, would recommend.  I'm sorry.  Again, I LOVE the ECHO and DOT!
