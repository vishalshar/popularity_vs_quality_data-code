The product looks like it has potential, but the algorithms and apps are not quite there.  I had consistently slower speed reading than any other sensors.  The firmware update is only available on the android app and I wouldn't have found it if I didn't decide to run it on my tablet and not just my iphone.  I gave it an extra star just because I like the design, but it does shift the balance around 2 points.
