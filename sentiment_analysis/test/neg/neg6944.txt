Having problems and had to contact support several times. Has difficulty recording 18 holes on courses that have 27 hole layouts. They advised they are correcting this issue, but most courses in this community use the 27 hole layout. Also outdated maps for new courses. One course that is 6 months old used a map of the course before it was built. Google map tie in?Next issue is getting to remember to tap each shot, it can be corrected after you upload the data to your computer, but it very easy to forget to tap on each shot, especially putts.I would only recommend this to my fellow golfers if I covered all the problems I have had, and the regimentation needed to record all shots.When you use properly it does a good job of tracking your shots, what club used and accurate distance. The program's accumulates all your rounds so you can trend your good shots, bad shots, distance per club, and cumulative data for all rounds played.
