I'm really pretty unhappy with these cases. A fantastic concept (who doesn't want to rely on fewer cables?), but unless the engineering gets an overhaul, the outlook isn't terribly good.I've now owned four of these cases within the past 4 months. Four separate, individually purchased cases.My first case lasted three months before it stopped charging my iPhone 6s. All four of the charge level indicator LEDs would illuminate, indicating a full battery charge in the case, but it wouldn't convey that charge to my phone. I tried it on my wife's iPhone 6s as well, and it wouldn't charge hers either, which seemed to indicate a problem with the lightning connector on which the phone rests while sitting in the case.  I ordered another as a product test.2nd case was DOA. LEDs didn't illuminate when plugged in to the wall, and no power conveyance to either phones. Promptly returned it.3rd case arrived and was in use, problem free, for one month before one of the charge indicator LEDs stopped working. 1st, 2nd, and 4th light up, 3rd in sequence does not. Shortly thereafter the LEDs began flickering rapidly when plugged in (either to the wall or via cable), as though a short exists within the case.  It does still charge, and the charge conveys to our phones, but come on Prong. Improve your build quality for crying out loud.  There's no excuse.  I've never had such an anticipated product perform so consistently poorly.4th case has been in use by my wife for two weeks. So far so good. With a 75% problem rate so far, though, I'm definitely not holding my breath.  I will report back if that one craps out too.Just FYI. Hey, it's your money.
