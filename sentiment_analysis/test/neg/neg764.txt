We returned this item. To be fair, we didn't realize it was terrycloth originally, which wouldn't have been too much of a problem, but this is super scratchy! We didn't even try it out on our bed, it was such an uncomfortable material. I'd pass and get something else! Plus a lot of the other reviews say that it is noisy when you move around on it. There are many other similar products that are "noiseless," and more affordable so we went with one of those.
