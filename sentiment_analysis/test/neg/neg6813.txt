I installed it after receiving 3 days ago, but the mini-USB connector was pulled back into the plastic when I plug it into the device. The quality is bad and looks cheap.  I just tried to use my phones cable, but the LED was not lighting on even I held the button for 3 seconds according to its instruction......There is not paper instruction in the pack, not easy to look up the troubleshooting. I will return it to Amazon if it can't work today!The price is high, but quality is low, don't buy!  I was also misled by the reviews -- "DECENT QUALITY?" maybe I'm not luck.
