I like the concept of the OmieBox, it is really convenient to have veggies, dessert and meal in one container for my Kindergarten child. However, two days into the new school year and the Omiebox does not keep food hot.  So, her pasta and rice were both cold the last 2 days.  Very disappointed! And, more so that I'm 2 days past the return window and now I'm stuck with this thing.
