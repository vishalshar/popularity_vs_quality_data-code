This does not fit a 2010 Nissan cube Krom.  May fit other cube trims or other years. Generally speaking, to fit as promised the CD slot must be the most forward-facing part of your dash.  The cube's CD slot is recessed about a quarter-inch shy of the dashboard.Fitment not as 'universal' as promised--rated two-stars for having to go through the trouble of returning.
