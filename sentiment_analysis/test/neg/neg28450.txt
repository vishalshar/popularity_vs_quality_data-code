This gets two stars because I lost a GoPro Hero4 Black camera while using it. The clip itself is great, but the quick release attachment on the handle, to which the GoPro itself attaches, comes off way too easily. As a result of this weak connection between the camera and the handle, I lost a GoPro (my very first GoPro as it turns out) while filming a friend wakeboarding from the back of the boat. I was incredibly disappointed. PolarPro should've reimbursed me for the cost of the GoPro that I lost, frankly.
