I was taught that if you can't say anything nice about something, it's best to say nothing at all. So I will try to be nice.When I discovered The Dash on Amazon I was duly impressed by this brilliant little piece of technology, and wasted no time in placing my order (even after reading all the reviews, some of which were decidedly not glowing). I should have paid closer attention to those negative reviews, instead of giving in to the "I wants". And I so wanted to love this thing! The lesson here is let the buyer beware. Good things don't necessarily come in beautiful packaging, which indeed The Dash has. The Dash itself is also beautiful, and made of decidedly high-quality materials. My main intention was to use The Dash as wireless earbuds to stream music and audio from my Samsung S7 mobile, (a listed compatible device according to Bragi). Initial set-up was a breeze, and I found myself happily listening to my playlists in no time via Bluetooth. The sound quality was good enough , the fit comfortable and secure, and the controls easy to learn and operate. I was loving my Dash!Then came the notification that a software update (version 2.0) was available, offering a list of overall improvements. The instructions to update were clear enough, and the actual update, performed on my laptop, went smoothly and without issue. It was then that the software went wonky, and the problems began. Connecting The Dash via bluetooth to my mobile caused, what can only be described as, a never ending stream of false restarts and freeze-ups on my Samsung. This is where my story gets boring, and reminds me of the painfully frustrating, endless, and fruitless attempts to remedy the problem by following Bragi's troubleshooting procedures. Really? No longer even a simple Bluetooth connection? I finally gave up, and decided to contact customer support. When I discovered that my only means of contacting Bragi was through their e-mail support system, it was then that I decided I'd had enough headaches. I promptly re-packed my Dash, and returned it to Amazon for a refund. Any company that charges 300 dollars for their product, ought to offer their customers some telephone support. A product this cool shouldn't be this troublesome.I think maybe Bragi was a bit hasty in bringing their product to market. Maybe after they work out the problems, I'll give The Dash another try.
