This low cut sock was supposed to be wider and fit up to size 13 foot. NOT SO. I became so disgusted with the socks after trying to put them on, I threw them in the garage. Not really extreme when you consider that they were so short they were uncomfortable unless I curled my toes during wear. My shoe size is 12 w ,  and if my foot was somewhat moist from the shower, forget it. they will never go on my foot.That is not all. they were so short up my ankle that they stayed BELOW my ankle when worn. A real zero
