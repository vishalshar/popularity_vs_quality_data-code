The product works bad. I bought it 1 months ago and when it arrived to me (to the shiny country Uzbekistan), I've found that the program for this device can work only with few smartphones and tablets. I couldnt install it to the Samsung Note, to the Huawei P8 and it always stops working at my Samsung Tablet (I even couldnt generate my training program or calibrate the device). Maybe it depends on the android version, but in all devices I have different android versions (4.2, 4.4 and 5.0). But I dont know about IPhones. The second problem - the sticking-plasters. After 30 minutes - 1 hour they become unusable, also it's impossible to use them more than once, but there are only 60 of such plasters in the box. So, I use 3-4 per day and after 2 weeks I will have nothing. The third problem - bad work of the device at all - I cannnot calibrate it right, it just everytime often vibrates when Im upright and silent when not. Also it's very hard to use it when u walk, it vibrates everytime, even when u stay upright!) When u r driving a car - u should switch it off and remove from your back because of bad plasters it will fall down at the same. Generally, it seems like unfinished or undone. So, I'm not recommend to buy it. Regards, miss Ramilya S Klimova.
