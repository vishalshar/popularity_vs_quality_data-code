my 11 years old daughter was recovering of a severe eczema rash on her hands, we tought that this cream would help her to recover faster based on the good reviews this cream has here on amazon, we tried it at night before bed time next mornig she woke up with her hands red and with lots of waterballs all over her hands. i am a 32 YO male with healthy skin on my hands and i tried this cream on my own hands and they start to itchy after 10 minutes of using it. I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS CREAM all the good reviews here on amazon and the YOU TUBE video of the woman with the little girl is starting to sound like a scam to me.
