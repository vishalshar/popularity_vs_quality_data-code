While we liked the idea, they were too short for our shoes.  My hubby actually had to put together 2 in order to make his shoes wearable.  This worked for a couple days; but they keep coming undone.  LOVE the idea, he does not like to tie his shoes, so just ties them loosely & slips them on; but need to have a variety of sizes/lengths, to fit different widths of feet.
