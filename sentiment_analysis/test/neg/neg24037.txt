I was very disappointed with the quality of this item. Is not cheap and it lasted like 1 month. I expected it to be prepared for fall etc, as it is a keychain and keychains and keys suffer a lot of scratches, but i didnt think that it would open and split in two after the first time I dropped my keys. Totally a waste of money!! ?
