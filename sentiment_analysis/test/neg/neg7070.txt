I was so excited to get this bed, hoping it would improve my sleep and eliminate some back pain.  I'm left disappointed, I haven't slept well since I got this d*mn thing.  It's been 3 nights so hopefully it will soften up, but it's entirely to firm. My husband loves it but he's not as curvy as I am. It feels good if I sleep on my back, only on my back.  I'm a side sleeper with big hips, It creates more pressure points than my spring matress.  the smell when I unboxed it,  wasn't noticeable until I smashed my face into the mattress. It was gone in an hour.  Its also a bit smaller than my old king and doesn't fit the frame exactly. I'm actually debating returning this bed and bringing my spring in from the garage. However I read that it softens after a month of use so hopefully I won't have to.
