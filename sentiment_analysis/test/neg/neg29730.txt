I do not believe that whomever introduced this product has any irrigation experience. I have had many irrigation controllers and am very familiar with all of the functions a controller should have. This product lacks a lot! Any other controllers have the option of using a pump start relay for any zone on the system. Blossom does not, it's all or none. I was told by their support people ( 3 of them) that the controller would do what I needed it to do. So after a week of contacting support someone finally tells me that the controller will not work as needed. It sounds like they have hired a bunch of high school kids for the summer for their customer support. Also, if you are using a pump start relay it probably won't work with the one you have. I'm very disappointed with this product and I feel like it was released before the whole thing was fully thought out. The whole "Green" thing sounds good but falls short of what an irrigation product should deliver.
