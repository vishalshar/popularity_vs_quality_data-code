I keep my internet hub in my closet with my wireless router to conceal it as well as for convenience since it needs to be connected via Ethernet.  I wanted to use this keypad next to my front door...BUT this keypad device literally must be in the same room as my internet hub to work.  It is ridiculously frustrating.  I don't understand why the tiny sensors have better range than the keypad.  The security system kit I bought is awesome and works like a charm, but this keypad accessory is crap.
