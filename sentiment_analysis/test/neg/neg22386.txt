For the price, this is ridiculous. I was about to nab it at $10 but I've seen it up as high as $40. For $10, it's not a bad deal and kind of cute. For $40 you're being ripped off. Without the plants (which may or may not actually grow and aren't going to live forever anyway), it's a piece of junk with no real purpose. It doesn't look "done" so no kid is going to play with it. The fairy's arm fell off within 2 hours of giving it to my daughter and there's little you can really do with the set. There are a ton of little gardening tools...but aside from damp soil and seeds to sprinkle on top, there's literally no use for them and, in fact, seems like a really good way to tempt a younger child to ruin their garden by digging, raking, and generally messing around in there while the seeds are taking root. Save yourself the trouble and take a pass on this. To top it all off, the "tree" part isn't attached to the base. It rests in a very shallow outline and can easily be tipped over. That wire the fairy is supposed to be able to "fly" from's base is tiny, barely usable, and came to me broken anyway.
