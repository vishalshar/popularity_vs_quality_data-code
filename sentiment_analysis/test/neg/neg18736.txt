It's too bad about these - great in many ways but fatally flawed. I'm returning them.The good:+ Music quality+ Innovative; cutting edge techThe bad:- None of the four sizes fit my ears. Unlike Bose or others with different sizes to the silicone piece that fit into your ear canal, the adapters on these make the large part larger. Since these are not active noise cancelling, if those don't seal perfectly, sound leaks in. Poor design.- Two Bluetooth radios - one for music, one LE for heartrate sensor etc. Confusing, needs two separate connections to iPhone. I'm still not sure which needs to be active to connect to the Bragi app.- The true deal breaker - Bluetooth for voice is so bad it renders these completely unusable for calls. I have upgraded to the new firmware (2 hours to do so BTW) which supposedly improves Bluetooth. I have held the phone inches from my ear; doesn't matter. I don't understand this, especially given the music streaming is very good.
