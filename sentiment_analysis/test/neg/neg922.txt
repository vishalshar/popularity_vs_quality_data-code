Updated from four stars to one star.****Issue****Hidden compartment- great idea and but no way to secure things. Carrying a gun back there while active leads to unevenly distributed weight on your back. Which causes lots of issue when active. People who use it leisurely won't see this issue but I longboard, bike and run as a means of transportation and this became a huge problem.1. Sizing is perfect. Not to big and not too small2. Very accessible and the layout works well for constant up down, out and and about traveling.3. Water proof enough for traveling and water bottle friendly.4. Adjustable strap- I don't really see lots of use here5.  Phone compartment on strap- worked for my iPhone 5, Amazon Fire phone and iPhone 6 but not my iPhone 6s Plus. Fat phone will have to find another place to live while on the go.6. Inside pickets and construction is superb! At no point is it flimsy or lacking in the origination department. As a student that works in IT in a large city. This is really saying something.My main issue is the gun concealment. I carry a  full size military grade HK .40 and its weight distribution can make or break a longboard ride or run. It makes all the difference for me.Overall sizing is okay. It was great for carrying a Microsoft surface pro 3 around but carrying my MacBook Pro 15" is pretty difficult. I ended up switching back to my backpack for everyday use and I use this bag when I can.Changes I would recommend would be:1. to add an option to secure around the waist for active use,2. Add adjustable straps in the hidden compartment for securing valuables and/firearms3. switch out the phone holder for a stretchable material to fit larger phones4. Add a waterproof zipper used on most external media packs5. Add elasticity to the penholders to secure them while active.This is a four star product when I don't carry my HK but that's not very often so I have updated the rating.
