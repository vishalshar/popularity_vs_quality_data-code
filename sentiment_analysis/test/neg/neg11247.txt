I originally owned a Tagg tracker, but it eventually broke so i was looking for a replacement. Since Whistle bought Tagg I thought I'd give their newer tracker a try, but I'm really not liking it at all, and the app isn't nearly as useful as it was when Tagg was their own company with their own app.The old Tagg tracker had a single button. Hold it to turn it on or off, double tap it to put it in "away mode" to silence all notifications when you're intentionally out of the geofence. If your dog got away from you on a walk you could still enable tracking from the app, and get live updates (well, updated every 60 seconds)The whistle tracker has two buttons on it, neither of which could be fully explained to me by whistle customer service. one of them hard resets, but not reliably in my trials, and the other is supposed to be a silence button, but they've intentionally made it silence alerts for only 10-15 minutes. This seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of the needs of the user, why would anyone have a need to silence the alert for only 10 minutes? i don't want alerts going off constantly while I'm walking my dog outside the geofence.The whistle app is an overdeveloped mess, which tries to force you into their social community way too much. Also, you only get updates of your pets location 10 minutes after they've left the zone, and the tracker only refreshes every 10 minutes while you're searching for your dog. This leaves way too large of an area to have to search. And the biggest issue I run into is the tracker misreporting my dog's location. My wife took him to work with her, and I kept repeatedly getting alerts saying he's out of the zone, then he's back by the base station (which is with me), then outside the zone again, then back in....All I want is a simple tracker that works the way I want it to, and reliably, like Tagg used to offer. Especially when you make me subscribe to your service to use the product. Sadly, Whistle has ruined virtually every aspect of what made Tagg great, so it appears it's time for me to seek yet another tracker.
