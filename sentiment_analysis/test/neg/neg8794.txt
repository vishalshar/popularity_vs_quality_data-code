It's an exceptional stylus considering that iPads are not originally meant for sketching and writing. The palm rejection works well in most apps and it's great for taking short notes if you're using an iPad or even an iPad mini. I'm personally using it with an iPad mini and have no trouble using this for writing a few short notes. It's also fairly accurate and fun to sketch with or make digital paintings. I wouldn't say it's really for professional use though, but for quick basic sketches and notes it works well. I love using it in OneNote to take quick notes and highlight things.In short, It's nothing like a professional Wacom stylus or even the iPad pro stylus - but still a fun, easy to use solution for standard iPads. I would not recommend for iPhones.Update: I'm returning this because after only a week of mild use the tips are worn. They're very fragile tips which bend a lot when you're using them and rapidly degrade. Additionally, I have found that other apps supporting this device do not work very well. I originally purchased the pen for one note but after using it a bit I have basically come to the conclusion that the pen isn't much better than my index finger. Additionally, palm rejection does not work well enough. Still a good try though. Guess I'll have to save up for the iPad Pro.
