I had high hope for this amp, and had been watching it for over a year while it was $400. When it dropped to $325 or so, I went for it. It looks great, but unfortunately after setting it up and trying it with both an acoustic and electric guitar, I was quickly disappointed. It does not sound good. After adjusting the levels on both the guitar and the unit (via app and directly), I could not get any decent sound. It sounded underpowered and "cheap". Waited a second day and tried it again, but with the same results. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I wrapped it up and sent it back. Your results may vary.
