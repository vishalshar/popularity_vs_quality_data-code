There are some important things to consider before buying this:1) You will not get a prescription if you test positive. If you simply know what you have, this won't help you at all.2) You will get a call from a third party company just telling you to go to a doctor. It's a little annoying that another company gets a copy of your health data just to make a phone call.3) Your lab results are stored on their public facing "patient portal" which is built with wordpress plugins. The site is also riddled with third party trackers and analytics. Thanks for taking privacy and security seriously.....4) You will receive a number of follow up emails from them, asking to rate the product, letting you know if you have items in your cart, etc. I can't imagine anyone wanting this popping up on their phone.5) The box shipping box is anonymous only in the sense that it's a brown box. The return label still says "mylab box" so anyone seeing it would know what it is.This may be a good option for some people, but I had a far better experience just going to an urgent care (which I had to do anyway).
