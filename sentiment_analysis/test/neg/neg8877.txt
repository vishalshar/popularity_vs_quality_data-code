At first the product was working just beautifully! It was sending push notifications to both mine & my wife's phone whenever someone rang the doorbell, or whenever it detected motion. Then, after 4 days..  it stopped. I no longer received notifications of any kind! My wife's phone however still received notifications.. I own a Samsung Galaxy s7, & she has a galaxy s5. I have no idea what happened. I tried to get ahold of SkyBell, with no reply! This did not do what I wanted it to do! It is a huge letdown, & I had to return the product & will stay far away from this product. I will be trying the Ring Pro, with hopes it out performs this product in terms of reliability.
