The thrower uses two spinning wheels to launch the ball.  It works fine with the provided mini tennis balls.  But my dog tends to tear through them quickly.  I believe the designers didn't think through the fact that the balls would get slobbery.  This impacts the launch and causes room for error.  I tried using squash balls as I've read others use.  Once they get wet, they rarely launch due to the wheels losing friction on them.  That being said, we intended this to be an automatic launcher for the dog to play with, but it seems to defeat the purpose since there is a large margin of error forcing us to intervene more often than not.
