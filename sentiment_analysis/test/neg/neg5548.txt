This product is receiving a less than stellar review due to how flimsy it is. with the arm fully extended and a 15.6 inch laptop attached, this thing bounces all over the place, to the point I am afraid the arm is going to break off. I have had Ram-Mounts brand in the past, and it seems like much better quality than this.
