I wanted to like this as soon as I saw it on "Works with Nest" on Nest.com. I wanted to like it when I read the Medium articles on new product updates. I still have high hopes for their future, but I just don't think it's there for customers who need a well thought-out, budget-effective solution at this moment in time. This was advertised to be a seamless solution but there are just way too many hardware limitations for me to consider using this seriously.There seems to be a passionate community of folks online, and I hope this attention materializes into a generous funding round that supports a much more wholesome and developed product at a more reasonable price point (while addressing "starter pack" flexibility and fulfillment issues). I was hoping for the best with this setup, but I think this needs a version two before it becomes a decent solution for a larger home.
