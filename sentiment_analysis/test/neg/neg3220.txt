Same problem as other users. The fingerprint scanner is totally unreliable.  I scanned several fingers one day and they all worked to open the box.  Later that day, no finger worked after multiple tries.  I tried licking, wiping ...  nothing worked.  Then the next day, one finger worked. It's just not consistent and I can't trust it in an emergency, which is why I bought it.  The bracelet works all the time, btw, but I didn't it buy it for the bracelet only. I really wanted to like this unit and other reviews were promising, but I'll be returning this until something better comes along.
