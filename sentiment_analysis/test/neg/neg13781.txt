Does it "preserve wine"?  Yes.  Preserve it well?  Yes again.  Is it a good product?  No--needle broke first use.  Cumbersome to use.  BUT....I actually would continue to use it (as it is probably the best product out there...but others do nearly as good of a job...) if it wasn't for the fact that Coravin rapes--yes, I will use that word, as it is appropriate here--RAPES its loyal customers when they need to purchase additonal gas cannisters (I have gone through 3 cannisters in less than 3 weeks....).I am not opposed to a company making a good product and making a good profit from it.  What sickens me about this product is that they could still make a ridiculous profit by charging a fraction of what they do for the extra gas cannisters.  Way over the top, and I cannot wait for a decent alternative to arrive on the market.
