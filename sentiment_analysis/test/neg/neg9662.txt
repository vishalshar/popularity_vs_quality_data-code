On the good side: 1. The exterior has the world's most famous mouse, and is a pleasing red color.  2. Slots are 5 inches across (a common size), so will accommodate most usual sizes of bread.  3. It toasts fairly quickly, so the bread doesn't loose moisture and become dry.  4. An outline of Mickey appears on one side of the toast (the other side is plain toast).On the bad side:  1. There's a strong nauseating industrial burning smell when the toaster is on (we're hoping this might go away after it's been used more).  2. It's very flimsy.  As an example: unless you push down the toast using the center of the black plastic handle (where it connects with the "carriage lever") the metal of the carriage lever starts to bend.  3. There's a v. small raised bump, but no easily visible marking on the browning control knob.  Consequently, you have to feel where this bump is when rotating the knob.  It's frustrating because the white setting numbers then become obscured by your fingers.  4. You must NOT lift the toast up by lifting up on the "carriage lever" (something most of us would probably expect to do).  To lift up the toast, before it pops up itself, you must rotate the browning control knob fully to the side marked "cancel", which means loosing the current browning setting.
