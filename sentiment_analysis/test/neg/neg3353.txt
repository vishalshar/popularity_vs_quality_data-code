Molds are ok-had used before and liked them. My ears are funny shape so always looking for something that stays in ear. Headphones were of fair quality - I am not very picky. Worked ok for 2 months and stopped working.  One year "Warranty" is less than useless.  Customer service is terrible.  Unwilling to help and was promised a supervisor would get back to me but never did. Would never buy another product from this company again.
