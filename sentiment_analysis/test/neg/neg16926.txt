While the device looks nice, it runs at approximately the thermal output of the sun. I am surprised it didn't catch fire to be 100% honest.  It also nuked a microSD card (SanDisk Extreme Plus 32GB) I had and now all those memories are gone.. poof.  Feels like a bad beta test, I could HIGHLY recommend buying something else.
