It works to a large degree however sometimes it tries to tune to a note in the wrong octave . I suggest that you wait til they perfect this before you buy it.  I would not even sell this to someone.  It was a good idea but it is actually easier to just use a  regular tuner .  sorry manufacturer... this just isn't ready ..... PS.. You asked for the review !
