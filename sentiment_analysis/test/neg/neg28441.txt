I am about out of patience with Anova and/or Amazon here.The first unit I received as a gift from my mom was DOA. The low level water alarm was defective and always on. So I returned it and ordered a new one.I opened it this morning and noticed that the display did not have protective plastic for me to remove. Did Amazon send me a used product?I tried it for poached eggs and they were very overcooked. I thought it might be the recipe. So I unplugged it until this evening when I was going to try a steak.I keep my house at 68 degrees during the day in winter. When I turned it back on (with the same water I had used in the morning,) the temperature on the Anova read 52.4 degrees. This explains the overcooked eggs.Twice bitten now. I may order directly from Anova, who now offer a substantially lower price than Amazon, but I may just give up and buy another brand. In any case I'm reticent.
