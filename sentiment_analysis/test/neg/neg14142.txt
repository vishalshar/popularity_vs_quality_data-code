No matter what you may hear from the company, these bottles leak! Great idea, easy to clean but having Gatorade drip down onto my bike frame is frustrating as can be. No, I will not buy this again and would not recommend it to anyone for any use. Cycling would seem to be the purpose of this bottle since the founder first "advertised" them by dressing up as a bottle and running alongside riders in the Tour de France. They really don't work very well when it comes to keeping your drink in the botlle. I hate the product.
