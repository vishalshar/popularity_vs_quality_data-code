My first case of Soylent from Amazon was fine.  My second case has caused two bouts of violent diarrhea.  I even had to cancel an overnight trip because I was afraid to leave the house.  This morning I couldn't even get from the bed to the bathroom in time.  I will be throwing away the five remaining bottles.  I'm afraid to drink it again.
