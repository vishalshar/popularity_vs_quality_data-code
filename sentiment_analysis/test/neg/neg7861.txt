I cannot entirely give a full review on how the phone works and its ease of use because my father never had the coverage I was advised he would have so he assumed the damn thing wasn't working.  I called Great Call specifically prior to buying a Jitterbug phone to ensure that my father would be covered in the service area.  They asked for his specific address.  I gave it and was advised there was ample coverage.  There wasn't.  My father thought he was losing it (I think the point of this phone/service is to assist older people, not to add to their confusion).  When my father called to request assistance he was advised that his area "was a spotty area they get complaints about a lot".  Oh really?  Interesting. When I called to verify before purchasing the phone/service the coverage was confirmed.  Now, I am stuck with a phone that I paid for that I cannot return and must now buy a new phone and plan for my father and, worse than all of it, he has to learn how to use yet another phone which is not easy for older people.  I am disgusted and really annoyed that Greatl Call would not be honest with me before I went down this road.  I will not recommend the phone or hte service to anyone and, in fact, will warn people against using this service.
