Smells really good, but it is slightly grainy. Doesn't last all day, or work well during exercise. I also had a really bad chemical reaction to this product. No good. I plan on contacting costumer service about this product. I am very unhappy with what happened to my armpits. It's been 5 days since I've stopped using this product and my armpits are still burning and BRIGHT RED.
