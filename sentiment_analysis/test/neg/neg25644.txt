I use powered drinks and always get the residue leftover. I thought this was a great idea, a bottle you could open both sides to really get it clean. Unfortunately, the top of the bottle and inside of the removeable nozzle are really hard to clean. The whole point of the bottle is to not have to use special tools to clean it, but the rubberized nozzle gets nasty on the inside and you will need a pipe cleaner type attachment to get it clean. I've since found the Blender Bottle which has a really wide mouth so it's easy to clean to the bottom and it has a metal ball to blend my drinks really well.
