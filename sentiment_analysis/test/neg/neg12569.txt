Bragi truly the worst customer service ever. I have received the Dash with one of the sleeves deformed and not properly fitting the earpiece. I have sent their customer service multiple pictures of the defective item and asked for a replacement sleeve. They insist the sleeve is not properly inserted even though the other size fits perfectly, hence I am apparently able to fit the item properly at least on one side.Update: I find myself having to add to the review out of sheer desperation. As I started using the product with my phone realized the microphone was not working. Tried any possible configuration with different phones and computers but nothing. Resorted to contact again th dreaded customer service and got a couple of "token" replies but, of course, no help whatsoever. It is now a week and they have totally disappeared.Bottom line: a faulty product is ammissable when innovating but an infuriatingly bad customer service is not. Buy at your peril....
