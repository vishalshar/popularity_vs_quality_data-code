Just received the latest version of August lock and installed it. Installing was a breeze. It upgraded the firmware by downloading and it took about 25 minutes.Soon after it started working, the battery indicator on the August App showed 20% capacity. By morning it showed 5% battery level and asked me to change the battery. I replaced with 4 new batteries. It started working well. But, next morning, it showed 20% battery capacity. The new set of 4 batteries also lasted only 1+ day.I have to remove and return this device. Am I the only one having this problem?
