Horrible product and horrible product support.  The seller of this product has lied to Amazon so the A-to-z Guarantee Program is worthless after I returned this product to the seller.  The Dane 64 GB USB stick I purchased constantly reported drive and data errors.  After reformatting, it would work well for a few hours and perhaps a day or two, then the errors would begin to re-occur.  I contacted Amazon for a refund of my purchase price and the seller lied to them and told them I didn't return the product and not within the 30 day time frame.  All I can say is, stay away from this product.  The Amazon A-to-z Guarantee Program won't help.
