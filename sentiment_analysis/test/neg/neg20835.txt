Bought two pair, great idea and design.  Fits well on any cell phone case.  Glasses are not designed well, where both pairs snapped in  middle after using 10 times.  Do not advising buying at all. Mfg , will not replaceRegular use eventually (3-4 weeks) wears down and break the bridge in the middle.  Strongly recommend not buying until they reingerrig
