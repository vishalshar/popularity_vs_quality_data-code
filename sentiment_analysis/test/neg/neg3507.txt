These things break easily and constantly. I bought them for my chukkas which I use to sit at my desk at work. Seriously, the most stress these things get are walking to and from my car or front door. I use them in the "regular" fit configuration, and my feet are US 7. Can't use loose because my shoes only have 4 eyelets. Before they break, they fit nice and comfy, but within a day or 2 they start snapping.EDIT: So I WAS able to try the loose configuration and...too loose. the shoes want to fall off when I walk. So it's regular or nothing, I guess.
