After reading the reviews I decided to ignore the negative reviews since Amazon has a good return policy and try this out.  The negative reviews are correct.  The concept is great, the tech is not.  This tracks my mood quite well and gives me minute details about how it changes etc. and even tracks steps I am taking, while SITTING ON THE CHARGER....  mine is on its way to being returned.
