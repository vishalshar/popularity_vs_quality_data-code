Please, save your money and buy a Bluetooth OBD2 device that will cost you less than $25.00 (search for "BAFX Products Bluetooth") and then spend less than $10 for an Android app (such as Torque) or an iOS app (such as OBD Fusion) and you will get more car driving data.All the data you will ever need will be on the Android or iOS app.Sure you won't get a web site that shows you limited information but you will save ~$75 and have more functionality and more data.I think the folks at Automatic need to spend less money on making their packaging into a cup (see screen shot fro their web site) and spend more time on really innovating the product and make it more feature rich and make more diagnostic information available other than hard braking and hard acceleration.
