First off, this thing is TINY. child sized. I was expecting it to at least be long enough to set my record player on top of it, since it has the option to come with one already I thought it would have enough surface. And it has no input or output in the back, when I searched for a 'receiver' and this showed up in the search options I assumed that would be an option. You can't plug anything into it and it's midget sized. And it's not good quality either. Dont bother.
