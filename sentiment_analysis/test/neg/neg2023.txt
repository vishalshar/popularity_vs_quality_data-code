The initial install went off without a hitch.  I installed it, set up the powerline connection, zones and initiated a test run to make sure everything worked fine.  My issues began when I woke to find a Red Pulsating LED on the controller.  So I pick up the install manual to work through the issue,  but there was no reference to a pulsating red indicator.  So I launch the app.  it says my next watering is scheduled for June 15th, but no indication anything was wrong.  With the light still flashing I go to the Blossom help website.  I managed to find a write up on a solid red LED, but no pulsating.  So, at this point I'm getting frustrated.  I did follow the instructions I found for that.....Check the Powerline connection (Ethernet cable, plug and reset), unplug the controller for 30 seconds and then try to reset by entering the pairing code.  I did those steps at least 5 times....and nothing.  Assuming this was a connectivity issue I attempted to connect via WiFi.  In the App it gives you this as an option right beneath the reset option for the powerline connection.  So I follow that link.  It instructs me to go into my Phone WiFi settings and look for a "Blossom-XXXX" SSID in the list of available connections.  Nothing was listed, so I entered it manually and it still could not find it.  At this point I was really frustrated and I called and emailed the company twice and got nothing but voicemail.  In a last ditch effort I tried to use the app to manually turn on a zone.  None of them respond.  So I had zero control over the system.  Not good.  I had it off the wall and my Hunter back in operation in 10 minutes.Now I'm back inside printing the return label and boxing it up when Blossom Tech support calls.  He was the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet.  very apologetic about the experience, but as we talked about the problem I was shocked to find outa) The pulsating red is the same as solid redThis is really strange because the site makes a point of distinguishing between all the various states of pulsating vs. solid.  The tech thought for sure the website didn't state solid red, but only pulsating red.  Here's the link:  http://support.myblossom.com/knowledge_base/topics/blossom-status-light-color-guideNo mention of pulsating red.  Coupled with the fact that I couldn't manually run the zones I thought the unit was toast.b) Even though the unit couldn't connect or be manually started it was programmed to run a backup watering program.  OK, so that's really cool if you didn't have to contact the company to find that out.  The App should tell you that it's using the backup watering program because of connectivity issues.  Something like "The Cloud isn't available, but don't worry we've got you covered.  We'll use a backup watering schedule until connectivity is restored."  Then give you a link to actually see this backup watering schedule to modify if you want.  There's absolutely zero documentation on this functionality anywhere I could find other that the tech support guy.  Nor is there any control of this backup watering schedule.  So that's pretty bad.c) To connect via WiFi you need to open the controller and hit a reset button for 15 seconds.Again, nothing in the install instructions, website or App that even remotely indicated this as the WiFi connection process.  How about a picture in the App that instructs you to remove the cover of the controller and points you to the reset button?I was really hopeful about this product, especially after the initial install, but it is really not ready.  This is a classic example of poor system design, integration and immature S/W releases (like some early Agile S/W dev team releases).The three major oversights are:1) Reporting a failure without any instructions or documentation for the user to troubleshoot2) No provisions for basic manual control.  This should be the first feature that should have been mech'd for the system design.  When everything else fails, provide the user a set of basic controls: on and off for each zone and duration for each.3) Provide explicit knowledge of and access to the backup program.  This should include an indicator that notifies the user when it's being used (like on the opening screen where it tells you when the next watering is scheduled) and the ability to edit it in the system settings.  And perhaps when to initiate it (like when cloud data is unavailable for xx hours/days).  Also, provide a notification function and a push notifications setting to adjust when to send system changes to the users phone or email.A few more backlog items for the teams to work before it's ready.
