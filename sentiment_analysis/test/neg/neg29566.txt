I was so excited to start using these after we lost one of our expensive car keys (subsequently found weeks later). I thought that they would be a great way to locate our phones when they manage to hide themselves throughout the house, and I was very excited to attach these to each of our car keys.Although the concept seems wonderful (and the repkaceable batteries made these superior in theory to the Tile), I found that these simply did not work as advertised.When looking at the map, our devices were up to a mile away from their actual location. This would make it possible to determine the city your item is in but not the actual location if you visited more than one place.Two of the 4 purchased would randomly chirp throughout the day.The phone finding feature hardly worked.Updating the firmware used up almost the entire first battery (a spare is provided)The instructions were terribly lacking, and their online support was not helpful.After trying for a few days to get these to work as advertised, we have up, and had to send them back as they were causing too much trouble.
