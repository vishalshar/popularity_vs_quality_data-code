Bought four of these.  First one would not set up following the instructions on the app.  The second one connected right away.  The third one didn't connect either,  but then it did.  Set up a schedule and it worked perfectly the first day.  Today I came home from work and both units are flashing.  Couldn't reconnect them no matter what I did.  Tomorrow I will try calling customer service and if that doesn't work,  I'm returning them.  I'm sure it is a wonderful product.  Looks well made.  I actually think the problem I encountered today was due to a lost connection with the router (thank you Comcast) and now I can't get them connected again.  When I follow the instructions on the app and am trying to connect the unit, it turns off my WiFi and I keep getting a message that says to turn off mobile data which IS turned off.  Can only give one star at this time.
