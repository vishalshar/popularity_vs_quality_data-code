Works great!! This does exactly what we wanted. I think my wife and I have almost as much fun using this as our miniature dachshund does chasing the balls! We use the small Kong toy balls that are way cheaper than the iFetch balls and they work just as well.****UPDATE**** We originally rated it as 5 Stars, but it's now a 1 star. We loved this thing at first but after about 7 months it gradually started losing power. Even on high speed it would only shoot the balls a few feet. Now, 10 months after we got it, it is completely dead. It was great while it lasted, but now it's useless.
