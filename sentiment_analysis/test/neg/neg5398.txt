Order it yesterday and had it shipped next day.  Installed the iPhone app and paired it, but got a message that the battery was weak.  Now the light doesn't come on when the button is pressed.  It's dead as a door nail.You would thync that the company would have better quality control.  Unacceptable to receive a unit with a weak or dead batter.Now I'll have to return the styncky product and reorder or pass altogether.
