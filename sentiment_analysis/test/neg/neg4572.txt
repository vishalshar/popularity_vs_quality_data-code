This product works great if your target shoe has the EXACT correct distance between lace holes such that when the shoe is on, there is no strain on the rubber at all, and that the only strain involved is when the shoe is being put on or removed.  If there is any strain on the rubber when the shoe is on, they dig uncomfortably into your foot, and if they are too loose, they sit there pointlessly and may as well not be there at all.  IF you have a pair of shoes where all the lace holes are exactly the same distance apart and are also all exactly the right fit for this product, you will be pleased, otherwise you will not.  I have one pair of shoes on which these work perfect, and another on which they are unusable.  For the price, they could probably have included several hundred of these of varying sizes, but instead they act as if these are one size fits all when it's obvious they are not.
