I regret spending the money. The litter doesn't absorb urine odor, and I'm still changing it after a few days. I have 2 cats, 7lbs and 5 lbs. not huge cats by any means, yet it won't last a week before they refuse to use it. They will not use stinky litter. So I'm going back to regular litter that is less trouble for me and stays cleaner longer.I'm also having trouble cancelling the scheduled Subscription order for the trays to be delivered. I certainly do not want any more deliveries. I actually have 2 trays I have no use for.
