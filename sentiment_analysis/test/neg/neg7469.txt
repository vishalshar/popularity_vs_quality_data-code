There is a thin rubber cover that keeps the loose magnets in place. Whenever you remove your device, the loose magnets turn sideways. If you live in a warm part of the country, the thin rubber gets very soft and holes form in the rubber where the magnets have turned sideways. I've had this mount for less than 30 days and its garbage.
