When researching pillows to replace my soft flat feather pillow, this one seemed to be a good idea.  When we first received it, it looked really good. But after awhile it kept expanding and getting thicker and firmer which is NOT what we wanted.  Will need to just use it as decoration for our backboard since neither my husband or I find it comfortable.
