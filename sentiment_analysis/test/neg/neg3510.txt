I was able to install easily. I do not have big feet but could not put on top row. So use without top row. After wearing for a couple hours my feet would hurt. I think they were too tight. No good way to make loser really. You can make tighter but not really loser. Horrible. Wanted to like them but nope. To painful to use.
