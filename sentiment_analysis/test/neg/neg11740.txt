Purchased two of these.  As a "Dumb" power strip I love, it form-fits to different shapes and isn't flimsy. The Design engineers really put some thought into this unit and it shows.Now to the bad part - If your buying this unit you are NOT looking (or paying $50) for a "Dumb" power strip. Unfortunately the unit is HIGHLY unreliable when used with the Wink Hub/Servers (the ONLY choice since they are proprietary with Wink as a "system).  I was depending on these units to control my security system while I was overseas, and they did work well for about a week, after that they became intermittent, I lost control, or the Wink APP would incorrectly report the status.  I had to use my IP Cam (a NON-WINK product) to observe and verify if the lights came on. Occasionally they would work, but most of the time the did not.  I contacted Wink and Quirky by phone, and gave up after hours of sitting in a "queue", I then opened a ticket (with both Wink and Quirky) and never received a response for almost 7 weeks( the response just told me to re-pair and reset, that WONT fix the problem).  I am an experienced IT Engineer with 20 years experience, so this is not a secondary issue of not following installation or pairing instructions.Bottom line -  My $50 power strips are in the trash (along with my Wink Hub), I cant even use them as "dumb" power strips because the two "controlled" outlets wont work without being paired.Apparently I am not the only one unhappy; you can visit the New York BBB, search on Wink Inc, and draw your own conclusion.
