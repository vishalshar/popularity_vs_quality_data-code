I tried Whistle despite of the mixed reviews. The unit worked properly but the "locate" and alert feature didn't work as promised. I decided to return it after my dog went outside the zone twice for a long period and I was sent a text message only after 6 hours. My dog went on two walks for more than 30 minutes. The health features are unnecessary as well as the social media component. Very disappointing.
