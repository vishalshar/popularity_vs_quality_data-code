This review is based on buying the kit for a first-time teen user. The description/packaging claim that you can make internet-linked devices right out of the box, with 5 projects to get you started. The reality is that no instructions for projects are given; instead you are linked to their website where hundreds of projects are uploaded. After pouring over these a couple of hours, the only project we found we could do just with the components of this kit was a Laundry Done notifier (informs you when dryer buzzes), not nearly enough to justify the price of this kit. I emailed the manufacturer and they suggested two projects, internet-controlled lamp, which required 2 or 3 additional modules, (only available with the SmartHome kit $250), and the other project required drilling through the door area  to construct a doorbell...This might be a great kit for those that already have other LittleBit kits, but it is definitely poor as a stand-alone first-time kit.
