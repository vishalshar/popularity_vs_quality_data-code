I have not been able to use this remote properly since I purchased it. I have written to the company and got an email from them asking me questions but so far no solution to my problem. I have a LG 42LB5800-UG TV and this remote will not control it so that I can use it with rest of my AV configuration. I can control my audio and my DVR but without controlling the television, what's the point? So now it sits on a shelf and I'm hopeful that one day the software will be updated to allow the device to control my tv. So, back to Harmony, which controls all of my devices.
