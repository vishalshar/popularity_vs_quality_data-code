I was really excited by this controller. I had read all the documentation and watched all the videos before receiving it in the mail. A fully mappable grid with fully mappable controls was going to allow me to make some great creative music. I thought it worked for all those people on You Tube so maybe the bad reviews were from non-techies or plug and play types. Oh, I so wanted that to be true and I let my judgement lag and fell in love with a device that I hadn't dated yet.The problem was that it was buggy out of the box. The pads would work and then wouldn't work and then my DAW would lock up and then I'd reset everything, verify the set-up and start again. Different USB locations, don't budge the QuNeo to rule out cord behavior, re-read something to verify that I wasn't doing something wrong. Three hours later it was back in the box and being returned. I didn't want another shelf gadget. I wanted a working midi controller. I would put in the time to do midi remappings, etc. if only it would show signs that it was going to work eventually.It's a great idea that doesn't seem ready for prime time. I don't mind figuring out midi mapping and using something that is very manual but only if it's going to be dependable. Undependable = Zapped Creativity. I've been down that road and it's not a pretty view.Maybe I got a bad one. I'm not going to find out. Life is short and I want to make music, not test beta electronics.YMMV
