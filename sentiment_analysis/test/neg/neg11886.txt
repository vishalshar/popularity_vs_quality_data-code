Card worked fine, and the recipient had little patience and quickly hid the card, leading for some good laughs.However, those of us who wanted to test the card easily disabled it with a well placed smack on the counter or against the heel of one's palm. I'd only recommend if the recipient gives up easily or given in public, but not at full price.
