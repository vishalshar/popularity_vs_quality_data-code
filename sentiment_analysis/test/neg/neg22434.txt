This is a very limited item insofar as notification..  It does not notify you promptly that the dog has gone outside the zone. Once I took the dog on a walk to see, and it took 15 minutes to get a notification.  Also it notifies you in the middle of the night that your dog has gone outside the zone when the tracker is sitting on the counter immediately next to the base station. Never did figure that out.  The only reason I kept it is that it is better than nothing. For an extra $50 I would buy something else if I could find one.
