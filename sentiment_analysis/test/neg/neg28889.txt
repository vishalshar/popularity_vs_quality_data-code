It's not what it makes you believe you are getting. It's really only suitable for like bedroom door or other interior doors. It is made very weak and cheap. We never could get the phone app to connect to the lock and none of the chips or cards did anything at all. We are sending it back. It isn't worth the risk. I think someone could easily get past this lock. It's junk
