This speaker doesn't sound good when I actually can get a device to connect! Its a gimmick at best. The sound quality isn't what it should be. I have a bose mini speaker that blows this thing away. My wife bought this for me for our anniversary and I'm asking her to return it. Don't waste your money its just a POS.
