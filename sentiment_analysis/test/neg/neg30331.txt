Well, I'm sending back the Hello Sense sleep tracker.  Good reviews on amazon made it seem like a good bet. Three problems: 1. inaccurate deep sleep reporting that jumps wildly from night to night, 2. adds more deep sleep time even after I'm clearly up, out of bed and moving around. 3. App graph hard to use.I'm close to giving up on the sleep cycle apps that rely on my phone's accelerometer with phone lying on the bed at night.  Basic problem is that for night to night comparisons the phone needs to being exactly the same placeon the bed and I have to remain close to phone all-night or it doesn't register movements consistently.All these monitors rely on some way of measuring how much I move at night. Since body movements are minimal with both N3 deep sleep and REM sleep, all these monitors combine N3+REM and report this as "deep" sleep.I'm testing two wrist monitors (similar to Fitbit) and initial testing shows better correlation of time of deep sleep with how I feel the next day than either Sense monitor or phone app monitors.
