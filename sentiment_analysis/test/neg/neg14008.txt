We want to love this toy, but it arrived open, used and broken on our 7 year olds birthday.He's been begging for this toy for a year, and we wouldn't normally splurge so much, and bought it against our better judgement.While it's super cute and likely loads of fun, I doubt I will order an electronic toy from Amazon again. This toy is so obviously used and restocked and made our kiddo cry.But I guess lesson learned, always inspect your items and don't wait to open the box at the last minute. I do understand that some items are defective, but this is a major oversight. My husband is running around town looking for a replacement now... such a bummer!UPDATE: We did get another. But I can't say I am impressed with this toy. Perhaps it's just the let down after all the hubbub, but it seems rather one dimensional and finicky. Falls over and crashes a lot. Doesn't really obey claps, motions etc. It got some giggles at first, but both kids seem a little let down, and like they might lose interest.
