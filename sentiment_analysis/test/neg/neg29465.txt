Cool looking design but destroys cell phone reception and interferes with WiFi.  Defeats the whole point of having a phone.  Also is not comfortable when you hold the phone up to your ear.  That may not be a problem if you are like me and have a Bluetooth headset.  Just holding it up to your ear though would be very uncomfortable.  Trust the reviews.  I didn't and now I'm sending this back.
