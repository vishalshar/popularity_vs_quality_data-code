Not sure if it was just this batch or if that was how they always are, but the ginger was way too strong (as in mouth burning strong). The primary flavors should be apples and carrots, and the ginger should be a mild, barely there flavor, not something that goes beyond overpowering everything else and actually makes the product inedible due to its heavy concentration. Good product idea, if they drastically changed the ratios of the ingredients.
