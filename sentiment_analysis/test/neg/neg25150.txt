My boys were really excited to put this together.  Once they did, they quickly lost interest.  The vehicle simply goes in circles and that's it.  You throw down cards on the table and try your best to get the app to pull up a dinosaur from the card by using the camera.  Then what?  I thought it was a game and the car/track was somehow operated by the iPad or something.  There's simply nothing to this and it was a waste of money and closet shelf space.
