The product is OK but, I had PROBLEMS getting the lid off about the 2-3 day of possession-- (packaging).  I couldn't GET it OFF!!  I tried everything to no avail.  When the lid finally came off--a week or 2 later, the WHOLE lid came off including the pump that makes the product come out of the container.  I would say Pater Lamas does NOT know what they are doing when it comes to packaging OR something happens to it while the product is in Amazon's possession. Once again, if you (Amazon) cannot stand behind the products you sell then I do NOT intend to purchase anything else from you!  (I started using this product on March 1st..)  I am extremely dissatisfied!!!
