i purchased the expensive unit with all extras for $149.99 ..... then purchased these refills...the only word that comes to mind is "false advertising" ... there is no way on god's green earth this a tray can last 30 days unless you have an invisible imaginary cat, virtual reality cat or toy /battery operated cat ... all of which would have invisible imaginary pooooooppppp .... i cannot get even 7 days from each tray with 2 cats .... after 3 or 4 days i have to add extra crystals purchased elsewhere to try and absorb urine and odors.... additionally be aware you need to put the lid on the bottom (unless you want all the urine to leak to your floor) .... furthermore to add insult to injury the expense of these trays that last 1 week is simply outrageous ... i was willing to pay that if they lasted 1 month as advertised or two weeks for two cats but THEY DO NOT LAST EVEN CLOSE TO THAT... the smell is unberable on the 4th day and i have to also empty poop in addition to adding crystals if i want to get 7 days out of a tray....first time i have had cats, will now go to typical litter systems ... ah, btw crystals get all over (even with the 20 purple mat, yes purchased that too) and crystals and poop get raked behind the back of the unit onto the floor , i assume because these trays are no where near deep enough .... wish i had seen a review like mine prior to investing, i cannot comprehend the great reviews on this unit .... there is no way my cats poop too much or that a universe exists where these trays last 30 days
