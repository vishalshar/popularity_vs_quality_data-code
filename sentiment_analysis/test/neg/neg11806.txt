The lock did not work and can be opened by anyone if you just press down on the cap. Waste of money and does not work. Buying this product initially made me feel safe to carry all prescriptions in my purse and then once I could open it with any code made me feel like I was lied to. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!
