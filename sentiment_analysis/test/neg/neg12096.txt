Sometimes tech needs to work out the kinks. This could have had real potential. I purchased the Cuff in November of last year as a birthday present to myself. The idea is brilliant: a device that alerts you when you're getting a call but only from specific individuals. It can also save you potentially in the case of an emergency...and all of that in a pretty piece of "jewelry". I love tech and I'm usually an early adopter. I pre ordered one. It worked for the first couple of weeks. Then I noticed that it was not alerting me to phone calls from my designated callers.  I contacted tech support and they got back to me with some suggestions. I went through their troubleshooting tips and it started working again properly. Again however like the last time, it stopped alerting me and I was missing phone calls from my callers after just a day or two.  This time, when I contacted the company, I got absolutely no response. I contacted them a second time and again, I got no response.  It's like they disappeared off the face of the planet. I started to go through the original troubleshooting tips again and I would go through the same cycle every single time: it would work for a few days and then I would stop getting alerts. This prompted me to go back on Amazon and take a look at what people were saying now that the product has been released and it was being used on a larger scale.  Many people were having the same issues I was calling it would work and then stop working and then they'd have to reset it and then it would work and then it would stop working. And on and onÂ… I officially gave up after several attempts to contact the manufacturer and absolutely zero, no response whatsoever in return.  It was an expensive lesson to learn but I'm glad I did not purchase any other jewelry pieces for the bluetooth device to go into. Long story short, I bought myself an Apple Watch for Christmas and I couldn't be happier! Lol
