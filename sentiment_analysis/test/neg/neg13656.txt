Sad to say this turned out to be a total bust. I bought the largest size version of this product but I don't know size had any impact on performance. It was like trying to mount a giant phone screen on a wall. With two people we still had bubbles. Once mounted the "erase" of dry erase barely worked because the painted wall was not glass smooth. And honestly if you have a glass wall just write on that without the board.  Shame. I really wanted this to work.
