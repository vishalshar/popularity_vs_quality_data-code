All though his case gets 1 star Rokforms customer service is second to none and their other products I have owned have been great.  The first case I received had the rubber portion start to pull apart from the plastic after just removing the case a few times. I emailed Rokform and the quickly shipped a second case.  The second one did the same thing.  I emailed them a third time and asked if the would replace it with the "sport" case which is much thicker and heavier duty. They said yes and quickly shipped the sport case.The sport case is a great case which I should have ordered in the first place as I have three of them in he family.  I love the magnet and the mounting system and use it in my vehicles and while mountain biking.  Great product.So steer away from this case and look at the sport case from Rokform.
