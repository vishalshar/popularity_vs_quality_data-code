This stuff tastes like orange flavored vomit. Seriously.  I've thrown up orange juice, and this is exactly what it tastes like coming back up.  I could barely stomach a few sips.  I'm gonna try mixing it with orange juice to see if it will help.  If that doesn't improve it, it's either being donated to someone with no taste buds or tossed in the trash.  I definitely won't be purchasing again.
