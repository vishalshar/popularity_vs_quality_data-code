I just got it in the mail today. Great packaging and cool looking design. Unfortunately before i had a chance to get it on my dog the collar mount broke due to a very poor design where they used about 1/16 inch thick plastic to mount the $100 device. Instead of spending money on the brushed medal finish or fancy box they should have spent the money on a metal bracket especially if its meant for active dogs. Very disappointed.
