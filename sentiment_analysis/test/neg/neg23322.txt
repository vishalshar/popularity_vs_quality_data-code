The product currently works as a very expensive range extender. Yes my entire apartment now gets solid wifi signal everywhere. But...* Be prepared to use your old router because the software on the Eero is way too immature right now and use the Eero in bridge mode. UPnP doesn't work properly which means most media and gaming consoles don't work properly.* Firmware updates happen sporadically on your devices and it doesn't always happen overnight.* When things go wrong... you don't have any mechanism to troubleshoot. Just un-plug, re-plug and hope for the best.* While your device has strong signal to nearest unit, your actual connection speed will be much lower (I average 30mbps in the worst spots) so you may still not be able to stream video in all areas of your home.* Android support right now is basically not there.But the biggest problem is the simplest for them to fix which is why I give them 1 star: They don't communicate.* They don't blog.* They don't acknowledge their issues publicly.* They don't post change-logs of firmware.* They don't properly triage support tickets or give you an ETA on a response. Your best bet is to call them which is annoying.* They are incredibly slow to respond to email and unless you call or tweet at them do they pay attention. I get that their overwhelmed but they are working harder, not smarter.I'm worried for the future of the company because mis-managed launches like this usually spell the death of a small company like this.
