This seems like a good idea. But the technology is not there in this case. I bought six of these and put them on everything I find important.  I like the idea of receiving an alert if my keys or something else were outside the range of my phone. That would be helpful. But the devices kept losing connection so often that  I had to disable that feature. It was alerting me that my keys were out of range every five minutes, even when they were right there in my pocket. Now  several of them do not connect. Not that useful when they don't work. I would send them all back, but I  through away all of the boxes. It will be nice when the technology gets there. I hate not being able to find my keys.
