I bought this product as a cheap way out to digitize my 30 year old slides, but did not work. The product is a basic black box with a light that illuminates the slides onto your iPhone using the app to help filter the slides to clarity. The photos came out either too bright or not focused, i did use all the settings from the app but not successful, might be user or product error. Either way i should have had one slide come out properly. The price is expensive; it is made from a slim plastic with a simple phone locking mechanism, the light is a standard small light bulb with not enough power wot light up the slides for the right photo.My recommendation is do not buy this product and save your money for a professional to convert your slides, as i eventually did.
