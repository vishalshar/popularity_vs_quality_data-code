Pros  Some Vibes have an effect but only mild and very temporary.Cons:    The strips are a significant problem. They only last for 3 or 4 uses and I had to wear a headband to keep the device on my head on the first use. Any effects are most noticeable with brand new strips but are far less pronounced thereafter. The strips are designed to be quickly unusable and disposable so as to extract ongoing revenue from users who have no choice but to keep forking out a considerable amount of money in order to continue using the actual device.   It requires constant recharging.   The strips are very expensive.   The Calm Vibe strip which sticks to the back of the neck left a significant burn that opened and wept for days.   Customer Support is a misnomer.   The device sits above the right eye and my vision was slightly blurred on the right side after each use.Conclusion: This is an expensive device with mildly noticeable effects at best and the considerable ongoing expenses are clandestine. This technology is a long way away from being worthwhile.
