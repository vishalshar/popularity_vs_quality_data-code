I really wanted to love the Dash. After reading a fair amount of positive, but mostly negative reviews, i decided to give them a try. First i updated the firmware to the latest version (2.2).The fit was perfect. Most comfortable truly wireless earbuds i have ever tried.I put my phone in my gym shorts and went on a run. The experience was great.After my run, i took a shower and got dressed for the day. I wanted to continue to use the dash. I put them back in and picked a song on my phone...then i slid my phone into my jeans pocket and the dash went silent. Pulled it out and the music came back on.Not worth $300 IMO for headphones that only work in gym clothes. I preordered their new headphones coming out called "the headphones"Im hoping the name is the only thing that stinks about those when they arrive.
