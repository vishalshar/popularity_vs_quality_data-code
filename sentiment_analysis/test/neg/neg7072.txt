What a scam! I paid for the overnight shipping on this because I have no mattress to sleep on. Package was nearly disintegrated when it arrived and the vacuum sealing trifold process used by the manufacturer completely destroys the structural integrity of the inner foam creating a spine in the bed and preventing it from laying flat. Unusable. Obviously I am requesting a full refund and still have no mattress to sleep on.
