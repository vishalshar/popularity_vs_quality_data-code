I bought the game Golf Live earlier this year. The main reason I bought it was to track how far I was hitting clubs.Over all I was very unhappy with just about everything. First. The power switch is almost impossible to use. Getting the thing to turn on or off is a pain. I ended up Charging it before using it and just let the battery die after every round.The unit did not always record the location. Even if you got the acknowledge it didn't necessarily record the location. This meant that when you got home there was a lot of manual editing of the round to add the shots it missed.Lastly the plugs with the RFID tags that go on the end of the grips are not very durable. I've had a couple break. They give you spares but if they break on the course are you going to go thru the set up process. Probably not. One of the problems is the design. they go on the end of the club so they hit the bottom of the bag every time you put a club away.I used it for a season and put it on ebay.
