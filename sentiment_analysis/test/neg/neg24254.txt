This devise has more problems than it is worth . It appeared to be really cool when i first set it up but when my pet leaves her preset territory i will get a notice but it will not track more than the initial point she is known to have been. Now the darn thing is stuck saying that she has been at that initial warning location for over 24 hours when if fact she is now home. Yes it is charged and yes it is attached the collar adaptor. I was going to purchase more for other pets but not now why bother?
