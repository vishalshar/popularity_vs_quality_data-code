The short version:The application that is necessary to run this device is buggy and frequently fails to connect when used.  Since this is the only way to access and use the SkyBell it makes unreliable.A more reliable app and/or something that could run on a PC would be nice.The longer version:The first version of Skybell I bought ended up having a failure with the sound and had to be returned.  To SkyBells credit it was done easily and simply and their help/support is great.The second device worked and I have been using in for a few weeks.The device itself I really like, however the app leaves a lot to be desired.*The app is slow to load and respond.*I have had to reboot it twice because is simple quit responding and would not connect.*The app frequently has trouble finding the SkyBell.I bought the SkyBell primarily for my wife and I to have a way to see who is approaching or ringing the doorbell.  We both have the app on our device and intermittently have problems accessing on demand or getting alerts when the motion sensor triggers.  Sometimes we will not get an alert for more than half an hour that the motion sensor trips.I will say that the doorbell alert has be immediate each time, however sometimes accessing to view takes 5-10 seconds (or more).The idea is to see the person at the door right after they ring so that you could interact with them should you need to this isnt always happening.A PC based version of the app would be nice as well possibly more reliableI have run the speed tests for my wireless and network to make sure the issues arent on my side, and that doesnt seem to be a problem.You are supposed to be able to have as many device connected to the SkyBell as you want. We have two.  It appears like this may be part of the issue, but thats just a guess.Overall I like the device.I love the set-up.The execution though just isnt great.Were continuing to use SkyBell for right now.  I hope that they improve the app, but until then I really cant recommend the product.
