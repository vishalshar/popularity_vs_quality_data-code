Used it for a few months and worked fine. All of a sudden I wasn't getting notifications, the battery would die in an hour and the tracker couldn't be found. When we first got it we tested it in several locations and were in love with the product. However, once I emailed the company about my issues they claimed it was because we didn't get service (Verizon) in our area. I had Verizon for years at my home with no problem. They didn't offer me a refund of any sort. Basically, they told me I was out of luck and I could cancel my service. Data coverage in the area is not the issue since is worked totally fine before...it's the actual device that is faulty.
