I have been big a rokform fan geek for the last 4 yrs. But this new style case that replaced the original is terrible!!  My wife's iPhone 6s plus case started falling apart 3 months after she got it.  Meanwhile her original case she got for her iPhone 5 that she gave to her sister is still in like new shape yrs later. Rokform has really missed the mark on this one huge!!! Getting my warranty replacement and selling them. I will just settle for the ordinary crap out there until rokform gets there head out of their @#%.
