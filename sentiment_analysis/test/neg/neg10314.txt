Two stars because it is pretty.  However, it's nothing more than a pretty pedometer, and for the price I need more functionality.  Not to mention that the pedometer and sleep tracker are very buggy and do not function properly a great deal of the time.  It came with a bracelet, which did not fit so I emailed the company.  They were very nice and sent a different size bracelet very quickly, but that one broke within a few days.  There is no way to track your calories or weight.  All in all, a big disappointment.  It's a shame because I wanted to like this product!
