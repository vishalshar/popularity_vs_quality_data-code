As another reviewer said, I really wanted to like the Misfit Shine 2.  In looking for a new fitness tracker, I wanted one that could be worn with a clip, was waterproof (not just water resistant), and would sync with Weight Watchers (Weight Watchers is discontinuing their ActiveLink monitor and has a very short list of devices that will sync with their program).I started looking right before the Misfit Shine 2 was released, and the Misfit Shine seemed to have everything I was looking for, but the consistent reviews about the poor design of the band and clip leading to the loss of the devise gave me pause.  A few days later when the Shine 2 was announced, I thought surely these concerns had been addressed with this second generation.  I was also very interested in the silent alarm and automatic sleep tracking functions.I've been using it for about a week, and unfortunately it will be on it's way back to Amazon shortly.  I didn't even try to use the band, because a) I wanted one that could be worn as a clip and b) initial reviews noted the new band had the same trouble securing the device as the old one did.  The clip itself is plastic, and the Shine 2 fits into it very loosely, so much so that you can spin it around by barely tapping it.  I wear it clipped to my bra and am constantly checking to make sure it is still there.  It seems to clip better on thicker fabrics, but it seems like there is no way it would stay on the thinner, polyester/Lycra-type exercise clothing (let alone shoes).The silent alarm function is great in theory, but the vibration is so weak it is useless, at least when worn with the clip.  In very quiet environments, I can actually hear it instead of feeling it.The app is okay (I'm using an iPhone), but there are some problems I have with it.  If you enter an activity (like swimming) and want to delete it later, you can't.  You also cannot delete photos you take when "tagging" your food.Tracking swimming does not appear to work if you are wearing the Shine 2 with the clip (or maybe I just suck at swimming!).  The first time I swam with it, I chose to "log exercise" after I swam.  I noted the time I started and the time I stopped swimming, and manually entered the information into the app.  I'd been swimming for an hour and earned zero "Misfit" points.  I thought maybe I had to do the "track now" option, so the next time I swam I did so.  That involves starting the timer on your phone, putting your phone in your gym locker, going to the pool, swimming, getting your phone back out of your locker and stopping the timer.  I swam again for an hour, and this time got 88 "Misfit" points (the equivalent of 37 calories for me, apparently).  To compare, walking on a treadmill for an hour at a moderate pace gave me 1,688 Misfit points (or 718 calories).The automatic sleep tracking worked for me about half the time.  Sleep tracking definitely worked when I told the app I was "going to bed soon," but that's not quite the same as "automatic."I don't know how well the Shine 2 syncs with Weight Watchers because I haven't tried.  I've been walking around in constant fear of losing this $100 device and in fairly consistent disappointment with its performance.As far as good points go, the LED lights are very pretty.  A pretty light show, however, doesn't make up for all the Shine 2's shortcomings.
