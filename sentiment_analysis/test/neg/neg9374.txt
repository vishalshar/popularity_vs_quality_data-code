These are awful. I broke 4 nails, there were no WRITTEN instructions and the top 2 are way too loose., It took me 30 minutes to figure out one shoe. I ripped them out and threw them in the trash. I cannot believe there were no instructions except a picture that you need a flashlight and a magnifying glass to see.
