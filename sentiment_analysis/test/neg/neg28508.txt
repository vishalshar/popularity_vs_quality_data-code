This is the worst cell phone I have  ever purchased. I can't make calls form  my area or home with it. Which they said was good for this area. The "plans" are expensive your quoted a $29.95 plan then they send you a bill for $40, Activation was a pain in the butt, very complicated and was $40 activation fee ($35,+ tax and rest). It is not for hearing impaired other than being big nothing is easy for seniors. I have returned this phone and will NEVER own another.
