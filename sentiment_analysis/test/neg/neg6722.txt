This worked well for about a year.  Then it stopped.  I changed the battery and it would not reconnect, even after following the suggestions on FAQ page.  I restarted the phone, turned blue tooth on and off, and reinstalled the app.  It would not work.  Will consider something different for the next time as I think it is a good concept and I hope it will help me find my keys when I lost them.
