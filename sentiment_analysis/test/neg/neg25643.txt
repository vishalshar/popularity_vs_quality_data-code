it's a great idea.  I've had to throw bottles out (well recycle) because I couldn't get the bottom clean.but the top and bottom do not screw on easily like other water bottles.it's very easy to get it threaded the wrong way and when you do get it right it's not smooth and takes some effort to twist on and off.lack of ease of use is the killer for me.  not worth the effort.Update: After about 6 uses we chucked this in the recycle bin.It's too difficult to get on and it leaks from the bottom.
