I wanted to love my shine 2 but it's going to be returned tomorrow for several reasons. 1 the stupid sport band design holds the device up off my wrist and doesn't allow me to feel the vibrations 90% of the time, I can only hear it. 2. I HATE the sport clip. I loved my old one but this one is hard and doesn't hold the shine 2 in the same position so if it vibrates it starts to turn around within the circle and makes the clock function confusing to read at a glance. 3. The stupid clip doesn't sit well on my bra strap like the old one did. This was my favorite feature and this really misses the mark. As for accuracy the minute I switched it from wrist to clip mode I noticed I was no longer earning as many points despite the fact that I was actually more active during that period. I'm saving the money I get when I return this and putting it toward an Apple Watch.
