"Wiggity Bang Games, LLC (WBG) was founded on the belief that a sense of humor is the key that unlocks the universe."  Well... I'm not sure if it was intended as a joke or not, but when we opened up the game to play it, we received 5 sheets of the same letters "A" and "B."  Not sure if "BAA" or "ABBA" can make the game fun or not, but we sure are disappointed.  Hard to play a word game with two letters.  Not much hope for an exchange either with it showing out of stock.  Time to test the holiday refund process...
