Oh boy! Drooling over hyped Light Field Technology for yeas, finally, for what appeared to be fantastic price, I got it.It would be OK camera 15 years ago. This is, at the best, technology preview demo. At worst - it is completely botched product.First, camera must be pre-focused, auto-focused, like any other camera. Otherwise no light field processing can extract any details, it will stay fuzzy. Auto-focus is slow and unreliable. In my tests most, about 80% of images taken, still fuzzy, no mater how much I reduce aperture and increase field of depth in post processing. Sharpening if images makes it even worse. Fisher Price toy cameras produces sharper images! Resolution supposed to be about 1Mpix. looks softer that VGA.Playing with post-focus/aperture gets old very fast. While I would appreciate if depth of field would be adjustable, the fact it is discrete, in very noticeable steps. I ball park it that raw array is about 4x4 images. To make it more continuous, software does a lot of image processing. I got number of images with attempt to create shallow focus only o find that some lines changing sharpness while still in same focal plane. Obvious problem with algorithms. And those algorithms taxing my PC to it's knees. Any image adjustment takes couple of seconds to update on screen. Can't run it on Win8.1 tablet as it is 32bit only (Microsoft enforcing 32bit even on 64 bit capable tablets).  iOS does not allow any adjustment on iPhone 5, must have 5S or higher to have those functions.First I thought to keep it like novelty or some experimental artsy tool. I thought it has kind of like Polaroid film feel plus depth of field control. It does not. Feels dead and annoying.Last hope was for 3D macro. PC software allow to post images to standard 3D JPS files. Far objects appeared just plain flat. Close-up closer that couple of inches still kind of shallow. Not enough stereo base in single lens aperture. No go.In addition to poorly implemented technology and very low res, it has no flash and light sensitivity extremely poor.Lens cover snaps with magnet and has no lanyard. I basically lost it couple of times. Luckily in my pocket.Wrist position is weird, uncomfortable. Screen is tiny. I was not able to navigate it till reading manual (first time ever!).After taking pictures for couple of days there is not a single one that I would like to keep.Very disappointed. Complete waste.
