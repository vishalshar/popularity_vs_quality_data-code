I've used this Mountek CD slot mount almost every day for six months on a 180-mile round trip commute. For five and a half months, it worked great, holding my phone (first a Nexus 5, then a Nexus 6p) very securely. However, in the last few weeks, one of the internal gears has stripped itself, and now the two adjustable "wings" that clamp the phone don't hold properly; they pop outward far too easily, so even hitting a small bump in the road will send my phone flying.I took the entire thing apart, and was able to temporarily fix it, but the plastic gears have worn down too much and it failed again within two days.The part of the mount that secures the mount to the CD player slot works great, and seems unlikely to mechanically fail. Too bad the part that grips the phone didn't last.
