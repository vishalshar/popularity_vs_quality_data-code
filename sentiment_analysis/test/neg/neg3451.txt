While the idea behind these is great, the actual product leaves a lot to be desired. I purchased these because my cat insists on chewing all the shoelaces off of my shoes. These seemed like a great solution and had the added convenience of turning my shoes into slip-ons.Unfortunately, these are not meant for people who have high insteps or wide feet (and I was blessed with both). I put these on a pair of Asics Gel Cumulus shoes. I had to remove the top most Hickies because it was so tight my foot began to go numb. It looks a little stupid, but worked. After about two week of frustration with the Hickies coming undone, two snapped off of one shoe while I was mid-step. A few days later, one broke on the other shoe, and today, I had one break again. I'm out of spare Hickies now and I think I'm just going to go back the the more reliable traditional laces and somehow keep my cat off of my shoes.
