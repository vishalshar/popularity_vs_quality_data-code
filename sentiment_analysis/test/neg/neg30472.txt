We ordered these as a "step-up" from Little bits. They are way overpriced and the magnets don't hold well. Stick with Little bits which is a much better product and much lower priced. Check out the price on one little componet for these if you ever plan to add on to your set! We returned this for a refund. My 13 year old daughter is a whiz with k'nex and little bits but these were not fun. I struggled to justify the purchase and tried to make something with these but eventually gave up. I was cutting paper and pulling out legos but nothing seemed to help.
