This works really poorly. The "heat from your hand" would take 15 minutes to warm it enough to be effective, and even if you pre-heat it in hot water, it does not melt the butter curls enough for easy spreading. I can cut better thin slices of butter with a table knife, without mangling the rest of the stick of butter.Not Recommended for toast or any other use.
