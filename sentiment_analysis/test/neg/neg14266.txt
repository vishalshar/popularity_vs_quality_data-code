I didn't realize how slippery this rubber material would be. It is extremely smooth and provides no rubber-like grip that one would expect. It almost feels like it's coated in baby powder (which it is not) but has that same sort of tactile-less feel. My four year old drops it frequently even when holding the handle portion unless he is gripping it very tightly.
