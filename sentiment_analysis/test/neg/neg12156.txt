Requires your phone to have USB OTG capabilities.  Did not know this until I started troubleshooting why the camera wont work with my Nexus 4.  There should really be a link to which phones it does work with and which phones it does not work with.  There was no mention of USB OTG anywhere in the product description.  All it said was "simply attach to your phone's microusb port" or something like that.  In fact, it is not at all that simple.  And then, even if your phone does support USB OTG, there is a very likely chance that the camera will only face backward toward you instead of forward.  And also, you are required to agree to their very restrictive terms and setup an account with them just to use the app.  Also, the app requires the permission that allows it access to your location... WHY should they get to know my location??? CREEPY!!!
