If you expect this product to look like the picture, do NOT but from this site.  I wanted something "cute" and the big bow and clever look seemed perfect for the gift I wanted to give.  It arrived in a funky little cellophane package with a 1/4 inch ribbon wrapped around it. No appeal at all.  I am returning it and buying the same product from the Wrapadoo site.  No Prime but same price and free shipping.
