We had high hopes for this. We were a bit discouraged when we saw there are no instructions or manual included but we still tried to make use of it as intended. However, this isn't a fully useful building kit without an iPad. The iOS app isn't made to be used on an iPhone. Build instructions aren't fully viewable on the smaller iPhone screen and cannot be adjusted for the viewing size difference. So imagine trying to make a build but only seeing  6 giant words that don't make any sense because you're seeing just one small portion of the whole instructional page. We couldn't even tell how many build projects are on the app. If the app worked on iPhone or Android, we would keep it because the components are good quality.
