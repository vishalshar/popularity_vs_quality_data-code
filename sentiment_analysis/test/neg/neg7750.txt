This product does not work in any car so far that I tried it in.  I tried a 2015 Ford Escape and a 2013 Lexus ES350.  It won't even insert into the CD slot at all.  This could not have been tested on modern cars as it is not long enough to fit their built-in CD slots.  It may work in a flat faced aftermarket CD player.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  I would get my money back if I could. This is a very poor design and just doesn't work.Radmo Dual Mobile Phone Mount For Your Car, Coated Aluminum
