I'm really disappointed. Turns out, what you're ordering here is only the camera/sensor package, and it needs a totally separate "base station" to function at all. And as far as I can tell, the base station is nowhere to be found on Amazon (even if I could afford it). You can't even fire up the app without itÂ—the device just sits there blinking a sad red light at you. It's a beautiful design and sounds like a really great idea, but as it ships, it does exactly none of the things described on this page.
