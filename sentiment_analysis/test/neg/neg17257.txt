We got through two days of using this when the bottom quite suddenly shattered all over my husband's dinner! The first two uses were spectacular; we've wanted a gadget for mixing homemade dressings for awhile and were excited for this. It worked...until it didn't. He was shaking it but not vigorously when the bottom leaked all over the table. What a shock! Anyway I hope no one else gets shattered glass in their salad. ??
