They work fine once you get them inserted. However, after you set them to the correct length, when you try to get them in and have to put any pressure on them, they collapse to a smaller length than you need. Also, because of the shape of the end with the arrow-like point, they can be difficult to remove, as the edges of the arrow get caught easily. They will do the job if you're patient but for me it's easier to just use nice metal collar stays to avoid the above stated hassles.
