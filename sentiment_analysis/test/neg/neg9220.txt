Normally we purchased this food from Petco but thought for convenience we would try Amazon.  One of the cans in the case was not labeled and every can was really watery.  If you shake the cans you can hear liquid and every can had 4 or 5 oz of liquid.  Normally this food is solid but soft with almost no liquid at room temperature. I like the food and it has been good for the dog but I won't be buying it here again.
