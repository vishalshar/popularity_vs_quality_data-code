Be sure and check the guard screws every now and then.  My guard screws came loose and the string got caught up in my propellers.  The drone fell 25 feet and luckily landed on the grass. I will not be using the guards in the future. The drone is so stable, I think the guards are not necessary. My drone is going to the shop this weekend for repairs!
