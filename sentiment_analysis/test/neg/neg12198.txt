I rarely if ever write reviews on Amazon.  If I write one, the product must be pretty bad.  To qualify, I am 34 and grew up with technology.  I'm damn good at troubleshooting and getting things to work.  This device is absolutely not worth the effort.  With Philips' Hue on the market, I'm surprised LIFX believes this obtuse nonsense is marketable.  Over an hour of fighting with minutiae of detail, and it still is barely working with Amazon Echo.  Phhbbbtttt!!!!  (Returned)
