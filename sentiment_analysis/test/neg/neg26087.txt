Bought this is a Christmas gift for a family member, she complained that it wouldn't fully charge the phone and that the battery pack itself didn't last.  I was disappointed because I read a lot of reviews and so many people wrote raving reviews about the product so I decided to trst it out myself.I charged it overnight and at 7:04 pm started to charge my Samsung S7 edge, it was at 50%.  When i turned on the battery pack it lit up white and I began charging my phone. By 7:08 my phone charged to 54% but by 7:12 pm the light changed from white to blue. At 7:20 the light turned red and my phone was charged at 65%, the battery pack then shut down.I'm really disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.
