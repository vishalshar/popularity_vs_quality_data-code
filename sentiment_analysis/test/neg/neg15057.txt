Well i got this hoping i could use it for work at times which it does not read even behind a 3/8th drywall. I have had a GS3 and its falsely advertised it isnt compatible to all GS3.  So still not knowing the product function i purchased GS5 and after testing it im now over 500$ in expense i could of just bought a dedicated camera for thermal. So bottom line if you have Galaxy s3 dont risk it or email the thermalseek you will have an answer in about a week. Other than that its a cool toy if your into running hot water and look at it through your phone in a different color.
