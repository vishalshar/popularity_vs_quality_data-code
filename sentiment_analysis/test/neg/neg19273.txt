The sound quality and comfort of these headphones is excellent.  But I can't give it any kind of good review seeing as mine came with a broken mic.  Hopefully the customer service is decent and I can get them replaced without much hassle.  I want to love these things.  They are incredibly comfortable, sound fantastic, and feel solid.Updated:  5 weeks out is apparently too long to get a return, exchange, or anything at all.  Don't buy these.  Unless you've got that kind of money to gamble away.
