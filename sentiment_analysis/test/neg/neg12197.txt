Very bad customer service! This a very expensive bulb to stop working so soon, connectivity is horrible after the update and when I contact them they just tell me that I DONT HAVE THE WILLING TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. It all happened because of the update but now I just have a bulb that I have to use it with the wall switch.
