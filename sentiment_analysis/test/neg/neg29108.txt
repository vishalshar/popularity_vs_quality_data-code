Today was the first time I actually tried it. I was at Costco, opened the app waited a minute or so for it to find my car. It didn't even know where it was it thought it was on the other side of town. As I walked to my car the app was still searching when I could actually see my car the app finally figured out where it was and found my car. Once it found my car I'd take a step it said getting closer, take another step it would say getting further. So I think it is useless for finding my car, it might work for keys since they are probably in the same house as the phone
