Great idea, unfortunately it does not work after the first few times.  The first time I used it, it worked great!  It stuck upright on a smooth metal fixture and didn't slide -  as advertised.  Within 10 uses, the product simply stopped staying on anything.  I removed it from the back of my phone and threw it out.  On a secondary note, which is not the products fault, but should be considered for someone buying, many places I wanted to use it simply were not designed in a way that it could be used for example: the screen in my 2013 Camry is too small and the product couldn't get a flat connection, the windshield on my Camry was too curved for it to get a flat connection, the dashboard on my Camry was too textured for it to gain hold, etc.
