It broke after a week and is unusable. The mount kept coming loose on my 15 minute commute to work and I kept tightening the knob until there was no more threads to turn. I looked at it to see if I could have done anything different, but its cheap plastic and it was either have it loose, rattle, and shake, or try to tighten it.  I loved it while it worked, but will be sending it back.
