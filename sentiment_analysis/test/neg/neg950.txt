I got mine 3 days ago and am sending them back today. The technology is so cool but the Bluetooth range wasn't good enough for I need. I think the technology will be there in a year or so and I'll probably be a future customer once they get the issues ironed out. The waterproof function was great the controls are cool and work great. It's hard to get used to the touch screen. I just need a headphone for the gym and I can leave my phone in my bag and workout without the scratchy sound. Once they fix these issues I'll reorder. 300$ was hard to swallow for the audio quality due to the Bluetooth
