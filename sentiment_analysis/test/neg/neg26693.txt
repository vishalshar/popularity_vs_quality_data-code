I bought this for my 12 year old son who is very comfortable with computers and other such tech - but he has been nothing but frustrated. After he 'sets' the robot in the standing position, it almost immediately zooms away and falls over. Emails to WowWee customer service have been less than helpful - change the batteries, etc. This was a $100 xmas present that I should have skipped.
