It's nice being able t manually start my sprinklers for a given amount of time butThe first time they were schedule to run on their own, one station ran for 24 minutes as programmed, the second station ran for 24 minutes as programmed, and the third station ran for 1 and a half hours WTF! This is actually worse than what I was dong before this.Not worth the money spent.
