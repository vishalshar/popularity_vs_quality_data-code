How many kids do you know with an iPad for school, lots ?? Guess what you can not use to control these models, yep, an iPad. We bought these after seeing a review that gave them big thumbs up, didn't see any need to read the fine print, just looks like great fun for the kids. Yes we know it's our fault for not sitting there and reading the fine print,We were both very surprised to see the device that so many school aged kids have now could not be used, if you wish to use them with an Apple device, only iPhones will work, something most younger school aged kids do not have.C'mon gus, are you serious, kids have iPads for school now, not iPhones.
