Cute but the problem is that if you don't have a brand new device to run the app on your screwed. your son will be using your brand new iPad that kids aren't allowed to touch. because without the app it does very little and they are bored with it quickly.  this is an expensive toy and my son is sorry he worked so hard to buy it.
