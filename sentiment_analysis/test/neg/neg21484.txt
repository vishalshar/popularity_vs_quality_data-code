Zero stars would be more than generous.........my package came ---  the lotion was stuck in a cardboard book sleeve without any protection,the product was in a plastic sandwich bag and it still leaked all over the box, then on me and my tablewhen I opened it - The jar seal was opened and the seal was STUCK BACK IN THE JAR-it looked USED! And the inside lid has a line of some kind of red goop around the edges.  Gross.
