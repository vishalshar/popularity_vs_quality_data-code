The camera has failed multiple times for 2 production/live events.  We have contacted MEVO and they believe it is a defect given that their troubleshooting tips did not work.  Unfortunately, I am past the 30 day mark therefore I am unable to return per Amazon policy.  I don't want a refund, just exchange for a "working" camera.
