Had mine 2 days. Not impressed. Too slippery, not at all like the video with the pebbled design on back. Hard to open and close. The tracker is chintzy looking and the instructions awful.Follow up 1 week later..... I love the convenience of having my plastic and phone together. I don't carry a purse ever but used to carry a separate card case. Don't really care about or use the tracker. The biggest issue I have is that the case is just too slippery. They should have stayed with the original design with the bumps and logo on the back or made the sides of the case with some grip. I'm torn about continuing to use it because of this. I really don't want to drop my phone so I might have to wait and hope for a redesign.
