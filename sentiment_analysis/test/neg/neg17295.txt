I really dislike giving small start-ups bad reviews.  I thought this was such a great idea and couldn't wait to get mine.  Unfortunately, it worked the first night I used it and pretty much stopped after that. Device would say I was a 0.00% when I had just finished 3 glasses of wine or would say I was 0.05% when I had no alcohol all day.  I contacted Alcohoot directly via email (they have no phone number) and finally got a response after sending 4 emails!  Person asked for the original amazon order # which was supplied in the first email.  I sent it back, waited patiently another 5 days, no response again.  Great idea which is the reason for the 2 stars, poor execution on customer support.  Good luck getting anyone to get back to you if you have any problems!
