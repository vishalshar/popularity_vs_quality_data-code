I love the concept, I love the glasses and I just wish I could find them!!!I saw this pop up when I went to replace my drawer full of broken readers I've accumulated over the years with thought s of attempting to salvage a few.  I've learned that, for me, readers must be lightweight and at least, last more than a few months.  This looked promising.For light weight wearability, they are fantastic. They really sit anywhere you put the on your nose and they stay put! Whatever the nose piece is made of, it works great.  They are easily moved to suit your environment and make reading a pleasure.However.,, they are small, very thin and easy to lose.  The first time I lost them, I had laid them down to do something and, as usual, soon forgot where I put them.. a common occurrence for many, I am sure.  Sure enough, they turned up a day or two later where I left them, but they are hard to spot when your are actively searching for them.  If I had known that, I would have ordered fluorescent pink or something to help them stand out.This incident convince me to pick up the phone case and attach it to the Otterbox Commuter housing my Galaxy phone.  I pulled off the tape and carefully positioned the case on the back of the phone so it would be square and the adhesive only against a flat surface.  Slid the glasses in and was extremely impressed with the setup.It worked great that night, stayed in place, glasses stayed put and I was a happy camper.  Until the following a day spent in one of my 4 jeans pockets, including an extended visit to a hospital maternity ward.  Shortly afterwards, the case became loose and beginning to un-attach from the phone.  Hoping it was resilient adhesive I carefully put it back in position, pressed firmly and hoped for the best.  After a few hours of it wiggling around the back of the phone, it disappeared.  Where?  I still have no idea.  I am trusting they'll turn up soon or later, but in a case that looks like it could be a piece of scrap material, for all I know my wife could have swept it up and tossed it in the trash.  Florescent again would be useful.I hate to knock them because it is a great idea, but I assume their status as startup here on Amazon, they are looking for honest feedback from customers.  I'll try and update if I find these and I am open to suggestions on how to make sure they don't detach from the phone before I get to really put it to use.
