I bought this from JAMAICA. I had no answer from BRAGI when I wrote them telling that my dash had stopped working. For such a high price I was expecting something that actually works. Had to pay the return from my pocket, 80 USD. Right now they are refunding my money, but I lost cash and time by buying something that stopped working after 2 days use.
