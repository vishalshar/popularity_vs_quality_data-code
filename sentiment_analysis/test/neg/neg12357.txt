So I held off on giving a review for a while because while I think the device looks amazing, I had some issues. To begin, this is the second iteration of the Misfit Shine 2 that I obtained. The first one I had for about a week until I realized that it was severely undercounting my activity. I first noticed my phone would say one number and this thing wouldn't be close. Trying not to jump to conclusions, I used a friend's tracker, their phone and mine. Nope. This wasn't even in the ballpark. Then the darn thing wouldn't sync in the morning. It's like I couldn't get it to wake up. Tap, tap?! Nothing. About halfway through the morning it would come to life. Useless. Not to mention this thing just wouldn't stay in the band. Popped out like crazy. I thought people were overreacting. They weren't.So I contact Customer Service. I tell them I've been a longtime customer, having owned the first Shine and having lost it when (you guessed it!) it popped out of the band. I tell them the syncing problem. I didn't realize drugs were legal in California or wherever they are because the first person to contact me back asks me (I kid you not!) if I had double-tapped the device. Or if I had checked the battery on the brand new device that they had just mailed to me. Obviously she didn't' read a word I had sent. So I did my best to explain to her that I'm not a complete moron and that I would just like to return the device since I was still in time to do so. The next person to get back to me was much nicer and offered to swap out the device. Since I needed the tracker and I really do like the look of it, I thought, "What the hell!" I'll give it another shot. So I tell her fine. I also mention that the band sucks. She says she'll send me a new one with a new sport action clip, whatever the hell that is. And she does. A+ to her. Her customer service accounts for half the star.So I get the replacement Shine 2. In a manila envelope. Wrapped in bubble wrap. Not in an unopened box or anything. Just the Shine 2 in the band wrapped in bubble wrap. Weird, right? But I go against my gut AGAIN! (I know, I know, I know....now I know I should have quit while I was ahead!) I wipe it off with antibacterial, because Lord knows who's wrist that things been on and I start wearing it. Sync is good. Ok. I like that. Doesn't seem to pop out. Ok, that's better too.  Until today. Guys! GUYS!!!! The new sport action clip band that will secure your Shine 2 and keep you from losing this thing accidentally by, you know moving your arm more than 10 degrees??? IT'S TAPE!!! I was going to a meeting and wanted to wear a watch so I transferred the thing over to the clip and IT HAD DOUBLE-SIDED TAPE STUCK TO THE BACK STICKING IT TO THE ORIGINAL CRAPPY BAND!!!! I hadn't realized that this ultra new technology of double-sided tape was what they were going to sell off as their "new improved band". If you couldn't figure out how to make the darn thing stay in place you shouldn't have started selling it in the first place.Not only did they send me a very unprofessionally presented product as a replacement for a defective one still under warranty. They TAPED it to the band. Not cool Misfit. Needless to say, when my mom was looking for a tracker last week, we went with the Fitbit.
