I have tried this twice, and was disappointed both times. I got a decent yield on the first batch, but, in both cases, the second batch completely failed. No mushrooms at all. For the price, you can easily buy five times as many oyster mushrooms as you get from this kit. It might be worth it if it grew truffles or morels (and lots of them), but, as it is, it's really not worth doing.
