This seemed like a great idea for a vacation home.Unfortunately, the first problem I had was that I could not register the device because the iFamcare app has a limited number of characters for an email address and I was evidently a couple of characters too long. So I created a gmail address to try the product. It came on reasonably quickly but could not broadcast continuously.  The picture was reasonably good to start.  Then I used the app to rotate the camera and it stopped broadcasting. I tried reconnecting but I never saw the picture again.  Our speed is about 11mb/sec so we had good thru-put. I also tried connecting it to a 4G service and had the same problem.I sent an email to customer service but on Saturday but did not hear anything back from them until 8pm on Tuesday.  Not really what I would call good customer service.  After I didn't hear from them on Monday I initiated a return to Amazon.  I have since ordered a more professional camera at a higher price point.I would skip this one until they improve it.
