I had to send it back as the pedals are not spaced far enough from the body to keep from knocking it and getting stuck. I was looking forward to being able to link it up with my Fitbit. The body needs to be skinnier to accommodate the pedals. This is really a manufacturing defect that needs to be corrected.
