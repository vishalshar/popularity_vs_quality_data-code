Android and Blackberry users beware!  There are many android/blackberry devices that are not compatible with the firmware updates.  I spent many hours reading everything on their site before purchasing this item.  Nowhere on the Bellabeat website did it say that I would be unable to use my new Leaf if I owned a Samsung product.  After literally MONTHS of back and forth with tech support (they take two days to respond to each email, so every reply I send them takes two more days for them to reply) they eventually inform me that the ONLY fix that will make my product work is to download the firmware with an iPhone.  They of course assure me that I don't actually need to purchase and iPhone, I merely need to borrow a friend's iPhone, download the Leaf app onto their phone, use it to download the firmware update, then delete everything from the iPhone and go back to using the Leaf on my normal device.Which is great, except that I live in the middle of nowhere, nowhere near any friends or family, so now I am stuck with a useless piece of crap that has never worked, and won't work.  Ever.  Their only response is that they "sincerely hope you'll be able to update it on a different device and continue enjoying your Leaf".  What a joke!  I was never able to "enjoy" it because it never worked!And all this took MONTHS of back and forth to figure out.  I wish right off the bat they had asked if I owned one of the incompatible devices and just told me to go screw myself if that was the case.  It would have saved me many, many, many hours of my time, not to mention frustration.  I have now spent over a hundred dollars on a device that does not work and will never work and basically, it's my problem.I would never recommend anyone buy anything from this company!P.S.  Here is a list of the incompatible devices as of 12/29/16:Samsung Galaxy Note 4Samsung Galaxy S5Samsung Galaxy S6 ActiveSamsung Galaxy A3Galaxy J7Nexus 6Blackberry Priv
