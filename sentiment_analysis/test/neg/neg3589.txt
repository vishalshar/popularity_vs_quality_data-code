**UPDATE We'd be down to zero stars if that were an option.  Kevin Creator of EcoQube (who made a few promises in his response to my original review, see below) asked me to send a video demonstrating that my LED is broken, but the email address he provided doesn't work.  3 more days, 2 chats with an online EcoQube assistant, further attempts by me to contact EcoQube through amazon, and way too much of my time and energy later, and the 'Senior Specialist' to whom my case was escalated remains MIA while I have a non-functional $100 aquarium and no way to reach anyone at the company.  Less than impressed -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE CUSTOMER CONCERNS.**  I broke my beta's aquarium yesterday while cleaning it, and decided to upgrade to the EcoQube, paying extra to get it here overnight and get our fish into its new home.  Unfortunately, that's not going to happen any time soon.  First, what I received was just the cube, electrical items and the planter and seeds.  The other items described as being included in the box -- the Origin sand, mountain stone and LED remote --on EcoQube's website (which I reviewed at Aqua Design Innovation's suggestion in the question and answer section of this listing) were nowhere to be found.  So I spent an hour on a trip to the pet store to get sand so I could get my EcoQube up and running and get my fish in it.  Oh, except that the  "5 minute simple setup, simply fill it with water, plug it in and add the fish" forgets the part about WAITING THREE WEEKS FOR THE PLANT TO GROW before you add the fish.  Never mind, I thought, it looks like this will be a great product, I'll figure out a better temporary home for my fish and wait.  Completed the set up and hit the magic button to turn on the fancy LED light that has a zillion different settings to suit my every whim and... nothing.  The light doesn't work.  Guessing that won't help the plant to grow -- waiting to hear back from ADI, hope to hear from them soon and be able to update this to a more positive review.
