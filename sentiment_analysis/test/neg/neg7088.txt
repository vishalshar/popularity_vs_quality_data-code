The design doesn't work -- the snap together design keeps on falling apart.I got this for my 9 year old daughter who is great with lego and snap its. We struggled for more than 90 minutes trying to put together the bot with wheels, only to have it fall apart every time because the pieces that were suppose to snap to the base kept on coming apart.If I knew the frustration I was in for, I would not have bought this.
