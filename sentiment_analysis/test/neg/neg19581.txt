We have been buying this product for 3 pr 4 years and our cats love it. Or at least until the last 2 shipments. The pieces were very hard and often not edible. We tried to soften it with water but that didn't work. We ended up returning a bag to Amazon and the replacement bag was still not up to par. I finally called the end-item supplier and they were sympathetic and very honest. They said that they changed their process and were changing it back because of so many complaints (mostly from cat owners). They sent us a replacement bag and we are very happy again.
