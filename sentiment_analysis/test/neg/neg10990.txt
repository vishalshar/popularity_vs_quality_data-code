I'm not really a fan of these. I was looking for individual wipes to take with me in the backcountry as a luxury item to wipe the dirt and grime off of me after a good hike. The material certainly is thick, so I get why people compare it to a wash cloth... but it's a very rough, scratchy material that I did not like rubbing on my skin at all. Beyond that, I didn't realize how huge the packets would be. Not conducive to packing small and conserving space in your pack. I ended up just bringing one with me for a week of hiking and still felt like it took up a lot of space. I think in the future I'll just keep to using my camp suds and bandana to wash up.
