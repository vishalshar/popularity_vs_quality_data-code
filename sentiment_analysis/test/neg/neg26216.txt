This is an ok game but; unfortunately, there are a lot of duplicate sayings on cards, plus... words are misspelled (like "baskerball"), which is kind of odd.  There are no instructions included in box, which is no big deal.  But mouth pieces hurt, when you put them in, because the plastic is not smooth all over, like the "Lolz" game mouth pieces (which our friends have).... so that is a big deal!  This game was less than $15 so we won't be returning it, but I wouldn't recommend it to others.
