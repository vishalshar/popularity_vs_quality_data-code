My application required that the laser target be placed on a garage door that has windows in the top panel.  It appears that the light coming through the windows interfered with the laser reflector.  The reflector was never able to register a reflection greater than 10 out of 100 and was not able to sense a closed door, thus preventing proper operation of the door.  The reflection registered over 90 at the same distance in a lowly lit room.  I returned the Garadget when it appeared that it would not work for my application.
