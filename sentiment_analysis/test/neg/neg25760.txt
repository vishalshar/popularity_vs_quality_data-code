The August Smart lock is anything but a smart lock. Firstly there's no way to tell how much battery is remaining. August claims 3 month battery life. To unlock your door remotely it requires a Wifi bridge. Don't let their advertisements fool you. This is an additional $79.99+ cost. It's a shame Wi-Fi isn't built into the August Lock. Further more this requires 4 AA batteries doesn't even come with lithium rechargeable batteries. The worst feature is the automatic unlock as it never works. I live in a high rise and by the time I get to my door nothing happens. Do not even try the auto unlock feature especially if you live in a building. And the biggest false advertisement is the homekit they haven't even made it compatible with iOS 10. Their website said they were going to update it 3 months ago. Imagine a company that doesn't update its firmware frequently and you lose the ability to remotely unlock how would you feel? Completely unacceptable. Overall it was a big waste of money, time, and effort. I would never recommend any August product to anyone.Cliff'sCons- No battery remaining indicator.- Requires additional Wi-Fi bridge for remote unlock.- No lithium battery rechargeable built-in (4 AA batteries)- Automatic unlock feature doesn't even work.- Cheaply constructed- Homekit isn't working anymore because they haven't updated their app for the past 3 months! To be compatible.ProsN/AFinal notesJust read the many reviews on Amazon. It's quicker to just pull out your keys and unlock the door. It's only a matter of time another company such as Nest makes a better product. Nest being owned by Google will have great application support. I would wait until a company who cares about its customers comes into the market. This is a second generation August Smart lock and they still can't get it right.
