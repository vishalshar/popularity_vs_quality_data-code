The edges around the face of the phone are too soft - the overall structure of the case is too weak and has allowed a slight "bend" to break the glass across the top 1/3 of the screen.  While not entire the fault of the phone (yeah, I dropped it, from about the height of 1.5 feet), the Rokform case I have for my iPhone 5s is far better designed.  With the increased flimsy design of the iPhone 6 is needs more and thicker plastic around the edge, not less.
