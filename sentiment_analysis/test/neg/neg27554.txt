Hardly used them. They were handy when I needed them and although they scratched easily they did the job until they snapped on two at bridge. You have to bend the bridge to put them in the sleeve and I guess the engineering department didn't do a fatigue test or even take them in and out twenty times. Or maybe I just was unlucky again!
