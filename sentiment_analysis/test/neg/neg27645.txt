My kids were so excited about this product. They ripped it opened and got to customizing right away. It's been 5 days and the "spray paint" that comes with it has dried but is still so sticky that they have no desire to use the headphones. This is not a super cheap product so I expected it to be higher quality than what it turned out to be. Now I'm out $70 and I'm left with two pair of sticky headphones that no one wants to use.
