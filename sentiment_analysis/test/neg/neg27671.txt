Not ready for prime time. Will not work if you do not broadcast your SSID. This device will not work with Amazon Echo without the Belkin App which requires quite a bit of personal information for example Device & app history, Identity, Contacts (?why?), location, phone number, Photos (why do they need your photos to run a light switch?) Camera and Device ID and call information. The app is a personal security nightmare!!!Belkin is asking you to give out all your personal information and take some of the security down on your wireless to run a lightswitch.
