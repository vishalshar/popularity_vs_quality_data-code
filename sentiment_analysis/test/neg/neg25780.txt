I haven't been so disappointed with a product in a long time.  The pairing process was a nightmare, they do not get nearly loud enough, the heartrate tracking is a joke, no one can hear me when I try and call them using them and they cut in and out constantly.  The worst part is these are huge and hurt my ears.  I can't get them to stay in my ears at all since they are so big.
