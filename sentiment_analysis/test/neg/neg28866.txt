I got this lock in May 2016. I had set up the lock to automatically unlock when I return home. It worked probably 95% of the time, and the rest i had to pull out my phone to open it in the app.In August 2016, the lock stopped working and was jammed. I could not even turn it by hand. I had to take it off and now my lock is naked from the inside. Very disappointed.
