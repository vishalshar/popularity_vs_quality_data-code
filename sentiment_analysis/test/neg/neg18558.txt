I was so excited about this item. Sadly the record player started skipping and scratching brand new albums on the 2nd day. Even adding weight to the needle didn't work and it would damage the albums over time if it did. Had to return and purchase a more modern looking Pyle that has been terrific. I just wish this one was better made as I love the look and features. They also charged me to return it. Huge downside as a prime member. Bad customer service in my opinion.
