My device would only charge some of the time, and the rest of the time, wouldn't turn on, so I was only able to use it very occasionally. The Scan feature in the app didn't work at all and some of the features advertised in the app never appeared in the interface. All in all, it was a broken device accompanied by a poorly thought out app. It's extremely disappointing that a device this expensive was shipped out without having checked that it actually works.
