Very Disappointed. I don't mind troubleshooting and working on something if once I get it set up it works. The first pair I got was defective and the left dash did not pair through to the right. So I returned them and received a second pair. The audio works but the microphone stopped working after about a week.I have contacted Bragi at least 6 times and they have not responded to a single message from my app or on their website. Haven't even let me know they received my messages. They are terrible and the frustration isn't worth the technology because the technology doesn't work!
