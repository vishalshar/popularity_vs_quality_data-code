For the first month this item failed to sync. Once it finally synced, it kept popping out of its holder until one day it fell out when I was walking. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until it was long gone. I believe the wristband is poorly designed and the design leads to its unreliability as a fitness tracker. How can you exercise when you are always worried about it falling out of its band?? I have had other fitness trackers (such as Garmin vivofit) that do not have the same problem.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. It is incredibly expensive for the lack of quality and defective technology it offers.
