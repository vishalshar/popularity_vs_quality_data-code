My experience with this fire starter wasn't as good as the videos I viewed.  Used a six-inch ferro rod that throws tons of sparks and it never lit.  It wasn't wet or even damp.  Only a Bic lighter would light it.  Not impressed.  Now I have seven more bags of this to try out.  If the other bags work better I'll update this review, but this stuff doesn't even come CLOSE to Vaseline & cotton balls.
