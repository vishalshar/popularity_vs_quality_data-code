I really wanted to like this headset.  As a tech nerd who was really looking forward to using it for both personal theater and drone flying, I'm sorry to say that it does both just...okay.  But not okay enough, and not good  good enough to justify the price, even at the newly discounted $549.  First, I should say that I have a very average sized head, with an average nose and average spaced eyes and all that.  My vision is good, and I don't wear glasses.  There are other reviewers who have said that they couldn't get the headset to fit comfortably, and while I didn't have that experience (it was comfortable enough), I couldn't get the lenses to focus close enough.  They would hit the stops before the entire image was perfectly sharp.  Also, the lateral lens adjustments could never get quite to the right spot where the center of the image had no crossover (lens artifacts in the middle) and where the corners of the image would remain in my field of view regardless where I looked.  If I focused on the left side of the image, the top and bottom corners of the right side would be hidden to one eye and black out.  So for watching a movie, it's just not good enough.  It seems that the geometry of the internal optics is just not quite right.  I seemed that I wanted to be able to bring the image closer, and all would have been well.  As drone goggles, they represent a new concept that I hope becomes a standard...the ability to see over and under the projected image at your surroundings.  This is INFINITELY better for flight operations, and for safety.  But the headphones are not needed for flying, and seal out too much ambient noise that I want to be able to hear.  Make a set of these without the earphones and I'll buy them.  The image issues I mentioned earlier matter less in this application.  As far as the sound quality of the headphones, that was really disappointing.  It's really just very...meh.  For as good as the video image is (really quite good, no pixelation or screendoor effect) the music sounds flat and "grey".  So with a certain amount of sadness I'm sending these back.  I'm rooting for this company, and I"m a fan.  I hope to be a customer again soon.
