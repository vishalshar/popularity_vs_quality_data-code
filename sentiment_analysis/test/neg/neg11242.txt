I bough whistles for my dogs because there wasn't really anything else that provided the range I needed. I figured that any tracker had to be better than nothing. I was wrong. The product stopped working and then Whistle support made the experience even worse by giving me the run-around for a few weeks to avoid replacement. I've decided to just give up and cancel service because my dogs have been unprotected for weeks anyways, but now it's like pulling teeth just to get them to cancel the service. I strongly recommend staying away from Whistle and wait for something that actually works.
