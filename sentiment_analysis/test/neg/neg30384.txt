After switching from an IPhone to an android Galaxy S4 and loving the user-friendly and customizable features of android I was heartbroken when the screen on my S4 cut out leaving me scrambling for a new phone. I decided that, like most mid-twenty white girls, I wanted the larger screen for my cell phone as well so that I too can take unnecessary mirror selfies and slay.I scoured Amazon for a few days comparing the under $100 android unlocked phones. Despite the desperate need to look fly, I'm ballin on a budget. Riding broke bitch status, ya feel me? Anyway. I read review after review of the Posh Titan HD 550 and all seemed positive. Watched unboxing videos and reviews on YouTube and decided to go with this phone. I was elated the day it arrived. Couldn't wait. Selfie time. BAM! watched me!After a few days of use I noticed the phone started to slow down. Touch screen response time was under-par and the camera was...frankly it was s*** and the beauty cam feature was comical at best. The phone boasts a 13mp camera but what is that when the display can't give justice to its own features? The video even lagged like a ghost trail of I was recording my daughter playing or even opening gifts on her bday.Battery life was the WORST of any smart phone I've ever owned. My phone stayed on the charger constantly. And if it died, you can forget it. An overnight charge was lucky to get you 70%. It did do this weird quick charge thing where it went from 5% to 100% in 10 minutes but then without warning it would die before I'd even get home and that was with the phone just on standby.Hated it. Only had it for 2 months. Would never recommend.
