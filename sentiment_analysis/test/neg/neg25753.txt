It gives me such great pleasure to write such a negative review of such a terrible, arrogant product.I rarely side with my wife on the hatred of technology (she's a technophobe, and I'm an early adopter of anything with a battery), but when I do, it's something that should be universally reviled. August Smart Lock deserves my wife's혰and my혰and your derision.I was the August Apologist. "You should make sure your Bluetooth settings are ..." ... "You should update the app, they just recently ..." ... "Are your location settings set to allow ..." ... "turn auto-lock off, then on again, then sign off, then sign ..." ... UGH what a waste of breath. Some trust-fund-baby venture capitalist and third tier engineer must have had a brain baby. Design: uninspired. Function: this thing works about 15% of the time (I've kept track), which is 1000% percent more irritating than it never working.If you want more details, read more reviews. I hate writing reviews. It's a waste of my time. Think of your favorite sandwich. I could be eating one of those sandwiches right now, but instead혰because this product angers me so much혰I had to write you this review. Do me a favor and set aside your dreams for home automation for long enough to vindicate the 200ish words I've written and wait for a August to be purchased by Google or (and this is my dream:) go out of business, because their product is useless.If you're like me, you're going to buy it anyway. Do it. Good luck. I'm returning this spawn of Silicon Satan and going to start counting every time I insert a key in my deadbolt and it just works. And shout-out to my wife for her patience.
