5 stars for "as advertised", 5 stars for "fit", 2 stars for durability.  The VERY FIRST drop of the filter broke it.  Getting them off the GoPro, they act spring-loaded.  The lanyard is not to keep it on the camera, it's to keep it from dropping when you are trying to get it off.  Very, very fragile.
