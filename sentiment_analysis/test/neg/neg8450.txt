Very mediocre. They come in one size and in order to make them tighter or looser you have to weave them different ways. Need reading glasses to fasten them. More complicated than it has to be. Description talks more about the founders and their life story (which I really couldn't care less about) than the product itself. 2 stars for the idea. My suggestion is to go with the Homar No Tie Shoelaces. Cheaper, simpler, easier to use. But, alas, without the glamorous founders story.
