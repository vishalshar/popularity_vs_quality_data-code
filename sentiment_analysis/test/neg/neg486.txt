I bought two batteries for smoke alarms.  The first one worked fine.  The second one did not.  I subsequently had to replace the battery with a normal battery, which worked fine.  I'm still receiving messages from this battery saying that it is going off or it has stopped going off, even though I have removed it from the smoke detector.
