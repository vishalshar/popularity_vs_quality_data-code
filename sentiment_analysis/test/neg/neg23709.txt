My husband used this cream for almost 2 yrs. and had excellent results.  Unfortunately, they recently changed the formula and not only does it not work as well, but he says the new formula burns his skin.  What a shame they had to change this product.....it had worked awesome for his psoriasis for so long.  Please Metaderm.....change it back to the old formula!!
