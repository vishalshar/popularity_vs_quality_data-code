Poor quality control. I received a used unit with a disc missing and it either doesn't come with a power supply or that was missing too. I considered requesting that the company supply the missing items, so I went to the website. I couldn't find any additional discs that were actually available now. This is basically a very expensive version of the little nightlights that can be plugged in the project stars, shapes, fish, etc. On the ceiling. It costs fifty bucks more to project words. Would be pretty cool if: 1. lots of inexpensive content was available, 2. they created a way for users to customize content either through a diy kit or inexpensive order, 3. the price matched the product...in this case you most certainly do not get what you pay for-should be fifteen max and that's because it has a digital clock. It is a lightbulb in a translucent plastic cup with a few discs you can set on the opening that allow light to shine through to project a small number of words. Sorry. Cool idea. Poor execution. I hate to rain on a parade, but I cannot see why anyone would keep this for the price.
