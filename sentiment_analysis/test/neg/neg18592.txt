Bought it for a gradual sunrise wake-up alarm, and it works perfectly for that purpose.  The packaging is very well done and the bulb feels quality made.  Easy to set up, and the app is very simple to use.  It is larger than a standard bulb, so may not fit some fixtures, which is the only reason I'm deducting 1 star.  I submitted an enhancement request to allow fading from one color to another, and received a prompt response that the feature is in beta test, so impressed with the support.  Overall highly recommended.Update:  Bulb worked fine for 2 weeks, then one day the auto turn off timer didn't turn it off.  Two days later the auto turn on timer didn't work, and it had lost wifi connectivity.  Went through all the troubleshooting steps, numerous times, and it won't connect to the network.  Just too unreliable and flaky to keep.
