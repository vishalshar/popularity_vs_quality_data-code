I thought.... why can't my toilet be a night light, so I hopped on line to see if someone already did it and to my delight, found someone had. Instant purchase. I totally wanted this product to do what I hoped it would. But I've already futzed with it for 20+ min and still no joy. I'm sending it back.ProsGreat ideaPerfect intensityUses standard batteriesIn theory, a good mounting schemeConsDespite playing around with their suggestions to reshape the suction cups with hot water, they held very poorly. Yes.. the surface I was applying them to was clean.The end of the cord opposite the LED is inadequately strain-relieved. It pulls open and will admit water.Given the attention paid to mounting in their support area, I suspect that mounting can be an issue for others beside me. I think I'd suggest a longer cord so you can do something behind the seat hinge without straining the cord. Just a suggestion (35 yr product designer). If the idea were implemented more usably, I'd have gone 4 stars.
