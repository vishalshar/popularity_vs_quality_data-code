I could never get it to connect to my Century Link router but I was always able to get my motion detectors (DCH-S150) to link with no problems.  when I check my router it says 'Timed out' on connection via WPS whereas all my motion detectors say 'connected' and stay connected very well.  but this thing seems to be from a different planet than DLink motion sensors as it will not connect via WPS period.
