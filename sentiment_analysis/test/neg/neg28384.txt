This is a disappointing product.  The unit is literally a plastic that you put a ball in and it has 1 of three holes the ball SLOWLY rolls out of.  The fist attempt to use it my dog looked at me and walked away from the unit....  Again, the ball very slowly rolls about 18-24 inches away.  I will return this item.
