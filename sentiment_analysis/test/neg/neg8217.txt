Good idea, but poorly executed. This scale is intended for BarB Q, an intrinsically outdoor application. BUT it is not to be allowed to get moisture.(I didn't get it wet, but it still works only intermittently.)  It needs a flat hard surface to sit on, which you may not have inside your typical back yard cabinet BarBQ. It raises the height of the bottle a couple of inches which may cause you clearance issues also -- as it did in my CharBroil commercial unit. I only used it a few hours before finding it was not going to work, so I can't comment on its accuracy.In short, good idea. But not suitable for its intended use.  For the money, you're better off buying an extra tank and having it on hand for when your tank goes dry.
