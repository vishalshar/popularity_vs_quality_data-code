With so many good reviews, I had much anticipation about this "phablet".  However, we received one that had a defective microphone and didn't read the Straight Talk Sim card (initially it would read it in the second sim position, and then in neither sim slot. We called POSH a couple of times for assistance.  The first time we were transferred to a voice mail.  The second time, the technician was busy helping a couple of us, on the phone, at the same time and asked to call us back.  Frustrated, we decided to return the phone to Amazon for an exchange, but Amazon had a glitch with this option and we had to call Amazon Customer Service and got a refund, instead.  We are thinking of re-ordering and trying again, but for this order--FAIL!
