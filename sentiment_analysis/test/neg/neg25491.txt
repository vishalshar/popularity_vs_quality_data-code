2.5 stars - It's okay, but I don't like itBroke down and bought the Cuff, expecting it to be delivered on October 1st.  I'd already bought an Artemis (Indigogo which failed to come to the market) and a First Sign (which shut down without notice but was the best one since it called 911, had an assault/fall feature, had a loud siren, a "silence" feature so that you could "fake" shut it off even though the alert was still active) and that device was supposed to work with V.ALRT but the app won't work on my phone (two days with tech support and they can't figure it out because it should work on a Galaxy S4).  So, I desperately bought a Cuff. (And now I see there is another Indigogo product called Athena/ROAR that's supposed to come out next year...I can only hope it's better.)Well, I finally got it last week and I'm underwhelmed. I got it to work quite easily right out of the box.  It stays connected just about as good as anything Bluetooth (comparing to my headset).  I am not pleased that my emergency contacts also have to download the Cuff app to find out where I am and to help.  I hate it when companies force stuff like this, but I could live with it if the thing works when I need it (I'm a Real Estate Agent)The problem?  It falls off easily and I don't even notice when it happens.  Just today I looked inside my handbag and there it was - must've "scraped" off my wrist when I had my handbag hanging off my arm. I can't believe I haven't lost this thing yet because I keep finding it inside my gym bag or handbag or next to my bed  or in the laundry hamper or on the floor of my car.  The wrist strap is just too soft and flexible and doesn't lock down securely enough.  I've even taken to wearing it tighter than I normally wear my watch, but it still keeps falling off.I'm also concerned what's going to happen when the battery dies since there is no way to charge it.  Hoping something better comes out by then.
