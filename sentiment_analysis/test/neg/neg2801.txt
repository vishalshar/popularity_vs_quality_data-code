The eraser function on my Pencil didn't work. When I visited technical support on the fifty-three site, I discovered that this was an all too common flaw. Worse, after a half-hour of pointless troubleshooting with a staff member there I was informed that my warranty was null because I purchased through Amazon. Lovely.A few other comments: The weight of the stylus feels good in the hand, as does the Walnut material. The writing tip, however, is squishy and often loses capacitive contact, leaving broken lines in the app. Not worth the hassle, and definitely not worth $100.
