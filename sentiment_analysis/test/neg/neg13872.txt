I bought this board thinking it had potential to be a great asset to my productivity. My number one problem with it is that it wouldn't stick to the wall for a long period of time.I live on a tropical island which has a really humid climate. Therefore, I was severely disappointed when after just a month of using the board, it fell off the wall. Furthermore when it fell off the wall, the board stuck to itself and in the process of trying to unstick itself, it was easily ripped and wrinkled. I was quite frustrated.If it lasted a year, I would of gave the product 5 stars because it was everything they advertise it to be and was wonderful for the month it lasted on my wall.I really wish it stayed on the wall longer, but I'm not going to spend $30 to buy another one again if its going to fall off.
