I was initially disappointed, but the Thync customer support respond to my comment below and provided a tip. The tip worked and I was able to check it out. I could not tell if it made much of a difference, but I will continue to experiment with it. I will raise my rating to two stars now.JAN16:It pretty disappointing that I had to shell out $199.00 only to find out this the app does not sync with the device. It did not matter how many times,  I retried the Bluetooth sync, it did not work. And their website hardly has anything useful to say. And their entire device is dependent on an app and Bluetooth technology they could not get to work with iphone6. Very disappointed.
