We have had to have the first unit replaced because it would not power back up. Yesterday our pet was lost and the tracker would not find it consistently. Our dog was gone for 2 hours. Then this morning I could not get the unit to power up. If you have a reliable cell network it would be OK. We live in the country and have no coverage in some areas of the woods. I am returning this unit and buying another brand that does not rely on the cellular network.
