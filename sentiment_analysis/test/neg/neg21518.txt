This gave me a terrible underarm rash that lasted nearly a year, even after I stopped using it. Baking soda IS NOT for everyone. It created such a sensitivity that I couldn't wear any deodorant for months. Even I used anything at all, the rash would come back in full force. I think it is a good product, but it can be way too harsh for some people.
