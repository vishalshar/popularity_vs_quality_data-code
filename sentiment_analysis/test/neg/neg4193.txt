If I could, I'd rate this 2.5 stars.Performance: the drone does everything it says it will do. It's very easy to fly, I consistently get 3 to 4 minutes flight time with a charge time of 20 minutes. The app and camera work just fine.Quality: The plastic clips that hold the drone (top and bottom) together are weak. Be careful of those or utilize the included guard. It won't prevent them from cracking but it will help. Also, be careful of the controller. It is very weak were the lid clips in.Value: Overall the drone is good and enjoyable, however, there are many equivalent drones for half the price. I know because I've flown them and tested them. Many of my coworkers and friends now have these little drones and they all paid half the cost of this one while not missing out on features or quality. That's what I would recommend. I would also grab some extra propellers. You can find a pack on Amazon here for less than $2.
