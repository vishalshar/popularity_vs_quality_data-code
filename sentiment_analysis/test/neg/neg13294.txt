**UPDATE** The ball and socket joint broke after a year. I am VERY gentle with my electronics and accessories, so I don't feel that 1 year is an acceptable lifespan for a product like this, especially when there are so many other options out there. I contacted the seller over two weeks ago and never received a response. Based on this I would not recommend this product. There are other options out there. ***I purchased this product to use for my HTC Evo in my Hyundai Santa Fe. The mount is extremely easy to install and holds very securely. When tightened, it holds the phone securely in place and I probably have one of the heaviest phones out there. My phone is heavier because I have an aftermarket extended battery on it and that leads to a minor problem. Since the extended battery adds a half inch or so of depth my phone, it is BARELY able to fit in the mount. While it hasn't fallen out (and hopefully won't) I would feel more comfortable if the mount was able to accommodate a bit thicker of a phone.The only other minor issues I have are that the location of the "bottom" part of the mount obscures the charging port which is on the bottom of the Evo, and the screw device which tightens the mount into the CD slot is pretty conspicuous and obscures the radio screen in my vehicle.Overall, it's a great product and anyone without my particular phone in my particular vehicle may not even have a problem with the minor issues I mentioned. Regardless, the positives of being able to use my phone like a GPS and touch screen radio in the car far outweigh any other considerations. Highly recommended.
