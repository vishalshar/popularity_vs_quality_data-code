This drone is incredibly easy to fly. I love setting way points and it'll fly it's self to the location. It's very stable and was flying within minutes. The camera quality is great and makes great videos. Reason for 4 stars is because no where on their website does it mention that you cannot live  video feed straight to your phone. I had to call to get this info and find out that I have to buy an additional monitor to live view the camera. How am I even suppose to know what the camera is on with out seeing? In hindsight what both cost I might be returning it for a DJI  phantom. Other thing is it list fly time 23 minutes, I haven't gotten more than 12-15 minutes of fly time. The warranty is hard to beat though and the automated fly controls are amazing and very easy compared to joy sick controls.Update 7-30-16So I went on a camping trip this weekend and I brought my drone along to try out. This is about my 5th time flying it and had no problems until now. I use it last night and charged my battery today to use it again. I charged it for couple hours in my camper and the battery said 100%. I took off with it and flew for only 5 minutes and the app alerted me of battery low, but the gauge on the phone app said 55%. It automatically flew the done back and while it was self landing the drone went haywire and spun out and crashed straight to the ground. First off from the day I got it (3 days ago) I got at the most 13 minutes of flight  (not 23 minutes as advertised) and now it apparently didn't gold a charge and the gauge on the phone app said 55% but the voice said battery low. This is very disappointing that the battery seems to be defective and caused the crash. The drone mostly survived but the camera was broken off. Unfortunately I'm dropping the rating to 2 stars, it's a great machine but unfortunately I received one with something faulty between either the battery, charger or drone is self.  I'll be returning.
