I really wanted to love this jamstik. Unfortunately, the actual product left me wondering how these glowing reviews were generated. It has a tinny, artificial sound that does not lend itself well to actual music generation. It sounds like what it is, a child's toy, not a real guitar. It cannot be made to sound like an acoustic or electric guitar, so all these reviews saying people are using them to actually play music just baffle me. And the much vaunted ability to work with apps to actually teach guitar is just false. They don't work together. At all. You can play the jamstik or use the app, but not both.The jamstik does deliver on one basic promise: you can use an Iphone and headphones to play sliently. And yes, it will generate guitar-like noises in your headphones. So if you need a silent guitar that you can use to practice in a very confined space like riding in an airplane or in an army barracks, this thing would be useful. Just get some sheet music and practice away without bothering anyone.I suspect the makers of this Midi device are using the Christmas sales as a funding round to try to work on improvements to it. With better sound quality and the ability to actually work with apps as advertised, this would be amazing. So maybe version 2.0 will be amazing. But in the meantime, don't believe the hype. (By the way, I read companies can purchase positive reviews now like anything else. So buyer beware.)
