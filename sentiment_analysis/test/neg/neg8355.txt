I really tried to like this. I love the withings scale and their app. This product seemed like a simple way to track sleep and get a better count of activity including swimming.* the go would not stay in the same position in the wrist band effectively making the watch function worthless* it completely botched the overall time by a significant amount 4 out of 5 swims* it failed to track my entire nights sleep mistaking visits to the bath as waking up. So each night it claimed I only slept a couple hours.* finally, it stopped syncing with my phone and now refuses to be added back to the app.I guess I'll just wait for my Apple Watch.
