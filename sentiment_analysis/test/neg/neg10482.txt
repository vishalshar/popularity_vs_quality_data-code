great device.  I have a large Jambox and it does not compare to the Riva!Revised: within the month I had issues as it was not working properly.  I filed a warranty claim with Riva.  They rejected it as they said my purchase via Amazon was not with an "authorized dealer" and they would not honor warranty.  I had to file a claim and get a refund.  suggest you purchase elsewhere and from an authorized dealer.
