This is terrible. I got one and after wearing it for a week I needed to charge it, which is as expected. And after I charged it it would no longer sync. I troubleshooted with customer service and all they could do was have me send it back and send me a new one. I got the new one was excited and then the exact same thing happened! After charging it. And not over charging it either. It stopped syncing. I troubleshooted again and it still won't work. I am returning it and asking for a full refund. Very disappointed.
