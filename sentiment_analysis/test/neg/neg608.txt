I was really interested to try this and found it as a sponsored product on amazon. I found it to have too much protein in too small of a servicing. There was a distinctive after tasted that lasted for awhile, tasted like sunscreen mixed with vanilla. I feel like if they went with less protein it would be more smooth. Found the protein to be chunky and chalky. The material of the label were cheap and there was a ton of glue protruding from each bottle. I thought for the price I'd be getting a better product. Interested in trying the other flavor if I see them in the store but tropical was not for me.
