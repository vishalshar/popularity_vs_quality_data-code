My husband and I tried to connect this imager to 3 different Android phones (all with 4.4 OS) and it wouldn't work with any of them.  We even tried using other third party apps, to no avail.  It seems this is only compatible with specific $400+ phones, as that is what they have listed on the inside of the box AFTER you purchase it.  We had to return it.
