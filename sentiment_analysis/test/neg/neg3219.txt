This product is a complete piece of crap!!  I received this unit on 1/10/15, I am writing this on 1/11/15, 1 day after the return date.  I used the gun safe to store my gun as well as prescription medications.  Late last night in need of getting into the safe to obtain a medication that was needed immediately, the safe failed to open with the fingerprint sensor (which hardly ever worked until 30-40 attempts) and the RFID wristband.  Neither method would open the box, the locking mechanism would grind and then nothing.  Since there was a need to get the medication immediately, I did not have time to search the internet to find out how to get the box open manually, so I broke into it with a screwdriver, which was extremely easy to do, however the box of crap is now damaged.  The last thing I was thinking last night was to check when I purchased the unit, and now since I am 1 day outside of the return date I am left with an expensive door stop.  I would not recommend this product to anyone due to the quality of the merchandise as well as how ineffective it is in actually protecting the contents.  This product is a JOKE, I would give it zero stars if it was an option!!!!
