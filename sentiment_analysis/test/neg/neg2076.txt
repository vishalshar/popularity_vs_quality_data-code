I installed this replacement screen on my iPhone yesterday,everything works fine except for my proximity sensor so now I mute phone calls with my cheek all day long and also there's a slight lip as if this screen is 1mm too thick.Do not waste your money you can get them same knockoff screen off of eBay for $70.All they did was put that product in better packaging and double the price.
