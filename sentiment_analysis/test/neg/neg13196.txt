Maybe I am doing something wrong.  It took my dog a couple of days to use the Loo.  I know he used it, but when I went to empty the pan (2 days later) the tray was dry.  What did I do wrong?  Also, he continued to poop on the floor. I removed the loo.  If anyone has any suggestions please let me know.
