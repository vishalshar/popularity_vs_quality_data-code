My first Amazon review.  Not impressed with this product.  I want to start out by saying that I am okay with the limitations of the device itself with regard to distance.  I understand this is a technology limitation and the product is still potentially useful at this short distance.My main complaint is with the mobile application for this product.  As a software developer / designer, I am in disbelief at the poor design and lack of functionality of this application.  I will provide my feedback below.  I hope someone at TrackR is listening.- Because of technology limitations, the distance gauge is inaccurate and there is no sense of direction at all.  As far as distance goes, you can hold the device right next to your phone and it will still show it as near by but not close.  I think you guys need to accept that the distance gauge is not helpful, and potentially misleading.  This should change into a "vicinity" scale.  Either connected or not connected.  Or have at most three settings: "close", "near", "disconnected".- I had difficulty understanding what the main page was supposed to be.  What I really wanted is a simple page that listed all my devices, and clearly indicated which were connected and which were not .. is that so hard?  There is a menu where you can select your device that shows all devices but this doesn't have any other functionality.- My main page shows the selected device, a map, and an icon that shows it is searching for the device.  This is useless.  Let's start by saying that when my device was connected it showed up in the ocean outside of Africa.  This is incredibly stupid.  If it can't find the device, why not show the last location and a color indicator showing disconnected.  The global scale is particularly stupid.  Why am I seeing a view of the planet?  Default scale should be more local.  Also, I don't want to see the map as the default view as indicated above.- Searching.  This part really annoys me because it is an indication that the designers of this product don't really understand how their product will be used.  Let's say I lose my camera.  I might have misplaced it.  Someone might have taken it.  The app cannot show me precise location, and the chances are that its going to be disconnected if it is more than 100 ft away.  Why are you forcing me to look at the app to see if it is connected, and distance to device, especially because distance is not accurate.  Connected/disconnected indicators are not visually distinct  If I am looking for my lost camera, I am going to want to be looking for my camera in the real world, not staring at my phone.  Having a proximity indicator alert on the phone when it connects would be far more useful.  I want to be able to click an button setting up the proximity alert, then go about searching for the device and wait till I hear my phone ring indicating it is connected -- without alerting the person who stole my camera.  Then I can control when the device rings.  That last part is supported by the application.Cool idea but completely failed on the implementation of the application.  I hope someone over there gets a clue and redesigns the app.
