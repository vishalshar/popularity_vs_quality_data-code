I think I would have been very pleased with these socks if they were not sized for monster feet.  I wear a size 8.5 wide, and normally buy medium socks.  These were easily three inches too long and came halfway up my calf.  If the product listing had simply provided a sizing chart, I could have avoided this irritating mistake.
