I'll start this review off with saying if you don't like this product Amazon allows easy returns and if you buy it from Kuna they have a no questions asked 60 day return policy. No messing around. They credit you with no hassle. Maybe my bad experience with the mounting and function of the product will not happen to you. They have some cool features and their pricing is much better than Ring's products. Despite all of my issues below I'm still using one unit because I have not found another product that fits my needs.Issues:First issue is installation. I had trouble mounting the first set with single gang boxes that were horizontal behind a brick wall. They assume you have a hexagon box that you can make a cross with the bracket. This means I had to overlap the brackets horizontally and cut the screws because they were too long banging into the bracket. There was a tiny gap between the wall and the fixture but it was easily caulked.I could not mount the lights on siding mounts. It will not work on the kind that my house has, the kind that stands off the house. No matter how I tried to modify the brackets there was a big gap between the house and light. I returned the remaining lights.Here are the functional issues:Detection-The lights are not designed to detect people more than 10 feet away from unit. It misses anyone not actually on my porch. It is not good as a security camera as it misses everything else going on around your property.  It does have a vehicle detection feature that works. Problem is it sees cars passing the house 60 feet away. That is annoying. You can set a detection area to avoid this issue...but it's broke. It sees cars that it should not, but can't see people 11 ft. away. This is all after they put me on an experimental detection algorithm because it would miss people in front of the camera intermittently with the stock settings.Live View-I have an issue where the screen often grays out for a few seconds. This does not show up in the recording. I have enterprise network gear and a 50/50 Mbps Fios connection. New gear was brought in from another vendor to try and troubleshoot the issue. The issue is not here. I cannot say that there is not an issue between AWS(the storage and server are cloud based) and Fios. We have not been able to solve this so I can't say Kuna is the one to blame. I tried a Ring Pro and had some issues (they use AWS also).Audio- If you need to speak to a visitor it is only half duplex. Only one person can talk at a time. If I speak to a person at the door, when I stop talking there is a delay before I hear them. That means I miss their first couple of words. Also the recording does not capture what I am saying, only what I hear the visitor saying. There is silence in the recording when I speak. I will say that the outside audio is loud. I tried a Ring Pro and visitors could not hear me. Not the case here. Also it has a cool siren that you can sound when sales people refuse to leave on the first request.Companion Light- If you get a power outage the annoying bright blue LED comes on. You have to fish around the reset hole with a paper clip to reset it.Night Recording-I don't like the lack of IR's. The light coming on does the job, just don't use too bright of a bulb or it will wash out the video.Recording-It works. Not 30fps(25 maybe) but it does work well and I can call up the recording quickly. There was one mishap when I power cycled the unit. We saw someone elses camera on our phones and could control it. Kuna indicated the issue was fixed and it has not reoccurred.Tech Support- Ill say that they are very nice. The bad is that its via email and responses are slow. My average response times  ranged from 12 hours to two days. They often answered 1 or 2 questions at a time skipping over other questions, causing me to ask them again.I sent numerous pictures and numerous emails in an effort to work out the problem. I want to love this product. I really tried. Its a great concept that stumbles on execution. They must have happy customers out there.  This is my experience and YMMV. Like I said there is a no hassle return policy. Im just waiting until a 2.0 product arrives before I purchase anything else. Everything else they say about the product is true and works but those features did not offset the problems I had causing me to return a majority of the equipment. I did not review much of the positive because of this.
