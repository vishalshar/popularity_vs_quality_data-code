I watched many different YouTube videos about The Brush Guard, but they really aren't that great. I have a whole set of MAC brushes that I use everyday. I spot clean them and deep clean them every weekend, but they just won't dry sitting in these things. I don't wear much makeup on the weekends so it's fine that they aren't dry then, but Monday morning when I wake up and can't use them because they are damp is very disappointing. The only nice thing about them is they help keep the brushes shape.
