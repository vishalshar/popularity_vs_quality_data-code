Taste and size aren't great. I recommend the "TRANSCEND 15g Glucose Gels" more highly. These Glukos things are bigger for the same sugar/carbs (less convenient) and a lot less tasty. The Transcend gels taste like strawberry jam. These taste like artificial juice, with a watery consistency.I'm a type 1 diabetic, so I use these for low blood sugars. I haven't really timed how long these take before they take effect, and I don't trust my subjective experience. Low blood sugars feel like they're taking forever regardless. With that said, these seem to take effect fast, as you'd expect.These aren't awful. There are just better options.
