I bought this once, followed the instructions to install, however it was simply too hard to install. It took too long and can easily tear or wrinkly up. They were nice enough to send a replacement. I did a much better job installing it the second time, however after a few days it fell off the wall itself.The small calendar version of this is way better. Super easy to install and apply to the wall. That one gave me no issues.
