Is it called clean bottle because it cleans whatever surface you put it on? Came back to my desk to find it covered in water. The bottom cap has a tendency to leak badly. You don't always notice it right away but I think it happens if you squeeze the bottle while drinking. This somehow causes the bottom cap to loosen up releasing a stream of water. Guess I'll stick with a good ol' fashioned water bottle brush.
