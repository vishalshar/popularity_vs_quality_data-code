I was looking to buy a mint plant since I drink a lot of water with lemon/lime/mint as flavor.  I came across this set on Amazon and ordered it knowing that my hubby (the chef in the house) could always make use of the other herbs.The kit is awesome (cute) and after watching the video, very easy to set-up - especially for non-gardeners like me.Now three weeks later, we have the basil, cilantro, and parsley growing like wildfire.  But NO mint.  NO mint sprouts, just dirt.  So disappointing.I'm pretty sure we won't be getting any mint from this kit - so now I'm on the hunt for some mint seeds.  *sigh*
