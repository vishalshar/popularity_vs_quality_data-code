have a new yorkie puppy and was looking for alternatives to expensive puppy pads.  researched this product on-line on several sites and read great reviews for it so decided it was worth the money.  found best price at amazon so placed our order. we have had the product for a few weeks only and have been very disappointed.  our puppy had no issues using once we got him used to it and we thought it would be great but then we began to notice a bad smell coming from the grass.  despite cleaning the grass daily per the instructions provided, the odor did not go away.  more problematic was the fact that when we gave the grass a thorough weekly cleaning, as instructed, the underside began to completely disintegrate and the grass began to unravel.  the product claims the grass should not need to be replaced EVER but after a month, we couldn't use it anymore.  even though we bought an extra grass so we would have one to use while we cleaned the other, both have had the same problems.  now we are back to the puppy pads and hoping to find more economical and eco-friendly alternative!did want to say that despite being extremely disappointed with pet loo product, we were VERY satisfied with customer service from Amazon.  they responded to our issues very quickly and were happy to refund our money so we don't feel like we lost out too much.  have been an amazon shopper for several years and have always been happy, now even more so!
