Glass cups are a great alternative to BPA-laden plastic; however, this product is just not practical for toddlers. My 3-year-old had his for 10 days before he bumped it off our kitchen table while eating. I really thought the cup would be durable enough to withstand a 3 foot fall. Unfortunately, the cup shattered and the broken glass tore a hole in the silicone top, so, I couldn't even use that on another glass if I wanted. Very disappointed : (
