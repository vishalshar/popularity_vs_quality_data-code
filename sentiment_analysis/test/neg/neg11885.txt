I gave this card to a friend for his birthday yesterday. I filmed the whole thing, waiting to see his confusion (and potential rage?) build. The music from the card lasted less than 2 minutes. By the time he had moved on to the next present, it was done. We pushed the button again, curious, and this time it stopped after several seconds. The card is advertised as lasting 3+ hours. For over $10, the 2 minutes we got from it was not worth it. Definitely would not buy this again.
