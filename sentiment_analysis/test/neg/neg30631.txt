When the remote arrived it would not work.  However, I was able to setup the hub with my smart phone and it works from the phone.  For my application that is not a viable way to run my system.  I just spent  76 minutes on the phone with a nice gal from tech support.  Apparently the problem is that the touch screen does not respond to touch.  However, we spent all that time doing various resets/restorations/reloading firmware, etc. all without fixing the issue.  Finally it was decided to replace the remote using the following process.  They will MAIL me a shipping label.  When I get the label I will use it to send the bad remote back.  WHEN they get it they will then, some time in the future, send me the replacement.  I'm seriously thinking that I will just return the whole package and start over.
