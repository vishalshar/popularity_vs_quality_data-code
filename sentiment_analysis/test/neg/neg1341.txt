I very rarely every do a review.  However, I feel this product deserves a review so hopefully others won't make the same mistake I did.First off, I REALLY want to like this product.  I like the design, and I like the functionality.  However, the product I received as well as the support has killed any hope I have for this product.When I first bought it the battery died within two weeks.  I contacted support, and they sent me some new batteries.  That was good service.  I was hoping that i just had a bad battery.  Well, two months later, the battery was dead again.  Real problem was, I only found out that the battery was dead when I needed to use the device to locate my keys.  I had been told that a battery monitor was coming to the app, but I hadn't seen it yet.SO, I put in ANOTHER battery.  THis made two battery changes in less than 3 months for a device that was supposed to last "up to a year" on a battery.  Then, I tried pushing the button on the device to ring my phone.  It would not ring.  I tried rebooting the phone, and still nothing.I contacted support again to let them know that I was still seeing unacceptable battery life and now the call button on the device would not work.  I waited for over a month and no response from them.  Then I got an email saying they were closing my case cause they figured it had been handled already. IT HAD NOT.  I hadn't even gotten an email from them.Then, I got an email with a survey asking me how satisfied I was with support.  I figured if I told them my experience I would surely get an email or contact about the poor customer service.  Nope.  Nothing.  Its been weeks since I sent in the survey and not a word.  I feel very abandoned with this product and like I wasted my money.  So, my advice is to not waste your money on this device either.
