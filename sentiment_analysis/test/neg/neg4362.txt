Unfortunately this device uses data at about 5 times the normal rate.  I burned through a Vodafone 15 gig plan in 4 days.  I used my iPhone normally like I do at home and I never use that much data.  It doesn't really matter if the device works (which it does) if it burns through your data plan costing you more $$$.
