I bought 4 of these and filled them up with hot tap water before using them just to flush out any manufacturing residue. I placed them in my sink and a few hours later they were all empty. thinking maybe i hadn't tightened the bottoms sufficiently, I made sure all the bottoms were secure, and my wife and I each took two on a 50 mile bike ride. They all still leaked at the bottom seam. Not quite as much, but I would prefer they didn't leak at all, especially if I start filling them with sticky sports drinks rather than just water. The tags attached to each bottle have an email for David, the company founder, who says he guarantees the bottles for life. I emailed him to let him know I'm not too pleased. We'll see what he has to say about that.
