Outstanding idea, but if your iPhone has a case, the flat, non-recessed connector won't engage the Lightning connector all the way into your phone.  Therefore, it doesn't charge, wobbles and falls off almost immediately.The case on my phone is a slimline case too, but no luck.  Rather disappointing.  You'll notice in the photo that I attached the gap between the connector and my case.I'm going to take my Dremel tool to it to see if I can grind down the flat area around the connector so that I can actually use it.
