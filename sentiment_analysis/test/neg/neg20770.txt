The concept is great but the execution stinks.  This is very unreliable.  You will find 85% of the time, when you actually need to find your keys, your phone will not find the device/connect.  The construction is very cheap and can tell it will not withstand a lot of use on your key chain.I do NOT recommend buying this product, i would like towards some of the other name brands.The main reason is you will not get support.  I placed request tickets with TrackR and got back an email saying they were experiencing higher than normal requests and would get back to me as soon as possible.  Well its been several weeks and nothing.  I tried again and have gotten no response.The issue i have with my device is after replacing the batteries with a fresh set, the device does not seem to work any longer.  Their documentation states that the battery will last roughly 1 year.  I tried another set of batteries and nothing.  The device will not turn on or connect to the phone.Please dont waste your money on this.
