I am getting so frustrated with technology stuff that doesnt work and poor communication and this ZUS car-finder is a good example.1. The instructions are printed in tiny, tiny, tiny print, difficult even with the necessary magnifying glass.  But, brief as they are, they are printed in 10 languages in light grey text on the pure white paper.  Its impossible to imagine someone reviewing the draft of this document not saying, gee, the print is kind a small2. Nowhere in the information that came with it nor in the information on the ads/promotions does it say it will not work fully with phones that dont have compass . . . how many of you know for sure if your phone has a compass (my new Moto G4 does not).3.  When I went to the website, the password, working on my phone, did not work on the website so I had to spend time figuring out that it wouldnt work completely (only the map not the arrow finder) with my phone, nor could I ask them if there was a work-around.It works with my wifes more expensive phone but there is not excuse for making life so difficult for customers, none.
