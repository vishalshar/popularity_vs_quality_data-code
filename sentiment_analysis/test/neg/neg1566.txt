First off, I want to say that this is my 2nd Mighty Mug. I never had any problems with the first one until I dropped it and now it leaks out of the lid. It was my own fault and I couldn't buy a replacement lid because it is several years old and the new lids don't fit.And while this one technically works, the bottom part of it keeps coming off if it twists the wrong way. I don't know if this is a new "design feature" but it's only a matter of time before the thing gets lost. I was considering buying more as Christmas gifts but I probably won't now.
