I was so excited to find this healthy snack, but was very disappointed.  The skin of the apple is very thick and hard to chew, not to mention the core and the stem are also included in the package.  There are even dirt around the apple stem, how could they not even try to clean the apple before processing them.  Wish I could return these.
