Pebble went out of business before I could give it to my wife for a christmas present. Product not as described, especially if it claims to work and have support and it doesnt before christmas.  I was a long time supporter of pebble and for them to fail to strike a support deal with FitBit is an ethical failure , especially when still selling the watches to people claiming support, warranty, etc...knowing very well they were going to sell, and then on Dec 7th 2016 telling everyone they sold  to FitBit and that they wouldnt support or accept returns. They still would take orders though a week before! They knew very well they were selling. I will be cautious now on companies that havent been around longer than 10 years.
