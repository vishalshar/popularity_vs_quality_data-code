This device and company are both unfit for retail service. The recon jet requires an initial update to activate (poor choice) or else it will not work. After downloading the software and setting up an account, the program went through the motions of upgrading before I got an error telling me to restart the device. I tried it again, same thing. I tried it on a different computer, same thing. I tried it on both a windows machine and a mac, same thing.I sent an email to customer support, but got a stock "reinstall the software" answer which was of no help. I tried calling the listed phone number four separate times, but no one was available. I am now sending the product back.The customer support is ridiculous, the hardware I received doesn't function, and requiring an update to even activate and use the product is abusive. Save your time and money, don't bother with this defective product.
