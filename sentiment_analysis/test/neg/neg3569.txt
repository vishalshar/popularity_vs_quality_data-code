I pre-ordered this way back in march, and it showed up much later than I had expected. Initially I wanted to compare it to eero, which I've installed and used at two different locations. Then I wanted to see if it could replace my existing DLINK router that I've been using at home.I'm sorry to say that the wait was NOT worth it. The setup process of the Luma is very straightforward, but incredibly basic. The pucks themselves don't offer great range, and the mesh network is pretty terrible. Speeds are middling (my old DLINK was significantly faster at range), and the range of each puck is garbage. I run a set of 8 wifi cameras throughout the house which my DLINK had absolutely no problem covering. After switching over to Luma, all of them have intermittent connection issues.My laptop has a terrible time moving between levels of my house. It's not a particularly large home, and my old router handled it without many problems. The Luma's range performance really falls short. Devices (smart phones, cameras, laptops, etc.) don't have a problem connecting, but depending on which one it connects to, speeds are atrocious to just ok.The worst part of all of this is that the super dumbed down interface makes it impossible for me to actually troubleshoot or fix the problem. At least with the eero, which is pretty basic as well, it would have some wizards to describe range problems. The Luma provides pretty much nothing. I can't even see what the public IP address of the unit is. I mean, come on!Anyway, I cannot emphasize how disappointed I am with this produce. They just announced COLORED versions of the pucks. So instead of upgrading the software or figuring out how to increase performance, they decided to print it on different colored plastics. What a load of crock. If I could return it, I would. Instead, I'll probably go buy another eero set.
