I bought this to teach a short electronics tutorial for a group of young makers. It worked fine for a couple example circuit that used about 15 inches of line drawn by the pen, total. After that, the ink stopped conducting. It was really disappointing. I've asked for a replacement, but I'm not real optimistic.
