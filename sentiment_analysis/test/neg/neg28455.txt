I tested this bad boy out hiking in the Grand Canyon for 3 days.  Needless to say I think I would have been better off tying my gopro to my backpack with the same amount of money and I would've been better off.  This mount was heavier than I expected, but I didn't really feel the weight on my backpack strap, to be honest.  This mount is also only good for specific backpack straps.  For instance, I had to use a backpack with very thin straps for the mount because my other backpack had padding on its straps, which was too thick for the mount.  My biggest complaint with this mount is that it is extremely uncomfortable to wear after a couple hours of use.  I actually didn't even wear it for one of the days hiking because it hurt my shoulder so much.  Also, the compartment that dislodges from the mount is very stiff and almost impossible to take out when it is mounted on the backpack.  Because of this, I had to unscrew my gopro from the mount when I wanted to take it out instead, which was very annoying.  A mount like this is a great idea, however I just think that there are better ones out there for your backpack.
