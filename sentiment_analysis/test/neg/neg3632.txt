I have waited a while to write this review because I just kept hoping I would love this pitcher. When we moved, we tossed out our Brita, and I wanted something that not only looked good but gave us great tasting water -What is good about this pitcher: it looks nice & good customer service.What is bad: while the design of the pitcher is very visually pleasing, it fails to function at its single most basic function - pouring water! If you like wiping up wet surfaces, then this is the product for you. Not only does it fail to pour, but the magnetic 'fill door' at the top works 50% of the time.I'm overall very disappointed with this purchase (which I spent a lot of time researching). It just goes to show that flashy marketing really can make you believe you are buying a good product.Note: when I first had issues with pouring, they sent me a new top and insert - they claimed that the hinges of the spout can become frozen in the refrigerator...even with the new lid, we've never had success, even when we pour after it has just been sitting on the counter.
