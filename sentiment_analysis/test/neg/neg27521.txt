I gave this two stars rather than one, because I would say it's better than NOTHING, but having tried a couple other products for concealing hair loss, I did not like this one at all. What it doesn't say is that it actually makes your hair look dull, and dirty. The "fibers" are more like dust or something.  You could pour cinnamon on your head, pat it down, and accomplish the same thing. And BONUS: smell like baked cookies at the same time. I don't recommend it for those with hair who are trying to fill in; if you have large areas of no hair it might work better.
