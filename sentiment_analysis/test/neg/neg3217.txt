Very disappointed with the finger print technology. Rarely works. Opens up with the wrist band right away. However I purchased this safe for ease of use and to keep my gun away from my children. Having an accessible wristband is the same as having a key laying around. The finger print only opens once in awhile after numerous tries. I have no faith using my fingerprint if I need to access this safe quickly.  Look into alternate finger print safes or just save your money and buy a safe with a pin pad code or key.
