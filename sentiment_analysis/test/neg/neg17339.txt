I have a iPhone 6.  Had it in my case and as soon I hit the curb off my driveway it bounce out of the bottom.  I then removed my case and felt like fit tighter.  It still kept trying to bounce out the bottom.  If you look at the design you can see there is nothing holding it on the bottom except the corner.  It rattles a lot even when I tightened it.
