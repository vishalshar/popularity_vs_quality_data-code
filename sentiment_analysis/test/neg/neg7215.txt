The magnetic part keeps falling off because the magnet is weak. It doesn't mask the smell at all. When I was using the refill trays, I never had a problem with the litterbox smell. After using this for a couple weeks, I'm sure I wasted $50 on this. I was better off using the refill trays. I only tried this because I thought it would save me money in the long run, but it ended up wasting my money instead. The only good part is that it's reusable.
