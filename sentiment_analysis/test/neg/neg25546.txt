Soaked it per the instructions, scraped it, cut it, placed it near a window, and misted it twice a day.  After 19 days, I saw no growth or change.  I threw it out.  There were a couple of brown spots in the white mold/fungus, I presume it was warehoused too long or didn't breath well enough and died before I received it.
