I used this for the first time today.  I have blonde lashes and although I understand this is to be worn under regular mascara as a tint and thickener it is kind of gooey and was a bit of a struggle to put my mascara on over it.  Because of other reviewers who raved about it I will keep it to see if it improves over time or actually does tint my lashes.  I will update later with findings.
