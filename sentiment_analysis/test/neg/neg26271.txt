I purchased the Lytro 16GB to test its capability with object photography.  I was amazed by the sames showing the perspective and focus shift.  But the reality is terrible.First off, this is a LOW RESOLUTION camera, about 1.2 mega pixels.  Any point and shoot is 8 to 16 times that now, for a fraction of the money.  The perspective shift is useless since there is no easy way to use them.  The focal adjustment ability, with the low res is just sad.This is an early adopter product, and in my opinion a failure.  The technology is brilliant, and I truly wish it was at least a point and shoot replacement, but it's not.  Then factor in the money you pay for it (and it doesn't even come with a tripod mount, that's extra), and it is not worth buying.  On top of that, it doesn't come with a plug in charger - that's also extra.  Byt the time you are through, this is going to cost you $900 for a 1998 level image quality.Do not buy this product, unless you just want to look cool!
