Received from Amazon earlier this week from Amazon and gave to Fiance as her birthday present. Upon un-packaging, we were very disappointed to find that the device would not power up.  Inspected power cord and adapter and found no issues.  Swapping the cords out for other, higher quality cords and wall adapters did not resolve the problem either.  Troubleshooting options listed on website are minimal and poorly described at best.For $200, I would expect a product to be delivered that went through higher quality control.  It's easy to think that the single product was a lemon, but reading reviews on this website and others I am definitely not the first to experience a non-functional device right out of the box.  It would be nice if there were a visible quality control notice on the device, or something along those lines, so I can at least blame the shipping company of the product for the failure and not poor craftsmanship.However, I understand that this is a new(er) company & Amazon is replacing the unit.  I will just have to ask my Fiance to be patient and we will update the review if we find that the replacement changes our new perception of Petcube.
