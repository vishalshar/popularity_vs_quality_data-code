I bought this for my wife for her birthday because she wanted a fitness tracker, but didn't like the look of a giant plastic band like a Fitbit. Long story short, this is a really elegant piece of jewelry, not a successful piece of technology. We tried for two weeks to get it to sync with no success. The instructions are on a small rectangular single sheet of paper with a picture showing the device being plugged in. That's it... The app is just as helpful. Also, while it did track her steps one day out of the two weeks we had it before returning it to Amazon, it never once tracked sleep, nor was there any indication on the app that it was even capable of this function as it states in the item description on Amazon. Anyway, you can try it, it looks cool. I bought my wife a Fitbit Altra since the Amazfit debacle, and it has been flawless and so much better in every way.
