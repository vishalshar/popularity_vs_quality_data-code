I would so much like to love these sensors. In general they work great. Easy to setup and install. BUT, and there's that dreaded but, they don't work with any other smart hub system known to humankind. Basically, if you want a smart home, with other sensors, etc., but have Korners, you have to arm/disarm those other security systems on a separate app every time you leave and come home. That's an incredible pain, and I see no effort on the part of PatrolTag Inc. to rectify the situation.
