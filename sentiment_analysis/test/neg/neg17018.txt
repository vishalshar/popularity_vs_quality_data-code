This was going to be my gift to myself - I checked the list, and it said it was compatible with a Galaxy S4, which is what I have.  And mine says it's up to date.  I made it past the book that said iOS only - but when I went to download the app, it said it was not compatible with my device.  Funny how a device I was hoping would help me deal with stress is instead adding to it, and coming in as one more sad event in what has unfortunately been a season of those.  I guess it's going back.
