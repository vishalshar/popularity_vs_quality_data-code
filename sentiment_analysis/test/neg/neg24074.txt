Well.... none to pleased to pay $179.00 to be a beta tester for a product that definitely isn't ready for release. Not only that but the price dropped from $179.00 to $168.00 in a matter of days. Hmm, wonder if Amazon has a ton of these things getting returned.Pros- attractive- fairly easy to set up- iphone and ipad compatibleCons- Hyrometer a joke, consistently 20% higher than all other hygrometers in the house (many other customers report exactly the same offset).- Expensive- USB cable DOA right out of the box- Indoor and outdoor modules display radically different temp and humidity readings sitting right beside each other, even after a couple of hours.- Non existent customer support.It's sad, I really wanted to like this product and honestly do think the concept and tech is great. Netatmo should of waited till they got the thing to perform accurately before alienating a whole client base.
