poor quality.  suction cups don't really work well and now 3 weeks later the light doesn't work properly.  I tried replacing the batteries, but still doesn't work.  gonna try the glow bowl unless this one gets replaced to prove that I just got a lemonupdate....the replacement failed after a few months......cute idea.....crappy quality
