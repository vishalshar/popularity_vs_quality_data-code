We bought two of these for our two dogs. They worked OK for a few weeks, though (1) it's hard to tell whether they are on or off and (2) lag time on pet tracking is substantial.  Still, they were usable until one just stopped working altogether.  When we reported this to the company, instead of offering a replacement they used a lot of our time on the phone trying to debug the problem, assuming it was our error, then, to our amazement, asked us to send in photographs of the device on the docking station showing various numbers etc., so they can "get your ticket sent on to our tech team for deeper investigation.  As I mentioned, this will take a few days so I appreciate your patience with the process."  Sorry, Whistle, we don't actually have the patience or time to be your QA team, returning.
