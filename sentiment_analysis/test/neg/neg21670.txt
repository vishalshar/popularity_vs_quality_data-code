I fell in love with these when I was in line at my local Starbucks and decided to give them a try. I made the decision to buy them in a bigger quantity online so I can enjoy them at will. When I received these, I thought the taste was a little off. I took them to work, had one of my coworkers try some, (he enjoys these as well) and he agreed that the bag was stale. I was highly disappointed because I bought 6-8 bags of these and they all were stale.I'm better off just paying a little extra and buy them locally.
