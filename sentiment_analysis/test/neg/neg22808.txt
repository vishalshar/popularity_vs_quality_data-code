This POS arrived today, no damage to the shipping box.  Unpacked it, set it up, Radio worked great,CD player skipped on three different CD's and on different tracks.  Next the Record Player, all of the Vinyl skipped across therecord.  So I purchased a $200 AM?FM radio?  NOT !!  Applied for refund and UPS will pick it up tomorrow.Another inferior product by Innovative Technologies.  Would give it no stars if possible.
