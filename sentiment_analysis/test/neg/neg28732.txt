This was not what I expected. Very rudimentary design and not in a good way. I'm all for the old classic games, but this is not well thought out. You have to peel and stick a clear sticker onto every wooden block before you put it down, onto a piece of cheap cardboard that doesn't even lay flat. It is tedious and not the least bit fun for me or my 12 year old nephew. And then to make a new maze, you have to peel all these off, peel the clear stickers off, and start again. No thank you. The blocks and base need a coat of magnetic paint or something, a way to make this easier and more practical to change up with less effort. The fun part is making the maze and being able to create a new one when you want. It's a daunting task as they have it now, and I'm guessing this will sit with the first maze we built, forever- making it a one time use toy which drives me crazy. Don't waste your money or time, this needs some major work before it is worth even close to $60.
