Recently adopted a Savannah cat and the breeder recommended Solid Gold Indigo formula, my kitten would meow like she was in pain when going to the bathroom...After a visit to the vet it was recommended that I try a kitten formula. I started giving the kitten formula to my 10 week old kitten and she has had diarrhea for about 3 days and every time she passes gas she has watery stool...back to the vet we go...Apparently this is due to the pumpkin in the formula, throwing away immediately!!!!!!
