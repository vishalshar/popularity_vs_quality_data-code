when we purchased this in August, as a birthday present.  We set it up at beginning of September, it seemed to be a pretty good set up for my son's room.  It has good sound.  In early November we started having problems with the volume going up and down on its' own. By the end of Nov 2015/beg December 2015 - volume is no longer controlled by 'knob' on the receiver and consequently, no music.  For 3 weeks we could get "no sound".  Last week, my husband worked the manual volume control several times, and as mysteriously as it stopped it has come back, but if you touch the control it goes wildly between LOUD and lower volumes.  I will be looking for a service tech to fix this.  But am expecting to be told, "it will cost as much to fix it, as to buy a new one".  This is the problem with so many of the tech items now, if you buy them when they first come out(not the case with this), you pay too much and if you wait and purchase something 'on sale', that usually means outdated... if you have problems, count on just throwing it out.  This is a big disappointment. I had initially considered purchasing a second one.  Tonight, I am online looking for a replacement.  I have read several reviews that speak to various issues with this.  I was encouraged that we were able to get some sound for a couple days, even purchased new speakers.  I have some components that need to be connected to a receiver.
