Disappointed in the product. I thought the anymote had wi-fi capability. Its useless and ludicrous l that I have to have my anymote app on for Alexa voice commands to work. The bridge thing doesn't make sense. Also, anymote should be a wi-fi device that connects to your home network and therefore connects with Alexa. Then, no need for bridge. Developers were so close in the concept but yet so far away. So not worth $80.00.
