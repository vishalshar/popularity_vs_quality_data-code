I bought this along with an extra bag of dino food in preparation for my pet to have a long life.  I followed all the instructions when I received it.  It glowed brilliantly the first couple of days and it slowly started to dim down day by day.  Every morning, I would put it near a window with a sheer blind so that it is not in direct sun light, and put it in the closet at night.  It's been a little warm in the house lately, about 80 degrees, so I even put it in a tub of water to keep it cool.  After about 2 weeks, it is no longer glowing.  Did all my dino's die?  I did everything as instructed.  Now I am left with one and a half bag of dino food with no dinos to fee it to.  Is there a warranty for this?
