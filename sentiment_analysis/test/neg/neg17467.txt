Won't detect my usb 3.0 HDD. That was the main reason for me to buy a connector, but unfortunately it doesn't work.On top of that branding do look out of place and it takes away the clean look of the connector. I wouldn't recommend this if you have a lot of USB 3.0 HDD's to be connector to your new MacBook.
