DO NOT BUY!!! I don't know if I got a knock-off version or what.But I ordered the NSFW #1 and #2 and both sets have identical cards as each other, not to mention identical cards within each pack! Plus there are serious spelling mistakes. We went through about a dozen of these before we realized they were absolute junk and ended up googling phrases instead.They weren't even NSFW, none of them were inappropriate. I am demanding a refund.
