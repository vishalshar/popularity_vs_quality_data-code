I was really disappointed by the quality of the product. It arrived soaking wet in its bag, not even sure how that could happen. The metal was scuffed, scratched and had black marks all over. All the parts were haphazardly fastened and nothing was straight. Definitely made in China with no oversight. Returning as soon as possible.
