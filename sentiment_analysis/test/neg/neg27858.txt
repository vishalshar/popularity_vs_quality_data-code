Ok the good:  it works and does a good great job of smoothing feet while your in the shower.  My girl reallly loves this thing.  Was not sure at first but it works as advertised.  The bad:  this company didn't do a good job of working out how to adhere the unit to the floor of your shower.  I have a tile shower and the suction cups do a poor job of keeping it in place as it spins and you apply pressure to get the unit remove dead skin.  I had to become an engineer to get it to stay put and even then its currently not installed because it came loose.  My next engineering project is to adhere it to a nonskid bathroom mat with industrial strength glue and see it that solves the problem.  Once I get that done then it an easy 5 star rating for this.  I paid almost $60 for it and the fact that the company didn't have any innovative way to install it is a dissapointment.  I wouldn"t recommend it unless you are an MIT grad or a Mechanical Engineer, or a some other hard science nerd.
