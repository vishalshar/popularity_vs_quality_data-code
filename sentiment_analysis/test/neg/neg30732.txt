This review is just for the WHITE Rokform case. After 6 months it already broke in 2 places. The bumper is also very loose. And yes, it gets dirty easily. I bought the same style case for my boyfriend in black and it is MUCH better. The bumper is tight and more solid feeling and nothing on the case has cracked or broken.Before purchasing I read several negative reviews about the white case but really wanted white to match my phoneÂ… and I am paying the price.One positive: even with the areas that are broken and the loose bumper it is still protecting my phone.
