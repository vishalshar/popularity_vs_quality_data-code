After just one year the toy won't work again.  It was played with appropriately and not exceedingly.  Now it won't hold a charge.  It sits on the charger and looks like it's charging, but only lasts about 2 minutes before it fades.  It is such a cool toy and my son loved it, but for the money and the great care that was taken with it, it should be more durable.
