This is a good flash drive especially 8gb for the price.  I had no problems with its operation as my computer recognized it right away and its fast.  The only problem with this drive is its actual physical design.  It does not actually have a cap to cover the USB connection so you always have to worry about it getting dirty since it is a portable drive.  The USB connection slides in and out of a pocket but there is no cap so the front of the USB is totally exposed at all times.  They conviently don't show any views of that poor design condition.  The sliding action is very hard to do so your constantly fighting with it anytime you want to open/close it.  Because it very hard to open/close the USB connector gets bent over time, so you have to forcably be careful with it.  Dane-Elec needs to redesign as they totally don't understand that form follows funtion, especially in this instance.
