I really love the idea of not having to charge the device daily or weekly as apple watch or Fitbit.I've owned the original Shine for about a month and had to return it because it just stop syncing to my phone.So before purchasing this one, I've read lots of reviews and most of them were negative ones.Eventually I decided to give it a shot. Now it's money down the drain again.The band is a piece of garbage. The shine2 keeps popping out of the band.Went to ski this time and completely lost the device.I don't understand why it's so hard to make a durable band that can attach the device?
