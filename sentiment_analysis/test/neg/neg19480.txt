I wanted so badly to like this product. The phone app is what is really dragging it down.Pros:1.) Its awesome when it works.2.) I think it demonstrated some differences in my breathing3.) The charging station is pretty.Cons:1.) The phone app is clunky.2.) It is insanely expensive for what it actually is.3.) It still does not have a way to assist with sleeping4.) The tracking of the breath is not entirely accurate.The worst part about the app is the effect that it has on my phone. It has actually failed causing the entire phone to not be able to charge without having to hard reset the phone. I have set a variety of settings inside the app that haven't been saved so it doesn't actually buzz any alerts. I cannot unlock the Spire Tutorial despite listening to the first section. That is a touch frustrating because I would like to know more about it.Despite the directions it doesn't seem to work when being placed on the side of my bra. It also doesn't seem to be able to detect tension when it is placed in the middle of my bra. At times I actually find it uncomfortable as well.I want desperately to like it, but I do not think that I will be able to find enough reasons to keep it. However, I will try it for another few days and update the review of anything changes.
