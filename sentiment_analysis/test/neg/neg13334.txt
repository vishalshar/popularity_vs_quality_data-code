I bought this because it looked promising.  Yes, IR cameras have generally been very expensive.  If you are using this with a case, you will need an adapter, otherwise you cannot plug it in all the way.What I noticed the most, was the very slow update rate using the app.  That is very unnerving.  You really have to put it on a tripod and let it be still long enough to get a decent exposure.  The lens on the unit I received was of very poor quality.  It's supposed to be parfocal over a certain range - what that means is that everything within that parfocal range should be in focus.  The unit I had was always fuzzy.  Yes, there aren't many pixels to begin with so I wasn't expecting much, but all I got was blurs.  I am an optical scientist specializing in testing imaging systems.  The unit I received would not have passed my QC. Either the lenses aren't up to spec or the alignment is off.  I returned the unit and got a full refund.  I'm sure that some of these are aligned well and work as advertised, but the one I had didn't.
