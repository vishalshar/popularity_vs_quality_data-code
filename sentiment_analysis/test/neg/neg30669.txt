I was reasonably satisfied with the function of the devices action. My problem is, I don't have it any longer. The locking mechanism is horrible. I had the band less than 2 weeks and the band came unlatched and fell off my arm at least 3 times prior to the last. The last time I did not feel or see it come off and it is lost in a sporting goods store. Needless to say, gone forever. I would not buy this product again unless a change in its latch is made
