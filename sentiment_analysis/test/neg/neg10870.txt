I was highly disappointed in this product.  It was expensive (approximately 4x supermarket/major brand price), but I read an article about smaller, independent producers selling their products nationally and I thought I would give it a try.  It was dry and lacked flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product.
