Be advised for the following.With small print at the back of the box  WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.LittleBits practically does not clarify what triggered this warning, i.e. what chemical and how we can protect. See littlebits  site \prop-65.They contacted me to reassure, which is good service - but no clarification on the above.Apart from the above there are serious issues. Note, that I wanted to like this product. An I will still try.1. Bits can stay well together up to max. 3. Then you need the 2 provided boards. To which it is very difficult to stick, especially for kids2. When connected to a Bluetooth Bit, a motor should perform no action unless ordered to. No, the little car will run around, unless you stop it with the tablet application3. Application (have it in Android) requires login every single time. Why? What's to protect?4. Application has a driving utility that should steer the 2 BT + 2 motors car contraption. Well, tablet tilting axis is of different orientation to the car, so it is confusing. And no explanations provided5. Finally, LEGO conversion modules were not included. It is not claimed otherwise in site and on box text, but till recently product picture showed it, so they took the accessory out. That was a bit of let downLast, but not least, one of two motors stuck in first day and servo broke (only emitting a sound) in first week. With minimal play and no abuse. Shop checked and replaced. I hope new kit does better.I have to state that I bought it in Greece and paid EUR 250 for it (ca. 265 USD). I do not see why the tremendous price difference with US?So much money for a game, I expected only the best quality.Please, customer service, improve on those and give us first a better Application.
