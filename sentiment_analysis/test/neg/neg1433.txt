Not working well for electronics - if you are buying this to see heat signatures on PCBs (resistors, FETs, LEDs, etc.) - it does NOT work well. Stay away. There are some photos on their web site that show clear(-er?) photos of PCBs - i can't help think that they have been altered somehow. I've just returned my unit and will possibly be buying the Flir ONE for Android - once it's released. I'll add a brief note on that one as well once i get it to tell you if it's any better than this one.
