Not working at all for me.  It turns on, but is very inaccurate. Appears that I got a unit with a nearly dead battery, so maybe the horrible GPS accuracy and very weak signal strength are due to this. Also, the iOS app's mapping function doesnt allow scroll or generally work well at all. I'll be returning this.
