No instructions came with product.  I'm a first time gardener and  used previous customer reviews to get an idea of the do's and do nots.  Basil is growing like a weed, parsley and cilantro are limping along and clover never sprouted!  I liked the idea enough to look into growing a real herb garden, but this package did not provide herbs for use in the kitchen.
