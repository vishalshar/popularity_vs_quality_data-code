Update:After updating the firmware via APP, now it is working correctly. Please see the attached images.Original:I really want to give this five stars, but after trying a few hours, now I highly suggest everyone to look at something else instead.First, the connections go to China. Your network is not secure since your first kiss link. However, it seems any similar product made in China has this issue.Second, after one or two trials, APP cannot change password and cannot change advanced setting. Even five times of factory reset doesn't help. And, of course, APP requests lots of permissions to gather your cellphone information back to China.Third, the first time log in screen is really ugly. It looks like 99 cents cheap crap.TLDR: Do not buy this !!!
