I have had 2 of these units in a week.  I bought the first, used it 2 nights in a row and it died on the second night after an hour and a half of cooking.  I understand that occasionally electronic items are bad out of the box, so I returned it.  Received the replacement today, started a cooking cycle, and the circulator motor died after an hour.  I have followed the instructions, which are pretty simple anyway.  I love the cooking method, the food has turned out great when it functioned long enough to finish, but so far the quality of the product seems pretty poor.  I will be getting a refund and buying a different brand.
