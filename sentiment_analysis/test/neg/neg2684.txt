Worked great for 6 months! then became unusable, i became locked out of house 2 twice when decided to stop working and unlock the lock halfway. Really wanted to love this product but was unreliable. Also the customer service with august was no help after 3 attempts to work with them, i was meet with horrible condescension and not actual help. I am a technical guy, it was very upsetting. The final straw was then they said they need to set up a Skype session with me, then couldn't get them to confirm a time or date.
