Very unfortunate that the application does not work as well as the light does.  Without the application, the light is useless, so the the light is not worth anything. The light is bright and works great when it works which is very rare.  The application just does not connect to the light reliably.  I was lucky if it connected 10 percent of the time which to me is useless and that is why I am returning it and will look elsewhere to fill my house with colored recessed lighting.  Do not buy if you don't want to be let down.
