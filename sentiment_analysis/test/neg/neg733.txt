I'm sure that this product is efficient if you want to take a probiotic however I couldn't get past the texture and taste of these gummies.  They weren't "gummy" at all but instead they had a harder texture that didn't have any "gumminess" to it. The texture is what really through me. I didn't enjoy eating these at all and that's the whole point to gummy vitamins. Probably a great product, just not for me.
