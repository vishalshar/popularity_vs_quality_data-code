First of all, I should say that the Rokform cover is one of the best smartphone mount I have found on the market. I have owned this cover and handlebar mount for about a year. The handlebar aluminum mount is very well built and feels sturdy and secure. The magnet on the back of the case is very strong and reliable. However, after using the case and mount for just shy of one year, the case started to fall apart. The magnet cut through the thin rubber that holds it to the cover and fall down, making the cover not so very useful. There is no replacement parts for the cover and for a price of 170 dollars, this is not acceptable. The only option I have right now is to spend another 40 dollars to buy a new cover.In my opinion, the cover is too expensive considering that  it will break apart in less than a year.
