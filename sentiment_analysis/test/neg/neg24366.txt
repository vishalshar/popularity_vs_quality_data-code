Last week on a bike ride, my phone was very flimsy during the ride and when I checked it out, I realized that one of the bands on the bike mount broke. Therefore I just took off the phone so that I wouldn't risk losing/breaking it. I had only had that mount for five months and had only been on a handful of extended rides. For the prices that they charge, you surely wouldn't expect to have any issues as early as five months in. As for the product itself, the attachment to the phone is secure, but the attachment to the bike itself is only held by elastic bands and as you ride more, the band eventually stretches/loosens and in my case, eventually broke.  At that point I was very disappointed in the lack of durability in the product so I emailed QuadLock to express my displeasure. I explained how I did not feel that the bands were secure enough. I requested that they send me one of their newer products, the Out Front Mount. That mount clamps down on the handle bar and you can tighten with a screw. Since this a was newer product that they just released, It was not available at the time of my initial purchase therefore was not an option for me. After a few emails back and forth (which eventually a supervisor was involved), they concluded that they could not honor my request and they could only replace the defective band. My problem with that was that over the course of a few rides, that band would again start to loosen and I would have the same problem in the future. The reason I requested the newer (lesser expensive) product was because it looked to be more secure. Their "solution" was to give me my own discount code to purchase the Out Front Mount. When I applied the discount, it was only for 10% off. The funny thing is that anyone can get 10% off by entering their email address. They tried to make it seem like they were doing something special for me. At that point I was highly insulted. This product was way too expensive to only be held on to by elastic bands. The way it attaches to the phone is secure, but the way it attaches to the bike is not. And the manner that this company chose to handle my situation was poor. You can find other products on Amazon that are just as good and cost 1/4 the price of QuadLock.
