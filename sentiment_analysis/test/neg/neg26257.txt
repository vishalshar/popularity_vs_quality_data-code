Product pictures and videos in advertisements  are VERY misleading.Unlike the vivid images shown online, you can not make out any detail of what you are viewing beyond a general blob. I was hoping to use this to troubleshoot electrical problems on circuit boards and inside robot controllers in the field. However, this is better suited to the scale of checking a parking lot to see which cars still have warm engines. There is NO practical adjustment for the lens as advertised. You can turn the lens, but the only position that is in "focus" at ANY distance from what you are viewing is twisted all the way to the max point. Anything before that is blurry at any distance. I was very disappointed because my research had all lead me to this particular thermal imager. I contacted Seek immediately after seeing that my lens was not even close to what I seen online, but here I am 3 days later writing this review with no answer from them. I have returned this imager, and will "seek" elsewhere for a decent compact imager to outfit my team with.
