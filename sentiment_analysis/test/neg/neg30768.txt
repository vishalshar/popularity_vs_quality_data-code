This printer does not work at all.  I downloaded the latest version of the software before starting (Windows 64-bit).  The software delivers an endless stream of error messages.  Will not print; will not purge the nozzle; will not eject filament once it is loaded.  I had to return it with the filament reel still in place.The graphical display of nozzle temperature to the left of the graphics window in the software, and the text display of nozzle temperature in the graphics window show completely different values.  On an HD screen (1920 x 1080), parts of some of the pop-up windows in the Settings menu are clipped and the windows cannot be resized, making some of the settings, and their labels, inaccessible.After the first error, the software instructed me to immediately shut the unit down, eject the filament, reseat the head and restart.  The filament would not eject because the nozzle would not heat up enough to allow ejection (even though it appeared to heat up beyond operating temperature at times when it was not supposed to).  I shut it off and reseated the head.  After restarting I was warned that I had shut the unit down while the head was still hot, and that could damage the head, even though the software had instructed me to shut it down when I did.The hardware and design appear to be of very high quality and well done.  The problem may be with the software.  The latest version of the Users Manual and the Quick-Start Guide from the Robox web site do not match the latest version of the software, downloaded at the same time also from the Robox web site.Does not deserve even one star, but that is the lowest rating allowed.
