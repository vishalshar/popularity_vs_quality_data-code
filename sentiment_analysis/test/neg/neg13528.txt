If you are looking to buy this product and activate it quickly, look somewhere else. I bought this last week and have not been able to activate for three days now. I received the phone quickly and as expected from Amazon, then went on to the GreatCall website to activate it. I chose a plan, and GreatCall took all of my information. I had read about "hidden" activation fees, and it is true, there is a $35 activation fee that is not mentioned until you commit to initiating the process of choosing a plan. On the next screen, I waited for a confirmation about activation and instructions on how to proceed, but instead received a message saying activation didn't work and I should call the 800 number. Here the website shows that the helpline is 24/7. It is not. I called and received an automated message about phone service hours between 6am to 6pm (of course I called at about 6:10pm). I called the next morning from work and the phone tree message states they are having trouble activating the phones. I was put through anyway and a kind woman tried to help me but told me that I would need to set up the phone in a place where I could put it in the charger for the next 24 hours, which wouldn't work since I wasn't at home. She then told me I could call back from home later in the evening until 9pm PST. She reiterated that twice. I called in the evening around 6pm only to find out phone service hours were over for the day. I called again this morning (a different woman, not nearly as kind as the first) and was told they are still experiencing technical difficulties, cannot activate the phones, and I should try calling back after the Memorial Day holiday (in 4 more days.) Out of curiosity I checked my bank statement and although the phone has yet to be activated, the activation fee has already been withdrawn from my account ($40, including fees). I will be returning this phone and choosing something else, since we need it in a particular timeframe and there is no clear indication as to when the activation problem will be resolved. Very disheartening; I understand that technical difficulties happen, but this has felt like a true "runaround" so far, and charging me already for activation when they can't provide service makes me question the integrity of this safety-based company.
