Either DOA or just plain doesn't work as advertised.  Neither SD nor Micro SD/SDHC slots worked at all.  Tried multiple cards with differing formats and sizes.  Only one of the USB ports would work at all, and then only with a very low capacity flash drive from 2010.  Tried multiple hard drives on the USB ports also and couldn't get any that were Mac Journaled formatted to read (which is ironic since this is for a Mac).  Gave up and will keep looking.
