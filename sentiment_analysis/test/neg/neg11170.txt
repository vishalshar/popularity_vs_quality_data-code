I ordered this tablet for my daughter's birthday las week, arrived within record time with my prime membership. Took it out the box and set up the apps and everything. Had it a full week prior to giving it to her, unfortunately, I didn't really play around on it to pickup on lag time. Within 3 days of her having it, the screen now freezes and won't let me shut it off or reboot it until. After the first day, she was saying it was taking a long time to load  websites. So freaking disappointed! Had bought multiple cases and everything!
