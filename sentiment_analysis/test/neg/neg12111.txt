This is a little high for my dog. It is not stable. The mat is cheap and sits on top of this plastic corrugated pan that empties into a cheaper plastic container . There are holes in the bottom plastic container that drawers the emptying pan but  the rest of the space is empty. If there are any leaks in the corrugated one, they will end up on your floor.  Since there are 3 layers that are not stabilized, it is not sturdy. Since the bottom layer is essentially hollow plastic, it is easily warped. My dog tried to climb on it. It slipped from underneath her while she was trying to get on it. That day she refused to use it until I  switched back to her old piddle pad. Waste of money.
