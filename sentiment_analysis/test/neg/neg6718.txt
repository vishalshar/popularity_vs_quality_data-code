This product is a complete disaster. Pairing with the phone is problematic, even for an advanced user. The trackers would lose bluetooth signal and re-acquire it unexpectedly. The user interface is clunky. But the main thing - these trackers have 1 year useful life. The batteries started dying after one year, upon replacement all the trackers would turn the light on and lock. Back and forth with tech support. End result? "We regret to inform you that your trackers are outside of the warranty period". Yes, one year and one month, and they tell me I am out of luck. Stay away from this product, they have much better advertising department than engineering,
