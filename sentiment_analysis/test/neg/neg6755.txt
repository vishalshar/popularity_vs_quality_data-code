I had high hopes for these as when I put them in my shoes they were easy to set up. However, beyond the ease of use and concept, there is nothing else good to say about this product. They constantly snap in half at the top and they only include 2 extra so I was left to move the hickies from other holes of the shoe to the top so I could keep the shoe on. Would never buy again or recommend
