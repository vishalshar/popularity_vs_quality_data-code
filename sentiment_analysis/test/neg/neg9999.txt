The range of this thing is a joke. I measured and it disconnected at 32 feet away with clear line of sight. It was not strong enough to stay connected with it sitting outside and me being inside (a glass door between and 10 feet of distance). Replaced with an igrill mini and while it does not have the advertised range either it is still atleast 2x times stronger than this.
