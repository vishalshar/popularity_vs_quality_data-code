I have owned a Canary for almost a year now. Initially I was satisfied with the product, although a bit worried about some reviewers drawing attention to a recent pricing update by the manufacturers. Last year the makers removed the 7 day free videos plan option, and essentially forced buyers to migrate to a minimum of USD 4.99/month plan for merely 2 days of videos. I bought the Canary thinking this will be the end of it and was ok with the 4.99 price plan. I was in for a rude shock yesterday when they changed the plans again, by discontinuing the 2 day plan and forcing people to either subscribe to a USD 9.99/month plan (30 day video) or get downgraded to a 12 hour free plan. Note that if you look at practicality, 12 hours of recording is hardly any use given you might not even look at your phone for 12 hours and miss out on any important update. A USD 9.99/month (or 99/year) contract dramatically adds to the true cost of owning a Canary, and is a clear bait and switch by the manufacturer, if you don't subscribe to it you end up with a very expensive paperweight. I am (and I believe lots of customers were) perfectly happy with 2 days of video, so I don't see why I should be paying more for 30 days when I do not need it. So any buyers considering a purchase should be made aware of this hidden cost of canary and explore other devices. Who knows, within a few months they might price the plans up higher again and buyers stuck with Canary have no option but to pay. Note that there are still unresolved issues with the Canary, for example the video algorithm which was supposed to learn which motion in the house are suspicious and which are not, is basically still non-existent.
