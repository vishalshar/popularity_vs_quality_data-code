It works, but it doesn't.  Like another reviewer said, it is 30-50% accurate.  What it DOES do is make you very aware of your posture, either because you are trying to fix it, because it has fallen off inside your shirt, or because it is working.  Just set a timer to go off every two minutes, and when it buzzes check your posture, it would work just as well.  The step counter does not work, and the bra strap clip does not work on sports bra's or anything with more than the thinnest straps.  If you have a backback, a purse strap, or a child that you have to hold, it won't work.  After purchase I got put on some sort of SurveyMonkey response survey that won't stop emailing me and asking me to rate my support and leave a review.  I didn't get support, and I don't want to leave a review.
