Be careful on this one.  I followed all the instructions: soaking it 24 hours, misting twice a day, keeping it out of direct sunlight... and all I grew was a lot of white mold.  And guess what, there's no guarantee or return policy at all, so a moldy brick of coffee grounds which promises, but does not deliver mushrooms, goes for $20 on Amazon and the buyer is SOL.  Very disappointing buy.
