I ordered these because my mother-in-law has an original pair and they are amazing. The originals are very sharp and perfect for splinters. As other reviewers have noted, Uncle Bill sold out some point to El Mar and the tweezers they sell now are a cheap imitation. There is a point, but it is not sharp and they're basically useless. Sad story.
