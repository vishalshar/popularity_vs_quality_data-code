Our doctor suggested this for my wife. She's been having some heart beat irregularities lately and he told us we could use this device to capture EKG strips at home and send them to his office. What a great idea! We've been using it for a month now and unfortunately it's far from perfect.Pros:+ We have been able to catch some weird arrhythmia's with this device and we were able to send them to her cardiologist.+ Capturing the rhythm is easy, just put your two thumbs on the metal and hold it down onto a table.Cons:- It's so touchy. When her heart is beating normally the EKG typically works fine but as soon as she starts having a heart problem the device sometimes gets confused and will just stop working. The EKG will cut out completely. I'm pretty sure we've lost some pretty important arrhythmia's from this bug.- The phone case you can buy with this thing is practically worthless. Unless your hands are as steady as Chuck Norris, don't expect to get anything close to an accurate reading holding the phone case and putting your thumbs on this thing.- The desktop software is crazy buggy and the website isn't perfect either. Here are a couple bugs we've found.1) You go in and make a recording, 50% of the time the recording cuts off when there is an arrhythmia. When the heart rhythm is normal the device seems to operate just fine.2) In-order to play back the rhythm you've just captured on the desktop app you have to log out of the app and back in, you can't view rhythm strips you've just imported.3) In the desktop app, after viewing your rhythm if you try to view your history the app blacks out completely. Log out and back in to view your history. Then if you view another rhythm, again you can't view your history again until you log out and log back in. Do this until you're sick of the desktop app and you turn to the website.4) The website works fine for some things but doesn't work at all for others. For example, If you want to make a note to talk about what happened during an episode you cannot do this on the website. You are forced to write the notes through the phone. This limitation doesn't make sense at all. It makes you not even want to write notes because it's such a pain to type out exactly what was happening on your phone.Overall I really like the concept of this device. I wanted to love it but it's got so many problems it's almost unusable. You need the patience of a monk to get an accurate reading that you can actually have analyzed by your doctor. The only reason this didn't get 1 star is because we have managed to capture some interesting hearth rhythms on this device that we gave to her doctor. We will continue to use this until someone else releases a better product.
