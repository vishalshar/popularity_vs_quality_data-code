This thing didn't work at all. No noticeable difference. I've had it for 4 months now in my car. Last month I  brought it inside for a change, and a real test - put it above my cat's litter box. Nothing, nada, zip, you might as well light $40 on fire.  And yes I followed all the directions that came with it, priming it in the sun and such.  "Give it a month before it really starts absorbing the odors." Convenient as it's too late for you to get my money back when you realize it doesn't work. Unfortunate.
