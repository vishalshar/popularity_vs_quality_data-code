Your prop guards are defective.  During a flight while video was recording your prop guards came into contact with my spinning props, breaking the props in flight and causing a crash from 55 feet in the air.  I have downloaded the 3dr solo flight log and confirmed that a prop strike on motor pod #1 was the root cause of the crash.  Once I recovered my drone and upon further inspection I was able to to find the damage on the prop guard from the spinning prop.  The 3dr solo flew for several minutes without issue, but the prop guards did not maintain a fixed position relative to the spinning props, after a few short minutes they shifted from their original locked position and caused a catastrophic prop strike....damage list:- 4 props broken = $30- 2 motor pods stripped threads = $120- 2 motor pods hard impact = $120- gopro (hero 4 silver) no longer able to connect via WiFi = $400I purchased these prop guards so that my 3dr solo would have added protection, instead they caused a catastrophic failure and several hundred dollars worth of damage to my 3dr solo.I respectfully request a full refund for my prop guards and reimbursement for the damage that your product caused to my 3dr solo.  YOUR PRODUCT NOT ONLY FAILED TO PERFORM AS ADVERTISED, IT CAUSED DAMAGE AND MADE MY 3DR SOLO A CRASH HAZARD FOR MY SUBDIVISION
