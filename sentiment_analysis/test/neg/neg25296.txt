horrible design, plastic pitcher is too thin, wood handle is not strong enough to support the weight of the water...very disappointed in product. The first one I ordered arrived cracked near the handle. Second one lasted ONE month before handle snapped off and ripped the backside of pitcher off. Waste of money.
