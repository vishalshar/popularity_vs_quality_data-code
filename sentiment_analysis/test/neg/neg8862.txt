We've had this for the past two years - primarily so that we can check in on our cat while we're away. The image is great and the laser works wonderfully. The night quality is honestly what you can expect, I think.The bad part, really, is the app. About 90% of the time, the app can't connect to whatever it needs to so that I can open the video and see what's going on.
