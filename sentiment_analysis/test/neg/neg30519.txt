I installed a Roost Smart Battery 5 days ago. Now, my iPhone displays the battery is "Offline." The Customer Support page on the manufacturer's website doesn't offer any information about this problem.  To make matter worse, the Smoke/CO detector that contains this brand new Roost battery started chirping.Update:  I removed the "Offline" Roost batteryfrom the Smoke/CO detector and replaced it with a conventional 9 Volt battery. Several minutes later, the disconnected Roost battery started emitting a low beep, approximately every 5 minutes.  Interesting how it goes "Offline" when placed in the smoke detector and keeps beeping after it is removed and disconnected.
