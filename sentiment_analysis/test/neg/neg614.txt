Holes are too large so treats have to be refilled constantly so you need to use larger treats than you normally would with a treat dispenser. We tested this with a 45 lb boxer mix, who took to it right away (he's great with treat dispensing toys, doesn't tear into them like some dogs do.. really likes working for the food). Within the space of 5 minutes, and with very minor manipulation with his teeth, a chunk of the toy came off. Not durable enough for dogs over 40 lbs. The rubber is very thin.
