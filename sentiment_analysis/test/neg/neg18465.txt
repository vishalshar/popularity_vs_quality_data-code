We get errant messages that my dog has left her whistle area when we can clearly see her sleeping in the back yard. The device has not tracked any of her activity in several weeks and always seems to be kicking over to "power saving" mode. We have not had to use this to track her when she gets out of the yard which will be the real test. I have my doubts that it will work since it cannot do anything else right.Be wary, the cost of the device is only the beginning. To activate it, you have to pay a monthly service fee which will run you into the hundreds of dollars very quickly.
