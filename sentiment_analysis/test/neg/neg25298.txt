The carafe is definitely pretty and eye catching, and I liked the idea of glass pitcher.(which was also the reason I purchased it) I tried very hard to like it but ended up feeling very disappointed -- it did not function as a solid water filter. First of all, the design is problematic which makes the pitcher insanely messy. The water sometimes barely poured out, sometimes gushes out a huge amount from the pouring mouth, or even leaks from the gap between the plastic part and the body of the glass carafe. More importantly, the water streams down to the carafe almost instantaneously just like collecting water from the tap directly,I couldn't feel it is filtered at all. The taste of the water is much worse than Brita , despite that Brita is already not a decent one.I highly doubt this product could remove hazardous chemicals and heavy metals from the tapped water, even for the amount that is comparable to Brita.
