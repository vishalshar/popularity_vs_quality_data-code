Bragi creates an elegant product but, unfortunately, it's not very practical. I am good with technology but for the last few months I've been struggling to use it. I'm constantly charging the battery and it loses its charge quickly. The volume-max is very low. The price is extremely high. All in all, I would not buy it again. I do think this product has tremendous potential and will be on the look out for future reviews.
