I bought the Piper Computer Kit for my son as a Christmas present.  I thought I had done a decent amount of research and took the advice of other Amazon reviewers and bought a separate mouse and keyboard.  Going back and rereading the reviews, I wonder if the reviewers weren't paid to buy and review the product as my experience wasn't even close to the reviews.  And looking at the product description on the Amazon site, I get the feeling that I have been sleezed by a marketing machine.  The pictures, descriptions, and videos are way over the top compared to other Amazon listings - let this be a clue for you in the future that perhaps the product listing is more hype than substance; and as Clara Peller use to say, "where's the beef"; because it's sure not in this product.My experience:Christmas morning, my son was excited to get the gift and after all of the other gifts were opened and thank yous said; he immediately jumped into putting his present together.  Out of the box, the acrylic base on the computer board was broken.My son and I went ahead and decided to assemble the kit anyway, figuring we could get a replacement piece the next day.  At the end of the assembly, we were short two bolts, no problem, we'll call for a replacement the next day.  Put it all together, power it up - nothing.  We researched the support FAQs on the playpiper website and found a similar problem; a bad HDMI cable.  Fortunately we had a spare cable and were able to proceed.  We also downloaded a software update to ensure we were running with the latest code.Before you can go into creative or game modes [where the fun is I suppose...], you have to go thru a story mode.  The first story was accompanied by great audio and video instructions, and if you forgot anything, you could go back and replay the videos.  We only made it through part of the 1st story and the game locked up.No problem, try the second story, this one had no video or audio; we made it thru part of the story, and again the game locked up.  I rebooted and tried again.  Same problem, and same point in both stories - the game locks up.  The third story has you connect jumper wires between the computer board and a breadboard; and unlike the second story, you can't tell if what you did worked or not - because again the game locked up.Next day; Monday, 12/26 at 2pm CST; I called the support number; Lieutenant Tommy [according to the website], no answer.  A machine voice asked for my name, a phone appeared to ring, and the machine voice came back and said no-one was available.  Leave your phone number and a message.Still no callback.Product evaluation:Nice idea that is poorly implemented.  My son enjoyed building the case.  Reminds me of a cross between Lego and Erector sets.  The wooden frame for the computer case is not thick enough for the machine screws and nuts that hold the case together as the nuts stick out above and below the surface of the wooden pieces; and maybe that's part of the charm...The computer case is undersized for all of the components and the stiff cables make it hard to fit everything in the case.  There is no place for the speaker, the picture on Amazon shows the speaker on the tool box; unfortunately the supplied cable is too short.  And even with a longer one, the lid will not close for the speaker to be kept on the tool box.The unit is battery powered.  The battery pack has two USB Type-A outputs and one USB micro-B input.  When the computer is being used, one USB cable goes to the LCD screen, and the other to the Raspberry PI computer board.  The cable between the battery pack and the computer board does double duty - powering the computer, and when reversed, it is used to recharge the battery pack.When you want to recharge the batter pack, you have to disconnect the cable going to the LCD screen, unplug the micro-B cable from the computer board, remove the battery pack, unplug the USB Type-A side from the battery pack, turn the cable around and plug the micro-B side into the battery pack input slot - then go find a USB charger - not supplied.  Even with small hands, the pulling and rearranging of components and sliding the pieces into the positioning slots is a challenge.  My worry is that overtime, the micro-B slot on the Raspberry PI is going to get damaged.  Perhaps it would be worth an investment in another cable, and rather than disconnecting the cable from the computer board; just leave the cable connected to the computer board, and if you have to remove the battery pack for charging, disconnect the cables from the battery pack side.  And use a separate cable for charging.Net answer; the jury is still out.  I have hope that the Playpiper support site calls me back and provides replacements for the broken pieces and an update to the software that doesn't freeze.  I'll update my review and let you know how it goes.  But until then; DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.
