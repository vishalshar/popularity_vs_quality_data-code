I don't love it, but I don't completely hate it. The sounds tend to have an underlying buzzing/singing sound from the speaker, I'm assuming. It's almost a rattling sound, but it's very faint. It drives me crazy. I've tried changing the surface it is on, changing which sound I'm using.. it doesn't go away!!
