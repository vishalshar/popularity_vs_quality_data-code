I thought this was a really cool concept and was excited to put this on our toilet, especially for night time uses with my toddler. Having a soft light and one that changes color is really nice. Unfortunately, the suction cups do not stick well and it keeps falling off and I have to keep reapplying it, almost 3 times per weekI feel giving it 1 star isn't fair because I do like the product. I only hope the change the sticking/mounting method.
