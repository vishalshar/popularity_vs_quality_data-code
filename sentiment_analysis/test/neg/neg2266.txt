It seems a "better brita" at first, at least its aesthetic surely is. The real problems start after that. First issue - fitlers leak a darkish blackish residue which I sadly discovered depositing on the bottom of my 2 year old son's bottle. Second issue the flip cover comes off very easily - you will find yourself wondering how to put that back in place quiet few times. Third issue - not easy to clean. It has a ring of silicone or rubber of some sort which is VERY difficult to clean. My shown dark marks ALL THE TIME. I just got rid of it. Not for me.
