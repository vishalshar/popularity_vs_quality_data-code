The new app shows the temperatures really nicely, with a vertical scale at the left of the picture. But they're meaningless. See attached pictures showing a near view of a washing machine drum, and a medium distance view of the same machine. Temperatures are wildly different. This device is fun to play with, and may be reliable for showing variations in temperature, but you can't take the temperatures seriously, at all.
