The marketing video really intrigued me last Thanksgiving and I ended up buying it this year. The roadblock was the price point.Positives- Build quality is good. The feel is nice.- The clip stays on its place, doesn't slip away or tilt.Negatives- I used it for two days: 1 day at my work and 1 day one my domestic flight and meeting with my friends. Of the 1840 photos, I am yet to find a single worthy photo.- I have still not been able to view the pictures on the iPhone Narrative Clip app. (I have to first copy the photos to my computer and then connect it to internet to be available on a cloud, from where I will download it to my phone?) I guess that is the process.- I am still not able to reset the clip to factory default.- In Windows 7 all raw images are tilted by 90 degrees.- The clip occupies 1.33 GB of space with 11 days of use (see screenshot)I hope they have fixed all these issues with the new version.
