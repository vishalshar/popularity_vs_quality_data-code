I got this on sale for $30 and this thing is still ridiculously overpriced at the regular price of $40. The orbitkey itself works as expected but was not impressed at all with the quality at this pricepoint. Leather is thin, feels and looks cheap and the actual screws that hold the keys are made of plastic. I was expecting top shelf leather and hardware. Contemplating returning and just making one myself that would probably cost $10.
