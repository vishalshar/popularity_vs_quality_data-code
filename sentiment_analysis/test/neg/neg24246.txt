This thing has not worked correctly since day one.  It would tell me my dog was within the Whistle range even when she was 90 miles from home.  When it did work it would only update every 4 minutes or less and my dog can travel a great distance in those few minutes making this tracker pretty much useless.  The final straw was when, after just 2 weeks, the battery won't charge.  After reading the horror stories of others who had to endure Whistle's crummy support staff I decided it's not worth it to have them troubleshoot this so its going back to Amazon.  I['m hoping WUF will be available soon which has all the features you could ever want in a pet tracker.01/12/17:  Amazon sent me a replacement and it also has the same issues as listed above.  This product is clearly not reliable.  Just look at all the Amazon warehouse deals that has used units for sale and you'll see that people are fed up with this thing not working as advertised.
