This is one of those sad cases where the size of the product is not at all clear from the pictures online.  I couldn't believe how tiny this thing was.  Technically my fault for not noticing the 0.85oz part, but seriously, why would anyone purposefully buy toothpaste in such a small container unless it's for travel purposes?  And it wasn't labeled as being travel-size.Also, the toothpaste itself isn't good.  It tastes weird, it's grainy, and it doesn't seem to do a good job at cleaning my teeth, let alone whitening them.  Massive fail on all fronts.  Will not buy again.
