I ordered a female kit, and received a kit that was labeled 'female' on the barcode, but had another sticker that said 'Male' on the other side. I didn't notice the discrepancy until after I had completed the kit, so I mailed it in anyway.  I received my results email. The results said "Test Not Performed". There is no other information on the website as to why.  Needless to say, I'm pretty irritated. I contacted the company to find out why the test wasn't performed. I confirmed that I ordered the correct kit. I wish there was something somewhere that explained why my results were "Test Not Performed".Update - MyLab responded to my emails and replaced the kit with the correct kit at no charge.
