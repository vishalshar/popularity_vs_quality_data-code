As others have mentioned motion detection is way too sensitive even at lowest setting resulting in endless false alerts rendering the product useless. I tried numerous locations away from doors and windows.  It seems counter intuitive to have a security camera that can't monitor a door, right? I even set it up in a large cardboard box and still got false alerts. I contacted support by phone and they answered quickly, were easy to talk to, and offered a possible fix.  I followed their instructions but it still is returning false alerts at least a couple times per hour. I contacted them again by email and got no response.  Also, never did get laser to work and the camera makes odd clicking noises from time to time for no obvious reason which again is not a particularly desirable quality for a security camera or a baby monitor for that matter. I wanted to like this product but there are just too many issues with it to "make it work".
