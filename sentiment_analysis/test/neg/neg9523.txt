Don't buy this product!!!!  Set up is impossible as there is no PC set-up wizard and the firmware could not be upgraded due to IP issues.  I went through the set-up process countless times and on the final step, it just won't connect to my router.  I have spoken to the help line on several occasions but still no success.  One more try and then Amazon will be receiving a return.  I hate this product!!!!!  Don't buy it...save yourself from grief!!!And dare I forget to mention that MyDlink software is not compatible with Windows 10 browsers and multiple others.  If you run these, an older browser will have to be used (no 64).
