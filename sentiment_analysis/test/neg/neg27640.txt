wow be prepared for the most unreliable product to ever hit the market. my dell tablet is more reliable than this thing. I give 2 stars because when it works, it just works. Well, aside from the app being super slow to load and search for devices... albeit it still works. But for random reasons unexplained, the outlet will become not connected to the network, and the only way you can get it back on the network is to pull it out and plug it back in. Not even pressing the physical buttons on the outlet will reconnect it... it seriously needs a pull out and in maneuver. So... at a time you want to activate it, and you are not near the outlet, you are out of luck until you go back to the outlet and physically 'reset' it. This is horrendous for a product that sells itself for automation... just hope that if you have something you absolutely need turned on remotely, that it will be connected when you need to. Myself, I use it as remote garage door opener to let guests in when I am not around. The fact that I can't rely on this defeats the purpose of why I bought it... but hell it works sometimes, I just have to cross my fingers, and even when it works, I would do a hard reset the morning of if I am sure I will need to activate it
