This phone started out with potential. It seemed decent for the price and was easy to use. Then it started acting up in various ways that made it unusable. It shuts me out of apps and recently, the lower third of the screen's alignment has gotten off to the point where it is unusable. It also managed to change the person I am texting when I type in a name, despite selecting the person I wish to contact. The battery also sometimes gets dislodged with no tampering. My warranty expired recently and now I'm without a phone. Thanks...
