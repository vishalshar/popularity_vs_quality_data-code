I bought talkie for my daughter and for my niece for Christmas. I checked the FAQ befor buying them which says "Can my talkie connect to multiple wifi networks? YES, IT CAN. Hit the 'Change wifi password' in your child's profile to change it's wifi network and follow the on screen instructions."But after buying them and trying to figure out how to set them up so that my niece and daughter can seamlessly take their talkies to their regular haunts: Home, Grandmas House, and the Babysitters Home I contacted Toymail and the real answer is a big fat N-O!"At this point in time, they would need to change the wifi EVERY TIME the Talkie changes households.We are working on an update where the Talkie will remember multiple WiFi networks, but DON'T HAVE A TIMELINE for this development."So much for soon. They are cute, but they only get 2 stars because, without constant fiddling, our kids have talkies that don't work 2/3 of the time. ?
