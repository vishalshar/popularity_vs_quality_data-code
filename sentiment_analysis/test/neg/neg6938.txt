For a start: there is nothing easy or simple about this product. The website (which is ViaWay) for the TV content is riddled with typos, dead ends, and the "channels" they provide can be streamed free of charge without subscription. In fact, I have fiber coming directly into my home and the ViaWay channels (accessed via my Smart TV, not this terribly designed plastic box) will load for 15 seconds and then freeze or loop a 5 second segment endlessly. So, save your subscription money.This is not a device that will work anywhere but the United States. It reads like it will in the description, but it will not. And if you try to use it simply as a media player, the damn thing keeps interrupting to ask why you haven't scanned for TV channels.
