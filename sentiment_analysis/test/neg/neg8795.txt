I really wanted this to work well. I am not an artist and don't really need pressure sensitivity, so I thought this would work for me, especially considering it costs much less than the competition and seems to be getting fairly widespread support in IOS apps. However, it disappointed.First of all, even getting it to work at all is a challenge. The connection is buggy and when it cuts out, the palm rejection is lost and so you smudge whatever you are writing on. They advertise it as being simple to pair as you press the nib down in a circle in the app you want it to connect to. However, I had to try over and over and over again to get it to connect. They must know it is a problem because right there in the connection dialog it has all these things to try to get it to connect if it fails. Not very confidence inspiring. I had to reset the pen on two occasions to get it to work and on another, I tried replacing the nib to get it to work and this did it. These are two of the things they say to try to do if it doesn't connect at first. That is a lot of trouble and it didn't just happen twice. It happened every time I tried to use it with the Paper app which is their native app.Surprisingly, it worked a little better with OneNote. At least the connection worked every time with OneNote, but the experience using it wasn't much better than a dollar store stylus. The palm rejection was nice of course, until it lost its connection. Fortunately this only happened once though and then it worked okay in OneNote.Secondly, it seems quite fragile as some others have pointed out in their reviews. Not the pen shaft itself, but the nib. It appears to be no tougher than your standard decent quality capacitive stylus so it is very soft and pliable and therefore you will need replacements. They do provide one in the box, but if you want more, they are $15 each.It could be that the unit I got was simply defective and not indicative of the experience of most people, but the connection issues combined with the thought of having to spend $15 on new nibs periodically really turned me off to this. If they could get their connection issues fixed and toughen up the nib I would take a second look, but until then I will keep looking for a good stylus and just use my fingers in the meantime.
