I don't know what they are doing with people that gave it 5 stars but I have had the watch for 5 weeks and have not been happy with it a single day after the set up.  I walk 3 miles a day and walk to work and do general housekeeping etc.  Days that other trackers worn side by side gave me 9k to 13k this one gave me 2k to 5k.When I reached out to customer service with screenshots of trackers AND GPS data the answer was that they limit the false reading on steps because of arm movement.  When I am carrying a laptop my arm does not swing.  I counted steps when I did swing my arm.  175 steps.  other tracker got 172; the Withings...84.  A trip to Costco where I parked as far away as I could to get steps...other tracker: 3126...Withings: 642.I asked three weeks ago on the status for software improvements for such a key feature...no answer.  I would return it if I could.Gave it two stars for the looks and ease of checking steps IF it worked, as well as functionality of setting the time correctly itself and updating for Daylight Saving Time.
