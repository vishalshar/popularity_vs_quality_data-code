I just received the drive I ordered from Amazon today.  The exterior of the packaging clearly states that the drive is 512GB.  However, the operating system reports that the drive has a total capacity of 480,101,003,264 bytes, which is nowhere near 512GB. Mind you, this is *total* capacity, not even free space.This is not an issue of 1K = 1024 bytes. If anything, using that math would make this drive 447GB.At the very best this drive could be claimed to be 480GB, not 512GB.  It's incredibly deceitful, and it shouldn't be advertised as such.
