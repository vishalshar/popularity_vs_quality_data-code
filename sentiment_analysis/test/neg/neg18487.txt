See further down review for my more recent opinion.*I'm pretty impressed by this device. As a remote, it gets around 4 to 4.5 stars. It's replacing a Logitech Harmony One which is biodegrading and has been discontinued (otherwise, I'd get another). The setup is very easy. The method for setting up macros is a more than a bit non-intuitive, it takes a while to figure it out. There really needs to be an instruction manual for this thing, despite the current trend to leave it to the customers to try to figure things out. There just isn't any substitute for a nicely done, printed manual for consumer products.There doesn't seem to be a huge battery drain when in operation, and I like the fact that I can have it paired with two phones and two tablets (one each of Android and IOS) and switch between them and have the system work seamlessly. All changes to the control screens such as adding/moving/renaming buttons get reflected in all the paired devices very quickly.On the minus side, I'm pretty disappointed in the integration with the Amazon echo. You must use one of several dozen pre-built phrases to control things although you can assign pretty much any function to them. They claim that to get a new control phrase implemented, you must request it from customer support. The rationale for this sort of holds water, but stillÂ…There's also a hiccup once in a while when pressing a function key where I get a pop-up that says something to the effect that a function hasn't been assigned to that key and asks if I want to assign one. If I press Yes, it takes me to the list of functions for that key and I have no clue what I'm supposed to do then. This product needs a Users Guide.On the plus side: I found that my HDMI switcher box wasn't supported, so I dropped an email to Blumoo Support, and quickly received a reply that they would submit it to the programming team. The next day I got an email that the device had been added and the database update had been pushed to my device(s). Sure enough, it had been updated. Better than average support/service.With a nice manual and better Echo interface/integration, this could very well be one of the very few five-star reviews I've written. But it's not there yet.I'm mildly p*ssed that two weeks after I bought mine, the price dropped $20.*EDIT:After six months of off-and-on use, my review has changed from 4 stars to 1 star. No update has been issued for the IOS or Android apps to fix the bugs as was promised. The Echo integration is too cumbersome and incomplete for me to use. The user interface is pretty non-intuitive, I have to learn it all over again every time I need to change something (for example, getting a new A/V receiver). I'm discouraged by the reports here that Customer Support has apparently disappeared.I'm not convinced that the idea of using your smartphone/tablet for a controller is a good idea, unless you have an old one that you can dedicate to running the software. By the time I pick up my phone, enter the PIN, run the app, get to the screen I need, I could have picked up a more unsophisticated remote and done the job. And possibly made a cup of tea.It's easier to use my $14 RCA 8 device universal remote that has no display.
