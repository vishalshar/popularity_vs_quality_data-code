took longer to set up then indicated.  upon contacting support when it got stuck updating was told it would take 30-40 minutes to update itself.  Only had it for 4 days and it was offline 2 of the days i had it (for no apparent reason, wi-fi was still working and all other connected devices were working). good looking piece of tech but needs more development. When it did work it was great, good picture quality and alerted when my daughter stopped by and i was not there. But there was no way to get it back on line until i got  home.  There are other devices that preform the same function for half the $$$.
