I purchased this phone on impulse at a Lightning deal I just couldn't pass up. After owning this phone for over 2 weeks, I am ready to write my review. I upgraded from a 2014 LG 90 with Android 4.4.2 KitKat and the difference is substantial.  Much clearer and higher resolution, snappier response, better sound, better camera, and much faster and more reliable GPS. The latest android version of Marshmallow is much much better than KitKat and I believe makes a huge difference in performance and user experience. I am using T-mobile and the phone is perfectly compatible with this service.Below are my reviews based on different areas of the Robin's hardware and performance.GRAPHICS:  I will give this a 9 out of 10 rating. Display has crystal clear high resolution.  I'm happy with the Marshmallow's UI transparent overlays. Screen is bright and easily adjustable. Colors are vibrant, but not overbearing.  Games play smoothly and GPU navigation runs beautifully.PROCESSOR: I will give this a 10 out of 10 rating. The CPU is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, which is usually found in high performance smartphones.  It is very fast at 2GHz 64 bit and more than adequate for multi-tasking.SOUND:  I will give this a 8.5 out of 10 rating. The two front speakers have pretty good sound and can get fairly loud.  I haven't had any issues with crackling as others have reported.  I believe bug fixes has solved this. The speaker phone works very good and reception is both loud and clear while talking.USER INTERFACE:  10 out of 10 rating.  I very much like the UI. The phone comes WITHOUT all the junk apps like my LG phone did.  Notifications can be set to pop up on your screensaver which I find useful for work emails. The settings areas took a little while to get use to, but are setup well. If you swipe down twice from the top, you can see your batteries remaining charge percentage and all the options are large clickable icons to turn on/off  Wifi, Bluetooth, Cellular data, Location, Hotspot, Cast, Flashlight, Airplane mode, Auto-rotate, and Do not disturb mode.GPS:  9 out of 10 rating. Very good. Not sure if it is the newer Marshmallow version or just the phones hardware, but it is at least 4 times faster than my old LG phone.  The signal picks up very quickly and stays consistent.HOTSPOT PERFORMANCE: 10 out of 10 rating.  Excellent!  In case you were wondering like me about the hotspot feature, it works excellent and devices connect to it easily.  I used it almost daily for the first week and had no issues what-so-ever.CAMERA:  I haven't used this enough to give a good review.  But the rear camera seems decent and much better than my older phone. The front camera is just ok.HEAT: I will give this a 3 out of 10 rating. The only issue I found, which isn't that much of a issue to me, is that under loads, the phone can heat up quickly.  Since I don't play graphic intensive games on my phone, this doesn't concern me that much. But I do think there is need for heat improvement for future releases.BATTERY / CHARGE TIME: I will give this a 7 out of 10 rating.  I found the battery can sometimes drain quickly (while gaming).  But overall, I think it is pretty good.  If you're not running many apps at once or using graphic intensive games, the battery lasts all day long.  After trying some battery savings apps out, I decided to remove Battery Doctor and Clean Sweep, as they seem to only drain your battery more and I don't recommend using them.  The battery charges very quickly (about 2 hours from 7%).  I found the included USB cord to be too short (only 3 feet long), so I ordered 6' long cord from Amazon for around $10.  I also am using my old LG charger for this phone and it works perfectly.BUILD QUALITY: (UPDATED) I will give this a 2 out of 10 rating. The build quality is below average for this price range.  Because the phone is quite thin, I would recommend getting a hard case to prevent future accidents.  It does seem more fragile than my old LG phone. You can also get a glass screen protector for around $8 on Amazon, which I recommend.10/28 Update:  Due to flat top surface, the Glass screen cracks very easily.  Cracked twice in less than 2 months!  The body is completely plastic with no metal.  Completely Failed the bend test - search youtube videos on this.BODY DESIGN:  I will give this a 9 out of 10 rating.  I have received some compliments on the phone and it has been described as futuristic looking.  I do like that it is different from every other generic looking phone on the market.  At first I wasn't sure about the Mint color, but it has really grown on me and I really like the two tone color scheme (white with mint stripes).FINGERPRINT SENSOR:  I will give this a 9 out of 10 rating.  I found that the only times it has rarely failed is after getting my hands wet from washing dishes.  In my "scientific opinion", I believe the moisture in your hands may temporarily distort your fingerprints from expansion in the skin membranes.  After my hands dried, the issue disappeared completely.  When setting it up, the sensor reads your fingerprint from many different angles. So be sure to provide it upside down (something I did not do, but recommend).CLOUD FEATURE:  Even though this is one of the phone's distinguishing features, I haven't set it up yet.  I think it is a great idea, but since T-mobile hotspot is my only internet connection, I don't want to use up all my limited data on uploading / reloading from Cloud.FINAL CONCLUSION:I am very happy with my upgrade from my old phone. The Robin's price tag is excellent for a modern phone with this many features and I highly recommend it. My only gripe is the phone does not have a SD slot and doesn't come with a wall charger. Nextbit also seems to want to please their customers and since the company is newly established, listens to customers' opinions and focuses on improvements.UPDATE 10/28: CHANGED FROM 5 TO 2 STARSAfter owning the phone for less than two months the screen has cracked twice!  I'm not accident prone and very careful with all my electronic devices.  In over 10 years I never cracked a cell phone screen before until I got this one.  Due to the awkward size and shape of the phone, it is very easy to drop and crack the screen.  First time I had a glass screen protector on it, which cracked once it feel face down in the parking lot. It protected the actual screen, but sure enough I dropped it again 2 weeks later when pulling it out of my pocket and it shattered the actual screen! Reason being that it is bulky and the corners are sharp and square, which will easily snag on the inside of your front pockets if your not careful.  I had a hard case on it, but because the front is so flat with no lip, the glass will easily come in contact with the ground.It is also conclusive to say that the glass is very thin and not of durable quality, because both times the phone fell no more than 3 feet from the ground. Note that the first time, the $4 glass screen protector (only 0.3mm) thick only had two small cracks, but the actual screen almost shattered during the 2nd drop, both falling from the same height and same fashion (face down) onto asphalt.So now matter how careful you think you are, you are bound to eventually drop your phone, and with this one, your screwed if it falls face down.  There are no replacement screens you can buy online and no hard cases available that offer adequate protection for the screen. I contacted Nextbit and found out the repair is $99 plus you pay shipping.  That's $99 for a screen that doesn't even match the $4 glass screen protector!  I rather spend that money on a different phone with better build design and quality.Poor build quality: The body of the phone is also completely plastic with no metal inside or out.  This phone completely failed the bend test as demonstrated on youtube (you can search for this).  Even budget phones much cheaper are better built and more durable.The phone also has a major overheating problem. One minute in the sun, expect it to start overheating.  Run any game app and expect it to start overheating.  Download a update or app more than 5MB in size and expect it to get very hot.
