These liners leak everywhere.  I think the leakage may have permanently saturated our tile, because I threw the entire system out two weeks ago, mopped, had cleaners pay a visit. And still, whew. Yuck. The Additional Liner that ScoopFree provides, just collects spilled over litter from first liner, creating this screeching noise when the scraper runs, which then causes the scraper not to run at all. Sadly, My husband wins $5 on this one.
