I bought this product a couple of months ago for a high-quality music system that I own.  I did not open it until months after I got it because I did not try the music system until then.  When I opened it, I plugged it in and nothing happened. No lights, No sound.  I tried to return it but the return window is now closed and now I am stuck with a 200 dollar paperweight.
