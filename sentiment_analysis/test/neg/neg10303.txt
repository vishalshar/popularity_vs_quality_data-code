I give two stars only so people don't write me off as one of those 1 star people. But I wore these for a 2 hour session one day. Took them off on a mat. Washed them in cold water right away. Wore them for a 2 hour session the next day. Looked at them after getting out of the water and theres a hole in both the stitching between the toes. I'm sure this is the case with EVERY pair out there.  They're just made poorly.  There is no reason to have the seam split there in 5 hours of use.
