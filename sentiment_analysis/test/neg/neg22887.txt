For the price, I was expecting A LOT more than 1 plastic lid. (Somehow I thought there were going to be more than just one?).  Okay, getting past that point, it appears to be nothing more than cheap plastic, and to my horror the reviews of the seal leaking.  Firstly, I will replace the seal, secondly, there has to be more to this product that what is it.. Just plastic.  I intended to use it for fresh-made salsas to pour on to tacos and such trying to reduce spillage and mess..  Well.. I guess I am going to have to stick this one out and chock it up for one over-priced plastic lid.  Disappointed.
