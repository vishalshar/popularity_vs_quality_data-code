The packet of seed mix was not enclosed. I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It was the very first item on her wish list. Talk about disappointment when a six year old opens her gift, excited to plant her garden, only to find out that she can't because the seeds aren't even there. Thanks a lot. Product is pretty useless without the seeds.
