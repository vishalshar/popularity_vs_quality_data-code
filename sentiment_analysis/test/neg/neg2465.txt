I saw a version of this game being played online and thought it would be fun to play with adults.The box was crushed when received and that disappointed me right away.  When I opened the game and read the cards I became even more disappointed.  The phrases don't make sense and make it hard to guess.  I realize that is the point of the game, but I feel the phrases are not fun or funny for the game.I also had the problem of misspelled phrases and words which makes the game frustrating to play.I do not recommend this version if the game.
