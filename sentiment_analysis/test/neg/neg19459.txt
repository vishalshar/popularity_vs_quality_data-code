I bought this scanner specifically to scan clay models. I had been using 123D Catch and wanted something more precise. This was not the solution I was expecting.Pros- Compact- (Relatively) Inexpensive- Easy to set upCons- Most objects need to be scanned multiple times in multiple orientations, meaning it won't work on unbaked clay- Loud- Slow- Requires a lot of time and technical know-how to clean up scans before they're usable- Very little documentation on how to tweak the scanner for optimal performance- Scans limited to the size of the turntableOverall I was disappointed with this product. Setup was easy: unfold it, plug it in, install the software, and turn it on. On windows 10, this was relatively painless, though I was disappointed to see that the installation installed vanilla Arduino communication drivers. Calibration worked fine and I jumped right into scanning my clay models.The first scan took a few hours, and I got a half-completed point cloud. After some googling (it's not clear in the instructions) I realized you had to perform multiple scans to get a complete model. This wasn't possible since my model was clay, unbaked, and hence could only stand in one orientation (I prefer unbaked clay so I can make changes). This was disappointing. This is because there are 2 lasers that are at a fixed angle and a camera that is at a fixed angle. If a laser AND the camera can't see part of the model, it's not recorded, and this resulted in only around 70% of my model being scanned.The software outputs quite a few formats, which is nice, but nothing really usable right away. So don't expect to "scan and print." It's going to be, "scan, clean with meshlab, import to blender, spend a couple hours cleaning up, and print." Depending on the complexity of the model, some areas may be completely unscannable and you'll be eyeballing it. That's really the most disappointing part: if I wanted to eyeball it, I wouldn't have bought a scanner. -_-The software was simple to set up, but offered very few advanced options and almost no documentation on how to use the advanced options. Laser / Camera orientation means there's a lot of guesswork in setting up multiple scans, and sometimes it seems impossible to get it to scan certain areas of a model.They recommend using ambient light, but the scan takes so long that the ambient light in the room changes and the scan comes out multi-colored, so unless you're sitting in a room with no windows, don't expect the colors to be correct or consistent. This also can makes it hard to align multiple scans to make a complete model.I can't recommend this product. The only reason it doesn't get 1 star is because it does actually work: it just doesn't work well. It's slow, loud, and unwieldly, and currently 123D catch still does a better job of capturing my models, and it's FREE. Hopefully the continue to improve the product, but I may just end up returning mine for a refund: I can't see myself ever using it again, and for $500, I expected something I could use. This product may be something YOU can use, just be aware of its limitations.It makes a lot more sense to have a fixed model and a mobile camera than the other way around, so I'm not sure what kind of future this concept has.
