I ordered this for a very sick 11 year old furry love that had renal failure.Dogs with renal failure have a hard time eating sometimes as they are nauseated so much.Everything I read about green beef tripe stated that no dog had ever turned it down.My sick dog would not eat it.I was so hoping she would.
