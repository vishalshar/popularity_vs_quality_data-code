Intentions were to use this on a cats collar while having them outside (supervised). The bluetooth only works within approximately 30 feet. If they are out of range, aka  the far end of the yard the tracking becomes useless. Also even when within range the (hot cold) tracking is terrible. The cat will be right next to me and say  2 bars, will walk away and register 3-4 bars. Not accurate at all. The only use I can see for this is to ping (get an audible alert) for an object that is going to stay in a general location (i.e. keys, phone, remote, wallet).
