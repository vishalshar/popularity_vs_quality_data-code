No good. Stopped charging my iPhone suddenly. There doesn't appear to be any damage to the cable, it simply stopped working. I bought two of these. The second one is still working so far. My "return window" just closed a couple weeks ago. I'm going to attempt a return with the manufacturer that claims to provide a lifetime warranty. I'll update the results of that.
