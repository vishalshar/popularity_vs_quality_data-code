The Temperature supposed to stay the steady (especially after 20 hours of cooking) but instead it goes high and low as it pleases....I ruined one too many roasts to find out, the issue is with the machine not me. temperature should stay steady and not go up and down...very disappointed, im not sure if its the brand or a lemon. Ill try the other brand now i guess....
