I am very disappointed with this phone.  While the phone may be okay no one mentioned that the network they use is Verizon.  I cannot get Verizon service at my house.  We live in a Verizon and AT&T dead zone.  Also this phone does not have a removable SIM card so everything I have on this phone will be lost when I get rid of it. (And I will get rid of it.)  Some of the information is important. I had a very difficult time getting this phone set up to use.  It took several phone calls with the Great Call people and I don't think it should have been such a problem.  I should have known that the good price I paid had some kind of strings attached.  Think twice before getting involved with the Jitterbug phones.  Make sure you can get Verizon service.
