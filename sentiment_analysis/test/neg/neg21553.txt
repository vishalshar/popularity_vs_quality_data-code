The iFetch worked great for the first 4 weeks with occasional use by our dog (twice a week). At 5 weeks, the iFetch would only throw one ball, and would not throw any repeat balls without unplugging it and restarting. Of course, this is exactly one week after the manufacturer offers a replacement model. We are very disappointed we wonÂ’t be able to replace the item to see if we just got one bad model, or if it is the product overall that is flawed.
