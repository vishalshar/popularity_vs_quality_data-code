Cool drone, but now likely outdated technology and too expensive. Very poor customer service sabotages any other positive part of the ownership experience.I bought this back in June and had a few flights with it. Eventually I needed new/spare landing gear which isn't very surprising, but it's been four months since I ordered my landing gear direct from AirDog. I still have had no landing gear shipped to me despite numerous contacts with AirDog customer service.Effectively, I don't own a drone so much as a $1600 paperweight.
