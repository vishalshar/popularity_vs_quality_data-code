I bought these for my Cutters Rev Pro gloves and they actually made the gloves less stickier when I applied it with a dime sized amount. I tried again a few days later and it still weren't sticky, so I put a quarter size amount and they still were not sticky. I don't know if I got a bad batch or something but I do not recommend these.
