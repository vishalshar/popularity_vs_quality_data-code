Lots of problems with this item.  Notifications have a significant delay from when it leaves the tracking area.  I can live with that but the device stopped charging after about two weeks.  I can't get any of the buttons on the tracker to work and no light comes on while it is plugged into the charger.  I think I may just have an $80 paperweight.
