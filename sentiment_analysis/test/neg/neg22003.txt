At the end of the day, the Portal router is a competent AC 2400 router from a hardware perspective. But it doesn't live up to its marketing hype, and is missing the majority of features that high-end routers have. If you live in a crowded neighborhood, and don't have a router that supports 5Ghz or 5Ghz with DFS channels, buy a new router. But if you already have a modern-ish router, e.g. the last few years, the Portal is limited to the same transmit power as every other router out there, so don't expect significant improvements in coverage/range or speed compared to what you have today.Pros:- Easy setup- Generally strong RF performance, I see an improvement of a few dBm on both the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz channels compared to an Asus RT-AC68U- Good hardware set, the latest Qualcomm Atheros chipsets (no surprise given the team's background), MU-MIMO support, etc.- If radar is detected, the Portal will move you to another DFS channel if possible vs. moving you to a non-DFS channel. A cool feature, and unfortunately really the only differentiating factor of the Portal vs what's available from Netgear/Linksys/etcCons:- I know they're adding more features, but this router is BAREBONES. Basic features like parental controls, QoS, VPN, IPv6, band steering, VLAN, static IP, etc. aren't present. If you've ever logged into your router to do something, there's a high likelihood the Portal doesn't support what you need yet- The web UI is clean, but there's zero analytics, configuration, or data available.- The mobile app is even more barebones than the web UI, and doesn't natively support iPhone Plus screen sizes- Plastic Ethernet ports...unacceptable at the $200 price point- New company without a proven track record. It's hard to differentiate in this space, and when I'm shelling out $200 I don't want to be a guinea pig. I'd rather go with a name brand company that's been around for a while, vs. buying first generation hardware from a new company- Somehow I got a dark red/burgundy model, not the white one in the pictures...
