You have to be very close to the device before your phone will see it.  I set it on the highest power (which shorten's it's battery life) and the first couple of times I have lost my keys, I was almost on top of my keys before my phone saw it.  It was quicker just to look for them.  I have Quickset bluetooth front door lock and every time the lock is used, it sets off the beeper on the Aware device.  The app tries to do too much and isn't that intuitive.It is small and does not get in the way, and if nothing else, it's acts as kind of a placebo effect knowing that if I really had a hard time finding my lost keys, then I know that at least I have this device it to help me maybe find them.
