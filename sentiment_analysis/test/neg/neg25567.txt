Based on the description of the kit, we had high hopes that it would turn out to be a fascinating and endlessly replayable toy.  Unfortunately, it turned out not to be the case.  The kit arrived in good order except for a single broken component (a button) which was kindly and quickly replaced by the manufacturer.  Unfortunately, the kit fascinated us (an adult and his 10 year old daughter) for about two hours and since then it has sat in a corner untouched.I think the reason for this is that the kit is limited in the sorts of circuits that it can create - the packaging promises millions of different combinations and although this is mathematically true, the number of combinations that create an interesting circuit is much more limited.  Basically you can create a single series circuit OR you can take up to three single series circuits and put them into a single parallel circuit.The cost of the components is also an issue.  The kit comes with just one of most things (one button, one LED, one slider, etc) and if you have an idea that requires two of something, you'll need to order an extra component but the cost of a single component is quite high - high enough to make it not worthwhile to order it (check out the current price list on littlebits.cc).I would direct your attention to the Snapcircuits series of toys/kits.  They are less flashy than Littlebits but are much more replayable.  They kept my daughter's attention for days at a time and were much less expensive than the Littlebits.  They also offer much more in the way of flexibility in terms of designing your own circuits.
