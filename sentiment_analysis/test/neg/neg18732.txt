what a ripoff. this thing quit working properly within one day! won't even go into pairing mode so i can connect it to my phone. when i was briefly working the range was very poor before it dropped out. i found another set of cordless earbuds for fifty dollars that work perfectly. they don't have the so called gesture controls this thing has, but they work. sending these back.
