Short review: it functioned mostly as described, but the breathing algorithms didn't match my internal state, meaning it isn't much help to me personally.I thought about ordering this for months, holding off due to the mixed reviews.  I was intrigued, though- people on the autism spectrum often have difficulty recognizing and regulating their emotions, and I think biofeedback tools like this could be useful in this area.  For me, I am often anxious, and thought that more self-awareness and better breathing habits could help me deal with negative emotions.Pros:Attractive designComfortable to wearEasy to set up and understandThe breathing wave is fun/useful to watchI liked the reminders to get up and move after I had been sitting at my desk too longHandy to have step counter without keeping my phone in my pocketCons:I tried the first guided breathing exercise, and even with that it was hard to get it to say my breathing was calm.  Almost all of my "streaks" said I was focused.  In the few days I tested this, it only recorded me being tense twice - when I was soothing a baby and when I was practicing guitar.  But the final moment that made me decide to send it back was when it told me I was in the middle of a "Calm streak" when I was fighting off tears at work one day.  The system's algorithms simply don't work for me in a meaningful way - if it's going to tell me my breathing is calm when I'm very upset, there is no way for me to use it to improve my psychological/emotional state.
