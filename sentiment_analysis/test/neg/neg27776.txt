The hardware looks nice enough being solid and physically functional.  I can say that the setup is far too complicated.  The PC/MAC must be connected to Wifi not wired.  Next the Java support in browsers is becoming far too complicated and the API is not supported in current versions of Chrome browser.  The Microsoft Windows 10 browser is also not supported.  Older versions of IE didn't seem to work nor Firefox even going through all the Java installs, ID creation and related.  There must be a better install routine which I would suggest be done with a built in web server.  But in any case, I give the product a fail until the install is far more streamlined.  This is a product that I really want to love but it needs more development love before that can happen.
