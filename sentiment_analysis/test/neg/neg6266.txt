I had high hopes based upon the research and other reviews. Although this tDCS has the benefit of an app that guides you through, I did not experience the benefits advertised or reported by other tDCS units that require a bit more know how. It's a balance here - Thync has very limited montages (like 3) and limited use and VERY expensive conductive tapes, other tDCS units offer difficult to figure "maps" on electrode placement but many more montages and use sponges rather than conductive gel tape. I recommend waiting until Thync offers up more variety of montages and comes up with an alternative to the expensive conductive gel tapes. I returned mine and purchased a less expensive but harder to figure out model.
