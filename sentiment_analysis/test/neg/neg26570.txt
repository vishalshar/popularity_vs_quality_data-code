Couldn't get this to work when I opened it.  It would not connect to my wireless network.  Upon further investigation Roost was aware of this problem and sent me new modules for free, which did fix the problem.  Then, once I got them installed in my smoke detectors, the batteries would not power the alarms - I couldn't test the alarms, no lights lit up, the alarms acted as if there was no battery in them at all.  Returned this product for a Nest Alarm and love it!
