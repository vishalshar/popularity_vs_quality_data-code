These were a major disappointment!  My husband has a 2013 Toyota Tundra.  Okay, the side view mirrors do have a "defrost" feature, but I thought it would save a bunch of time to have these on in the first place.  BEWARE:  They in NO WAY begin to fit over the mirrors.  They would have had to be at least half again as much bigger to fit over the mirrors.So ... I call Amazon to return them ... and they are deemed UNRETURNABLE!  I did finally get my money refunded, but that's just ridiculous.They really should come with a warning about what side mirrors they fit.  I'm sure it's a great product otherwise. I wouldn't know.
