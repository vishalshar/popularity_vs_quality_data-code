I hvent actually tried it so I dont know if I like it or not, I bought this and after reading reviews saw that I need to also buy the VR headset..which is now on the description of the product that it is not included, but did not say that when I purchased. Jeez, I 100 percent would have expected it to say SOLD SEPERATLY ...Im happy I can return it.. but Im just highly aggravated because it was a Christmas present and with a week left I dont have an extra 600.00 laying around. I could have put it on layaway or something if it the product had been properly labeled...I guess thats my problem now. What the heck guys! ....this is horrible business.
