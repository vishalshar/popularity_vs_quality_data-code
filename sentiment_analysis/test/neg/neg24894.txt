This item is junk. I bought it when it was 75% off, thinking well even if its not super amazing. At least it will be kind of neat to monkey with. Since it was only 70$s or so. That was not the case. I got the thing and it wouldn't turn on. I contacted support, and the first time you want to use it you need to charge it for a whole day before it will turn on. Nothing about that in the instructions. Anyways - I guess this is a result from them not really selling so they have been sitting on the shelf for years and the battery has completely discharged. The second issue I had when it finally started charging was that when I took pictures it was all psychadelic colors. I contacted support yet again, and they are telling me it is because of loose wires... and I have to exchange it. Aside from this, the picture quality is terrible, even when in 'focus' they're bad and you can only really share your pictures on facebook or their website. Which yeah I understand its a new format, but maybe they should work to get it common enough to be able to open it on common operating systems.However due to the obvious issues with their QA, the terrible picture quality, and the non-sale price(wouldn't pay more then 30-40$s for it) I wouldn't buy it. It isn't a camera, it is a toy. You're not going to take any decent pictures you'll want to keep with it. It's more like one of those cameras you see in a hardware store they want to get you to buy for cheap. The image quality reminds me of a VGA webcam.
