I purchased the expensive item because it was suppose to be an emergency radio.  Had it been an emergency, I would have been SOL.  The emergency radio did not work.  It was fully charged and failed.  Quality control should have flagged the problem and corrected it, especially since it was suppose to be for emergency situations.  I do not recommend this product because it failed when needed.
