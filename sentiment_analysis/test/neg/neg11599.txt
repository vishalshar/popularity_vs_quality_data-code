Update: 9/11/16 So I've been using this for two weeks. Today my 9-year-old said "The wifi is terrible. It's worse than before." The management issues below in my original review are annoying, but there are so many issues with wifi that I never had before with my old single Asus router: dropped connections on devices, random slow downs, difficulty transferring large files. On the exact same FireTV, connected to the same exact NAS, videos and files now buffer and stutter like crazy. Netflix and Amazon streaming video will degrade and pause while watching, this never happened with my old router. I'm switching back to my old router, but will monitor for firmware updates and try it again in a few months.I was really excited about this and preordered. I'm a long time Asus user and consider myself pretty handy when it comes to hardware and networking. I have a 3 story house, so the Asus doesn't have great coverage and with kids and tons of devices, I was looking forward to solid coverage and easy management tools.I bought a 3 pack and the packaging was really nice, apple quality. Downloaded the app and setup was really easy. But once it got going, the complaints came up. I don't get strong coverage around and through walls. I have one unit on the edge of my master bedroom and only get 2/4 bars in my bathroom about 30 feet away.The management is really lacking. There is no web admin screen like most routers. There only an app. I've only used the iOS version. The app is really basic. You can't view traffic. You can't view devices online. There's no way to find device info (IP, MAC, device name). All you get is a list of devices with partial device names, but not always. So I see 19 devices, most with non-sensical names that don't equate to anything in the actual device info, although iPhones show up with device names and 1 out of 3 kindles. But xbox, firetv, roku, bluray, old iphones all show up without any way to tell which is which.You can assign devices to users. But are only able to turn off the internet for all users at a time. This is a neat feature to pause the internet. But not so great if it turns off yours as well as the kids at bed time.Oddly, you are forced to use "cloud" administration. I really don't want to admin my local network through the internet. Rather troubling actually as there is no benefit to me, and I really rather prefer local network administration only.It's a neat idea and I suppose some of these problems can be fixed. Especially if they make the app usable and add a browser interface. But paying this much for a wifi router and having less performance than my 5 year old router is a bit of a disappointment.
