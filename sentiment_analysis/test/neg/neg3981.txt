Warning: the "clamps" holding the artificial grass down are made of plastic. There hasn't been a day yet that our 14 week old puppies have not chewed them off the loo leaving the grass as an easy target for play. I usually come in to find it partially or sometimes completely removed from the base and little pieces of grass scattered about. This is gross since our female Dane actually does use the loo faithfully. Our male Dane will not use it. All things considered, the loo does save me from having to clean up shredded puppy pads. However, for the $$ I expected something more durable.
