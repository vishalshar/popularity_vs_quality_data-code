The watch is nice looking, seems to be well made with a nice appearance. It's bare-bones as far as what it does (which is what I was looking for). The big, big problem I had with the watch was two-fold; the battery would just not hold a charge. I had to re charge the watch a couple times a day, with minimal activity. Also, I had problems with the watch losing blue tooth connection, and a very unresponsive touch screen for navigating. I'm sure there are much better for the money. Ended up returning.
