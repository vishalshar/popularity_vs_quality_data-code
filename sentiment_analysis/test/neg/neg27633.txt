ThIs stuff is so dilute that it is difficult to taste the flavor. I used an entire sampler of the white cheddar on the amount of popcorn result8 ng from 1/2 cup of air popped popcorn and i still can't taste thr flavor. I thoutht perhaps it was just me be i had 3other people taste it to draw the same conclusion-this stuff is not flavorful and lackluster. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless they have superb tasting abilities.
