Really upset about this product, as I've heard nothing but good things about Pebble.  I've had this watch for almost 3 weeks and it's been an okay replacement for my Apple Watch.  I'm active, so I've run with it, lifted weights, played golf and wore it throughout the day at work and whatnot.  I've been very careful with it, and been sure not to bang it against anything (something I've done consistently since owning the Apple Watch.  So far so good.Here's where things fell apart for me.  I wore it golfing today and it rained.  Two issues are now present with this watch (see pictures).  1) The inside of the display, underside of the glass) is all fogged up.  2) The outer glass is scratched up in several places.  Before my round started the watch looked brand new.  I didn't bang it on anything.  The only thing that came in contact with the watch was my golf glove.  That leaves me with the conclusion that my glove scratched my watch... How on earth is this even possible?!I'm pretty angry about this.  I expect much more than 3 weeks of use from a watch I paid over $200 for.  Buyer beware.  This watch doesn't match the quality I've come to associate with the Pebble brand.
