No instructions provided.  Other reviews indicated "comes with everything you need"......it does not.  Mine came with a sawdust like material which according to the picture sits at the bottom and the soil atop that.  There's no soil, or rocks, for that matter.  Can't tell you how it grows.  I'm kind of chapped just opening the box and not finding everything I needed as stated and displayed.
