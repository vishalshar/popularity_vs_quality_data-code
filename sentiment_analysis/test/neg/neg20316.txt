I found that these came apart too easily for me. They would pop open at least 2-3 times a week which was a pain. Also I found that they were either too tight on one setting and too lose on the other. I needed tight for running and loose for everyday use, but changing was very time consuming. Overall I like the standard sport laces better. Good concept but misses the mark.
