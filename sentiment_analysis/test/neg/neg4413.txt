I ordered this at the beginning of February, 2016. At first, I loved it. It fit comfortably like a watch, and the app interface was easy and fun to use. The bonus feature of being able to set it to do other things (such as ring my phone or change the song on my phone) through the Misfit Link app I though was the icing on the cake. Add to that the watch battery for months of no charging, the cherry on top!After the first couple weeks, things weren't so sweet. It started to have issues syncing to my phone. It began to fall out of it's case frequently. A few times after it fell out, it was lost in my apartment, but even with the "I'll light up if I'm lost" feature, it wasn't found for days (an audio beep or a non-phone related vibrate option would have been a lot better in locating it). Even while it's core function as an activity tracker was fine, everything that set this apart from the rest of the a+s trackers was malfunctioning.Now, after a sweet month of activity and sleep tracking, it has been lost forever. This device, which supposedly should stay put through sleeping, vigorous exercise, and swimming, fell out after smacking my arm to swat a fly, and plopped into the river. If they had made this set in a band, like a watch, rather than making it convertible to the clip, this product would have been so much better. Even with their new release of a different activity tracker, with the poor example they've set with this product makes me very unlikely to test out anything else Misfit produces.
