The product pictures are A LIE! I ordered this flavor because it was advertised as having the highest protein and lowest sugar out of all the flavors (advertised as 4g of protein, 4g of sugar in the pictures on Amazon). When I got the product it is actually 3g of protein, 5g of sugar! Less protein and more sugar. See the attached photos! Very angry that I got lied to about the nutrition on a health bar!
