Bought this as a gift for a friend with a dog who is "fetch crazy" and never wants to stop playing. She used one time in the house and the dog couldn't get used to it, but decided to try again outside. On the second use it stopped working and we could not fix. Sent it back the next day. I thought the product was a bit expensive,, but if it worked it would be okay. Definitely NOT worth the money!!
