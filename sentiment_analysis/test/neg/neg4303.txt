Not accurate. Highly variable readings. Don't buy. I was obsessed with trying to get it to be accurate. I could if I was focused 100% on it. But that defeats the purpose. I might as well be monitoring myself. Learned a lot about the technology. But that is not why you buy it. Sorry guys. Not ready for prime time. This is a beta. Don't be like me and be their beta tester; unless you realize that and what to pay for that experience.
