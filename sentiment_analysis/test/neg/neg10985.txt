My cat would not use the hydrophobic sand....she climbed into the box on three separate occasions and then climbed out without urinating.  I gave up at that point since I was afraid she would become frustrated and urinate outside of the litter box.  However the pipette and collection vial were missing from the package which meant I would have had to come up with a substitute way to collect and store the urine.....overall not a happy experience with this product.
