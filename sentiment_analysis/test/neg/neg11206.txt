This is a weird review because I actually like my August Doorbell. Camera quality is good, alerts are instant when someone presses the doorbell, and I like the compatibility with my August Lock, but feel really fooled with the false advertisements. When I bought this (in early July) the Amazon page didn't mention that the proximity alert was a future update. On top of that, I JUST watched a commercial on TV that mentions you get alerts of people at your door wether they press the doorbell or not. That's what I thought I was buying but apparently this is just something they've been promising for "a future update" ever since the product was released. I definitely feel duped by August. How do they get away with advertising a feature that isn't in the product? I'd send it back but my who,e reason for buying it was to go with my lock and don't want to hassle with changing both systems out. What a scam.
