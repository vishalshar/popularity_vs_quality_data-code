It may be that the maker of this product simply wanted to make a quick profit, and was alert to the "new market" opportunity.  In any event, this popcorn has little to offer.  The popcorn itself was "day-old" soft, without any redeeming quality of crispness or fresh taste or texture.  I purchased many bags, with the assumption that it might be enjoyable.  My wife, who loves popcorn, can't even be cajoled into opening any more of them when she watches television.  They will be going into the trash this next pickup.
