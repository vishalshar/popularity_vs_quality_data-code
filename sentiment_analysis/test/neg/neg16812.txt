Pros:Incredible ergonomics, especially if you have larger handsEasy set upCustom LED accent colorsCons:Expensive for a mouseIt's heavySummary:If you have larger hands, this mouse is a win for you. It is the most comfortable mouse I've ever used in my life. You can palm it or claw it and it just feels good. I haven't had any hand or wrist fatigue since using this mouse. On the down side the cost is high and who really needs 8200 dpi? Nobody in my opinion. If the other NAOS models are on sale or cheaper, I would probably go with one of those.UPDATE 12/16/2013:After having the mouse just over two months one of the thumb buttons began sticking. The thumb button closer to the back of the mouse becomes lodged and does not depress after I let it go. I contacted their customer support and they said I have to RMA it and get a replacement. I will update again after that happens.UPDATE 12/27/2013:I got a replacement mouse back in a little over one week. Not bad! This one does not have the sticking button problem so all is well.UPDATE 11/14/2016:Here I am 3 years later and the scroll wheel button is malfunctioning. I lowered my rating from 4 starts to 3. This mouse is gently used and I expected not to have the issues I have had. I still love the feel of the mouse but after having to return it once for a sticking button and now another button malfunctioning I can't recommend it unless you don't mind buying a new mouse every few years. This is not a cheap mouse. If it cost thirty dollars I wouldn't be so harsh. But it costs more.UPDATE 12/8/16:I purchased a new mouse (Nixeus Revel). I forgot how heavy the Naos 8200 was until I started using this very light mouse. I can't recommend Mionix after having two buttons on two separate 8200s break, especially when you're paying a premium price.
