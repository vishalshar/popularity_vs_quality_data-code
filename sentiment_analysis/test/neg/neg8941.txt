Does not link, do not waste your time buying this!. The company emailed me with a solution and a return policy that even required even picture of the box! Ridiculous!! I thru the box out because, I thought this was a quality product like all other products I purchase. Not only that ,but this is not just a problem that I have, Many blogs report the same problem (can not link!). Well, if many people are having issues with linking, then why are you (MisFit) making me run though hoops. The company email me with solutions 3 days later, like this: Try these: get closer to the phone, install the app, uninstall the app, reinstall, reset, change to a new battery. Sony does not have these problems with their products, Samsung products do not have these problems. My question is...Why sell them? You have a software issue, admit it, but do not take me for a novice.
