I'm extremely disappointed with these since everyone says they work so well. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because they do stretch to fit almost any brush, but even then some of my brush bristles were out of whack after I used them. Also I put these upside in a cup to dry and even after 3 days they were still soaking wet. These guards hold your brushes so tight that any moisture in the inner bristles can't escape. I will be returning these.
