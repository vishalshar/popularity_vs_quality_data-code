Bottom line: avoid this product. The product did not charge my device. Furthermore, the on/off functionality is shoddy, at best. The instructions were in broken English - barely readable. The overall construction is questionable. I could go on and on - not a good experience. If you are looking for a charging case there are many alternatives - known brands - that offer quality. This is clearly assembled in China - the quality issues are glaring. Lastly, what's the deal with the "update" process? Why should I have to "update" my case via some form of software update? When I visited the "update" site listed in the instruction manual  in an attempt to resolve my issues, no "update" link or information was available.All in all, a horrible experience. Please save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere.
