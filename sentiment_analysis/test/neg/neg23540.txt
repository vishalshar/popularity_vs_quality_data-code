Good easy to use and lightweight security system, when it works. I've owned this for about six months and if I know what I know now, I would have looked elsewhere or setup my own DIY system. Twice a week, expect to find yourself waiting at your door to leave or enter because the app sometimes takes minutes to load. Expect weekly system disconnections with no notifications. Expect to contact support about once a month because the system stopped responding completely.If you can deal with these issues it is a great system. The sensors have only accidentally gone off once and I believe that was my cat.
