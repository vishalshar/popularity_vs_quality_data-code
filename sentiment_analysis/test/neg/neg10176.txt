I saw this days before my birthday and told my husband how much I wanted it. Which he then surprised me with it. I was overjoyed!! I couldn't wait to use it!! Unfortunately nothing seemed to go right. The whole reason I wanted it was to wear it as a bracelet but I have a larger wrist and the bracelet didn't fit. My husband tried to reassure me that we could just buy a different band but I really didn't want to invest more money into a product that I feel should accommodate their customers. Then the product didn't work. It was locked out or something. I had to contact the company it took almost a week untill I actually got it to turn on. By then I was pretty turned off by the product. I tried wearing it to bed by clipping it on my bra so it could track my sleep. I woke up and it didn't track anything! I was so upset. I don't know if I wasn't doing something right so I tried it again the next day it didn't track anything. Then again when I went to bed and nothing. I just tossed it in the box. I need something that is less complicated I guess. I so wanted to love this product. It just wasn't a right fit for me. I will be sending it back.
