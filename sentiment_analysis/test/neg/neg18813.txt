It seems to be getting harder and harder to get a standalone CD player that delivers quality sound, and doesn't look like something you would give to a 6 year old.  This unit fills that requirement.  I am hard on CD players in that I tend to put a background or meditative CD in and put it on perpetual repeat.  So far, this has been an exceptional unit.My only con is the VU meters.  Effectively useless as there is no response from them until you hit almost max volume.  Also, the blue lighting is too much in a dark room.  Mine is in the bedroom, and have covered the lights with dark cloth.UPDATE - - I have had this for just over 3 months, and the CD player has died.  I contacted the seller, and have been issued an RMA, but they require a $10 handling fee, and I pay the shipping to New York.  With the cost of packing material and shipping, I am looking at almost $60.  That for me is a tipping point. When I read through the 1-star reviews, the majority seem to be with the CD player, and many in the last 3 months.  So I'm done with it.
