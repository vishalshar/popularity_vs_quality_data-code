At first I thought this was a great device however the button on the side is to easily depressed which releases the phone and then today on the fast downhill the vibration caused the phone to fall out and landed in the ditch. It took me over an hour to find the phone with the help of find my iPhone. Too late to return to Amazon so I may retrofit it with a strip of heavy duty Velcro.
