Absolutely the worst filter pitcher I have ever come across. And I have used plenty.Very very poorly design filtration system. The lid is absolutely useless. And the filter needs to be shaken up about twice a week to RE-START filtration, otherwise its blocked and when you try to pour water, you get both filtered and UNFILTERED water because of the ridiculously stupid design of the lid.I wish the company spent more time designing it than marketing. It is definitely not worth the price. Stay away from this overpriced useless heap of a water filter pitcher, buy Brita or PUR and donate your money to a proper water charity foundation.
