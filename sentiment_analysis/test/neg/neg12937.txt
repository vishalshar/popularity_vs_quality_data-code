Great idea but the syncing with the app is frustrating and inconsistent.  It has made the product unusable in my mind. Was excited at first as it made it so I didn't need to buy a new Ipod Nano.  It was such a pain to use that I no longer do and dropped the large chunk of money on a new nano to get the same effect.
