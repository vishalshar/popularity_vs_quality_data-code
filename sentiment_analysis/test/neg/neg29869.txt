Paired with my android phone with no problem, however, it took a long time connecting to my TrackR attached to my dog next to me, same problem with locating my carkeys about 15ft away in the same house.  Asked TrackR for support over a week ago and as of this date have not heard from them.  I also was contacted because of my low ratings on their survey about their product...answered questions they asked and was told I would be contacted....so far no contact.  I returned the product because it's performance did not live up to its advertisement and product detail.  The idea is great ...I wish those who purchase TrackR have better results than I did. I expected something this pricey should deliver...this dissappointedly did not.
