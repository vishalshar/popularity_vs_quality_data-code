The auto-unlock feature does not work, and that is the feature for which I purchased this unit.  After several (6, I believe) phone calls over as many days, I was promised threee times that I would receive an email link to the "New build for Android phones," but after a week, it still has not come.  On two calls today, I was told that I would receive a callback from the appropriate person within the hour, but several hours later, still no call. On the last call, I was told that "they send that new build email out in batches, and the next one will probably go out next week."  At that point, I asked for the manager who had authority over the person who sends the emails out, and was promised that she would call me within the hour.  Again, no call after 3 hours.  If you want a product that works, and tech support that is responsive, avoid this product like the plague!
