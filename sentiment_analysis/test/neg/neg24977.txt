I consider myself a phone enthusiast and I currently alternate between Nexus 6P and Galaxy Note 5. I purchased the Nextbit Robin during the $299 sale and am returning it after using it for only one day.The phone is quite aesthetically pleasing. It is thin, light-weight, and build quality on my unit was excellent.I updated the phone to the most current version before setting it up and using the phone. There are numerous software problems which make the device unusable to anyone who intends for it to be their daily driver.  After experiencing these issues I visited the Nextbit forums and there are many people reporting a multitude of issues.The issues I experienced are as follows:- Wifi would disconnect and reconnect every 5 minutes interrupting what I was doing. This occurred on multiple networks in different locations and even sitting next to the router. It was clearly not related to signal strength.- The sound setting would only be acceptable if you have no intention of ever using any sound. The speaker quality is very poor and the default equalization setting makes music and speech sound distorted.  The first sound setting above mute is obnoxiously loud---so much so that it hurts my ears, and it only gets louder from there.I would suggest anyone who is considering purchasing this item visit the Nextbit support forums and look over the issues people are reporting.TLDR -- build quality is good, software feels like an alpha and is not ready to be your daily driver.
