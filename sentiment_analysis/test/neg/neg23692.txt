The camera is awful and the pictures are blurry. I bought this phone because it said it takes great pictures....it rarely does. There was no way to import my contacts, it was not an option, The actual phone was fine. There is not a hard case available at all, I even contacted the company. I already bought another phone and this one is gathering dust..
