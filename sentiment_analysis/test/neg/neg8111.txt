The WeMo Light Switch has worked great for me.  I replaced the switch that powers our outdoor lights and it has worked flawlessly, turning on the light at sunset and off at sunrise.  That is, until Daylight Savings Time hit on Sunday.Last night (Sunday, March 9, 2014), the lights turned on at the EST time.  Tonight (Monday, March 10, 2014), they did not turn on at all.  I contacted Belkin support on Twitter (@BelkinCares) and they DM'd me, telling me that I had to reset my light switch and two switches, pretty much reinstalling them.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?I found it painfully ironic that on the Belkin's product page([...]), it says "The WeMo App automatically adjusts for daylight savings."  Yeah, right.When this works, it's awesome.  When things aren't right, things go horribly wrong.UPDATE 04/02/2014I am fed up with this product and the other WeMo products I have purchased (2 switches, a camera, and a motion sensor) and have downgraded my review accordingly.  It has been nearly a month since DST arrived and the light switch that is supposed to turn on at sunset turns on at different times each night.  I have reset (in effect reinstalled) and redone my rules more times than I can count and this still doesn't work.  Numerous emails to Belkin support have proved to be fruitless and I am stuck with these things.  DO NOT BUY UNTIL YOU ARE SURE THIS HAS BEEN FIXED!UPDATE 10/31/2014I don't know what else I can say about this product.  I gave the rules another chance, selecting outdoor lights to come on at sunset and go off at sunrise.  I wish I could attach the screenshot, because the WeMo app was telling me that in Tampa Bay, Florida, the sun sets at almost 11pm and rises at about 3:30am.  What I try to put my location in, it doesn't find anything, no matter what city I type in.  So I am left with having to update my rules and the sunset and sunrise times move.  THIS IS A TERRIBLE USER EXPERIENCE, BELKIN!  They keep releasing software and firmware updates that just keep making things worse.UPDATE 03/08/2015I have had it with WeMo switches and will be looking for another solution.  ONCE AGAIN daylight savings has come and the switches I have are FREAKING out.  Even though we have the switches that are hooked up to lights going off at 9:15pm, one of them just decides to come on around midnight.  So I have to get up, get my phone and turn it off.  Belkin is INCOMPETENT.
