Great idea, failed implementation.Problem, this only uses Wi-Fi 802.11g protocol: The "g" will kill the rest of your network which is likely to be full of devices using better protocols. As soon as you disconnect this unit stuff like wireless IP cameras resume connecting normally.Problem, disconnects from network an needs hard reset (10 minute process) every few months or after firmware updates.Problem, after using this six moths 24 x 7, I can say this purifier does almost nothing to clean the air. The filters never catch much of anything and potentially may never need to be cleaned because the intake vents are too small to cycle enough air to matter.I have allergies so I have three other real air purifiers around the house. The filters on those units all catch tons of particulates and must be cleaned every six weeks or less. This unit's filter remains almost entirely clean for months on end. It is simply not cleaning the air in any meaningful way.I give one added star because they added Wemo and tried to make it integrateable with HA systems like SmartThings. However, they failed to produce a product that cleans the air. And in fact, using this product will degrade your wifi network significantly.Don't waste your money.
