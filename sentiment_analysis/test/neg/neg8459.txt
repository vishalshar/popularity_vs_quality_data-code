Pretty bummed. While this case is beautifully designed, and looks rad, and feels incredibly comfortable in your hand, I had issues with the lock button. Not sure if the lock button is different from the 6 plus to the 6s plus, but this case causes the button to be pressed even when I wasn't holding the phone. :( has to return it. The volume keys worked fine.
