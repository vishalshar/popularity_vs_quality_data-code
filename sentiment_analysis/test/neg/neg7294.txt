My daughter (1st grade) used this backpack for a week when school started and the side pocket string already broke.  The side seam around the pocket is coming apart. The backpack is super cute and she liked it, but I feel after a week of use it should not be showing any wear.  Very happy with the way Amazon handled since it was 32 days after purchase, but only one week if use.
