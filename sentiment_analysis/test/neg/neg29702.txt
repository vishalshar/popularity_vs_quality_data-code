I bought the scooter last week and tried it once. To be honest, the shape is really cool and it can reach a quite high speed. However I found it's really dangerous to ride it due to safety problem with the brake. The brake is so tight that each time I tried to slow down in just a little faster speed, I was about to throw myself out of the scooter. Do not dare to take the risk and already stop using it after that experience.Updated: after using for several times(in total less than 50 miles, after receiving it 2 months ago), the scooter cannot be charged anymore...What bad quality! Give my money back!
