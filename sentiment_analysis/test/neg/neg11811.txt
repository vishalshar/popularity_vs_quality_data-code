Complete waste of money. Could easily use a paper clip to reset the combination and open the bottle. Directions to reset are printed on the cap for anyone to see how to reset with an arrow pointing to the reset hole. So annoyed. Who designed this useless device? Ugh. Not even worth deduction of return shipping to send this piece of junk back.
