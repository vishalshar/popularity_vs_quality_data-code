the case does not look like the original, it comes with a glass version of a "screen protector" which broke before I even took it out of the box... I returned it and purchased this instead and had a much better experience: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0171295IC?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00.  Also, all of these screens have s*** instructions so just look up a video on youtube and you'll be fine.
