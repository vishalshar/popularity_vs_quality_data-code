This item came in and for the most part seemed pretty cool. But the metal band that says "Das Horn" is upside down...so we can't even leave it on our Game of Thrones shelf for viewing...It was supposed to be a gag gift kinda thing for my boyfriends B-Day...however, it feels the joke was on me, I'm just embarrassed.
