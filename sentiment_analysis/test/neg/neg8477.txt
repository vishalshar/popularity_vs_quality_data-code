UPDATE: The bluetooth connection problems return with vengeance on a new iPad Pro 9.7" I just bought. After literally a couple of hours of going through the troubleshooting over and over I have not been able to get the control app on the iPad to connect even though the bluetooth streaming of music from the iPad works fine. There is something badly wrong with how Line6's own app connects with the amp. I do not recommend anyone buy these amps until this gets fixed.I really liked the idea of the Amplifi 30 as I just want a little compact practice amp that has a lot of flexibility on effects. So here are a few Pros/Cons to think about  when buying. I start with the Cons because those are more prominent at this stage.Cons:- The Amp is really controlled mainly by the App running on your iPad. If the app isn't working then the Amp loses a lot of its appeal. It will still work with 4 effects that were last loaded.- The app connectivity is a mess. I have had to endlessly fiddle with the app/amp to get the app to connect and then it loses the ability to sync the very next time I try it. I suspect that Line6 will correct this with software/firmware fixes over time. However, the out of the box performance is pretty unacceptable even in this era of beta products, etc.Pros:- When the app works this thing is super cool. There are a ton of effects. You can match them to songs. Endless stuff to play with and a nice built in tuner.- I was surprised at how loud the little 30W gets and it sounds good.Bottom Line:- I will keep mine but I wouldn't suggest people buy this until bugs are worked out. If you like the idea of the amp then, in person, you will probably like it even more except for the fact that it won't work very well for you with the current firmware (2.5) and app version setup. I assume that Line6 will push out bug fixes that will make it much better sometime soon though their reputation for rapidly correcting problems doesn't seem to be great from reading other posts.
