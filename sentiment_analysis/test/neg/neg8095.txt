I have larger feet,12.5 us, and these do not work for me.  They make it hard to get my shoes on and scrunch them up in spots and it just looks bad.  I tried all the lacing options in the instructions and none worked.  I will be returning and hoping Amazon gives me all my money back.  I don't even want to gift these away. They suck!
