The thermometer needs an app to operate, unfortunately the app is only available in the US (apple store) and can't be downloaded if you're using an International Apple account.I have written them 2 email informing them about this issue but still no reply from them.So, if your apple account is based internationally, do not buy this thermometer until Kinsa removes the region restriction
