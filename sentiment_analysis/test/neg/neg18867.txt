I have been through two of these now, both total failures.The first one I tried, the microphones would not work. No phone calls, no voice assistant, no text dictation, nothing. However, I had the chance to also try it out with standard stereo audio, namely with music and podcasts. The sound quality was okay, but the Bluetooth range was terrible. You cannot use this with your phone in your pocket, period. Even with my phone in my right pocket, as their support documentation suggests, it will mostly work as long as I keep my head perfectly straight, but turn my head even slightly in either direction and it cuts out completely. So using it while walking or jogging is completely out. And this was *after* installing the latest "Bragi OS" (AKA firmware with a more marketing-friendly title) update that was supposedly supposed to improve the Bluetooth range somehow.So I returned that and got a replacement (via Amazon the old-fashioned way, Bragi didn't offer that sort of thing at all). On the second try, the right earbud was completely dead on arrival. Also, several of the fit sleeves were missing, while it came with two sets of the medium sized sleeves. So yeah, there is clearly no form of quality assurance going on here whatsoever.And the customer support is nearly as bad. They took nearly a week to get back to me each time, and they only gave me the same generic troubleshooting messages that I could have found (and did) on their website repeatedly, naturally being no help whatsoever. And by that I mean, you know, try rebooting it (along with a standard copypasta reference of how to do that). The stock answer for everything when someone doesn't want to actually try to put any effort into helping.In short, this company obviously has no idea what it's doing.
