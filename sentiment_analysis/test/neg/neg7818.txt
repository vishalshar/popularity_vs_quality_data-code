This is a great smelling product and I liked the idea that it was as natural ia can be. I understand that this is supposed to be a deodorant, not an antiperspirant. The deodorizing abilities of this product can not stand up to the summer heat in South Florida. It isn't useful enough, as a deodorant, to get to the point of being able to judge its hair inhibiting abilities.
