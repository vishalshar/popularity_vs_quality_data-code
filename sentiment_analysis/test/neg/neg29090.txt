I received my iOttie Easy One touch five months ago. It was to hold my iPhone 7plus. I placed the dash pad on a vertical hard plastic surface that sat between the front seat of my truck. I then placed the iOttie onto the dash pad as the directions stated. It was fine for three months. Then I noticed that the gel pad glue was separating due to the adhesive failing. This adhesive is thick and it became gummy. Over the next two months the glue began to separate and finally let loose and the gel pad glue was no longer adhesive. It looked like used bubble gum and was just as good as used bubble gum. Things fail and I accept that. What I don't accept is that I emailed the company and have received no response. I asked for a solution/fix/repair/return because I am sure I am not the first. So now a faulty product and no customer service.I would not buy again and would not recommend.
