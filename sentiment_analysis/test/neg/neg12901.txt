States this thermometer is the "newest model," but when I downloaded the app, it told me the model # was old and I would receive a current model compatible with my iPhone 6.  I'm frustrated, as I'd hoped to use it right away, and now I have to wait for another one to be shipped to me courtesy of Kinsa, I believe.  This shouldn't be sold as a current/newest model.
