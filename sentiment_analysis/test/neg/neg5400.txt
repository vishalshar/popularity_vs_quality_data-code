While Slice's blades may last 10X longer than traditional steel blades; they also require up to 10X the effort compared to that of a traditional steel razor blade.  While the angle of the body aids in producing a positive grip; I believe this item could make use of stippling and or jimping to create a much more positive feel as its finish as far too smooth (in my opinion).
