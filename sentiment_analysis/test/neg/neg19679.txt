I decide to return it after I receive it for about one hour because the GPS feature is literally a lie. It is not as convenience as I thought. If you left the suitcase behind in airport, you probably could find it. But if someone steal it from you, you will never find the suitcase even it is still located in airport. The ad says you could locate the suitcase wherever it is, BUT the only location info you can get from the App is the LAST UPDATED LOCATION! As long as the suitcase is disconnected to your device(too far away or suitcase turns into sleep mode automatically after 15 mins), there is nothing you can do to find out the current location of your suitcase.While. who will left his/her suitcase behind? Good marketing strategy though!
