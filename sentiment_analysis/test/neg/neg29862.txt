While recharging, the phone got so hot it burned the finish off of the area around the speakers. The audio quality is pretty laughable even after the update. The OS is amazing; however, the battery life was less than optimal at about 8 hours of active use. I returned it after I realized the battery got so hot because it just seemed unsafe.
