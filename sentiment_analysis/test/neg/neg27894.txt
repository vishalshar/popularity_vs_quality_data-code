I just experienced 4 and 1/2 extremely frustrating hours!I bought 2 Wemo light switches, and in the end I can't get either to connect to my wifi netwrk.I recently purchased Netgear Smart WiFi Router AC1750 Dual Band Gigabit (R6300v2), and set it up, and so far I am really happy with it. When I tried connect to this router it just didn't work. I figured that this is understandable, since the router is at the other end of the house, and I could see why the connection doesn't reach. So I configured the Netgear WN3000rp WiFi extender, and tested it with a few different devices, at the location of both switches, and i was getting a decent connection.After resetting the switches, the wemo saw the extended network, but when i tried connecting to it, to no avail it would just not work. I figured maybe it is because of the encryption, so I removed all security settings of the extender, but that didn't help either. after all the work I put in, i still don't have them connected.Additionally one of the switches would not allow me to do a simple reset, I had to a complete factory reset every time i tried to do the connection again.As others have mentioned the app interface is also quite buggy, it crashed on me at least 5 times in the process.
