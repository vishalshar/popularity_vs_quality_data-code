This product was a huge disappointment.  To quotebmy daughter "why is this toy so not fun?"  We bought this for our daughter for Christmas and we were very excited about the concept.  Unfortunately she was unable to play with it/didn't enjoy playing with it because the pieces require so much force to connect, but then fall apart with very little play.  The wires for the control/battery pack  are short so they have to be very close to the motor.  Instructions included are pretty lame...  almost impossible to see the details.  Limited electronic functionality.  These are just some of the frustrations...Before some of you go on and say something about the kids ability to play/imagine, let me say she builds things regularly with lego and has assembled fairly tedious kits from tamiya.Spend 30 bucks at Radio shack for some wire, leds a breadboard and a motor, and buy a used dollhouse for 10 bucks on Craigslist and your child will be much happier
