Phone is portable but small for adults and is extremely slow, Bought this phone for my mum 4 days but its not worth the money. The letters and numbers on the keyboard is tiny. Common text messages takes more than 10 minutes to be delivered.  Calls are not coming through at all. My mom isn't thrilled at all. Took a while to download whatsapp and yet can not  use the app smoothly on the Posh phone.
