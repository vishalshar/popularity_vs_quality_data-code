Even if you are a "verified" purchaser does that guarantee you're not being recompensed for your review?  This is the most  miserable thing I have ever slept on.  It is hard as a rock.  Just a big chunk of foam with zero comfort.  We are four days in and have added our foam topper from our old bed just to make it somewhat tolerable.  I just don't understand how people can think this is comfortable unless they're used to sleeping on park benches. I know everyone has different likes, but I find it hard to believe the authenticity of these reviews.
