I see how it could be useful to some and fun to others, but I wasn't impressed with the image quality for inanimate objects.  People and animals were okay but not great.  I wanted to use it for some home improvement projects but the clarity and definition of the images wasn't very good, especially compared to higher grade imaging equipment.  As some others have pointed out, using the split image disclosed that the heat source didn't necessarily line up with the camera view of the source (an outlet in this instance).  I didn't want to take the time to try and adjust the imagery to make it line up.  I'm glad I tried it but this device isn't for me.
