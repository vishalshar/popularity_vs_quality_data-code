I had high hopes but I can't recommend. When it worked I liked how sleek it was and I loved getting WW points for my activity. Unfortunately, I've now had 3 of these devices since June. My first arrived and wouldn't sync, so Amazon replaced it. The second one was bricked by an update about 2 months later, so Misfit replaced it. This third one lasted until October and suddenly stopped syncing and lighting up. I'm done trying to work through this and Misfit refuses to issue a refund. I cannot recommend this product or Misfit's software.
