While requesting an exchange for a larger size online, it registered and ordered a smaller size instead, and I could not change that at all online except by cancelling and placing a new order.... also this item is way overpriced -  I like the concept of all the pockets and quality seems to be good but terribly overpriced - so finally did not re order :(
