I have several D-Link Cameras (DCS-932L) so I decided to update couple of the old ones using this model.Its been several weeks and so far this model has under performed or not performed at all.Camera(s) would connect to my wi-fi without any issues but within couple of hours they would go offline. I updated both of my cameras with the latest firmware updates but nothing has changed. I've setup static and dynamic IP but nothing seem to help. Devices goes offline with in couple of hours and would not come back until I recycle power but goes offline in couple of hours. I even place to camera close to my router, changes the network between 2.4 and 5 Ghz nothing.I mainly purchased the camera for the higher resolution wish I could use it one of these days.
