This product...I don't know if it's defective or just bad. I bought this to replace my Goal Zero Yeti 150 (15,000mAh) and get almost double the life. I hook up 4 2W lights to it at shows, so getting a lighter version was what I was looking for. While my Yeti, that is over a year old, still powers these lights for eight hours (which is on par for a 15,000mAh battery of its age), the ChargeTech 27,000mAh only powers them for (at most) four hours. This literally doesn't make any sense. I actually had another ChargeTech prior to this that was having the same issue, but I returned it per company recommendation and got this one. It is having the same battery life. It doesn't work at all for what I needed. I don't know if the 27k mAh is a joke or if they're all bad, but there is no way that it is truly 27,000mAh. 8W of lights can't even go for the same amount as my Yeti? Really a crap product.
