I was not super thrilled about the case when it arrived, as it looked fairly cheap (especially the wood part) but I needed the case where I could keep my public transportation card outside for swiping and I decided to keep it. After less than a year of use the plastic outside of the case has completely ripped off from the main part of the case rendering it useless. Keep in mind that I have never dropped my phone, this is simply from taking the phone out of its case once a week in order to put it in my running band.I don't recommend this case- spend $10 more and get something that lasts.
