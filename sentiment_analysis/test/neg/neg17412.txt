Bought these for my son for xmas gift. We played with them for about 2 hours over 2 days and ended up placing then on a shelf to collect dust. We continously had issues with the connection between our android devices and the vehicles. Not to mention the fact that the app continually crashed and would also crash our android devices. They are a great concept but definitely need a ton more work.Very disappointing and an expensive  dust collector.
