I was really excited about this kit at first. I followed all the instructions precisely. I did not see this mentioned anywhere else but once you soak the bag, there is a very intense funk smell that does not go away for several days. It's not something you can really ignore or cover up either. After a week of babying the box nothing was being produced except mold and more gross smells. Ended up throwing the entire thing away. Don't waste your money.
