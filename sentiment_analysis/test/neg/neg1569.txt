I purchased this item because recently my husband has fallen asleep at his computer and managed to knock over his coffee. I thought the idea of having the cup stick to a surface and not be knocked over was just what was needed. Unfortunately ? The Mighty Mug does not work. It doesn't stick to his desk, the kitchen counter, table, etc....it is a complete dud!!!
