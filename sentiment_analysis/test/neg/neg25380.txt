I ordered these dye free crystal trays for the first time because I thought they would be healthier for my cats. We have had two ScoopFree Litter Systems over the past 8 years and we LOVE THEM but we DEFINATELY WILL NEVER BUY THESE DYE FREE TRAYS AGAIN! I purchased half a case and we went through them very quickly. The same amount of the blue crystal trays would of lasted us weeks longer. The smell coming from the litter machine constantly, even after only being used 2 or 3 times was HORRIFIC!  The urine soaked right through the box. I was so disappointed that I made the decision to try these that I am going to call PetSafe and complain. I do not do that for many things but this was something that definately warrants it!
