Worked great for about a month and then not so much. The only way for me to get it to charge anything now is for it to be plugged into the wall (of course this is not at all useful). I can no longer charge a device using the Fluxmob even though the blue lights appear to come on.Additionally, it seems to have killed off the battery in my iPhone 6. It was fine for the first few weeks using the Fluxmob and after that it started holding a charge for only around 2 hours. I took it into the Apple store and confirmed that the battery has failed. I'm not 100% sure this was caused by the Fluxmob but the timing seems to be a fairly strong indicator.
