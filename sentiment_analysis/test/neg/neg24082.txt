I have owned 2 shine products in the past and was excited to get my hands on the Shine 2. Alas, as so many other users have indicated, it pops out of the band with the slightest touch. After owning the device for 2 weeks, my luck finally ran out and it is lost forever.A few things can be improved1. Since it connects via bluetooth, could there not be a way to use the bluetooth to help the user find the lost item, at least tell the user if it is in range. The "Show my shine" option, assumes that the device has fallen face up which I have noticed has never happened in all the times that it fell out if the band.2. The vibration is essentially useless, especially when used with the additional stabilizing piece.@misfit or is it @fossil now, please correct the band issue, and provide some way to locate our investment. I would love to get a new shine 2 but I am unwilling to lose another $100.
