Well let me start by saying I really wanted to like this laptop and it has some nice features. It looked like a good college student laptop for its price. I have been using it for 5 days now and some of the minor annoyances have become major issues.Pros:1) Very light, thin, and overall beautiful design.2) Hardware is powerful for what its designed to do: web surfing, movies, documents etc (this is not a gaming laptop , although you can play games on it as the GTX 960 is more than capable to run most of the popular titles on High settings)3) Good speakers4) Stays relatively cool while working for an extended period (but it has become a con)Cons:Like I said at the start of my review some minor things got way too annoying for me to enjoy this laptop.1) I was going to accept that it wont have the best panel due to the price point but this display is just horrible. The longer I used it the more I noticed that viewing angles and color reproduction are so bad for a TFT panel that I cant even compare it my 10 years old laptop. The software that comes with the laptop is utterly useless in that regard as well.2) SSD drive is fast but you still get random slowdowns for no reason.3) Since day 1 I noticed that the cooling fans like to spin up randomly regardless of the load. So I thought its probably a BIOS issue so ran the update and got the latest version from ASUS website. Sadly that didnt fix the problem. It gets very distracting especially when you are working on a document and the noise just keeps changing. I'd rather hear a constant fan noise even if its louder than this inconsistent spin up / slow down thing that Asus claims is more efficient or whatever.4) Really terrible trackpad that sometimes missess the input (especially right clicks) . Ok I will use a mouse when I am sitting at a table but when you just want to surf the web while laying on the couch it gets very annoying having to click lots of times.5) Bad WiFi performance was the final dealbreaker for me. I shut down all of my devices and ran a speed test couple of times and not even once this laptop was able to get close to at least half of what I am getting by a wired connections, not to mention I was sitting right beside the router and it was showing me 4 bars.Overall I cant recommend this laptop because the issuess that are present now will only get worse as the time goes on.
