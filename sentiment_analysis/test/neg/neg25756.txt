We've had so many issues with our August lock.To save energy, the keypad isn't always connected to the lock. It establishes a connection whenever somebody tries to enter a code into it. This means that there are a lot of times, it's too slow to connect, and it doesn't register my correct code as being a correct code. This wouldn't be a huge issue if it wasn't for the fact that after you enter a wrong code, it won't accept a right code for a while. How long, I'm not sure. I just stand outside and angrily enter my code over and over again. Most of the time, I give up after a few tries and opens the door with my phone. I would much prefer to use the keypad -- hello, that's why I bought it, and why the company sells one -- but it just doesn't work very well.We've also had problems with the lock itself. The unlock mechanism is very quiet so unless you're leaning into the lock listening for it, it could unlock  without you knowing it. And for some weird reason, if I don't open the door at the exact moment the lock unlocks, the system shuts me out. I have to enter my credentials again. And because the keypad won't accept a correct code after an incorrect code (which is what August thinks has happened in this case), it'll be a few minutes before I can get inside. How long, nobody knows.Our keypad straight up stopped connecting to the lock a few times. No matter what code we entered. We had to remove it from the wall and do a hard reset. Our lock started making a weird noise when it locked again, and it seemed to struggle to auto-lock. The problems with this device go on and on and on. The battery on the keypad ran out (after only 2 months, BTW) while we were out of town, and there was no low battery alert system so it stopped working as our cat sitter was trying to get inside to feed our cats.Ugh. It's a lock for your front door. It has to work, and this just doesn't work reliably. I wish I could return it. I've emailed the company asking to be able to return it, and they won't let me.
