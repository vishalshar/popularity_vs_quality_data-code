So far the laptop has been great with the exception of the audio.  At max volume it is not very easy to hear.  I tried updating the sound drivers and resetting my laptop.  Asus told me to mail in the laptop to repair it so I will be without it for nearly two weeks which is highly inconvenient.  My old laptop volume was nearly twice as loud as this one and I'm not sure if it's something defective with the one I got or the laptop has weak volume to begin with.  If it turns out the issue was just a defective one I received I will update the review.  Otherwise, very disappointed in the audio this laptop has and I would not recommend it.
