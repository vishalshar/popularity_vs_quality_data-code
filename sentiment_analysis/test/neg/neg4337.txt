I have an earlier remote and this is the only replacement collar for it. My old collar quit working and the original only had 8 levels of stimulation. The new collar has more so you only get minor stimulation if you use the new collar with the original remote. My dog Koda has figured this out and ignores it completely. If you don't have the brand new system, DO NOT buy this collar as a second or replacement. Short of that it is a nice collar that I paid a lot of money for that does not work.
