It sent me a false report that my dog escaped, I left work and searched for her. It showed that she was on a farm near some animal pens. I was terrified that she would get hurt. I found her safe in my backyard. She had never escaped in the first place, thank goodness. The item that I bought to give me peace of mind caused me severe panic and fear.
