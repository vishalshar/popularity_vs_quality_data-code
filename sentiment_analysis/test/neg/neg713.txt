I brought this item for use with an Iphone 5s & Ipad. Product worked for about 1 minute until the camera started flickering. Then the camera simply just turned off and never worked again. I tried multiple devices and then called up their support line.Seek customer support SUCKKKKKKSSSS! Don't expect anything other than "Have you tried restarting the device?"I will not be purchasing any of their products. I will be trying a different brand. $300 wasted. Now amazon has to pick up their slack. Don't waste your money in this POS.
