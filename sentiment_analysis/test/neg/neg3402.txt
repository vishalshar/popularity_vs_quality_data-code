This product does not work at all.  The Bluetooth does not connect to any devices; PC, laptop, phone (apple & android), watch, iPad, tv, etc.  Does not connect to any item that manages Bluetooth connections.  Also, after fully charging, the cushion will turn back off as if disconnected and will not vibrate every 30 minutes to alarm for stretches and postures as advertised when "Disconnected.'  The Blue light shuts off after 3 seconds of being on.  When it does pair with a 4.0 and up Bluetooth device, it will connect for a split second.  While the management device attempts to pair, it will either stop and say Unsupported Device or say Connected and not actually be connected.  The Seat will show a 3 light for 3 seconds then shut off and remain a normal Uncomfortable seat cushion.  This is a scam and I am an idiot for making this a Christmas gift to my family.  Every positive 5-star review here is made by a friend or employee of the people who started this kickstarting smart cushion scam.  I have read that the app crashes too and seeing how the owners and their friends are all liars, they probably siphon your personal data from the app to so do not download it.Avoid this product and this company.
