I like the way it looks, like watch instead of a plasticky toy. And I love that I don't have to charge it and that it is waterproof, but it fails at it's most basic functions.  It falls out of the wrist band ALL of the time, several times a day. Right now the band is in my coat picket, and the tracker is buried in the bottom of my back pack. I've just gotten tired of putting the pieces back together after it embarrassingly drops to the floor and rolls across the room during meetings and such. I do really like that it tracks my sleep unlike the Nike fuel band, but I feel like it's activity tracking is not even close to accurate. Several times I've gone on 1-2 hour cross-country ski excursions, and the tracker will report something like light activity for 23 minutes and then light activity for 26 minutes later in the day. Sometimes I get more activity credit for going on a casual walk around the block than for a super intense workout. It seems like the activity points increase more based on time than actual movement. Also, the graphs on the App don't show nearly enough detail, you can get a general idea of what times the spikes in activity are, but not specific hours or minutes. I'm disappointed. Think I'll return it.
