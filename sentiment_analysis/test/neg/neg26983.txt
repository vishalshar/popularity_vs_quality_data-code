During the early months of my pregnancy, I was looking for a prenatal vitamin that included plant-based DHA and did not contain gelatin. This was a tall order when perusing local pharmacies. Then my doc recommended Premama. It was just what I was looking for, and it was a bonus that I could mix it in with my smoothies rather than swallow an enormous pill. The taste could have used a lot of improvement, but the benefits outweighed this downside.About a month ago, when I returned to Amazon to reorder, they original Premama was no longer available (only through private sellers that charged for shipping), and there was a "new" Premama product. At first glance, it seemed that just the box had changed, so I ordered it. When I received it, however, I discovered that the powder no longer contained DHA, which is an essential ingredient for developing babies and was the whole point of my original purchase. Also, the individual packets are no longer divided in two, making it nearly impossible to split the dosage, which was helpful because dumping the entire packet into a cup of juice was just too strong and made the flavor unbearable. To boot, the new formula has formed several small, grayish-green clumps in my OJ and tastes worse than before. Gross.When I came back on Amazon with the hopes that the original product had returned, I discovered there is yet another Premama product, the "Premama Plus." This one contains DHA, but they also added flax seed oil (to which I'm allergic) and they are charging over $14 more than the "regular" Premama. Outrageous! Premama should stick to the origins of its purpose- nourishing mothers and babies- rather than unnecessarily changing things around and trying to scam a profit with repackaging. I'm more than halfway through my pregnancy and I have to go back to the drawing board for a prenatal vitamin. Very upsetting.
