As a software engineer, I really appreciate these bulbs. Being able to change the color temperature is a beautiful thing.As a user, my light bulbs now depend on an app. Which means sometimes you can't change the color or brightness, or maybe your lights blink for no apparent reason. Sometimes you leave the room and come back and notice that a bulb that was set to cool white is now glaring disco purple.But, I can now play with my physical world from writing code... so I deal with this BS! You shouldn't have to. Don't buy this product, I've written the company and submitted numerous bug reports in the two months I've had these things. FWIW, exposing your light bulbs to hackers in China is probably not a good idea
