I wanted to upgrade my DAC from the Dragonfly and was really looking forward to this! I bought is as a second DAC to use with B&W P7's. These are more expensive and frankly significantly worse than the Dragonfly. Not only is the sound quality average but it's built like a piece of s***. I have to imagine that there are WAY better DAC's than this. This is probably the biggest disappointment of any audio product I've bought in the last several years.
