This is a neat concept, and when the product was new, it turned out to be very handy. I could walk into the bathroom in the middle of the night and not ruin my night vision.Unfortunately, there's major issues. First, the suction cups don't work all that well. It's hard to get the device in place, and even harder to get it to stay. Second, the device started demonstrating reliability issues - the light might turn on and off way too fast, or the light might quickly cycle between colors before quickly turning off, or the light might be way too dim to be useful. Yeesh.
