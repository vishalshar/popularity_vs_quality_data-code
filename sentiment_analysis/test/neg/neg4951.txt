Bought this for my cat as a Christmas present-- he's a very playful nine month-old Scottish Straight kitten, and I thought this would make a fun companion in the morning as I get ready for work and his energy is overflowing. As others have pointed out, although the SHRU is conceptually great, it still has a lot of flaws that need addressing and I feel it is highly overpriced for what it is.The Pros:- My cat seems to like licking it (to the point where it's kind of creepy). He pulled the feathers off of the first tail within a day.- It moves around quite well on hardwood floors.- It's made by a small company that is trying hard to make innovative cat toys, which I really appreciate.The Cons:- It is hard plastic with no option for a silicon cover, and it is LOUD. I would be concerned using this if I lived in a typical apartment.- Since it's not a smart device, it rolls underneath furniture and has no sense for boundaries.- It has to be "programmed" through a computer application, when it should be incorporated on the device itself due to the very simplistic nature of the options. Once programmed, the modes themselves don't tend to differ greatly. The "Scaredy" mode doesn't seem to act much differently than the "Aggressive" modes.- The "sounds" it makes are akin to something a Tamagatchi would have made circa 1995-- my cat is too smart to find them compelling. They're literally little digital beep beep boop sounds.- Small design flaws, including the difficulty to power on/off the unit, and the USB silicon dust cover which is not directly affixed to the unit thus easy to lose.Overall, I would recommend holding off on purchasing this product until a new and improved one comes out. From a consumer standpoint, I do hope the company offers discounts to current gen owners as the device they are selling does not live up to expectations. If the unit is improved, I would certainly purchase another.
