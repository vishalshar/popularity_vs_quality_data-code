Would give this 0 if I could.  I had 2 of these.  Both would lock up after a few days to the point where you couldn't even access their web config page from the same network.  Only choice I had to get them running again was to unplug them and plug them back in.  Not easy when using them as surveillance cameras mounted high up.I contacted D-Link customer support and they tried to blame the issues on my ISP not having high enough upload speed.  Sorry, but if I'm on the same network and cannot access it's web config page that means the issue is internal not external.  And when the only devices that cannot communicate on the network are the cameras it means there's an issue with the cameras.  I wasted weeks with them blaming my ISP.  The cameras are now in the trash as it's too late to return and D-Link doesn't seem willing to accept the fact that the cameras are faulty to do an exchange (been too long to return to Amazon).While all this was going on, I ordered 2 more to setup at a friends house thinking I just got a bad batch - it happens.  Nope.  One camera has the same issue locking up, the other had a faulty day/night sensor and wouldn't automatically switch between day and night modes which lead to 100% black night-time images.  There was enough ambient light in the room where if I manually switched modes the picture was perfect but we needed an auto-switching camera so this was useless.4 of 4 back cameras.  Horrible customer service on the D-Link side of things.  Will never buy a D-Link product again after this.
