I got these to use under my helmet while riding my motorcycle.  I followed the molding video as closely as I could and got them to form to my ears.  The first time I tried to use them with my helmet they popped out of my ears as soon as I put my helmet on.  This made it nearly impossible to get my helmet back off.  It was such a painful experience and I haven't bothered trying to use them again.
