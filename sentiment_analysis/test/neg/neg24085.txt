I recently bought the Misfit Sine 2 after the battery died on another well-used tracker. The Misfit itself is pretty nice. It seems well made and looks cool. However, just as others have said in their reviews the design of the wrist strap and clip are so awful the tracker is practically unusable. After less than a month I've stopped wearing it because it repeatedly falls out of the wrist strap.  The clip is not much better because there is no friction to make it hold on to your clothes. I tried carrying it in my pocket for a while, but it falls out easily from large pockets because it is so smooth. Until they redesign the holders, this is basically a waste of $100.
