This is my second iOttie. I bought the first one a few years ago for my iPhone 5 and it was the best phone holder I have ever had. And then, I bought this product for my iPhone 6S plus. It was a bad decision. The car mount fell apart after 5 days of use. Two of the screw heads cracked. So, it couldn't hold up my phone anymore. With that price, I expected something with higher quality. This is really frustrating.Update on August 31, 2016:So they contacted me today and said they will ship me a new one. I will not know the quality of the one they send me until I receive it and try it. But at least, their customer service is good.
