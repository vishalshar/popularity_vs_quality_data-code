This is my second review.Backstory.  Bought first time around, the plastic cover broke and the cleaning tool bent.  They did offer me a "free" replacement.  But that replacement would come a month later.  REALLY??  So returned it for full refund.Second time.  Ok the above might be an anomaly.  And my daughter begged me to buy another one.  Ok.  So ordered another one and it came within 4 days.  So if you buy it - 4 days.  If they send you a replacement - 1 month.The first 5 minutes the pen jams.  Trying to unjam.  I think their was little pieces stuck near the rotor where I couldn't get at it.  It kept jamming.  Nothing would come out.Enough of this.  So I put the nozzle back on and where it connects snaps right off.Returned *again* for a full refund.I don't know whats up with all these "VINE" reviews that give it such high marks.  If those people actually paid $135.00 for it instead of getting one for free, they might have a more realistic review.I would steer clear of this.
