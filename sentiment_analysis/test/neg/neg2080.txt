I initially bought the more expensive replacement screen hoping for a more quality product. When I installed the screen it had a "light" spot in the middle of the screen and I just assumed that it would have some bugs or it would go away but it did not. I lived with it for a few months until yesterday when I dropped the phone for the first time, with a cover on it, and the screen went dead. It is not broke or damaged from the outside view as the phone fell on its back, but half of the screen is black and white lines with no response to touch. I pulled the phone back apart to check the connections were good, and they were. So I ordered a new one today from a cheaper source hoping that this one will last till the Iphone 7 comes out.
