Works well as a solar powered light with a good wide area of light and the adjustable stand.  However when I tested it to recharge my android phone, the way I would normally use it on a camping trip by leaving it plugged into the phone overnight to recharge, I found that the circuitry was "two way" so that after a while rather than recharging the phone in essence both battery drained each other.  Could be used as an emergency recharge source for a phone, but not as I hoped as a solar powered source for while on camping trips. Thus really too expensive a device for it's limited usefulness
