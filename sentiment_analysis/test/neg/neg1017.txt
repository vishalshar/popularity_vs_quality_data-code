This item is cool, but that's about it.  I purchased two of them, and neither have worked correctly from the get go.  Pretty disappointed, but then again , not sure what I really expected. Thought it would be helpful for night-time and would eliminate the need for turning on the light.  Neither item is on when it's supposed to be on and one stays on all the time, except for when I want it on :)Cheap plastic, poor fit, suction cups wouldn't stick to bowl etc.  I'd steer clear of this and save your money!
