UPDATE: My original review is below and was written shortly after I got the earphones. I had given them two stars. I have been using them without the molding pieces since I never could use those. Last week, before the earphones were five months old, one channel went out. Apparently, the wire is broken where it comes out of the plug. When I move it, one channel goes off and on. The wire is very thin and flat, so it only bends in two directions which causes it to break sooner than round wire which can bend in different directions. These earphones were a total waste of $60.PREVIOUS REVIEW: The concept here is great but the problem is that the pliable material is so hard to mold that you can't keep the earphone in the perfect position while you mold the material into place. It pushes, pulls and misaligns the earpiece away from the perfect position where you get the best bass. I heated and molded mine three times and gave up. The material has been changed so much from the original form that I can't use it again, and I'm not about to spend another $15 for new molding material. They do stay in place well but I can't use them if I can't get them to sound right.
