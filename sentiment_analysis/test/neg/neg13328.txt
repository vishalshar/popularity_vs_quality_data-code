Purchased for personal home inspection, yet completely useless item. Marketed specifically towards "homeowners, inspectors, contractors, and more", yet cannot detect areas of thermal leak or even ducktwork within the wall. Would never have expected it to work as well as the models costing thousands of dollars, but for close to $350, it should have detected some amount of heat loss. Completely disappointed in this product.
