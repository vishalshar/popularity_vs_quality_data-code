Beautifully designed but poorly executed. It is NOT 100% leak proof. The tags on the product explain this as well. If the coffee is steaming it is not leak proof. It will leak all over you.This fact would not bother me if this wasn't a coffee mug. Who likes lukewarm coffee?? for me to use this mug correctly I have to put the coffee in it then wait awhile for it to cool down. Very inconvenient. I'm a little disgusted with this company but I love the design so much I might just deal with it.
