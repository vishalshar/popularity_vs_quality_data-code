I am very disappointed in this, especially for the price. The background (or tiles) are only magnetic on one side, so basically you can only add the magnetic accessories to one side of the picture making some of the magnetic cutouts worthless because they are geared toward the theme of each tile background. I really wanted to like this and was so excited about it.  Glad I discovered this before I bought the big set!
