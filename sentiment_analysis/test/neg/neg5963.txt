I bought this for my husband as he loves mushrooms.  We followed all the directions and spritz'd it twice a day like the directions state.  What a big freaking waste of money.  With the 20 dollars I spent on this I could have bought a ton of mushrooms at the store.  You'd think it would be fairly easy to grow fungus but not so!!  I also had a heck of a time getting the product from Amazon as a present.  It was ordered and canceled and then ordered again...not delivered and rode around on the FEDEX truck and then delivered after the date that I needed it and then as an honest customer I called to actually be charged for this worthless product.
