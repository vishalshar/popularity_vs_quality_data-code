This item is a good idea but it does not work properly. The button takes a dozen or more times to turn the machine on, then a dozen more times to get the machine to the chosen distance. The cord is too loose- when the cord comes out I have to start the process all over again. When it works it's fun, but it is so poorly made that it isn't worth the money.
