I was really excited about this product.  I knew this wasn't a gun "safe" per say, but that wasn't what I was looking for.  I wanted something that would reliably give me access to my firearm but keep my child or anyone else from touching it.  I love everything about the construction, design, technology, etc.  It just didn't work.  I couldn't get the fingerprint reader to work more than about 25% of the time.  Even worse, there were several times where it locked me out completely and I had to open it with the wristband.  I called customer service and they were as helpful as they could be, but still no solution.  I programmed it with several fingers, re-programmed again and again but couldn't get it to be reliable.  Hopefully you have better luck.  The return was no problem and I've already purchased another brand which is not as "cool", but it's opening for my fingerprint 98% on the first try, the other 2% with a 2nd try (a total of 5 seconds).  I'm happy now with my reliable but "ugly" nightstand safe.
