I've never written a product review before. This seemed worth it to warn other consumers. Pivotal Living appears to have evaporated completely, so even if they were inclined to provide support (they're not, check the BBB), there's no one there to answer the phone when your band doesn't work. And it won't work - anyone thinking of buying this band should understand that. If youre still considering purchasing one of these bands even after reading that statement (and you shouldnt be), here are the many reasons why this isnt worth any more time wasted trying to decide between this and other bargain basement fitness bands.*Step tracking*The step tracking accuracy is awful. For example - my daughter woke up, used the restroom, picked up a book from the living room, and sat down to breakfast. I already have 830 steps! she proudly exclaimed. If the tracking was consistently wrong you could at least set a goal with an appropriate offset, but its not. Sometimes its close to accurate and others its wildly off course. Weve made several comparisons with a small dedicated pedometer that is much more accurate and the results of the Pivotal Living band are inconsistent. We also had several days where the band just decided to delete all data from itself and reset its time. When that happens the only thing you can do is accept the loss and move on.*Syncing*Good luck. Its probably a warning sign when part of the official troubleshooting flow for sync issues is completely delete your account and just start over, but that really is in there. Across multiple smartphones the results are the same  the band syncs successfully about one in every five timesuntil it decides its done with this syncing business. When that happens youre lucky to get a 1/25 success rate. If the app or band experiences any kind of an error while syncing, all stored data is wiped with no ability to recover. Try explaining that to a kid who worked really hard to meet a goal.*App*The app seems fine. Its a little finicky with some odd UI choices (no undo, nutrition sliders right where a normal user would scroll the screen) but overall it looks clean and modern. Like the band itself, all of this is a pretty tech sheen on top of a cheap mess. The app will store your login data when it feels like it. Otherwise you have to enter your credentials every single time you go to use it. Youll get lots of chances to see what the app chooses for you too, because it crashes all the time. Sometimes it will crash while crashing. Thats kind of impressive in a sad way; Ive never seen it with any other app. Tracking nutrition within the app is cumbersome and not intuitive but theres no support to help you if you get lost. Searching for friends is unreliable and sometimes a distinct and unique name will return a list of unrelated people instead of your intended fitness partner. I couldnt actually comment on how that partnering works  it took weeks to successfully set up a family fitness group but by then none of the bands were working so no one was logging in to compare stats.*Customer Support*HahahaThis is a shell of a company (and maybe a shell company too). It could be that someone is still working there but if so all theyre doing is clearing out a warehouse and unloading the remaining boxes of broken bands to Amazon before they get on a plane to Mexico. There are still inexplicable Facebook posts along the lines of Healthy things! Corporate branding! but I suspect those were pre-scheduled long ago. The comments are full of desperate customers trying to get help for their broken bands. The same on the Better Business Bureau website. And more on LinkedIn. Cheated customers are desperate for some sort of resolution but all were left with is the ability to complain on the Internet. We already had that, Pivotal Living. It doesnt really do anything, and its taking away from valuable fitness time. Good thing I got 642 steps in just typing this review.Weve never owned another fitness band so I cant tell you where to go instead, but I can say that I wish I had heeded the many one-star reviews already on the product page back when I bought some of the Pivotal Living bands for my family. Youre not saving anything by buying one of these. Youd have a more cost-effective experience throwing a penny on the ground every time you take a step and at the end of your walk counting how much money you threw away.
