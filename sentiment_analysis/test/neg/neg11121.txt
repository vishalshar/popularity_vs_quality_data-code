I am totally dissatisfied with this product. The phone would not activate and I spent over 2 hours on the phone with"great call" reps trying to get it working. 5 of the 8 reps I dealt with were less than adequate, the others were fine to work with, just ineffective. They are sending me an activated phone that I should have in 2 days. I bought this phone for my 85 year old father. Thank goodness I had it sent to me instead of him. He would have been a basket case going through what I went through. Friendly people for the most part, inferior product for sure.
