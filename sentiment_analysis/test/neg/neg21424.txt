I wanted to like this thing so badly, but unless I've gotten two of these projectors that simply suffer from the same anomalous problem, I think I have to send them back and keep looking for a good portable projector.I'm an artist and I figured I would use a projector for tracing things, such as lettering, onto canvas or paper. I didn't notice this until recently with my first Cube, but the unit throws the picture at a noticeable angle. (See the photos below.) This is an issue because if I set up the projector at an angle (so that the picture isn't skew), then try to focus, it is not sharp for all of the picture. Given that I'm often tracing intricate things, it's so difficult to try to adjust focus without accidentally moving or nudging the projector, and it's hard to set it up to be exactly where it was before. Having to stop and tinker with the projector absolutely kills momentum and is incredibly frustrating.When I noticed this, I figured it might be due to a defect, so I ordered a second one. It came yesterday and the first thing I did was pull it out of the box and set it up on the floor to see if it does the same thing. Lo and behold, it does. I'll be sending them both back; I had held on to the first while I waited for the second one in case I needed to do work, but back they go.Also, with the first one (I haven't tried the second one), the tripod mount is uncomfortably snug -- almost feels like it wouldn't fit sometimes, and would require a bit of force. I ended up using the tripod straight on instead of diagonally.I wanted to like this little thing so badly, but sadly, this issue is a deal-killer for me.
