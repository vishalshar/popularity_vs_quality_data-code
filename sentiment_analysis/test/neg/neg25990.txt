Ive been watching these for a long time now and compared them online to other wireless Bluetooth earphones out and soon to come. The Dash was said to be the best. When I received them, the unboxing was nothing short of beautiful. The earphones themselves, at first feel and glance, beautiful. You can immediately see the quality and workmanship put into the product itself, as well as even the packaging.But at the end of the day, it's all a fluke! It's as if they put a Yugo engine inside of a Lamborghini.First off, the whole point of being wireless, is the luxury of being hands-fee. But you have to hold your phone nearly above waste level and sometimes switch hands and almost hold your head certain ways in order to even keep the Dash from continuously cutting out! This is extremely frustrating. Then, the left ear completely stops working! Both ear phones are inserted properly and snug in my ear as directed in order to work properly, but they don't, yet they just simply do not work!!!! $379.00 down the drain! I do understand this is a new product and there will be quirks and kinks to workout. But why on earth would a product be released to the public at such a high cost, yet NOT WORK to at least stay connected??!! And btw, if you do not have a computer, there will be NO upgrade for you. WOW. Thanx for taking advantage and misleading people Bragi.
