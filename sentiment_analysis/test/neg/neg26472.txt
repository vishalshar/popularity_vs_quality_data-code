First off, the setup wizard is a convoluted mess - I had to re-pair to the pod four times during initial setup and the worst part was there is no visual indicator to tell when I was actually paired to the pod which made for a terrible experience allowing me to keep carrying on with the setup only to later find out that I was wasting time.  I started with a Westinghouse TV - I could not find a code that would work in the database - OK, not necessarily a major brand I guess but considering this supposedly support a billion devices, I would have guessed Westinghouse would have been included.  Went on to my Onkyo receiver - after messing around with the thing for a good 50 minutes trying to navigate the code groups just find the correct code, I end up with the attached remote.  The mobile app looks like it just came out of a remedial middle school science fair.  Didn't even try to find any other devices because it wouldn't be worth the time.On a plus side - the hardware design looks really nice.
