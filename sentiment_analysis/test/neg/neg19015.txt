I bought this camera because I couldn't find the closeli version anymore for just real-time viewing.Two concerns:First, this camera does not seem to have enterprise level security as noted.  The setup process for this camera exposes your full wifi SSID and password in clear text within the QRCode (square barcode).  Scan the QRCode with another phone and it's obvious.  The Closeli version of this same camera did not do that.  *Maybe* everything else within the app is encrypted but it's worrisome that this was missed.Second, real-time video has an annoying background noise at any quality level.  If you use the camera as a monitor where hearing sounds is important, I'd say pass.
