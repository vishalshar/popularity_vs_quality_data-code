This item description is extremely misleading. It's says Large elk antler, and has an image that shows a LARGE, larger than palm sized antler but the one I received was less than 4" long. I can't give this to my dog because he will choke on it, as he is a LARGE dog. Not to mention I then tried to return the antler, but lo and behold, it's not eligible for return, Do not buy.
