Didn't work as advertised. It didn't work for any of our children. They still woke up, and now we had to take an extra step to inform the application that the child woke up. It was cumbersome to go back after the fact and recall what time he/she woke up. I don't think we were ready for the extra hassle of dealing with an application in addition to an awake child.I would not recommend this product. You are better off attempting to wake your kid up by gently rocking him/her if he/she wakes up at the same time every night.
