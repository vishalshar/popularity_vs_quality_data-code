Huge disappointment! I got this for my son's birthday, which was 10 days ago, and it still does not work. The OS on the card was not up to date so I tried to update it by following the instructions provided on Kano's support web site. I received a deluge of error messages!!! Evidently there is an issue with the card or the software that prevents the updated OS from being installed on the card. I tried a different card, but that did not work either. I have wasted many hours trying to get this thing to work.Tech support is virtually non-existent. I sent emails to them and they provided cryptic and confusion instructions (even for some one who is tech savvy). There is no phone based or US tech support. I have been waiting over a week for a replacement card that was supposedly sent. No tracking information was provided so I have no idea when to expect to receive the replacement card. Needless to say, this was a huge disappointment for my son's birthday. Kano seems to be a company that is not quite ready for prime time. I probably will return this to Amazon for a refund.
