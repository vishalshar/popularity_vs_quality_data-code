I love the concept but there is room for improvement.It shoots out cat treats just an inch or two out in large amounts.  I wish it would have shot farther out and only a few at a time. I used Temptations cat treats.  I got this to check up on the cats a few times a day but since it shot out so many the first time, they got their fill and lost interest in showing up for the rest of the day.I could live with that.What prompted me to return this was the extremely poor picture capture quality.  It just wasn't worth it for the price.  Again, I like the concept and Maybe after some upgrades and improvements I'll give it another try.
