The grip base is too thin :/ I've knocked it over and spilled it a couple of times -.-  I bought it for this EXACT reason and it cant even do it :(Only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it is still a nice cup with nice isolation. But the grip is just subpar. (I tried most surfaces and it worked semi well ONLY on glass. My wooden desk was a semi fail most times)
