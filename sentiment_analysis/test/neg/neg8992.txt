I came home one day to find this Water Garden leaked out a substantial amount of water. Of course , this happened after the 30 day period for returns. I'm very unhappy with this item. Before the leak happened, I had been growing delicious sprouts. I think think this item costs too much much to leak after only 2 months. I have had aquariums that lasted 10 years, were larger and contained more water, and didn't leak....It would have cost a lot less if I made a top for an aquarium to fit the growing cups.
