1 bulb in this 2 bulb + hub package just didn't turn on at all. Seems it is faulty.The occupancy sensor just didn't work on the other bulb. I left it on in the bathroom with doors shut for hours, and it never went off. I tried changing the location to the kitchen and had no one go even remotely close to it, yet it never turned off. I tried setting it to turn off both on auto mode and manually after 15 seconds. Both failed every time.If there are a few doors between the hub and the bulb, it took a long long time for the hub to detect the bulb. Even though the distance between the both was less than 12 feet.Each time the main power switch is turned off (either deliberately or by accident) it takes a whole minute for the bulb to come to full intensity when turned on again.There is a 3-5 second lag between triggering the an action on the app, and the bulb actually performing that action  Very frustrating as I have hue bulbs, as well as tp-link smart plugs and they both turn on instantly once triggered using their respective apps.I didn't have one good reason to hold on to these bulbs and am returning them within a few hours of buying them. I was really looking forward to using them because of the other nice reviews and especially for its occupancy sensor. Bummer!
