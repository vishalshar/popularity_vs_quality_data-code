I bought this item for myself (High School Varsity Football Receiver), at first I was amazed at how tacky it would make my gloves. A very small amount would make my gloves super sticky after a few seconds of hand drying. I immediately noticed how easily I could grip/catch the football. Soon all the other receivers and position players wanted some. All was fine... until the next week. I assumed it was going to be a similar experience, but instead my gloves would get really sticky (like the should), but by the time I actually needed them to be sticky my gloves would actually be slippery from the substance. This happened to everyone who put it on that game... lots of drops (luckily we ran well and had a good defensive night). The product would be sticky immediately after applying and drying, but would then make my gloves unusable for catching! I tested it out the next week and the same thing happened. Now no one on the team uses it at all. I would NOT recommend this product.
