Ordered this, got maybe an old model? Bit of bait and switch!!! Literally bought it a few days ago. It didn't have the different section on the bottom (shoddy looking metalic red steel?)), and wasn't really effective. First day it worked okay and prevented a spill. Then a slow bump (with elbow on desk) later on made it topple over and land on the tile.Doesn't do what it claims, and is expensive for just being a sub-par mug that doesn't insulate for very long. Would not suggest buying, unless this "new" model improves that. Until then, false advertising and wouldn't trust this product.
