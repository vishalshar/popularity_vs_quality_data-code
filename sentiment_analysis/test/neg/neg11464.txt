Do NOT buy!  I had a DLink camera previously and it worked great.  I thought these would be great to add to the mix.  I purchase both a sensor and siren.  2 hours of going through the process to connect the devices...I called technical support.  The Tech Support was pleasant and tried to help but after another hour of going through the setup process over and over again I give up.  I have used difference mobile devices, different routers, different locations.  Both automatic and manual setup.  NOTHING works.  Tech support didn't even flinch at having to go through the setup process repeatedly, I wonder how many times they go through this daily.  I finally had to hang up and go to bed frustrated.  Really sorry I didn't read ALL of the reviews, this product is obviously NOT ready for the market.
