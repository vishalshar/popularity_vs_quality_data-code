I had high hopes for this product as a sufferer of GAD.  Unfortunately, it didn't ever seem to pick up correctly on my calm and tense states.  It also recorded focus streaks when I wasn't wearing it at all!  After wearing it for two weeks I had one of the worst anxiety attacks of my life, in the middle of which this thing recorded 10 minutes of calm!  I was not calm, in fact had I been able to move or speak to dial 911 I should have been in the ER my tension and anxiety where so high and uncontrollable.  What a waste of money!
