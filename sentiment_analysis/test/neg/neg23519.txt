Please don't waste your money on this awful product.First Cube came and would not work; we followed all the instructions and called customer service who were absolutely useless. Had to send it back and wait for another.Cube no. 2 came...and did not work either.Such a shoddy product. I understand perhaps getting a dud the first time, but really, even the replacement was faulty. And this is not a cheap product.Avoid..this is a cheap faulty gimic.
