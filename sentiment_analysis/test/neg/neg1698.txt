Expected great things but was really disappointed. First, battery life is atrocious even after the 6.0.1 update. barely able to squeeze 3 hours of use with medium to heavy use. Next, for a 5.2 inch device it feels huge. In comparison the 5.1 inch galaxy s7 is tiny in comparison. Camera is horrid, even after the update your looking at 1-1.5 second delay between button press and shutter. Speakers sound great ill give it that. NO WALL CHARGER?REALLY??? Includes the USB C cable but doesn't include the quick charge 2.0 wall charger needed to take advantage of this feature. at $299 on sale its still not as good as the Moto X pure which can be had for around the same price.
