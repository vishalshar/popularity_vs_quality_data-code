I felt it was dried out --  it's the size of a tube of mascara and was in a packing box that could have held about 500 tubes with no packing slip enclosed!!  would not order this again.  Actually disappointed in Amazon.  Usually have no complaints.  Absolutely not worth the price,  but I guess it's buyer beware!!!!
