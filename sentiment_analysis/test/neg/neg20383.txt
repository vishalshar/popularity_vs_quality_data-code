At my job they have snack boxes and they sometimes buy these to add to the boxes, and I really enjoy them. However I recently purchased this item from Amazon and what came in the mail was a mushy meat paste tube, far from the enjoyable snack I've enjoyed before. I'm not sure what changed but I can't recommend these. I read some of the Q and As that people had similar complaints of getting mushy meat sticks. Be weary.
