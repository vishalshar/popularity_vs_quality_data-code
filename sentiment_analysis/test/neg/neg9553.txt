I was so excited to get my quneo after everything I heard. It would make life as a traveling, live, electronic musician a dream. It would make producing an intuitive workflow... that's what I was led to believe.I am using QuNeo with Ableton Live and so I started with the clip launching mode, this worked fairly well and intuitively with few issues until I decided I wanted to try the drum rack, I used the Coma button to switch modes seemlessly as i was led to believe it would be and it wasnt terrible. The pads i hit didnt seem to trigger logically corresponding pads on the drum rack but i just had to rearrange the drum rack on ableton to solve that, no big deal but then I tried to go back to clip launching mode. It looked like everything was back to normal with all the clip slots illuminated but each one i pressed just turned off a light either making no sound (not launching clips) or sometimes carrying over from the drum mode one or two, but not all of the drum rack sounds.Often when I turned on ableton the quneo would not be visible, or if I switched projects and I would have to relaunch the program (or as tech support recommended turn off the controller and turn it back on in the preferences menu, which I'll admit worked a good 30% of the time). Usually trying to close Ableton or switch projects would result in the program crashing.tech support said that there might be a few bugs (no s***) and that they didnt seem to exist as much when people programmed their own settings into quneo so I decided to try that, I watched all the youtube videos on the coma mode and how to reprogram the controller and jumped into the project. It didnt work. It less then worked, now QuNeo doesnt respond at all, it won't let me do any new mappings, the best i get is light from the faders, I am struggling to revert to the settings that at least worked to a slightly usable level before  back but I can't seem to get it working. No clip launching, no drum rack. just cool looking lights on the faders.I would love so much for this machine to be all that it's hyped to be and I'm hoping that I just have defunct programming so that it can become what everyone raves about but as it stands I am not impressed. I definately could not trust this thing for a performance without something changing. Tech support is trying to help but so far my problems have just gotten worse the more I tinker.This isn't necessarily a bad product, maybe i'll change my review later if I can find a way to work out the bugs on this thing or if KMI offers some updated software but I can't imagine these problems are completely unique to me, and think you should know the bad with the good before spending $200 and countless hours on a new production tool.
