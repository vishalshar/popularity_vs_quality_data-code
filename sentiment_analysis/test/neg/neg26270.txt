Camera itself is great. Where Lytro is lacking is connectivity and software. I own a wonderful camera with no way to load it on my PC, because I have a 32bit processor. So, I think I'll get over that little bump because I have an IOS device. One small problem, if you use the Lytro app, your pictures are public domain. Mmmmm, don't think so. While the concept of light field photography is fascinating. The software and marketing are still back in the tintype way of thinking.
