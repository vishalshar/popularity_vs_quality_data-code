Not only is this camera very difficult to connect because it wants to make its own network, but it constantly disconnects as well. Instead, it should connect directly to your network and stay connected, which all the other cameras do. What's more, in "Camera" mode, it's insecure no matter what, which they warn you about. We had people prying on ours from day one, when it would stay connected. Easiest return decision we ever made. So if you want a device that can be hacked by anyone at any time, so they can watch you in your home and point a laser at you, or a camera that you have to mess with every single day to even get it to connect, then this is the best $100 you can waste. We returned ours and got Clever Dogs instead. They connected right away with no hassle and cost half the price. Enough said.
