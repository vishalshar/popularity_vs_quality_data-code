I was excited to get this, but after wearing it for about a month I was disappointed. The accuracy was poor, I wasn't able to wear it in different body locations as I had expected based on the description without changing my settings, it was uncomfortable against my skin and it wore thin patches in the fabric of my bras. Disappointing overall. I decided to get a fitbit instead and am much more pleased with it's accuracy.
