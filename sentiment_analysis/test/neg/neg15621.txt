This is reall a horrible pencil. I tried so hard to love it but I am returning it because it is horrible. It's point is a flabby little rubber pocket of air. It has fake pressure sensitivity based on how fast or slow you move and the angle of the pen. I love the design of its body and it's way of charging. If only it was actually a good stylus. I tried it in its native paper app in all the Adobe drawing apps in sketch up and tested in good notes and it is as effective but more irritating that a battery less stylus I have at home. Infuriating and I returned it today. Don't be fooled by its pretty cover. Regrets.
