Almost there not quite . The idea is good they fit great could not get them to consistently work when I needed to I always had to fiddle around with them to get them to either stream music or play from internal memory also while cycling the sound broke up a lot .  It didn't keep a charge and died quickly . The new head phones may be better I didn't have a chance to try them in water and the call quality sucks bad but the music is pretty good . I wouldn't buy until maybe another few upgrades or the next version came out. I even had to email customer support for the battery life and sound drops !
