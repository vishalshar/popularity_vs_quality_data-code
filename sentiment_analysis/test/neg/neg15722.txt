We've been excited to get this - partially because when they advertised that there were thousands of songs that came with the TheONE light keyboard there was no mention of having to buy them.  We did find some free ones and started there, but were disappointed that apparently the majority of the good songs come with a hefty price tag.We just set the light keyboard up and tried to buy one of their very expensive songs ($3.99 per song with no option to just buy the whole book as you'd be able to in hard copy).  After going through all the payment setup and download, we were informed AFTER buying that "OOPS!" this song didn't work with this shorter keyboard.  There was no warning that I could see about that before buying and no option to get our money back afterward.  I went to their website online and couldn't find a login where I could try to return this music either.  I feel tricked and I'm going to have to explain to my daughter who was really looking forward to playing this particular song.  Not off to a good start . . . I feel cheated looking forward to a "Nickle and Dime" experience.
