I bought these and my daughter loves them.  I was so excited that there was an option for great kids' vitamins out there and that my daughter actually liked them.  Until I read about the difference between folate and folic acid, that is.  Folic acid is synthetic and is what is included in these vitamins.  After reading up on the difference between the two, I feel I can no longer give these to my child.  What I don't understand is folate is pretty cheap, so why go with the synthetic folic acid?Response to manufacturer's comment:  First, thank you for taking the time to respond to my comment.  Unfortunately, from what I have read folic acid and folate are not treated the same by the body.  The are metabolized by two different pathways. Quoting from Chris Kresser's footnoted article, "The little known (but crucial) difference between folate and folic acid":"Folate is a general term for a group of water soluble b-vitamins, and is also known as B9. Folic acid refers to the oxidized synthetic compound used in dietary supplements and food fortification, whereas folate refers to the various tetrahydrofolate derivatives naturally found in food.The form of folate that can enter the main folate metabolic cycle is tetrahydrofolate (THF).  Unlike natural folates, which are metabolized to THF in the mucosa of the small intestine, folic acid undergoes initial reduction and methylation in the liver, where conversion to the THF form requires dihydrofolate reductase. The low activity of this enzyme in the human liver, combined with a high intake of folic acid, may result in unnatural levels of unmetabolized folic acid entering the systemic circulation."The article inludes a section on the risks of excessive unmetabolized folic acid.  I will not list them here.  If anyone is interested, they can search for the article or other ones like it.  There are other articles out there that discuss the differences between folate and folic acid.
