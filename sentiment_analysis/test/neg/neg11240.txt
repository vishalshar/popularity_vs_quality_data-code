Product "did not properly sync" during initial set up despite following instructions to the letter.After 3 days of them having me try various things to get it to work, all of which were merely various forms of shutting it on and off, the product still doesn't work and customer service has stopped responding and I have not received any communication in 3 days.Very disappointing, frustrating, and a waste of time.  Returning for refund and will try a different brand.  Should have paid more attention to the many other similar reviews and problems.
