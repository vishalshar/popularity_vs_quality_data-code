I've owned one of the 3rd generation mobile readers about 8 months. It has a smooth face, not the dimpled face that the 4th generation has. I liked it, I showed it to friends and my cardiologist. I recommended it. Then I bought one of these, with the dimpled face. I had trouble from the first use. IT took longer to settle down. The baseline was not nearly as steady, it frequently jumped and humped. I sent it back for an exchange thinking I got a bad one. The replacement had the same issues. I contacted their support and while I can say they certainly responded in a timely manner to every email exchange, nothing was done. Basically they said they don't make the 3rd gen (smooth face) mobile device any more and they think the 4th gen  (dimple face device) is just fine. I do not. Your mileage may vary. I am sending this one back for a refund while I still can and I'll be looking to replace it with a 3rd gen from the used or third party markets. Because I do want to own two of these. I am certain that a small, portable EKG has been very beneficial to me and my health monitoring. I hope they can get the issue that I experienced fixed.
