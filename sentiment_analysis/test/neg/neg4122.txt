I ordered what was supposed to be a new product.  Opened the package and inserted the batteries and tried to pair with my phone.  Completely unable to, because my BRAND NEW device had apparently already been paired with another account.  I have never been so dissatisfied with an amazon fulfilled product.While attempting to troubleshoot, the act of inserting and removing batteries revealed itself to be an immense inconvenience.
