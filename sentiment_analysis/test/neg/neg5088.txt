Having used a number of fitness bands over the past 2.5 years, I've found them to be pretty great for 1) establishing a daily activity baseline (most people are, I've found through conversation, less active than they think they are), and 2) making you consciously aware that you should probably be getting up more often than you already are, taking the stairs, and going to the gym at least twice a week.We're creatures of habit, and I found that as soon as I got a big boy job and spent a lot of time behind a desk, it got really easy to workout twice a week and that's about it. Fitness trackers help spur me to action. Your mileage will, of course, vary.I include the above to set the stage for why I chose the Misfit Ray, and then returned it: you need to wear a fitness tracker daily, without taking it off, if you're looking to maximize the metrics obtained from it. The Ray is good-looking (on the website), you don't have to charge the unit every few days (6 months is what Misfit claims you'll get before you need to change the batteries), and is small enough that you don't really notice it in the way you will a FitBit Blaze, Charge HR, UA Band, etc. The bigger bands are, quite frankly, not aesthetically appealing after months on end. They Ray is great in this regard. On paper.Aesthetics: mine (picture attached) is not black at all; it's pictured next to a Garmin Vivosmart, which is actually black. The Ray has definite brown and bronze undertones to it, despite every promotional image of the "carbon black" Ray being, you know, black. I just re-checked the website, and it looks like something Darth Vader would give a thumbs up to. Also, the "sport band" that mine came with is not black, and is instead a semi-translucent gray that looks much, much cheaper than any of the promotional/website images. Also, at the time of writing, there are zero Ray accessories/replacement bands available; there's just a "coming soon" blurb on the website. So the Ray is gray-brown-bronze and the sport band is a cheap-looking semi-see-through plastic. Not cool, Misfit.Tracking: compared with an Apple Watch and a Garmin Vivosmart, also worn at the same time for testing purposes, revealed some dramatic discrepancies. The Ray on day one counted close to 2,000 more steps than the Garmin or Apple Watch. My electric toothbrush made the Ray think I'd gone for a run around the neighborhood. Scrubbing a pan after dinner was also another several hundred steps the Ray registered that the Garmin or Watch didn't. So...keep that in mind. These fitness trackers are supposed to give you a pretty good idea of your activity level and not be 100% accurate, but...20% off isn't within a margin I think most people would find acceptable.Sleep tracking: very good. Testing for a week straight yielded results that were very much on par with what I think I was experiencing. And it tracks sleep automatically--no button pressing or app starting necessary.Notifications: they're not great. You get a color-coded light and a vibration, which essentially just makes you reach for your phone. Not a very effective system, but I knew that going in; this doesn't compete with anything featuring a built-in screen on the band. Bear in mind the Ray isn't a great option if you get numerous notifications/texts/emails during the day. If you're looking to cut down on clutter and prioritize when you need to bust out your phone, a smart watch would be my recommendation.Conclusion: for $99 (MSRP) for the sport band, and $130 for the leather band version, considering the fact that tracking was...not great...and the band arrived looking very different than the promo material, I don't recommend this tracker. I love what Misfit (slash Fossil, as they bought Misfit) is trying to do here in creating a lightweight, good-looking tracker you can wear for 6 months without a single charge. Problem is it doesn't look great in real life and doesn't track well out of the box, and there's no option to calibrate it. Nor to say whether you're wearing on your dominant or non-dominant hand. At this point in the game, the fitness tracker market is getting pretty crowded, and you for $99/$129 there are far more accurate options out there.
