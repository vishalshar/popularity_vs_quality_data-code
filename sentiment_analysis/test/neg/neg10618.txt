Jitterbug uses the Verizon network which is unreliable from our location. We get good cell coverage from ATT, but this is not an option with Jitterbug.The phone looks well suited for seniors, with easy to read keypad, menus and navigation.I took off 3 stars because it took 45 minutes on the phone to request the service disconnection.They even suggested a $10 restocking fee unless we spoke to tech help. Then, they said the $10 fee applied only to phones purchased directly from Jitterbug.The refund would be processed after the phone is received from Amazon.
