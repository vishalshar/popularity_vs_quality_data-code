A bit big for a small cat but it used to work well enough to get at least her general location so that I could bring her in at night. Now I've been trying to find her for 4 days and all I get from the gps is "we are having difficulty locating...". We are now in the middle of a huge storm and since I couldn't find her before the storm came I'm at a loss as to where she's hiding out, if she's injured somewhere, or if she's locked in someone's garage or shop with no food and water,..?As I said, it used to barely work well enough to bring a cat in at night but if you had this on an escape dog there's no way you could track them fast enough or accurately enough with this gps.
