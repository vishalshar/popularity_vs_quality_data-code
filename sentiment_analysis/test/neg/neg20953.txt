Purchased April 2016. Used it 4-5 times including a 3 day brisket cook (best roast beef I've ever had). Went to turn it on Jun 5, 2016 and it gets hot, but the pump doesn't work. Too late to return it via Amazon. Called Sansaire and left a message after searching with effort for a phone number. Warranty information was more difficult to find (link at the bottom of the web page). Not impressed with the limited 12 month warranty on an appliance that cost as much as a used range. Less impressed with the 30 day longevity.After about 2 weeks it developed a musty odor near the middle (assuming where the pump motor is located). I carefully dried it out after using it every time. Not impressed at all. I recommend avoiding this product. You can make the same thing for less than $60 with a $18 Temp controller, $8 aquarium pump (they'll burn out fast from the heat), and $30 for 2-3 immersion heaters. Add another $10-20 for an enclosure if you want. Add in some technical know how and your cooking.Update Jun 7, 2016: Sansaire called back around 7:30pm EDT. Said they would replace and send me an email detailing what I need to send them. Sending the old broken unit back was not requested. They asked for a picture of the e-receipt, video of me trying to turn it on, and preferred mailing address. That was a little tricky since videos tend to be large files. Will update if/when new unit is received.Update Jun 17, 2016: New Unit arrived today. Date of Manufacture Sep 2014 (original Oct 2015) indicates I was sent an older model.  The older model is harder to clean the pump (must removes screws) and the plastic is shiny not matte. The older model does not appear to keep the temperature as well as the newer (failed model). Still not impressed. I don't recommend based on initial longevity and annoyingly average customer service (better than phone or cable worse than Amazon).
