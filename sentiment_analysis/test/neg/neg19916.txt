Only produced one usable crop.  Kind of a letdown.We were initially really excited, but the first crop, while not huge, produced some very tasty mushorooms.  Unfortunately that was it.  We followed all the directions and never got a second crop.  We even tried letting it rest for a while and remisting, to no avail.
