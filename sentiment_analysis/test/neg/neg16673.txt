After further review, these are actually terrible.The app consumes so much battery it's crazy.It must run in the background for the gps coordinates to get uploaded through the app (which is the listed feature that I purchased them for)This makes your phone so hot you don't want it in your pocket and kills the battery faster than you have ever seen before. Not only is this highly annoying but it's terrible for your actual battery. In a world where phone batteries aren't easily or cheaply replaceable, this is unacceptable. Phones and their batteries are designed to sip power throughout the day. When you run them hard like this for weeks or months, you actually start to damage the cells and you get reduced overall capacity and an early death to your mobile phone battery.The app has plenty of reviews of this nature to back me up.I wish I could get my money back but I fall out of the return period and now I have $60 in paper weights.Truly terrible product unless they fix the app. I'm willing to update my review if they can sort out the problems with the app.
