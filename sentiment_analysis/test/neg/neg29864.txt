The phone does not find the tracker until you are less than 10 feet from the unit.I left the tracker in my car at a shopping mall in the densely populated San Francisco Bay area. Even after a few hours, the app was still showing its location at my house. It appears that in order to be found, another user would have to finish a cigarette within 10 feet of the unit.After around in my car for 2 weeks in the Bay Area, the number of "crowd discoveries" is 0!When pinging the tracker from the app, the sound is so faint and high-pitched that you cannot hear it across a room.Fortunately, Amazon issued a refund for me. I am happy that I can rely on Amazon!
