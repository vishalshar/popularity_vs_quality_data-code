Falsely advertised. It's suppose to stick to solid surfaces like windows etc but it's just a thin cheap non sticky surface. Very cheaply made item that you can purchase at any dollar store. In fact the dollar store one is better. I'm not sure if the wrong item was sent on accident but it's being returned. I would give this a no star rating but the star system doesn't allow it so I have to do a 1 star.
