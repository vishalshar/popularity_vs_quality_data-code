The product seems to be a revolutionary one, with great features and design.But unfortunately my one do not work properly. It is difficult to get a connection and most of time the keep it in a stable way. I made the configuration and reset procedures several times to try again the installation again, but it not work. Now a I am not able to see any thing in my baby room.I am in contact with iBabyLabs to see what can be done to solve my problem
