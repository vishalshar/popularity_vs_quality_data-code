I had been a happy owner of the Sony Dash, but as Sony has pretty much stop supporting it, it was time to look for a replacement. The WITTI Design BEDDI looked like the perfect replacement. I read through the specifications and when I saw that on top of the weather, time, etc. it supported home automation like Nest & Hue - I placed my order.It's times like this I really appreciate Amazon's return policy.Let's start with the app. I used the iOS app. It was a good prelude to the disappointment ahead. The app is full of poor English grammar and it was obviously written by a non-English speaker. For a company called WITTI Design, I also expected better design of the app, but it looks horrible design-wise as well. It also froze up several times, and often gave no indication it was doing anything while I was waiting for something to complete.Now, the BEDDI features: Nest integration: not really. You can only control the Nest under very specific conditions. For example, if you have set up your Nest with both a cooling and heating temperatures, you cannot control it - at all.I would guess most people have this setup, so BEDDI cannot help you. HomeKit support - I turned it on, and while my HomeKit scenes appeared, nothing actually worked. Hue Light Control - again, it saw my lights, but nothing I did actually controlled them in any meaningful manner.For the actual device itself: I understand it can be used as a Bluetooth speaker - I did not try this out, so I have no idea if that works.The device is pretty bare-bones. It displays the time, acts as a speaker, has a phone holder, and 3 buttons to trigger automation (see above, they don't work).I like where this product is going, but it is clearly way too early to be useful. Maybe after a few more software updates and a re-written app, this might become  useful. But for now, this is a dud.
