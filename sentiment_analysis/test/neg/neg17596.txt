Waste of money for me.  Tried it several times with poor success as it either went awry or bunched up fibers. Now, gone back to the shaker application. Pump may be better suited if marketed directly at those with thinning lines of hair to treat.  My single vertux spot works best for me with the shaker approach, not the pump..
