This unit is worthless, my primary reason for purchase was the pulse and O2 rates. Both readings are so inaccurate that any results displayed would be of no use to anyone, Example unit displayed O2 rate of 99% when actual reading was 93% (90-94% is considered mild hypoxemia), below 90% is moderate hypoxemia. After multiple tests, the results were so far off it was almost like the unit just made up numbers, pulse rate off by more then 40%, O2 levels off average of about 6%.The interface I would rate on its own as a 2 Star, I would have to question if anyone ever tried either the hardware or software prior to release of this product.Also note I am a long term Amazon customer, and this is the first time I have ever received an item so bad I felt a need to place a product review,
