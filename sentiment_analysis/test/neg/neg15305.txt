$129 for a 3% boost in reception.  I'm in the mountains and receive a -97 db 4G signal based on iPhone "field test mode" meter.  Put the case on and it goes up to -110 db (worse), but then improves to -94 db signal strength when the boost function is turned on.Seriously, that's barely a 3% increase, and only when the boost is turned on.  If the boost battery is dead, you'll have to pull of the case to use your phone as the case hinders reception.
