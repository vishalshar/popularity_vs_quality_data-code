I really wanted to like this product, it was cute and different from the Echo but still interacted with Alexa. Overall though, I've just been disappointed with it. You can't use all of the Alexa functions (anything involving smart home control won't work unless it was set up with an Echo first) and the triby app for Android is still half-baked despite many updates.It has basically become just another bluetooth speaker but today I discovered that the LCD screen is broken. I purchased this back on May 6th so it's lasted less than 4 months. For $200, I expect a lot more.
