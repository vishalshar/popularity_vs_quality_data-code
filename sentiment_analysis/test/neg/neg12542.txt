Still needs a LOT of improvement. Easily the  Finder apear our of range in the app, even inside my home (no more than 12 meters/36 ft).Using one in my dog in the park it disconnect from the app with the pet very close to me. (In fact I think is useless with pets in open spaces, and the beep bothers my dog a lot).Same situation using one in the car for finding it in the parking lot. The map is very low resolution, so the app says that in fact is in the lot, but not the precise place.Several errors on finding my phone from the device.Wait until 5th or 6th generation. This is a beta device, unreliable and VERY short range.I am in Colombia, thats the only reason I am not returning this devices and asking for a refund.
