Bought the throw size for camping.  When it first arrived I was pleased w/ color & feel of the product.  Just a couple days out of the stuff sack w/ light handling to feel warmth factor noticed that all the stitching was just falling out!  I really wanted to like this product but just terrible quality...Returning it.  Save yourself the hassle & buy a Nemo Puffin blanket instead.  The difference in quality is remarkable.
