On a positive note, the concept is very innovative.  The problem lies in the fact that these are first gen.  And if you've ever been an early adopter, you know that first gen products are inherently buggy.  The Dash has more than it's share of bugs.  I know, because I am on my fourth pair.  It goes like this:1. First pair.  The microphone stopped working after they got wet, and as a result, call recipients could not hear me but I could hear them fine.  Returned.2. Second Pair, exact same symptom as the first pair with the additional problem of the left ear bud cutting out during phone calls.  Bragi support says this is a known bug.  They're answer about water damage:  "Your pair may not have been water proof", please return them for another pair.3.  Third pair.  I did not dare get them wet, so they functioned somewhat normally most of the time.  Bluetooth connection is difficult to maintain unless the phone is within plain site of the earbuds.  The right earbud eventually failed and produced static.4. Fourth pair, relatively ok.  So far.On all pairs, the bluetooth is not good.  Phone calls are only so-so even after upgrading to 2.1.  The touch controls are terrific and the earbuds, for me, are comfortable and do not fall out.  Support services are not good.  No phone number, only email that is answered sporadically.  If it wasn't for Amazon's return policy, I would be livid.Are they worth $249?  Not a chance.  I would certainly be interested in using them had the company put time and money into QA and released a relatively functional product.  I purchased a pair of PowerBeats 3 with the W1 chip which has been a huge relief for me not to have to "fiddle" with the Dash to maintain functionality.  Try again Bragi.
