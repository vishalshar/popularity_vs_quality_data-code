I was really excited about this product. Sesame cranberry peanut butter. I imagined it tastes like cranberry. Unfortunately it did not. It had a lot of sesame seeds in it and just pieces of cranberry throughout.I could have just brought some organic peanut butter from my grocery store and put dried cranberries in it myself. For me it was not worth the price.
