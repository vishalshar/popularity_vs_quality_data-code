It's great being able to write on the walls without ruining them, but they only work well if you want to write and erase very soon after. If you want to leave writing up for a while (more than a day) then good luck erasing your writing without cleaning solution. It is pretty intense trying to get it on the wall, but it can be done, even with one person. If it worked like a normal dry erase board with easy erasing, it would be awesome. Sadly, it's only good for quick writing.Depending on the use, it could be great, or could be awful.
