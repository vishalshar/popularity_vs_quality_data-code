Love the concept but lacks in execution. As noted in other reviews, glass layer is super thin and very easy to break. Additionally, the green top comes off easily leaving the glass vulnerable to breaking. Needless to say, my 2.5-year old son tripped and broke the glass within the first day of using it. Big hazard! They should switch to using thicker materials (like those used by Lifefactory bottles) in order to make this glass work.
