- very small screen and looks far away, not really inmersive expriencie.- put too much strain in my eyes so I had double vision and some head ache for about 1 hour after using device for 1st time then got a bit better but still funny feeling.- very difficult and complicated set up for internet connection, did no manage to do it after a while fiddling with it- too expensive for what it can offered so returned, does not worth the money so returned.-  Virtual Reality googles where you can stick your smartphone into it are a lot cheaper and offer bigger screen a lot more inmersive.- Audio is superb.
