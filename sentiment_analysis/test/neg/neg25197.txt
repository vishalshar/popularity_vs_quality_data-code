I thought this would be a good gadget to chronicle my trip to Prague. It simply did not do the trick for me. Photos were blurry, and it rarely captured anything. I thought it was supposed to be a photo every 30 seconds. It took one like every 5 minutes. I also attempted to double tap many times and ended up with nothing. I returned it.
