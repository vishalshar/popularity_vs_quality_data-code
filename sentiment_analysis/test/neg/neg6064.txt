Directions: sting items with large opening on hemp. String items with small openings on wire. Wrap them together. It doesnÂ’t work. Do you need to purchase clasps? When you wrap the string and wire together, what do you do with the sharp end of the wire? I assumed everything needed was included. A picture or two would have been helpful.
