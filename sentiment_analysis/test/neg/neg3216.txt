I purchased 3 of these units and one of them did not open out of the box - We got sent a youtube video how to use an alan key to open the box! Which is a bit scary if anyone else can just flip it over to pop the door open - sure you cant open it by driving a truck over it but you can stick an alan key in the back to pop the door! Not secure at all. When I opened the faulty unit it wasn't put together properly - so the guys at Gunbox told us - don't worry - just screw it together and it should be fine! We must have missed putting lock tight on that piece - Obviously I am now terrified to use it for a gun - In case it wont open during an emergency. When asked if we can return it for a refund or exchange we where told to deal with Amazon as we purchased through them - problem is it took more than 30 days to get to me in South Africa with shipping delays and freight - so now we cant return them regardless!
