I got two Plugs, 1 of which worked for 2 months and stopped working. The other did not work since the day it got here. I could not process the return as I was leaving the house due to work to another state. Thus the return window closed.I have 2 D-Link Cameras which proved to stay connected and are easily accessible from the app however these plugs die out sooner and later, which is a pain because i would have preferred using the D-Link App to control all my smart house appliances.Do not waste your money on these.
