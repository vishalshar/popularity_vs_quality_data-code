Not Ready for Prime Time.  I have a large TV and Projector.  I bought the harmony elite for its ability to turn on and select setting in group sequences, e.g.., turn of TV, select correct input, turn on direct TV, turn on receive and select correct input. When using the projector I have the added tasks of turning on and selecting the correct setting for a switch, turning on and moving the lens, and turning of lamps.  When it works it is very nice.  At least half the time it has an issue.  To begin with I am technically savvy and yet I spent two hours trying to program the remote; an hour and a half with a tech on phone that was useless and finally with a second tier tech that could program everything.  The first issue is that the remote does not successfully store learned commands from another remote.  At first it appears to work but the server in the cloud won't save it so it will not work.  Strange in that the most basic remotes can learn commands.  Fortunately their data base is very large and they were able to find a file for each of my devices so I did not have to rely on the learn feature.  Second, nearly every week the remote needs to be synced to work.  Most problematic is that the remote relies on the Logitech server in the cloud and if there is a connection issue the remote does not work correctly.  Today the remote would not turn on the TV.  I was then told on the face of the remote to plug it into the compute to sync rather than doing a normal sync that requires a button to be pushed on the remote.  I have now tried five times to make an update and it continues to fail.  The remote tells me it won't sync until the update is installed.  So until this is resolved the remote does not work properly, i.e., several functions do not work although some do.  Conclusion:  the remote would be great if it worked but its reliance on the cloud server and the constant syncing and updating turns what should be a simple reliable device into a very high maintenance buggy device.
