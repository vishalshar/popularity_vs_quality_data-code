Wow, what a dumb controller. When I first installed it we were having a rainy period (in Colorado) and yet the "smart" watering scheduler was having my sprinklers water the lawn and shrubs every day for 6+hours per day. After playing with the settings some more, like turning OFF the next few days so it wouldn't water, it then stopped calculating any further watering cycles. Blossom support told be to switch on of the ZONE settings for "Gets Rainfall" from Yes to No, after which the schedule started to compute again. However, even though the zones had watering times of 18 minutes for sprinklers and 45 minutes for drip, the calculated run time was only 35 minutes! Support then told me that there was a bug that caused the schedule to be incorrect if watering started between midnight and 2AM. I tried changing the start times to be outside of this but it didn't help. I finally gave up and established a fixed schedule for watering.After a week or so had gone by I tried again to use Smart Watering and found that things were still not working properly. While talking to support, they checked my account and read back different zone run times than what I was seeing in my iPhone app. We tried different settings and still were not seeing the same thing. (My total zone minutes was over 4 hours, yet the schedule said it would run from 12:25AM to 12:45AM).Another bug is the WiFi. I setup the controller using the Power Line adapter and was able to connect properly, however the Blossom-4E3B SSID continues to transmit even though I am not using WiFi. With the 2.4GHz band already being crowded, I don't need another AP signal coming from my Blossom to add to the RF noise.I feel sorry for the support team because they are getting lots of calls due to the buggy nature of their firmware (both controller and phone app), so often they don't have any good suggestions to solve the problem.
