Installed the illumibowl with a fresh set of Duracell batteries. It worked great in the blue color for a total of 3 weeks then it went out. Put a new set of duracells in and it now only comes on when it feels like and is very dim. Plus I can't change the color now from red which I don't like anyway.Just buy an led wall plug motion detector and save yourself from having to clean something gross to put new batteries in and attach. I believe the five star reviews of this are by folks reviewing after the first night. Once it's been there a while it will roar through aaa batteries. It will not last 3 months like they tell you .It's an As seen on tv type product that works once and then stops.
