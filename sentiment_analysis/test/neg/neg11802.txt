I was so excited by this invention. But I am completely disappointed. The LAP BELT GUIDES slide ***IN*** - there's NO WAY to LOCK them to PREVENT them from sliding IN to touch thighs - pulling the lap belt down TOO LOW, and not on hips/thighs. That is NOT where the lap belt should be. Your directions SPECIFICALLY state: "The narrowest locked adjustment position is for storage and transportation only." See page 6 of your online manual: [...]I have reviewed ALL of the videos you recommended to the other unhappy customers of your product, and NONE of them address this SAFETY issue.
