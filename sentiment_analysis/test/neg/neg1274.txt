I ordered the case at the beginning of August and for the first few weeks it worked as promised. I even purchased another one for a friend.But as time went on it became less affective. I tried the recommended maintenance of wiping down with a damp lint free cloth but it only seemed to help in the short term (a day at most.)Now it is the middle of September (45 days later) and it seems the case has a scratch that it cant heal from either. (See picture]Overall it is an impressive product when it works. Maybe I just got a lemon, but with it now being outside of amazon's return period I can no longer exchange it. I don't think I will sink another $40 for a new one.- ProSticks to almost any surfaceProtects all edges of the phoneProvides a slight buffer around the screen.-ConStickiness seems to wear off with time (Even with cleaning)"Self Healing" works to a point but has it's limits.
