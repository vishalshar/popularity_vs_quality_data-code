As far as keeping my dog from pulling, this harness certainly does the trick. However, she absolutely hates it even though I took meticulous care in fitting it to her 55 pound physique! While wearing it, she won't sit or even pick up her favorite treat off the floor. It's obviously very uncomfortable. While walking, she stays right by my side but won't sniff or do her business. I got onto a chat session with PetSafe and they couldn't offer much advice. Returning it now.
