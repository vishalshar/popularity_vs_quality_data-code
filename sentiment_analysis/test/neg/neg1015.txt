So installed this a couple days ago.  We purchased this mainly for our 4 year old son.  He's pretty good about not turning any lights on at night when he has to get up to pee at night (we have a few night lights throughout the house to light his way).  He thinks its really cool and loves to pee at night with it, and it doesn't disturb us since we have it set to green the light doesn't wake us up.  (our bathroom is connected to our bedroom, we leave door open for cats)My only real gripe is that, and  I'm sure we're not alone in this but we don't have any windows in our bathroom so pretty much 24/7 its dark enough to activate this light.  The motion sensor is pretty sensitive, I've adjusted its position numerous times, but pretty much anyone walking into the bathroom turns the light on.  We like it though, and I'll most likely pick up some AAA rechargeable batteries to swap out.  As long as I don't have to replace the batteries every week I'll be happy.Works as advertised, my son loves it (who we bought it for) so all in all we're happy!  If I were to change anything about the product it'd just be to make it not so sensitive to light since most bathrooms are somewhat dark to begin with.Update***1/30/2016So after the first set of batteries died in the device I put a brand new set of name brand batteries in and only light that comes out of the device now is a very very dim Red.  Doesn't work at all now, I've swapped the batteries out with another set and still low red light, so this product didn't even last two weeks!BIG WASTE OF MONEY DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!
