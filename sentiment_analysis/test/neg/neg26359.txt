Well, I am still playing with finding the sweet spot for this antenna so I can get the best reception, but so far is not working as expected or even better than my Mohu antenna. Image quality is definitely not as good compared with Mohu or even when I watch Netflix using signal from the same  wireless router. Many times the signal drops and when it comes back the sound is a second or so behind the image. Or the image has like a framing effect.Also the entire issue that you can't watch more than one channel at a time on more than one device makes it difficult to justify spending more than I would on any HD indoor antenna. I am thinking that I might return it if I can't get it to work properly. I'll follow up with an updated review later.
