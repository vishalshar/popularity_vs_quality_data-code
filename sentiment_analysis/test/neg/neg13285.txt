I received MOOV personal coach on December 30th 2015. I have done several running workouts and liked it a lot. It has a lot of good things to write about but Im not in a good mood to do so. I decided to test it on a bike ride and unfortunately lost the device. Similarly to what others reported the clip seemed to unbuckle and the device is gone. I have retraced my bike ride - it was only 3 miles run but since MOOV emits no signal there is no way to track so after less than a week use it is gone. I wasn't in a hurry when I went on my bike ride and made sure that the clip is secured properly but it unbuckled anyway. If you only plan to use MOOV on an athletic field where you can quickly find it then by all means get it, but otherwise I would suggest you find better use for your $$$
