The Narrative Clip is maddening. I wanted to love it. I loved the concept of it. But it's a disaster, especially at the price point. But once you realize that the price point isn't the end of the money you'll need to sink into this thing, you'll wish you'd never ordered it.Let's start with the hardware:- It's small. But still really obvious.- The lens is not wide angle. This is a real problem. It will only take a shot of what's directly in front of it.- The image quality is poor, even in bright light. In dim lighting, the photos are useless.- The 'double tap' thing to take a photo / check battery remaining doesn't work particularly well. You'll find yourself having to do it a lot to get a response from the device.- There's no off switch! Seriously. Supposedly putting it in your pocket turns it off, as does placing it face down on a flat surface. I have 500 black photos that indicate otherwise.- It's not waterproof. So don't lifeblog if it's raining. So much for using it in Portland.- Uploading can only be done via a micro USB cable. Better have wifi on as well. More on that later.Thought that was bad? Let's talk software!- Only apps for iOS and Android. The Android app is unstable, and not particularly intuitive.- CLOUD BASED HOSTING ONLY! $9/month forever. Seriously. That's the only way to interface with the photos in a reasonable manner. What happens if Narrative goes bankrupt or gets acquired? What happens to thousands of your photos should either of these events occur? What if they decide to raise their monthly pricing even further?- You can save them to your hard drive, but the EXIF data isn't shared! Nice! In other words, your photos cannot be organized automatically in software like iPhoto. Want 1,000 photos in random order? Then this is the device for you.There are so many ways this can be improved, and I'm hoping the team at Narrative listens to the feedback.Suggestions:Improve the image sensorAdd an adjustable wide angle lensCreate desktop software that allow modification to certain parameters including shooting intervals, resolution (I'd rather take more photos at 2MP than be stuck at 5MP)Allow desktop software to build time lapses of the photos shot.Wireless charging / bluetooth or NFC based photo transfer.Business Model: $239 for the device and $9/month for service? No. How about giving the device away for free with a two year contract? Charge $14.99/month for unlimited cloud storage w/ local backup via Narrative Clip for desktop. There's nothing new here. Cellular providers have used this model for decades. Take a page out of their playbook FTW.In short, I'm tempted to give it one star, but I do like the concept of the Clip. Here's to hoping that v2 is a winner.Sending the Clip back for a refund.
