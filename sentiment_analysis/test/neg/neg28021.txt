The idea for this is great, but sadly it just didn't work :(I tried several times and even purchased new and different seeds hoping different plants would grow better and I even tried several spots in my house and nothing could ever really get gong and the tanks just became dirty.Also the plastic on top was just slightly off size from the base so it never exactly sat correctly and kind of bowed in a little bit. I gave up on the aqua farm aspect of this after 6 months of trying different techniques and then just used it as a fish tank for the beta inside.So overall it was a waste of time and effort, The wheatgrass was the only thing that ever actually grew but it grew super well and then after a few clippings stopped growing and a second planting never really worked.
