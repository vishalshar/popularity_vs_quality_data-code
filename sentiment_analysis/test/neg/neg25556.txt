For personal reasons I openend the box 35 days after I gotThe amp is not working in any way. There is something wrong inside. I put in touch with the sealer and he told me that I'm out of the exchange/return period. For 5 days he cleans his hands and leave with the amp dead.So that store is totally not recommended and I'm really disappointed with them
