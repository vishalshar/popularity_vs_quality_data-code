Using Lifx light bulbs we can hop into bed and turn off (or on) the lights anywhere in the house from our cell phones.  This is a brilliantly conceived product.Update: if only it lasted.  Two months ago this light spontaneously disconnected from our network while another one we have did not disconnect and continues to work.  We've followed Lifx support instructions to reset the bulb but when attempting to connect, fails at the last step where the SSID swaps back out to the house SSID from the one from the bulb.  Lifx offers a two year warranty and although we're within that warranty period Lifx will not respond to email about replacing the bulb, having emailed them several times on ticket 164132. Amazon doesn't offer support for it either due to the order being placed some time ago.  So I now have $2.00 light bulb functionality in a light bulb costing $40.00 and a company (Lifx) which doesn't honor it's warranty.  Don't let this happen to you. Find another brand.
