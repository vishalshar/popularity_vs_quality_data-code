Its a few rubber bands, paper clips and a handle.  Doesn't fit on nifty fifty or my 18-55 kit lens.  So basically your getting a budget follow focus that does not work on budget lenses.  If it was 25$ instead of 50$ i might not be as upset.  Right now this thing does nothing for me until i buy a lens with a wider focus ring.
