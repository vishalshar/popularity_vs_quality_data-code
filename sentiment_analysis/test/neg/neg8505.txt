UPDATE:  I have tried and tried to make this thing work, but every other day it doesn't track my steps or sleep.  I have to reinstall the App and it works for one day, then quits.  DONE WITH IT.  It's too bad - the design is awesome.  Function is awful.My husband bought this for my birthday (Oct 22) - I loved it and was excited to have it.  This is December 7 and it no longer syncs with the App.  So I don't know if the app doesn't work properly or if the amazfit is broken.  I know it was working fine on Dec 5 and now nothing.  It hasn't been wet, nothing done to it out of the ordinary.  I deleted the app from my phone, then put it back on my phone.  I have fully charged the amazfit.  Those are the suggestions on the manufacturer's site.  It's too bad - I really loved wearing it.
