This toy has great potential but is just poorly executed. The pieces don't fit together, the parts listed on the directions aren't the same as the ones in the box, in fact I was missing quite a few. The structures don't stay up, my 8 year old got so frustrated with it she cried. I also bought the ferries wheel and it had the exact same issues.
