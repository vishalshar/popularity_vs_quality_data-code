The company followed up with an email asking about my experience with this product. I told them that the glasses kept falling out of the case so I put a piece of tape over the opening, which looked so tacky I would probably remove it from my leather cell phone case/wallet and be done with it. They responded with an offer to replace the glasses and case, which I declined as I saw others were having the same problem. Why would I want another one that doesn't work? Tonight I tried to carefully remove the stuck-on case from my wallet and it pulled up some of the leather in addition to leaving a distinct rectangle shape where it had been. Now I'm replacing my cell phone/wallet. I wish I'd have read this review before buying this product; if I had it to do over I would have saved my money. I cannot recommend this; it is a cheap product that doesn't work.
