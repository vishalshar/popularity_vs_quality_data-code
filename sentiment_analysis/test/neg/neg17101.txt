This food smelled really bad. It wasn't spoiled but just had a very strong smell. I have six cats and none of them seemed to like it much. They preferred another lesser-quality brand to it. I thought some of the six would like it but none did. If your cat likes sardines, or eats them and is familiar with a really fishy taste and texture, it may like this food. There are large pieces of sardines you can see. I think it's a great quality food but unfortunately my cats did not like it.
