Not worth the pain. I read the reviews about detoxing and was like, ok, I can handle this for a little while. The first day I didn't have any problems, but after that my pits were constantly inflamed (somehow extremely dry but constantly sweating) and smelled worse than if I had not worn deodorant at all. I ordered the lemonade and it did smell good, but the detoxing stench overpowered any pleasant smell that could possible come out of that. Disappointed.....and rethinking the buy, I think the amount that you get for the price isn't exactly great either.
