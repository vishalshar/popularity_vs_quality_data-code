I wanted to love this, but I personally had several problems with it.It functioned perfectly I believe. But didn't seem to clean clothing without addition of laundry detergent. Also many of our clothes became pulled and faded after we started using this unit. Maybe the ozone was too much for the dye and fabric? I returned it.
