Hi, bought 5 misfits for family, within one month 3/5 not working.  Emailed their online CS but NO answer, no phone #.One just dead.Two batteries loose, try to take out, 2 of 3 batteries in both Rays came out, but 3rd one, on the bottom got stuck, sideways, so can't use Ray.  NOt sure what can be done.  Anyone else have this problem??Anyone can suggest where to ship them back for refund or exchange?  Thank you
