Disappointed with reliability of this technology. When it works, it's wonderful, but 80% of the time I ran into problems. Often had to reset the bulb's connection by turning it off and on manually. At this point it would be easier to use the wall switch. Is supposed to work with Amazon Echo but I've had nothing but trouble trying to get it to work. Followed instructions per Lifx website and hit a dead end with a failed link. Will switch to Phillips hue for future purchases.
