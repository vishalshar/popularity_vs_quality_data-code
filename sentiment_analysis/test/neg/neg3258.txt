I purchased the Sansaire immersion circulator about 3 months ago. It actually worked well in the beginning and was enjoying the sous vide life, but then all of sudden the internal thermostat failed and the temperature on the device continued to rise without stopping. I had actually taken a quick trip away from the circulator but fortunately had returned in time to pull the plug before the defective Sansaire burned down my house. But no worries, right? I would just notify Sansaire and they would be aghast at the potential fire hazard their product presents, and would exchange the product immediately. Not exactly. Sansaire did not respond to my first two emails (btw, they don't accept customer telephone calls. Maybe they did at one time but ceased operations under the weight of too many customer complaints). Finally someone who referred to itself as "Rachel Sherman" (uh-huh) finally replied as was overly apologetic about the mix up and assured me that a replacement circulator would be mailed out immediately. Never happened. I followed up with "Rachel" ... and nothing. I followed up again, and "Rachel" reemerged, profusely apologizing for the situation, and even offered to thrown a free BBQ sauce or something (mind you, I never asked for anything freebies or anything more than having my Sansaire fire starter replaced). Nothing ever arrived. I followed up, AGAIN, and nothing. I followed up AGAIN! the other day. It seems "Rachel" must be tied up responding to other customer complaints. It must be a thankless job.
