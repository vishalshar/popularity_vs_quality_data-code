Bought a previously used unit and the app keeps on telling me to factory reset it as it has been previously registered. My guess is the previous owner didn't bother to reset it. Unfortunately there is no way to reset the device without contacting August and their customer service has been extremely slow so far. I've called numerous times and have been on hold for long period without being able to talk to someone.
