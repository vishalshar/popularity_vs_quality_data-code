Wondering if something is wrong with beef liver type ?  My dog noticeably lethargic and unhappy a short while after I fed them to her. Enthusiastic first three times she got them, same symptoms of appetite loss and/or nausea, and lethargy; now not only not interested, making it clear she has bad associations with the beef liver Bixbi.  I'm keeping my eye on recall notices because Bixbi was forced by the FDA in 2012 to recall many bixbi items for salmonella !  Unfortunately their plant in Colorado also produces brands I wouldn't buy.
