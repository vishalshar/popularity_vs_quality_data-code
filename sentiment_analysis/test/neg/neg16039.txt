It works.  It cleans off my gloves fast and restores the tacky surface.  I'm giving it 2 stars cause I don't think it is any better than alcohol based hand sanitizer or any of the other numerous and much cheaper bottled gel/liquids that people have been using to do the same thing for years.  Just google it and go pick up the right hand sanitizer for a fraction of the cost, you won't be able to tell the difference.
