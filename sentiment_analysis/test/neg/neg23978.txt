I am so disappointed. Despite reading all of the negative reviews, I decided to give Whistle a shot out of desperation because I have to have a family member watch my dog for a couple of weeks, and my dog gets anxious when we are separated and runs away to try to find me despite the fact that we are hundreds of miles apart. I got the device several days before sending him and tried and tried to figure it out. After setting it up and paying the subscription fee, the only message I could get was "Whistle is unable to track your dog, please try again." SO FRUSTRATING!!!! I basically paid $80 plus $10 to subscribe for a piece of metal and plastic that only looks like it is a GPS device. I am really hoping the thing miraculously starts working so that if my does does run away he is not lost forever.
