I had used a Trophy Skin's RejuvadermMD and really liked it, however it broke down in about 15 months.Since it's expensive to replace a $200 unit, and after reading good reviews about this mini, I decided to give it a try. This suction power is very weak, it is very difficult to do it on my forehead and my nose. I have also noticed the filter pads are thicker than the ones came with RejuvadermMD. Weak suction power with thicker pads is really not a good combination.You have to tuck your skin tight, so the suction with not pull and damage your skin. If following the instruction correctly, stronger suction works better on all areas of face, there shouldn't be any damages to the skin.Too bad I just can't afford replacing a RejuadermermMD every year and had to end up with this mini.
