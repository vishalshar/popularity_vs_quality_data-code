This didn't work for our dog.  She's a cow dog on our farm, very valuable to my husband to work his cows, and roams the neighborhood occasionally and will stay gone for days at a time.  We thought we could track her with this, but it kept saying she was within the zone when she wasn't and got stuck on one spot.  It was totally useless to us.
