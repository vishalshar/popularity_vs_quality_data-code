So you sell router, only feature of it is wifi? There is no wifi mac address filtering? No static dhcp? In 2016? You kidding me, right? I don't care how good your wifi is, but if you missing essential features -- you're useless piece of paperweigh. And you based on openwrt? And you still missing these? WHY?I'm not talking about new product's iOS application is not ready for 2 year old iPhone 6+ and shows up as zoomed application? I wasn't able to set it up via iOS app, so tried to setup via browser. It took 5 minutes to load login page to see only password field. How about username? I want to have a different username.  Then when I login there is no request to change password. You just don't ask user to change password, you don't ask user to change wifi password. Another question, why do I need to setup two different wifi networks? I don't want to deal with this -- I want to plug in, setup quickly  and use and forget about it. Why do I need decide every time which network I need to connect to?Oh, and coverage -- didn't notice any improvements, but noticed degradation of coverage.
