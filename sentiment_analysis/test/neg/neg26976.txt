Me and the misses were excited to try this out as a change up to the usual brands. She avoids birth control pills lately and I don't blame her so we are sticking to condoms for the time until a permanent solution is done. The idea seemed noble and figured they would be worth the price. First one broke as I put it on, second one broke not long after and I'm not chancing it on the third one it went strait in the bin. Happy anniversary we went to bed frustrated. Quality control must be bad on these. And they are 'lightly scented' AKA they smell bad in my opinion. The product is made in Korea if you are curious and if I had known this I would have passed them up. I'm not a xenophobe on where items and I find Korea is making really good products on par with Japan but with a product as sensitive as this I will stick with domestic. My lot number is 16AN002-HP if it matters and expires way into 2021. I wish you could submit a claim on items such as this but obviously you can't, I just want my money back! Maybe avoid until maybe they work out the kinks of the design or in my opinion avoid and save about half your money and buy a time tested reliable brand! I could imagine if you were using these for a 'casual' encounter and not a trusted partner you might end up with a STI/STD! Shipping time is LONG too. Thanks LELO for selling me snake oil.
