So disappointed. Defective product. Even after a full charge, the product only worked sporadically. It didn't respond to many of the commands at all, and then when it did respond, it only went a few inches, then reversed itself. I'll NEVER buy from WowWee again - this was my child's "big" Christmas gift & it failed on Christmas morning. If I ever order another electronic from Amazon (big IF) you can bet I'll pull it out of the box to confirm it's working the minute it arrives. I hope WowWee experiences the same disappointment in its bottom line that my child & I felt on Christmas. Shame on them for not having better quality control.
