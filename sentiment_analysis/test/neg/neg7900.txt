My son and daughter in law are avid gardeners and love growing all kinds of food such as veggies, sprouts and mushrooms.  So, my husband and I decided to give them this kit as a gift.  They followed the instructions explicitly but ended up with a box full of mold instead of mushrooms.  I hope ours was an isolated incident because this is really a good idea.
