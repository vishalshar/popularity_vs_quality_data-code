Would not charge.  I used an original apple charger and it would turn off and on.  No way it can sit at my bedside turning off and on all night.  Besides for the fact that that would destroy my phone battery.  Was excited for the thin charge but can't charge.  So therefore useless.  Read reviews and thought I may be a user that got the good package.  No such luck.  I guess there's a reason why the reviews were in the 3 stars.  And for $65 bucks it's awful.
