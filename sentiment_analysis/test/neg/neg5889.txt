So far this product has not worked. Thankfully I haven't had any rashes like some others. It does indeed make you smell worse. A very small ammount will take a while to dry. I used the unsented version to avoid rash and maybe that has something to do with smelling worse. I also understand that there's an adjustment period to any new product. A few weeks from now I'll update my review but so far not impressed and unlikely to reorder or recommend.Yup. Still sucks. Sorry. Going to try the 1oz green tidings for 7.99, see if that works.
