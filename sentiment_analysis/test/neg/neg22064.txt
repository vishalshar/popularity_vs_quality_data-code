I purchased this card for my mother-in-law to brighten up her birthday (and to driver her a bit insane). She opened the card and pressed the button and after 2 minutes the music stopped. My husband and I were both disappointed. Good idea but could have achieved the same level of annoyance from a regular singing card.
