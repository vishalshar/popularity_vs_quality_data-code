Works great when it's connected. Ive bought four of these bulbs and gave them 1+ week chance to see how they perform, the problem im having is it keeps disconnecting every single time. I have a wireless modem in my room and it still disconnects. So I'm rather disappointed in these bulbs as I really had high expectations for them. Guess I should have went with Philips Hue.
