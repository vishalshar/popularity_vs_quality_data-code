First off, let's talk about the accuracy of this device.  The minimum level this product shows for VOCs is 125 ppb.  That is the starting point. Formaldehyde at that threshold would cause eye, nose and throat irritation.  I seriously doubt the accuracy of this device or usefulness.Out of curiosity, I had a lab test performed on Formaldehyde and VOC levels in my house (two separate tests, as the testing and sampling for Formaldehyde is different than other VOCs).  These were both performed by PRISM labs and the results were vastly different from whatever the foobot is telling me.The CO2 levels are algorithmically derived, meaning there is no direct measure.  Given the accuracy of the VOC measurements, an algorithmic derivation of an inaccurate number yields another inaccurate numberNext, let's talk about the software - the app doesn't function very well.  For a few months, the charts wouldn't work historical data was stuck at 8am.  every day, no matter how many times you refresh it.  It still doesn't work very well now, you have to refresh several times...until the last update, at which point the chart button no longer works at all.Finally let's talk about the device itself.  For me, it frequently loses wifi connection, though I have it within 5 feet of the router.  It also randomly "resets", telling me 0/3 hours until ready.  The algorithms appear to not like big changes in environment very often.  Within the past few months, I'll open a window with it showing ~400-500 ppb on VOCs, then when I close it, it will freak out and jump to 1200ppb.  This did not happen before the round of software updates.  In the past, it's also within 10 minutes inexplicably decreased by like 100ppb.I've given up on support after the first few exchanges.  I would not purchase this again.4/8/16 edit:Thank you very much for the response from the foobot team. My issue not primarily with wifi dropping, it is with the accuracy of the foobot, especially after the recent upgrade that was pushed out.  The unit simply freaks out now.Let me provide you an example - I put the foobot OUTSIDE the house.  Traditionally, this has led to VOC readings of 125.  It tends to be 125ppb even when I place it near an open window.  It is now reading in the 1000-2000+ppb range.  For one hour, it also reached 29 THOUSAND ppb, I assure you I do not live near an EPA Superfund site and when I first owned the Foobot, it did not read at levels like this.I will take you up on your offer of a refund and email support.  Thank you very much for the generous offer.4/17/16 Update:As with the product, once again, premise is so promising, but execution fails.  I mailed support right after the CTOs comments to ask for refund.  After initial response from analyst saying they need to ask their manager, I have heard back nothing since then.  Emails for update was met with radio silence.  Nice.4/25/16 Update:Well, support got back to me after silence for two weeks and said that by having the foobot outside, it voids my warranty and I am out of luck.  I dont understand how having the device on the outside of window sill vs inside of window sill with window open is any different?  The 5 inches and mesh screen is going to invalidate the warranty?  While it's great PR having founders answer questions and tout satisfaction guarantees on Amazon, the follow up actions speak for themselves.5/2/16 and final update:Gwen from support still insists that my warranty is voided. Ok. However, they said they wanted to keep customer satisfaction and issue me a refund, but ONLY if I removed my Amazon review.  I was very surprised by this, as this ruins the purpose of having reviews on Amazon.  I offered to change my comments on the Support experience, if the final outcome of the experience is positive,but declined to remove my review of the product on personal principle.It's nice that the Inouk and the execs provide personal responses here and tout keeping customers happy and offering me a refund, but I am disappointed by the hidden strings that came attached with it.  I would not expect a company to request a deletion of a review as a condition for refund and position that as preserving customer satisfaction.  That's just bad integrity and values. I would not do business again with this company regardless of how good their products become in the future.
