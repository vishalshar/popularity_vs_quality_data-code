Beautiful watch, Its light, really comfortable and surprisingly accurate. I like the double tap feature that shows the alarm time but In order for it to function it must be stabilized for 5 seconds. Check out the help section on the Withings website:https://withings.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204237803-How-can-I-check-the-alarm-time-directly-from-my-Withings-Activit%C3%A9-Reviewed it at 2 stars because the first watch I recievied had lint under the glass. I contacted Withings, explained what was going on and had a new watch within a week. The second watch came dead in the box, after replacing the battery it started working. Also the leather strap on the second watch is much much longer.The previous watch strap had 7 placement holes and almost no extra space, the second has 9 holes with additional room to add 3 more... odd inconsistency. Finally, I feel that the 5 second stabilization info should be clearly printed somewhere on the in box materials.At this price point it should work right out of the box. Im tempted to return the current watch as I do not trust its build quality.
