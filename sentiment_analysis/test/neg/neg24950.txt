I'm not sure if I'm using the cheese paper incorrectly, but it doesn't really extend the shelf life of my cheeses.  Cheeses like cheddar and fontina still become moldy relatively quickly.  It might be better for hard cheese like parmesan.  Each piece of paper is also too big for a smaller block of cheese, so it's kind of wasteful.  I may try the Cheese Bag next time instead...
