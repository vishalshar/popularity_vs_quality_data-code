As the owner of a Golden, I wanted to share my experience with other potential purchasers of this product. Overall, the concept is well thought out and when it works, it is amazing. The key term here is: "when it works". The product allows for three ways to find your pet: Bluetooth, WiFi, and GPS. In my experience of 30 days, I've only been able to locate my dog via Bluetooth and WiFi - which includes other WiFi in the neighborhood. If I understand correctly, the POD receives WiFi signals and can locate your pet by correlating known WiFi signals to a database that includes the location of wireless access points that transmit these known signals. The correlated position is then sent back to your phone via cellular. As such, the POD is not super accurate when locating via WiFi, but well within 4 or 5 homes of finding your pet. In my neighborhood, we have a lot a trees that line the roads and that could be the reason why it does not use GPS (no clear Line-of-Sight to the satellites). In addition, the POD battery, at least the two that came in the package, have lasted at the longest 3 days and typically 1.5 days. As mentioned by another reviewer, the battery does take some effort to put on and off the POD. I can see how some people may over tighten and break the battery connector. To avoid this, I take the collar off my dog so I can carefully align the battery and have not had any problems. I have also not been able to sync the Activity tracker on the phone to the POD (apparently this is done by Bluetooth). Next, plan on waiting at least 1 to 2 minutes (or longer) when you try to locate your pet. If your pet is nearby, the response is quick as the App on your phone detects the POD's Bluetooth signal and you receive a notice in a very short period of time. However, contacting the POD via cellular is an entirely different matter. And if, for some reason, the POD loses cellular connection, which also happens on occasion, you will get a notice saying the the POD is not available. Needless to say, to get this message while you're frantically looking for your pet can be disconcerting. This is not entirely POD's fault, as the cellular carrier can be the culprit. However, the antenna design on the POD may also play a role. On such a tiny device there may not be enough antenna to get a good signal in certain situations. Simply stated, what may be a good signal on your phone, could be a weak signal for the POD. POD mentions the carrier in the US is either ATT or TMobile and I have no way of figuring out which carrier it is. I live in a densely populated suburban neighborhood with supposed excellent to very good coverage by both carriers - so I'll leave this issue of "no cellular" on the "mystery meat" pile. Based on my experience, when the POD works, it is at best 80% reliable over cellular. Roughly speaking, every 1 out of 5 location requests returns an "unable to find POD" message. If you wait a few minutes, sometimes the POD picks up a cellular signal and you receive your pet's locations and other times it simply does not connect. For me, that is not good enough. When it comes to my pet, I'd ask for 95%+ reliability every time. Note that your mileage may vary. POD is a well thought out product and worthy of trying. Mine will be going back, but others may find that it serves their needs simply because the device works based on their location (i.e. urban with even better cellular coverage, less trees, etc.).
