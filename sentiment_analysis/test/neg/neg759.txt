It smells really weird out of the box. I also didn't like the texture and feel of it it. It felt really really cheap. I know I could've just returned it, but I'm still putting sheets over this thing so it doesn't matter all that much to me. It does its job of keeping water from penetrating into the mattress so it's not completely useless.
