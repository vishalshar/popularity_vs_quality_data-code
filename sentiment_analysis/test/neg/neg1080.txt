A serious disappointment!!! Bought this for my vacation home. However it CANNOT be used because the app has a bug which will not allow you register an account. It's absolutely ridiculous that a web based version is not available, or that you can't create the myDlink account online.I bought this because I need to control the outlet REMOTELY, I only have a couple of days to set it up and now that's impossible.This is the LAST Dlink product I will ever buy.
