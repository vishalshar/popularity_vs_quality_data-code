I got these for my daughter who is 6, and when they appeared to be too big for her shoes, I decided to try them on mine. These didn't work at all. For the price that I paid, I expected what the pictures portrayed, and instead I got uneven adjustment even on adult shoes. I'm returning them and getting a refund for sure!
