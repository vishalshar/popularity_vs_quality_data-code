Chip is supposed to come at least "partially" charged. He arrived dead as a doornail. He arrived around 2 pm, and we charged him all day and ALL NIGHT (because he was not working) with the adapter as the instructions state. We also tried charging him with the stand, but it did not work. Every time we turned him on, his eyes turned purplish, and he would find his way back to his bed. My son, 5, is so disappointed. The longest Chip stayed on for was about 3 minutes. That was enough to record my son saying, "Hey Chip." The voice recognition seemed to work at that point, but then he died.My other issue is the technician who wrote the instructions. Terrible! First of all, a few separate leaflets are floating around in all different languages. No little 'book' manual - so unorganized! The directions themselves are vague. There is a sheet with pictures of the Bluetooth watch that tell you which button does what but it does not tell you anything more. I wanted to know how long Chip needed to be charged and how you can tell when he is fully charged. I found that information on several websites after searching. It should have been in the manual.In my opinion, for the cost of Chip, this product is not that exciting. I opened an Amazon credit card for the incentive and even though I only ended up paying $82 for him, I was still irate. We are returning this today and buying Cosmo as a replacement (which has almost 5 stars by the way). The customers do not lie. Do not waste your money on this...
