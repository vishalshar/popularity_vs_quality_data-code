Prefer the canary vs flex. Picture quality is less, night vision is non existent. It does not work independent of the canary. I cant change the sensativity for just the flex. better off buying more canary units and placing them inside. But then you lose the flexibilty to adjust the unit for best pic/angle. Flex needs a liitle more work. Day time recording is suitable.1/4-learned that the flex does work independent but you have to do go into sub menus to set. Waiting on ticket on night vision before I chg the rating.1/11-final update, rating unchanged.  Night vision started working after a few tricks from the customer support. However, it will not work through glass. I cant setup flex from inside my house to see the front or rear at night. This leads to problem 2.  When on and recording, there is illumination of an LED which draws attention to the device. It can not be turned off. You can only put this outside at a level in which a person could not grab or pull it. Im going to find a different product for my exterior.
