Disappointed. Frustrated. Victim.The first few words that come to mind. Even though the product is overpriced being a first adopter has its issues. Alas it had to be this product for which I have waited over six months then had to have it shipped to India. I open the packaging with gleaming eyes pop the magnetic flap and the five black screws fall off. The build quality is horrible. The product even though having a hefty price tag does nothing to increase the quality of the materials with which its constructed. Having shelled out a princely sum to first purchase it then an even larger amount to have it shipped to India I have only one thing to say. Don't buy it. Waste of money at this time.
