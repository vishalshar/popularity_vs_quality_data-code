I have tested the Coravin device with several bottles of wine, so far I am not satisfied with its performance.  I can taste significant amount of oxidation and marked difference in quality of wine comparing to when the bottle was first dispensed the day before. I then dispensed more wine 2 days later, then the last portion a month later.  The quality of the wine gets progressively worse.I have tried this with a few bottles from different vineyards and not one bottle has preserved its original taste when first dispensed.I closely followed the instructions and did give the trigger a quick squirt before inserting the needle to rid of any oxygen in the needle.  I remove the needle from the bottle and store the bottle in the refrigerator as soon as I'm done pouring.I seriously question the judgment of the famous wine critics that have endorsed this product.The device, however, is well built and operates well mechanically.  I don't mind the slow, thin pour into the glass as it lends to more aeration of the wine.Beware of synthetic corks.  As warned, it does not work with the device.  I didn't realized a bottle I tested had a synthetic cork because I didn't remove the foil.  In hind sight, I should have known because the needle didn't insert easily and took some force.  I took the needle out and stored the wine upright.  The next time i drank from the bottle I inserted the needle again and created a second hole.  As soon as I pulled the trigger to pour wine started to spurt out of the cork from the first original hole.  That's when I realized the cork is plastic and holes don't reseal themselves.  The other bottles I dispensed from had natural corks and had no problem resealing themselves.  No spillage when I set those bottles on their sides.I had high hopes for the Coravin but the search for an effective wine preservation device continues...
