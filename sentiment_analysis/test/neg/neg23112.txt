I had to laugh when I took this out of the box because it's so small. It actually  puts out a pretty good amount of sound. Would be easy to travel with. But.....the battery stinks. Every time I turn around its dead. We haven't had this product more than a month or so and we went from charging it every other day to every day. Unless you have the time to constantly remind yourself when to charge it, then this isn't the buy for you. There's no way to gauge the product to how low the battery is getting. It just within 5 or 10 minutes it slowly fades and shuts off. So annoying. I would not buy this again
