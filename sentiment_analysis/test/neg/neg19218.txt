Do not buy. This product did not fit on all 3 of my ps4 controllers.  Every time it forced the R2 button to stick.  Constant shooting,  or constant zoom.  I read reviews that said to shave some of it off for a better fit.  Still did not help.  I don't want to buy a product and "shave" pieces off.  I was not happy with this product.  There's other better trigger products on here.
