Where to begin..Pros:Setup is fairly easy though it is difficult to tell when the unit is on or off from looking at it.It's pretty light, it didn't even phase my cat when I put it on his collar.Cons:It is fairly wide, not sure why they couldn't have made it longer and narrower to more closely match the average collar. It's about 3x wider than the average small pet collar, and though light, it will still drag itself to your pets throat.As soon has he left the 'base station', it completely lost track of where he was, repeated attempts over the next 4.5 HOURS of trying to 'Refresh GPS' only resulted in "We're having difficulty locating your pet, please try again". At one point it said he was within range of the base station (he wasn't) and it won't let you attempt the GPS if it sense the base station. I *unplugged* the base station, and it STILL thought it was near the base station.Even after he returned and was at the front door, it was unable to locate him.This whole time however, it had contact with the unit itself, as it was keeping me updated on the battery status (down to 50% in half a day), it just couldn't tell me where it was.Bottom line, if you live in an area where you might actually need this unit to work, it probably won't.I've already sent this unit back, maybe in time they can get it together.
