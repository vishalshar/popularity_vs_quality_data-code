I am sad to report that - in spite of my long admiration for Line6 and their products - the Amplifi is a disaster.  It's not a question of "do i like it".  Its simply a question of "does it work".  Suprisingly (for this day and age when the internet is quick to disseminate knowledge) this thing simply does not work.  I don't mean its finicky.  I don't mean it will have an occasional problem.  It routinely loses its bluetooth connection to the IPAD and fails to function.  I mean every 2 to 3 minutes.  Continual failure.  Fails more time than succeeds.  Am i making my point?  I have no ax to grind with this manufacturer.  Its the opposite.  I have  2 variax guitars and I love them.  But this product is a disgrace.  Someone at Line6 needs to be fired.
