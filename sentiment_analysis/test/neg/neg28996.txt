So I followed the instructions to a tee with this product. Mushrooms grow fairly quickly and continue to do so however the problem is mushrooms groove fairly quickly and continue to do so however the problem is they were hard as a rock. Not sure what caused this did a bunch of research with no luck so not sure if it's the plants or myself.
