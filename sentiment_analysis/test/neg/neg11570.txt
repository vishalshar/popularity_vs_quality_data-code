The measure itself is great, BUT the Bluetooth feature is a PAIN!  I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 with Android software that I am using to connect the eTape to, and it is like an act of Congress.  It took over an hour to initially connect the tape to my phone, after which the Bluetooth feature worked great.  But after I shut off the eTape and restarted it, I discovered that the device was no longer paired to my phone.  Apparently you have to pair it to your device every time you use it!  This wouldn't be that bad except for the fact that it takes MANY attempts to successfully pair the eTape to your device, including but not limited to restarting your phone multiple times.  In the amount of time it takes to get the eTape paired to your phone you could complete most tasks that you intended to use the eTape on!  Disappointing, as this was a very clever idea, but a very poor end product.
