After 45 days later. I am sharing my experience about this product. First, Not to much necessary. I do not think buy a new one or seed.Because, When plants big and arrive to top ( close to light ) . Light is firing my plants. So there is no benefits of light. of course I adjusted for height.Second, When you buy a new one . You could not select another seed.Third, There is no rationale explanation without select different seed.Five, Mobile application has a lot of bugs. Please consider to read iTunes user feedbacks.Six, CRM does not professional.Last, There is no economic answer to grow plants at the house with this products. Seeds is expensive, rationale is not enough.
