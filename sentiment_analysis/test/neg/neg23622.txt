Did anyone have issues with their dog getting into out of character fights with other dogs after using this? Wondering if it's contaminated or not really organic..... I stopped use immediately, but the fights didn't start until after the use of this product and another organic joint mushroom product both bought here on Amazon. I have three dogs and only one dog using this. The other two dogs are normal no fights. Not sure if this is good for my dog since she is acting out of character aggressive about two weeks after I started the joint supplements and no other changes to her life that could cause this behavior
