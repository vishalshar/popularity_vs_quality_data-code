We ordered the pumpkin treat together with the blueberry flavor, the pumpkin delivered to us crushed up and flaky while the other bag was in perfect condition. After calling for a replacement, the new bag was delivered in a very short time, however, it was also crumbled up. We assumed that shipping has nothing to do with the grated cookies, but we wondered why other flavors we ordered (blueberry and kale) were just fine. Our puppy loves all the flavors, but I'd rather not order the pumpkin again.
