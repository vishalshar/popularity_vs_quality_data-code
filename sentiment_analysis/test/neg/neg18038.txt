Works great!  Very simple to set up.  No buttons to push, it simply remembers where you are when you walk away from the car.  It will actually give you turn by turn directions back to your car.  I haven't tried it in a multi-story parking garage, but I suspect you will me to remember what floor you parked on.  I ordered another one for my other car.  I highly recommend.Update:  I have one in two different cars.  They both quit working after 2 months.  Don't waste your money.
