This is the worst purchase I have made in a long, long time.1.  Doesn't do ANYTHING 75% of the time.  I step on and I either get absolutely nothing, a dot and then nothing, a smiley face and then nothing, or a wobbly man and then nothing.2. Provides wildly erratic weight readings.  My weight is somewhere near 150, but sometimes this scale tells me I weigh 1.4 pounds, sometimes it tells me I weigh 78.1 pounds, sometimes it tells me that I weigh 150.6 and 30 seconds later, 149.7 and 30 seconds later, 150.1, then 152.3.3.  EIGHT batteries!  Supposedly the eight batteries were to last about a year but in less than six months, I have had to change the batteries twice.4.  I have never gotten the app to work as promised. Buggy.5.  Tippy.On the positive side...it looks great.
