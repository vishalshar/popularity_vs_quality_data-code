I'm very disappointed today after receiving my new iPhone 6s case from Rokform.  I had previously purchased a Rokform case for my iPhone 4s, which I reviewed here:  https://www.amazon.com/review/R1WLP3K8U42UDF/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permWhen I decided to upgrade my phone, I immediately sought out the Rokform case to fit it.  You see, when I bought the older case for the 4s, I was very impressed and used it in every vehicle I own, including my motorcycle.  It never let me down, and was always an interesting topic of discussion when someone noticed my case.  The 4s case was effective and reliable.  Only this year, the case finally broke in the area of the round mounting system on the back side.  It was worth every penny I paid for it, and that wasn't very much.This new case?  Ha!  It doesn't protect the front in the same way the old case did.  The mounting system is not part of the hard case any more, rather, it is an insert which can be swapped for an insert with no mounting system hole.  I do not expect it to hold up long term.  I suppose the tether will be used on this case, or else I might end up losing the phone when the mounting insert plate eventually falls out.  Bad design idea.But do you want to know the worst part?  The original iPhone 4s Rokform case I bought was purchased primarily because Rokform flaunted how their products were made in the USA.  This new case?  Made in China.  If I had known that prior to buying this new case, I would have just searched out a new company.  Maybe they're all made in China, wouldn't surprise me.  But, Rokform used to take pride in that aspect, so much so that it was imprinted on the back of the case.I'm going to keep this case because it is my fault for buying it, but I don't expect to use it long.  I'm already starting to search out a new one, maybe a Lifeproof or something.  I'm very disappointed because the very unique mounting system employed by Rokform is excellent.
