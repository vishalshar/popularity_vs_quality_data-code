Horrible product.First, Came looking cheap and wouldn't even stick with the tape provided. I had to reinforce it with a plastic welder and use better double sided tape.Second, Not all cars have a spot to mount this. I have a 45 degree spot on my car and it leaves the phone flat like if on a table. Otherwise I have nowhere this would function since it doesn't work on a straight up and down area. (Which would be the most ideal)Only way it will work is if you have a spot on your car that sits with a 30 to 35 degree angle. This should be made clear before a purchase.There seems to be holes where an adapter can be added to the mount to compensate for any angle issues, but nothing was provided and much less were instructions provided for such an issue.
