This battery case is a perfect example of how little inconveniences add up to an unpleasant experience. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the thinness of the case and how you charge with lightning instead of micro-USB, but in my mind, the pros don't outweigh the cons. From my experience, I have laid out the pros and cons of this case that will hopefully influence your decision before buying.Cons:1) --MOST IMPORTANT-- The main reason I returned this case is because the audio jack cutout is too small. If you are a person who uses headphones frequently, DO NOT buy this case because literally you can't (or just barely depending on the headphones) fit the audio cord in the phone. I found myself having to use high amounts of force to get my Bose headphones in halfway, and my Beats (with the right angle cord) will not fit in whatsoever. In order to use the headphone jack, you would have to take off the case, which nullifies the purpose of the case: to protect your phone at all times.2) Only around 300 full charges then the battery starts to decline to 80%, around 500 charges the battery declines to 75% of the initial capacity, and only keeps declining. Information taken from the ThinCharge manual provided in the box.3) Charges too slow4) Inconvenient cover slip on the top of the phone5) Uses the volume up button to turn charging on and off. On paper, it sounds exciting, but in reality, it's just a nuisance having to turn the volume up all the way and down all the way.Pros:1) Thinness2) Charges with lighting so you don't need extra micro-USB cables around3) Feel4) Relatively large amount of juiceIn conclusion, I will support ThinCharge in the future as I think this company has a lot of potential, as producing a battery case that thin isn't an easy task. But, I don't support ThinCharge releasing a prototype, a half-thought-out product. Because most of the cons are small, fixing them will be easy, therefore putting the ThinCharge 2 case at the top of the charts.ThinCharge, hopefully you read this and really take in to account how big these problems are so you can fix them right away.Thanks
