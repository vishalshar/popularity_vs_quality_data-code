I'm now three days into wearing my Spire, and I must confess that I'm not impressed. My greatest criticism is that I see no evidence that the product actually offers a reflection of the user's state of mind. I've spent every day between streaks of calm and focus with no alerts or other assistance for achieving those states. If I was calm and focused all day, I wouldn't have bought the product in the first place.Pretending for a moment that the product could track state-of-mind as advertised, it only works when the user is sedentary. When in motion (walking, etc.), the product monitors activity (steps) instead of state-of-mind. For people like me who walk while on phone calls, travel a lot, and try not to be sedentary, I'm not sure I see a real benefit.If you're trying to train for focus and calmness, my favorite technology remains the emWave by HeartMath (a biofeedback device that trains to optimize heart rate variability - which is largely correlated to breathing).
