This product secures onto the drone very well, but interferes with the propellers during flight. The propeller guard sits too high which results in it rubbing against the propellers during flight.Due to this rubbing the propeller, it resulted it one of the propellers being damaged and needing to be replaced.The use of this item has resulted in approximately $20 worth of damage to my drone, that would have been worse with continued use of these defective guards.
