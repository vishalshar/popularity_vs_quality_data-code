I bought two of these. One is going back because it refuses to show up as a wireless network during setup. I'm comfortable with technology and did make every attempt to get the bulb to work, including following all of the suggestions on the LIFX site, doing research on the web, and trying the bulb with two different ipads and two different iphones. Nothing. It would light up and appear to be ready, and a hardware reset produced the expected behavior, but the bulb never broadcasted an SSID. Without that happening, you can go no further.The bulb that DID work may end up going back eventually also, mainly because the setup is a pain, and the integration with Echo is not fully baked. I have the Phillips HUE system and it outclasses these in every way except one: Color production. These lights are capable of producing great colors, Truthfully, hue can only produce about 20. lol that's exaggeration for comedic effect, but if you have hue you know what I mean. No matter whether you choose hue or LIFX, if you're wanting to use them with Echo you need to get ready for some frustration. While getting Alexa to turn the lights on and off is fairly easily done, changing colors and scenes or dimming the lights are tasks that need to be a lot less cumbersome.
