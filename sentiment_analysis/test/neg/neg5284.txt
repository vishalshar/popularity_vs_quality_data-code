Prints ok, high quality, and very fast, I just can't stand cleaning out the printhead every five minutes because it jams like crazy. Comes with 24 seven customer support all that you say it is to get a guitar string and stick it in the hot end to clean it out I'm not wasting anymore money on this printer than I paid for it from their first day. Got it as an early Christmas present and it may just be the best thing but it's also the worse thing I may have ever gotten. The things I did print turned out good(overhangs suck on this printer)just can't stand taking the extruded apart every 5minutes this is the second time in 1 weekend of printing. And it also takes 10 minutes to load filament because you have to take 2 screws off the back off the printer every time and risk that the hobbed bolt doesn't just grind $20 worth of filament getting it in.
