Quite disappointed. I bought it primarily for charging up my phone when on hikes or backpacking trips where I might not find a power source easily, The light functions works great, but to my horror, even with a full charge via usb, it can only charge up about 25-35% for my phone. Did I get a faulty unit?Solar charging is slow as well despite direct sunlight.
