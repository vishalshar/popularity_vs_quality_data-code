I'm not sure what gravitational pull this is referring to, but certainly not on Earth.  The first time I used this case, I stuck the phone to a flat vertical surface.....where it stayed for about 5 minutes before falling and cracking the screen.  Since then, it doesn't stick to anything.  It rubs against things and will resist (not prevent) sliding across the dashboard of my car, but that's the sole benefit.  NOT worth the cost.
