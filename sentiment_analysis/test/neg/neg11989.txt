I was quite excited to hear about this product, as there is currently nothing out there that offers this level of energy management granularity for such a reasonable price.Unfortunately, while the User Interface is intuitive, and may provide sufficient information for the casual user, I  believe the current software release misses the mark for the type of user that this product is intended to attract.  It's woefully lacking in reporting and data export capability, and doesn't offer any ability to access historical data in the iPhone / Android app.  So if you're looking for a way to track long term utilization or solar production, look elsewhere for the moment.  It also has a few bugs related to renaming your clamps, causing phantom data to appear in your graphs which cannot be removed at this time (according to support).This is a newly released product, and no doubt the manufacturer will make firmware and application updates with time, so I may revise my review later..10-2-16 Update:  Not much has changed in the product since the original review. They did add the ability to download 7 days of data via a .CSV file.  Now that I'm bringing some solar generation online, I'm noticing that the product has a bug that incorrectly counts a quiescent load on your production circuit as produced power.  This is a problem because night-time inverter losses will show up as production and affect the cumulative results of your data.  I tried opening a trouble ticket explaining their software bug, and, as usual, their response is 'take a picture of your panel', despite my attempts to explain that it's a software bug. My day job the power control systems for a data center: believe me when I'm pretty sure I know what I'm talking about.
