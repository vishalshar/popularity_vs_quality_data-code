I was excited to get this watch, even though I have several other smart watches, primarily because of the ability to use it with Alexa. It is a huge disappointment. There are major software issues with this watch. It definitely is not ready for production. After resetting it many times, I finally got it to connect with my iPhone 6s but that is where the success ended. If I reboot, I can get Alexa to work maybe 2 times. After that every question just goes to processing and never returns a result. Battery is horrible. Even with the screen always off, I am lucky to get 8 hours, with it always on, maybe 4 hours. It constantly request to tether even though it shows connected to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  It loses Wi-Fi easily. Will send it back as it is mostly useless. The Apple Watch for nearly the same money works flawlessly.
