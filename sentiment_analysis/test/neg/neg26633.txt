Product works as stated but... BUYER BEWARE of battery selection. The Amazon page I ordered these from had a "Frequently Bought Together" section that showed multi packs of 1616 batteries purchased at the same time. These do NOT fit the TrackR, the TrackR requires a 1620 battery. The 1616 is thinner than the 1620 and did not work for me. In multiple places I found sellers of the 1616 stating they could be used interchangeably with the 1620 and this is not true for this product.EDIT: Another product I spoke too soon about. After about the second day or so two of the four Bravo's I purchased kept reporting the batteries were very low. I ordered some new ones (1620s) and when they came in and were installed the Bravo reported the same thing. I put the batteries from the two Bravos that did work in the questionable two and still received a low status report for the batteries. I contacted customer support for TrackR and after several "back and forth" emails they determined they would send me out two new batteries, even after I told them I had tried new batteries and two existing batteries known to be good. I did, on my own, a bluetooth "forget" on my iphone and a "delete" of the TrackeR from the app and then re-paired the device with the phone and finally got a good battery signal. BUT... that only lasted around a half a hour or so and I was right back to a low battery signal. I have sent them back and will be trying a different product.
