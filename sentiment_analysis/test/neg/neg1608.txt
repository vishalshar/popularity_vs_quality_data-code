Purchased for Honda CTX 700. Had to take off back half of bike to get it wired. A helper followed me around and said that it wasn't working as it should. I emailed the company and got a generic and not helpful answer. I don't know if this thing works like it's supposed to or not. It doesn't seem to provide any extra brake light. From a CTX forum, it seems like another user had a problem with this on his bike. Maybe it works better on other bikes. I got it because it said it was so easy to install, but not on my bike.
