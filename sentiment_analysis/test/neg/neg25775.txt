I just purchased The Dash. The first time I've tried to charge it (as it says Activate and charge before first use), I followed the "Activate and charge" procedure in your webpage, stating the following:"To activate The Dash simply place The Dash into The Charger and make sure it sits correctly on the MagSnap.Connect The Charger to a computer or a power source via USB.The LightGuide will pulse with a blue light and The Dash is now activated and will start charging..." My Dash's LightGuide DOES NOT turn blue or any color. I've made sure that The Dash is correctly seated on the MagSnap several times. I'm really disappointed that I've spent that amount of money, waited that much time and can't use my product!
