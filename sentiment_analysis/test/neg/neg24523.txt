I'm in the process of requesting a 2nd (and last) replacement. This is supposed to be a high-end toy (at least based on the asking price) that feels like a cheap Chinese-made knockoff. I own a different model 2013 year version that seems to have solid manufacturing behind a cool concept. This one is one flaw after another.  If you care for details, the list includes: sloppy connecting pieces that just break apart, wheels that spin differently so it cannot "drive" straight, cosmetic faults that make it seem like a used item right out of the box.
