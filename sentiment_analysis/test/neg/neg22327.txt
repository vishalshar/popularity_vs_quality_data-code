This does not provide an air quality report as is advertised by the company. I contacted support in August and was told they were working on it. Since then this feature is still not available on the app. That's the main reason we purchased this model over the other less expensive ones.UPDATE 11/11/16In September, customer service told me they were continuing to work on this issue, but suggested I look into purchasing their product the Air Sense. Why would I buy another device from this company when I purchased the M6S monitor because it was advertised as being capable of providing air quality reports? Then, this month (November), I received an email from iBaby indicating that because there was no recent activity on the customer service ticket they were closing it. I responded to the email telling them my issue had still not been resolved and have yet to receive a response. In addition, I am no longer able to log into the iBaby app to use the monitor. When I called customer support they told me to reset my password. I tried this and it says my email address is not recognized. I also told the customer service rep about the unresolved issue of the air quality reports. He indicated that this was not an available feature of the M6S to which I inquired why it was advertised as being such on their website and he tried to dispute that it was. I've attached two pictures from their website on 11/10/16 advertising the air quality monitoring. The app and the customer service are awful. The unreliability of this monitor is very unsafe!
