I feel like I had to write this review because this product is quite expensive and I'm frankly surprised how much the other reviewers liked the product.  First off, this is basically just a regular duvet cover with a flat sheet semi-attached to it on the bottom.  My favorite part about the product is the fact that the duvet cover is VERY soft and cozy.  However, the way that the flat sheet attaches on is terrible.  It's fixed on with zippers on the side that are pretty rough.  More importantly though, it's attached with rectangular pieces of Velcro on the underside right where your chest would be if covering up.  The corners of the Velcro really hurt and have woken me up several times in the middle of the night.  Additionally, the whole sheet thing sounds like a good idea, but it gets all bunched up and I honestly can't wait to get rid of the thing.  I also feel like the top of the duvet still gets dirty, so I don't think that this really cuts down on how much you have to wash it.  Lastly, one of the ties in the inside of the cover was missing- it didn't really affect the performance, but it was just kind of disappointing given how much the product was.  I feel like the company should have better oversight of the product.
