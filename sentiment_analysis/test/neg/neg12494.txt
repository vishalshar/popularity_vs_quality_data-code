I met the founders of this product when they were dong a demo in Austin, TX.  The product that I tasted and bought there was terrific!  The product that I just ordered was good tasting, but the texture was completely different.  The label was different and I thought perhaps they were just making an update to packaging.  Not so.  The jars of sunflower butter that I received were more like sunflower sauce.  I would characterize the consistency of the product as runny after I stirred it.  I am, in fact, disappointed since the previous sunflower butter spread better and held its shape better.  This just runs everywhere.Wild Friends, please go back to the former formulation.
