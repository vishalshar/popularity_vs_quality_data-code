This has limited range. It works ok but has some calibration problems from time to time. Performance wise, it is fun to mess with and will help a homeowner looking for leaky or drafty doors and windows or spotting a pet or other animal in the yard--won't do much more than that.I am editing this review and removing a star. After all the time I have owned this, I started the app because my home alarm went off--I use the app to scan for any hotspots that might reveal an intruder. All of a sudden, the app would not allow me to access the camera without registering. Given the circumstances, I thought that unacceptable.  The app says you have to register for ITAR compliance but this is barely better than a toy so to me it just reeks of stupid marketing.I would not recommend. If you have to register then get something that does more than this.
