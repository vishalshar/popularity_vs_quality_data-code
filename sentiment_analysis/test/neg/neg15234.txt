I really liked the design and wanted to support NEXTBIT, however on a 3 hour drive that I make often, the Robin (T-MOBILE service), lost all data frequently, plus GPS was lost and data was terrible. I don't know if it's the internal antenna, or radio chip but on the same trip my S7 Edge performed 10X better. Several times while in town the phone went from 4 bars of 4G to total loss of cellular service. Also the finger print/power button just didn't work very well compared to my S7.  I sent it back to Amazon for a full refund. I really wanted to like this phone but it needs some more work.
