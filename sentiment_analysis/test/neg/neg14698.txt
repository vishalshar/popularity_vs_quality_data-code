Don't buy this game, BUY one of the others like it instead! Whomever wrote up the CARDS did not speak ENGLISH!! Cards like: "The Death of Ghost" , "The Wreak of Hopes", "A Noble Gangster", "Mind Your Head", "Bizarre Chilli", "Running on My Parade", "Returner to Our Hotel", "The Toiler of Bursting" and best of all "Have A Sreaw Loose" (not a typo on my part), I think they were going for "Screw"!Shipped from China CRUSHED box!We will be writing our own cards! These are horrible!
