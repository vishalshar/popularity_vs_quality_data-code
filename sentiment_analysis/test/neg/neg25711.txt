This my first item that I have returned to Amazon (which was an exceptionaly easy task, I was impressed with Amazon's return proceedures). I spent 3 days trying to get it to work. The online manual was not in PDF so It was no help.  The time would start at the time I set but would go off at a time that had nothing to do with the setting I had set. I cleared it several time and started from scratch with no success. If I unpluged it (simulating the electricity going off) it would not reconnect to the internet which would mean it would be useless and could not be used while vacation. I have since purchased a digital timer that does not connect to the Internet and the new one is working fine.
