It's comfortable, looks and acts like a watch but It is not accurate. A couple days after I purchased it and took my dog to the park we walk around with according to my phone (which has recorded this walk many times) it is 4.76 miles. The Misfit only recorded 2.4 of it. That is half of my activity that is it is not keeping track of. I even made sure that I didn't hold the leash with the hand that has the Misfit on it.Another one of the positive things about this item is that it does track your sleep very well, it's just the daytime activity that is not recording properly.Very disappointed.
