We got the unit and then called to activate. It took a long time to get someone on the phone, and when we did we found out that there was an activation fee that is not stated in the instrucions. And because my mother does not have Internet the fee would be 10.00 more. We were not even asked the unit number or able to give our info because we did not have this fee. This felt like she was being penalized for not being online, and we will probably return the unit.
