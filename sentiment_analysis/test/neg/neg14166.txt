So, I bought this case and it functioned perfectly for about a week then the case kept falling off of things and worst of all, it seemed to make my phone fall face down. One day, I had it stuck to a cabinet beside my bed when BAM the sticky coating lost its grip, my phone fell face down, and cracked. Now, I'm out 106 bucks for a screen replacement. It seems to stick better to things like mirrors and tile. I'd say skip it unless you've got applecare.A novelty not worth 40 dollars and the risk of cracking your phone.
