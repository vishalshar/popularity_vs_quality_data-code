I chose this bulb over the philips hue bulb for a couple of reasons. The lighting is more vibrant and I wouldn't need a hub to control it with Alexa (Amazon Echo). After a long setup process, I finally get it to work and it's awesome cause I can finally control my lights through voice. Unfortunately, the bulb disconnects way too often and I have to constantly turn the switch on and off, otherwise my lifx app or echo can't recognize there's a light bulb currently connected.I reached out to support, they responded after my third request, someone finally contacted me back and gave me instructions that I had already tried. Then after replying, I have still yet to get a response. Don't know if it's because they're so busy with all the other faulty bulbs they sold or if they just have a bad support staff. Either way, kinda tired of waiting so decided on returning the bulb and going with philips hue.
