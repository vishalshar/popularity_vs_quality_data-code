UPDATED REVIEW NOVEMBER 8th: This is a bad product and a pain to use, here are the highlights:1. It just died on me today for no reason, sound was robotic the last time I used it (thought it was what I was playing but no, I re listened the same file with another headphones and it was OK), it discharged so I recharged, completed normally (meaning LED was red and then turned itself off after around 90 minutes which is what they take to charge from 0 to 100%), but when I wanted to use it again it refuses to do anything, just blinks red and blue quickly. Doesn't reconnect, doesn't allow to pair again, nothing. I hear the voice prompt but it is definitely different, just says "power on battery high" without the distinctive ring they make afterwards and stays like that, doesn't even say "power off" when I power them off. Nothing.2. After a while you realize the voice prompt that announces battery level is SUPER ANNOYING, it triggers itself very frequently (I think every 15%) and it is super loud.3. The Bluetooth radio doesn't seem to be high quality because it has serious issues reconnecting after the initial pairing process, rarely happens automatically as it should be. On my iPhone and my Windows 10 laptop 90% of the times I had to go to settings and manually force it to connect, and to make things worse, that procedure had to be repeated 2 or 3 times every time. It's like btunes forgets that is paired already so it ignores the connection request.So moral of the story: let go of your old headphones and just save money to buy some proper NEW Bluetooth ones.You don't deserve to deal with this headache. You don't deserve to waste your money on something that maybe will only last 6 months (my case)--------4 starts because they don't offer more colors
