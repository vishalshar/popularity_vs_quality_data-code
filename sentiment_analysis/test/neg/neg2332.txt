I'm very disappointed because I could only use it until the battery died. Allow me to elaborate;PROSIt worked great. Good response time from "click" to "photo taken" on my iphone. Fairly seamless pairing. The little nylon drawstring bag for safe-keeping was quite handy. So why 3 stars?CONSOnce the battery died, I cautiously opened the outer casing and very meticulously removed the lower screw holding down the metal lever to remove the battery & determine what type of replacement I needed. I went to the store to buy the replacement & once inserted I checked for contact by powering it up, and nothing. I made sure everything was assembled properly, lined up, battery not upside-down, etc. and still; nothing. Removed the new battery. Re-inserted it. completely re-assembled the device & again, nothing. I'm pretty sure it wasn't user error. It wasn't exposed to moisture, bumped, etc in the process. I triple checked that I had the correct battery and that it was inserted properly and she's dead as a dodo.
