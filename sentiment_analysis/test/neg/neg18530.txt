While a novel concept, the implementation of this wireless lightbulb has some problems.  I bought the A21 light as a splurge while on sale.  I followed the instructions and downloaded the control app to my iphone.  The bulb has some problems.  It would ghost in and out of the app ... it's there, now it's gone, now it's back.  But it did work.  The phone app kept telling me there was a firmware update.  Thinking this was part of the problem, I updated it.  That was the end of that bulb.  The phone app said the update went without a hitch, however it was just an expensive LED light now at this point -- it wouldn't reset, it wouldn't see the network.  Nothing.  I tried to work with LIFX to reset it and got pointed to the generic "flip the switch and reset it" procedure.  I told them I tried that and was there something else to do?  After a week of waiting around, I shipped it back.  As a follow up, I did get an email from Lifx after I had shipped the bulb back saying that it sounds like I got a bad bulb and they'd send me an RMA for it.  By that point, I had already shipped the bulb back to Amazon and gotten a refund.  So out of the bulbs I purchased: 1 went back after the firmware upgrade, 1 was a gift to a friend who likes gizmos (but I warned him about upgrading it), and 1 I have operating without the firmware patch because I'm afraid it will brick that device.
