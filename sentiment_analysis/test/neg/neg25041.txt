I got mine today but it doesnt fit to my iphone 6 or Iphone 6s....the boxed shows for iphone 6 or iphone 6s but the printer kinda small for iphone 6 or 6s...the item i think got switch for samsung 5s....but do i need to buy a new cellphone again just for this printer to fit in...i hope amazon will check the printer first before they send it ...
