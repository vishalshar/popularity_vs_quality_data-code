This is not a bad product let me be clear there.  Its great for people who want to cover wifi in their house with little to no features, real basic use, which probably is a good portion of people who use wifi in their homes.However I feel this is not ready for primetime for the intermediate/advanced users.Here some of my issues that stopped by cold in using this after I got it1. Cannot change the LAN ip range/scheme.  I want all my client devices to have 192.168.0.xxx scheme, I have a lot of specific static IP addresses.  Luma sets your client LAN pool to 192.168.55.xxx, you cannot change this.  They did just introduce static dhcp assignments.  Which is good, but again, that means id have to convert everything over to 192.168.55.xxx and didn't want to do it at the moment.2.  No static route capability.  Almost every consumer level router/gateway/wifi device you buy these days has a static route feature.  Most do not use it.  I however do, since I have a wireless point to point link between two locations.  And use that static route to let my LAN devices know how to get to the other building (which has 192.168.2.xxx scheme).  That's why point1 above matters due to the IP scheme.3.  Everything has to be done via the Luma app.  Now again basic users this is great, simple setup.  Advanced users, its much easier at times to work on a webUI using a laptop/desktop, vs a smartphone or even tablet device.They are adding features, but with no time table for certain pieces, I couldn't wait for them anymore.  I had no choice but to return it and either wait till its ready for more advanced level users or until another competitor comes out with something similar with similar price point.  eero is there but obviously costs a good bit more.I also wish with such a small device they would've had the option of having the device powered by PoE.  Again another advanced feature, but would've been cool, Ive started converting to more of this mainly to get rid of the wall adapters, also centralize power in a way and also let it sit on a battery backup so network/wifi stays up the entire time even on power loss.  On a large house, if you have 4-5APs, then its hard to do that with battery backup everywhere without buying a UPS for all the devices and middle devices like maybe a 4 or 8port switch.
