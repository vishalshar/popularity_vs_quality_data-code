Don't spend your money on this battery back. It's poorly designed. The top piece comes off waaaay to easily.  It just falls off with the slightest brush of your hand or when taking it out of your pocket.  Had this less than a week & I lost the top piece because it just does no't stay secure to the rest of the battery pack. I'm going to return this piece of junk.
