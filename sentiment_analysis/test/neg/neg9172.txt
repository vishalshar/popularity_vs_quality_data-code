Christmas gift for a very excited 10 year old boy who thought this would be the coolest thing ever.Worked fine for a month or so but now every time it is plugged into our Mac it crashes the game :( .  Minecraft functions fine without it.Tech support is ok, they gave us lots of things to try to get it to work, it just became more hassle than it was worth.Cool idea though, wish it worked for us.
