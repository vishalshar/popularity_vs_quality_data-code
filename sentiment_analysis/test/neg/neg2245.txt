I was so excited about getting this.  It is so pretty and I love how it looks as a bracelet.  I also love the silent alarm feature.  That being said, those are the only things I like about it.  It does not start to track your steps until you have been active for 5 straight minutes.  That may not sound like much but I work from home and it doesn't take me 5 minutes to walk from my bedroom to my office so the leaf didn't start tracking any steps for me until the afternoon when I worked out.  That defeated the purpose of why I got this as I wanted to keep track of my steps throughout the entire day.
