I have loved these cases for years but the one I just ordered and received is different....feels much cheaper and flimsy. The one I ordered as a gift for my friend I just saw on her phone today. I picked it up to check it out and was embarrassed because the shell is so cheap and "clicks" every time you open it. I need to replace it with something else.
