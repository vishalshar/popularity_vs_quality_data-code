I wish it worked as promised.  1 everyone on your list must have the app or they get a text from another area code stating someone needs help.  2 they must use the app to call you if you want the buzz to come through.  My children just want to call me not use an app to get my attention in a meeting.  3. Everytime I got into my car it would turn off and you would manually have to turn it back on.  It was way to much work.
