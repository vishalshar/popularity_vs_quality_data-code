I have owned a Thync module for about 4 months. I can't say for sure it's doing anything, but it might and I think it's obvious this product is somewhat experimental.Yet the reason I'm giving it one star is the app barely works, firmware updates fail even when they report they succeeded, and the customer service is one of the worst I have encountered in a company. All around a bad experience.
