There's also a weak spot that a friend of mine noticed near the base of the cup, tap lightly just above the base (where the contraption sits) and it easily tips over.I was in dumb amazement and played with it  almost as much as my cell phone when it first arrived. I didn't mess with it much after the first day, but only when I took it to work to show off.But after the first few weeks, like I said, it became inconsistent.
