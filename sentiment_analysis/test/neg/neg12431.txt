I've purchase a EYN case for my iphone 5s a couple of years ago and love it. I had grate quality and fit my phone well. This once wasn't the case. The plastic seem a lot thinner, didn't have a lot of colors to choose from and it took me the longest to fit my iphone 6sPlus.  I don't thing I'll try another EYN phone case again.
