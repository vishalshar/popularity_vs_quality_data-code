I attempted to use this device for pain. Unfortunately, I was not successful in trying to decrease the strength of the electrical output, from the battery. As a result, I felt continuous shocks and tingling, from the area of my leg, where the device was attached. I was forced to remove that device from my leg, after a brief period. Even when a considerable period had elapsed, after removing the device, I could still feel tingling in the area, where the device was attached. Also, I felt increased pain in my thigh. The latter pain was not present, prior to installing the Quell device. Whereas this device may work for most people, it is with deep regret, that I must report, it didn't work for me.
