I like that the product give you temperature information, light, noise, and humidity information in regard to your sleep, however, I find that information generally obvious in general and a great compliment to what this product is supposed to do, however alone, not worth it.I purchased this device to mainly monitor my sleep/naps, tell me my sleep cycles and wake me up more naturally. It did not deliver.  I have a fitbit to also monitor my sleep.  I hoped this device would fill the holes from the fitbit (no sleep cycle or gentle wakeup).The first sticking point to me was that it does not recognize naps or day sleep whatsoever.  After it not recording my naps for 2 days I had to dig into the FAQs to find out that it did not support that.  I take naps quite frequently and was greatly disappointed.For my first 2 nights using the app, the data was blatantly wrong.  The app had me waking up exactly at 5am when I clearly slept in till 10:30am. It did however have the correct start time. I ended up returning it because not only does it not track naps altogether, the information regarding actual sleep was incorrect. Without that, all you have is a fancy device to measure temperature, humidity, sound, and light.  For much cheaper you could just purchase a thermometer with a humidity function.I followed the directions as specified, putting the pill on the edge of my pillow.  It remained there all night.Hopefully they improve the app/product, however, until then this product does not deliver.
