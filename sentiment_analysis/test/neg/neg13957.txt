I had high hopes that these cable keepers would help me organize the myriad of cables that I have for work and travel.  Sadly, this is not the case.  While the magnets are strong, the plastic is too flexible, especially around the slotted cutout, and they don't hold my coiled headset or lightning power cables in place the way that I want.  I have retired these three $11.00 keepers to a junk drawer.
