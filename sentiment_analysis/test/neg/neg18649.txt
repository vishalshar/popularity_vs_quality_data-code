My friend got one of these a long time ago, so I decided to get one that is the opposite color. When I first got it, it seemed fully functional, the only problem was, it move faster in reverse than forward, which was a it weird. After about two uses, this thing would lose power at the max of a minute after you turn it on. I thought the batteries died the first time. Replace them, did it fix the problem? No, it even seemed to make it last for shorter periods of time.
