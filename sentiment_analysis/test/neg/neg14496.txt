Bought it for the good reviews. It is made of cheap plastic, didn't even hold 1 charge of my iphone 7 (normal iphone size, not the plus). Took 3hrs to charge it from 10% to 90% (in the meantime i answered some whatsapp but that was all of my use during charging period). The cable, seems cheap and that it will crack in any minute. I returned it, it didnt worth the 28$
