I've had problems with this printer from the day I got it, I should have returned it instead of thinking it just needed tweaking. Have talked to the people at Robo3D and they say it should be working yet it continually break and need fixed. First it would keep shutting off mid print, then the hot end wasn't working. Then even though I went through with the people at Robo3D my prints are coming out shaky and off. I've used and have experience with multiple 3D printers so I'm not new to this. This is the worst printer I've used yet.
