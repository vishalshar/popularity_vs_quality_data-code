This product does not operate! The reviews at Amazon do not reflect the user experience accurately & the only way to get to the authentic reviews is when you go to download the app for your phone. Unfortunately, most consumers will only look at the Amazon reviews before purchasing the product  & they do not tell the real story.Since this is an Amazon Kickstarter product the reviews seem filtered and important product malfunctions are not reflected in the posted reviews.What is missing:There is no mention of the many complaints about the petcube crashing wifi systems or the fact that you can only stay connected to the camera for a few minutes before the entire app freezes & you cannot connect at all.There is also no way to reach petcube directly aside from email because, as I was told by the head of their customer service department, they "do not have a phone line yet."Aside from this, I originally bought the camera for use on my Android & it wasn't until I received the camera & went to download the phone app that I found out it wasn't ready yet. Curiously, the was no mention of this in the Amazon reviews or the product description...In fact, the reviews only began mentioning this issue within the last few weeks & only in 1 review, however, if you travel outside of the Amazon site for product reviews you will find all of these issues reported on & the product itself hardly averages one or two stars.I  keep asking Petcube to send me a prepaid shipping label for the misrepresentation of their product & it's functionality & instead they have offered to update my camera remotely...unfortunately it needs to be plugged in for that to happen & when I plug it in the device crashes my entire wifi, so that even my cell phone won't work. Very disappointing & something seems off about the whole thing, from both the Petcube side, as well as, the Amazon side too.
