This is just bad all around.  I can pair them easily with my iphone.  If I press on the Trakr devices button the phone chimes (so in case you lose your phone you can find it) but i cannot get the small trackr device to chime when i ask my phone to find it. I can't do it with my phone or my wife's phone (iphone 6s IOS 10.2) The phone tells me the Trackr is nearby and that they're connected.  My cousin has one that he's put on his dog.  I asked him how he gets it to chime and he said "oh they don't make any sound". I sent the company 2 emails and got no response.
