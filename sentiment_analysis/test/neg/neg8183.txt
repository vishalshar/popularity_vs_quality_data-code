Complete piece of junk. Tried and tried and tried to connect to the Wi-Fi but it never worked. Said the PIN number was wrong even though serial numbers on card and product said it was right. Complete waste of time. Ordered a second unit which arrives today. I'll update this review if the second unit works - or doesn't work.UPDATE:Just recieved the second DCH-S150 Motion Sensor. Sadly it does NOT work either, however it did get further along into the setup routine than the first one did. It takes around 20 minutes for the entire setup process to run its course and then it asks you to give the sensor a name. When you go to save your device name - that's when it gives you a "Save Failed" error message, and the entire setup process needs to be restarted from scratch.I tried twice and both times it gave the same error. The second time I did not change the default name, but it still said "Save Failed".  I was going to buy a D-Link router and security cameras (we sell them where I work) but I will no longer buy - anything - from this company, and I will tell my customers who ask about D-Link just how poorly they are designed / made. No quality control what-so-ever. This second unit will be going back too. Sad, because the concept for this product is such a good idea.UPDATE #2After I saw an update to the app posted a few days ago I decided to give it another try. The new app does work much better, and the process doesn't take as long to complete, BUT you still get the dreaded "Save Failed" error in the end. The manufacture left a so-called help link for me to contact them, but it isn't a working link. Seems nothing from this manufacture works. Will be returning this third unit today for a refund.SIDE NOTE:Looks like D-Link is going to be coming out with a new motion sensor. Type "D-Link DCH-Z120" into a search engine for more information.
