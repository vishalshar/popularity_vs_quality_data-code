Charger would not work as advertised and would not charge my galaxy s6.  I contacted the seller and at 1st they were very easy to deal with, but when I asked to return the charger for a refund I got no response. Been several weeks now and I've attempted contact 2 more times an am still getting no response.  Now I own an $80 piece of junk...
