I started out and followed  the directions to the letter . Took longer than expected, got about 5 mushrooms. They got bigger, CRACKED and dried out. Turned it over, then did the other side. Same thing. threw it in  the trash.Fun to watch, but didn't get what we thought. Did not contact company, really don't have time for that.
