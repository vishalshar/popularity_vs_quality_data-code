Love the straw and cup! I've ordered more straws. But the lid broke the second time I stretched it over the cup. It also doesn't have a tight seal around the state. The lid tore a big hole in it - super easily, too. I prefer these, but since it broke I'll stick with the Boon lids and use these straws!
