Very disappointed with the product. It refused to cover/stick to my lower lashes, and didn't do that great a job on uppers, either. Minimal lasting power but lashes did stay soft. I didn't bother trying to get mascara on top of it ... was hoping alone it would be enough for a decent darkening effect on super-casual days, but insuffient and had strange consistency. Another brand some years ago (either M@y******* or R-v***) was MUCH better going on and staying on though if not removed promptly and gently, it made lashes brittle and they broke off --- probably why it's no longer available. But I have very, very thin lashes, and a lightweight/thin formula works best for me. Back to adding distilled water to new tubes of regular mascara.
