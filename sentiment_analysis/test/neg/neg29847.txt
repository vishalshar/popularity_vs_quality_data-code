Lets start with the packaging which is from HELL. I really have never seen a product packaged quite like this with an impossible to open box and 87 rolls of packing tape and screws and ties holding the dino in - insane. This is our 2nd raptor blue - the first one only had 1 leg that worked. We just got the 2nd one (exchange was a breeze, thank you) and both legs work but we can't seem to find a surface that the dino works well on - he does not walk on extremely low pile carpet or shag (that one is understandable). He does walk on hardwood but slips a lot. He's EXTREMELY loud when he roars and there is no way to control it. The remote is nearly useless but the iPad app seems to work pretty well.
