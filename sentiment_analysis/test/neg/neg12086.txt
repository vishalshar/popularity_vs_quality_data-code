I bought this mount because it looked sturdy and I had gone through some other mounts that broke on me. While it is relatively sturdy, my phone has fallen off a few times. While that is definitely a problem, the bigger problem is that it rattles a TON. I'm using it on my road bike so it's not like there is a lot of rough terrain. Any time I'm on a road that's even a little bumpy, the phone and mount rattle very loudly. I wish there was a fix for this or a better solution than this mount.
