I had high expectations from this product.  We have a Smart TV, a DVD, a Cable Box, and a Computer all connected through an AV Receiver.  With all of these connections and remote controls, my wife finds it difficult to switch between modes.  Combining AnyMote's macro capability with the Amazon Echo interface sounded like the ultimate solution.The model numbers for most of my devices were listed in the AnyMote library, but when I downloaded them they were remotes for different models from the same manufacturer.  The website recommended finding something close, and then customizing.  I was disappointed, but the process to customize the remotes seemed reasonable.  Before I committed to the time required to do that, I decided to test the AnyMote/Echo interface.  The Echo seemed to have no trouble understanding the voice commands, but turning on the TV worked only about 60% of the time.  But the real deal breaker was that even when using the Echo voice interface, AnyMote needs to be connected to your cell phone to work.Lot's of promise with this product, but way too far from functional to be sold on Amazon.  Boxing it up to return now.
