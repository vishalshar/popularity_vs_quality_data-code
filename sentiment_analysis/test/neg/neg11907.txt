It definitely fills a need that we couldn't find other products to do. However, the positives end there.This product is cheaply made. The surface was not totally level, and the knobs for the sliders all came with the paint already chipped off, and the lime green underneath showing through. The "brushed" finish is so obviously fake when on a fridge with the real finish, that the product does look quite cheap. It's also much bulkier than it appears in the photo.While they work, the sliders do not move smoothly, and if you repeatedly slide them while it is attached to a vertical surface with the single tiny square of magnet or adhesive that they provide, it will be constantly falling off. We had to purchase different magnets to affix to the back ourselves.The only reason to purchase this product over another comparable one, is that there aren't really comparable products at this time. Though it is convenient to have the whole week, we have ordered a reversible magnet that can be used daily that is much more attractive.
