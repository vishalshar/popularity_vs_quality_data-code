Purchased two pink OmieBoxes for the new school year. Unfortunately, the vacuum container is defective on both. We've read through the suggestions/recommendations of vendor (e.g. hot water in container, lining up lid properly, etc.) but the lid does not tighten. Lid keeps twisting and twisting, never locks. Water leaks out of vacuum container regardless of lid placement. We really wanted the bento boxes to work, so it's very unfortunate.
