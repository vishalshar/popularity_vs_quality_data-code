Not a very secure design. It does not stay in the CD slot well. Even with the sticky foam to stabilize it. The cell phone flops around. The mount will pull out of the CD slot as soon as I tried to remove the phone. I wound up not using it. Seems like the uprights for the wider phones are an after thought in design.
