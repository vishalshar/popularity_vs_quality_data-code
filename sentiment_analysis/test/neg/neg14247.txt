I saw these online and have other locking type laces cause I hate strings coming loose as I run.  I wear a size 11 and these things make my shoes way too tight - painfully tight and they do not have very much give to them.  maybe they will be better for someone with smaller feet, but they are not goof for mine.The Good: Cool locking and variety of colorsThe Bad: Frigging tightOverall:  I will never buy again
