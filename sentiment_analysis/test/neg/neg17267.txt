First off, I ordered these "shipped and sold by" Amazon.com, and appear to have received a refurbished unit marked as brand new.Why would I think this? Welp, when I started them up, they asked me whether I wanted to continue the connection with my iPhone (I have an Android but no iPhone) and told me that my name was Max Benjamin (It's not).This was frustrating in-and-of-itself, but the device initially seemed to be working properly, so I shrugged it off for the moment as I was excited to dig in and try them out.Here's where the problem with the listing (and apparent refurbed unit) bleeds into a problem with the product:The glasses' serial number seem to remain "associated" with the former user's profile even after a Factory Reset. This is a problem, because making any significant modifications to the unit (downloading maps, customizing data fields, etc.) requires that you be logged into the Recon software on your computer and have the glasses linked to your account. Whenever I plug the glasses into my computer, they sync... But with the wrong person's profile.Strangely, I can get the glasses to sync my name, age, gender, and weight by using the Android app. However, syncing anything more sophisticated than these basic parameters requires using the desktop software, which, once again, reverts the device's info to Max's."???"
