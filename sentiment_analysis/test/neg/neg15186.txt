The bluetooth connection is weak and clunky, must discinnect and reconnect every sesh to get info if I'm lucky.  If not, just no connection.  Defeats the purpose of spending more on a "smart" device.Update; customer service is rude and ineffective.  I contacted them, they ignored my questions, gave me a list of 13 questions, some requiring trial and error, wasting my time trying to blame my phone or outdated software when I just bought it.  Try another phone - yeah how about you test this garbage with a phone before you send it to me, if it's important.
