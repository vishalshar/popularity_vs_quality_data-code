this was a huge let down. The ring itself looked like it came out of a cracker jack box, and the quality of the stone was really bad. it definitely didn't look like moonstone. it didn't have any iridescence, just a flat milky white. I contacted tingly about doing an exchange, and commented on the quality of the stone and they gave me a standard line that no two stones are the same and they will have variation, blah, blah, blah. Point is, they should only put out a product up to their standards, and if they have low standards, that speaks volumes. I asked a few stylish friends if they would wear it and they said no! the gold setting did look cheap.On the tech side, it's just a basic notification. nothing fancy and I turned off all the other background notifications so i wasn't bothered by a buzz every time I dropped out of range. I think if you want to be notified, just pay the extra $150-200 and get an watch and that way you aren't left to guess who's calling or texting. i wouldn't recommend this to a friend, that's for sure.
