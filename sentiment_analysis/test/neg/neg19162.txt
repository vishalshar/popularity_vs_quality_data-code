I absolutely love the concept of this product! I was really excited to get a different sort of nightlight for my 3 & 6 year old. Finally received the product and saved it for a rainy day. I took it out of the packaging and did a quick run over the instructions and could tell this may have been a returned product. The discs weren't where the instructions stayed as well a few were missing any packaging. Of the 5 discs, 3 are scratched something awful. Like I said, great product and my girls love it, but being unable to read some of the words and the sever etching in the disc left me with a sad impression. This wasn't something that could've been done during shipping :/
