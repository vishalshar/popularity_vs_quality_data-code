I absolutely love the /idea/ of this product. I tried to use it for weeks, thinking I could work the bugs out and it would be everything I wanted it to be. However, unfortunately, I don't think the product is "there" yet. The PetCube is slow to respond, and sometimes get frozen as if someone is using it, even though no one is. The wifi in my home is not the best, and the receiver in the petcube isn't that great, so sometimes I don't get any picture or it is very slow to load. Since there is no option to plug it directly into the modem, this is something we are just stuck with. The laser also seems slow to respond and is often not in the correct place, even when I calibrate it.Finally, sometimes the PetCube app in general just doesn't work on my phone. It will take forever to load, or never load, or crash randomly. I don't think this has anything to do with wifi or data.I am pretty sad to write this review, because I really want it to work. I have a few more weeks before I have to return it, so I will keep troubleshooting- otherwise I think I will return it. The product isn't ready to spend $200 on it.UPDATE:After trying this product for 2.5 months, we have decided to return it. It is just too buggy. For $200, I would need this to work 100% of the time- but it just doesn't. I will turn it on in the morning, ensure that my app shows that it is connected to the PetCube, go to work, and check again just to see that it has become disconnected. The Wifi seems to work just fine on our WiiU, which sits right next to the PetCube. And my phone is always connected either through WiFi or 4G network, so it should work- but half the time it doesn't. So it leaves me wondering how my dog is doing all day long, since the only way to fix this issue is to unplug it and plug it back in.We decided to buy a two-way audio security camera instead. Even though it doesn't have a laser, most indoor security cameras have the option to plug directly into the modem using an ethernet cable. Plus they can move back and forth, have LED lights, and some even have night vision. Between this and a dog walker, I think we can solve the issue of leaving our dog home alone. Sorry PetCube, you are a brilliant idea and I want to love you- maybe I will check back in 5 years when there is a 2.0 version and all the bugs are fixed.
