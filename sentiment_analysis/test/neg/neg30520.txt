This is a summary of my 40 day adventure with the new Roost smart battery.I installed my battery in a First Alert SA720, and tested that everything was hooked up correctly by using the "test alarm" function on my alarm. My setup experience was similar to others reviews.Things were working fine for the first two weeks, but then I started getting low battery chirps at 4am in the morning not pleasant. Worse yet, when I opened the iOS app afterwards, it was LOGGED OUT; meaning, had the alarm gone off due to a fire, my phone would never have received a notification. This isn't an app youd open on a frequent basis, so having the phone app disconnected from the service without somehow getting a notification (an email/text/something in iOS Notification Center) is a big problem. To silence the alarm for the night, I simply removed the battery so I could deal with it in the morning; surprisingly, the app still listed my alarm as OK and the battery life level as 'Good.A few days later I reinstalled the battery, and it did not chirp anymore. I decided to leave it be and carry on with life.Two weeks later, I open the app and notice that the battery is now listed as Offline. Again, there isnt a notification when this happens; you have to check the app manually. I was busy so I figured Id address it next week. But a few days later the damn battery causes my alarm to start chirping AGAIN, forcing me to take out the battery immediately. (Obviously, no notifications again.) I took a voltmeter to the battery and it turns out its only pushing out 8.0 volts, just a month after purchase. I did not experience the low beeping from the battery after disconnecting, that others have experienced.Other thoughts:- Even when the battery was working, I did not always receive a notification when using the "test alarm button on my detector. Id say only 2 out of 3 tests succeeded in "alarm ringing" notifications getting sent to my phones. (When they did go thru, they always sounded on both phones). A 67% success rate at detecting the alarm is pretty poor.- The battery only lasted two weeks before my alarm started chirping, even though the app thinks battery levels are good.- The battery doesn't know if it's still installed in the alarm.- The offline appears to be caused when the battery fails to respond to regular pings/heartbeats from the Roost server. There's nothing on the support site that tells you what to do when its offline, though Id guess youd have to delete and reconnect it, then logout/login on all your other phones.- The iOS app needs work. There should be notifications when *anything* with the app happens, such as logout or battery goes offline, because if everything is working perfectly, nothing should happen. Also, typo on the login page seems unprofessional. I have not used the Android version enough to be able to comment.None of the smart features of this battery has worked thus far, outside of my testing on the first day. After my experience, I would not trust the "smart" battery to let me know when something's wrong. It didn't do the one thing it promised to do in the video spot (no 4am chirps); and as a lithium battery, it didn't even last two months. Im replacing this with a regular 9V lithium. While having smart features is nice, reliability is far more important in a passive but extremely vital monitoring device like a smoke detector.  The idea behind the product is promising, but I would stay away until they address these major issues.
