i got it for my BBQ, but it doesn't work well there and the package instructions aren't too clear.....it states it is good for starting 4 fires....but doesn't say whether u should divide the contents into 4 piles or use the entire package 4 times,,,,either way the pebbles fall thru the grates of the bbq and the flames aren't high enough to reach the charcoal....perhaps it would work better on the ground if u were camping
