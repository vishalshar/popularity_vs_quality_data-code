I'm honestly not sure how to rate this device. I want to love it, it's perfect in almost every single way. The size, materials, fit and finish, overall picture the tripod and stand are great. However, there are a few glaring problems that ruin it's usability.First and foremost, trying to figure out how to use this device is a nightmare rabbit hole of adapters, standards and reading about the differences between HDMI, MHL, Slimport, Micro USB 5 Pin, 11 Pin etc. Trying to find an adapter that would work and ending up with a snarled mess of spaghetti wires that defeat the whole purpose of it's small form factor already. Beyond that, there are some more minor quibbles...1) There is a near useless MicroSD slot that needs to be done away with to free up room for a more useful input than MHL. (Phone>Slimport>HDMI Adapter>MHL Adapter>RIF6. For real?)2) Some sort of clear direction or device compatibility other than a vague info graphic. What adapter? To what? Made by whom? Does one work better than the other? What about Slimport?3) The included remote the ONLY way to interact with the device as far as I can tell is incredibly cheap and fragile feeling compared to the cube. The fit and finish of it feels like one of those plastic remotes for a bargain fan that you hope lasts 3 months.This device does not feel consumer ready to compete with the ease of use of other projectors. There is a lack of clear instructions and directions that would leave the non technically inclined baffled. The dearth of information about compatibility with different devices is glaring, the remote is cheap and only functions when pointed at the rear angle. Add another inch to make it more usable and consumer friendly with more inputs and uses, upgrade the remote and I'd be sold on it, and an instant lover that would preach it to the high heavens.I would even keep it around if I had a laptop with HDMI out simply to use with the laptop rather than with my phone/tablet that I purchased it for. It's really that good. IF your phone/tablet is on the approved list or you are using it with a full size laptop it's easily a 4.5 star product, with the remote being the only real concern.Why one star? Because it's so close to a device that I want to love and use every day that it's sort of painful to think about the bitter disappointment of staring at the mess of adapters that still didn't work that I had to purchase to try and make this device work for me. It tantalized me into spending hours and dollars to just try and make it work because it's so darn cool.
