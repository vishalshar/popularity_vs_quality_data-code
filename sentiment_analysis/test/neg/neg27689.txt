I bought this as a gift for my wife on Nov 10th.  The product looked as I expected, but when I went to sync it with the Cuff app, I noticed that the CUFF had no battery life.  Being that the CUFF battery is not replaceable, I have not been able to use this product.  I have since tried to contact the CUFF customer service dept. but after 3 emails I have still yet to hear back
