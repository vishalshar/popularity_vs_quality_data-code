We brought the mushroom kit and followed the instruction to the letter and kept it in a damp place and away from direct sun light. After 10 days we got some budding and then the mushrooms stop growing. Kept misting twice a day throughout the process and now it's been two and a half weeks and the mushrooms started dying. We are very disappointed and will avoid purchasing the product in the future.
