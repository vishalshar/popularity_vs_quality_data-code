At first glance these looked great for my DJI 4 and i had high hopes. But then i noticed that the filter threads were too loose. instead of fitting in tight and snug the filter threads pop over the DJI 4's threads. I do a lot of DSLR photography and have used filters numerous times before but i've never seen filters so loose.Optically the darkest filter, ND16, had a weird distortion line that went diagonally through it. I guess it was a defect from how the resin set when  manufactured. It would be noticeable on video for sure. The other two were good and flat like they're supposed to be.There's no way i would fly would these on my DJI. I'm returning these and looking at other CP filter options. hopefully these issues get fixed. On a side note the polar pro graduated filters seem to fit well.
