While they are attractive in appearance and the least bulky of wrist weights (the reason why I bought them), I developed a large bruise on my right arm where the edge of the band touches the arm. I tested the bands for a couple of hours' work on the computer, hoping for benefits from simple activities. I tried to change the pressure point by loosening the fit, but the band still kept "cutting" into what I believe is the cephalic vein, causing my bruise. In fairness, I bruise easily and was disappointed that these bands are simply too hard and sharp at their edges.
