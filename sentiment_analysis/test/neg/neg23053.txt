I was disappointed with this. I am a lover of peanut butter, cinnamon, and raisins, But not your's.  Large & juicy raisins, not, they were small, hard, and dry. Also the cinnamon was very little, and the taste was barely recognizable as cinnamon. Then to charge more than double it's value was outrageous. I ate it only because I was too sick to go buy a better competing product.
