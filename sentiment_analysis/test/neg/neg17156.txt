I purchased this in hopes of adding flavor to my water while getting a few extra benefits to help while nursing. While the taste was somewhat pleasant, the way this product dissolves wasn't. I tried shaking it as well as stirring it and neither would completely dissolve it. I was always left with clumps of the mixture at the bottom of my cup. Not only missing the benefits but making it undrinkable.I gave up after trying the whole box and getting not one completely dissolved. I wouldn't recommend it friends or family.
