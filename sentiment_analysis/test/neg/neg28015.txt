I agree with all the negatives regarding this tank.  The pump was not strong enough after about a week to push enough air bubbles up to circulate water.  It does not seem to clean very well the water so its cloudy...Bought a new pump and everything was going along just fine until this morning when i could not find my betta in the tank.  After some investigation I realized he had been sucked up the tubing.  Bye bye betta!I would not advise spending $60 on this tank.  It is a very cool idea but there are issues.
