I really wanted to love this pillow. Like so many others, I have been trying to find a great pillow for a long time. I always used feather or down pillows, but wasn't able to afford them in recent years, so I struggled with horrible neck and shoulder pain and headaches. A couple of years ago, I spent $120.00 on a down pillow, only to find the new down pillows are so under-filled, they have very little loft. So that is no longer an option. I have been looking at all different kinds of memory foam pillows for several months. I was afraid they would be too hard.This pillow seemed like it might be a good solution. The holes throughout the core not only solved the heat problem associated with memory foam, they said that they also made the pillow much softer. And with my broad shoulders, I felt the height should be ok. (I'm a side sleeper) And then I saw a review which stated that this is a great memory foam pillow for feather pillow users, because it is SO soft. Eureka! I thought this surely must be the answer for me. I bought the pillow, and waited with great anticipation for its arrival.Unfortunately for me, this was NOT the answer. It is the worst pillow I have ever used. It is NOT soft, it is hard. My head doesn't sink into it, It sits on top, putting my neck at an uncomfortable angle. I feel like my head is fighting this pillow all night, and now, after finally ridding myself of the pains in my neck and shoulders, they are back, along with my headaches and a brand new pain in my shoulder blades.It's hard to imagine why some people had such a great experience with this pillow and I had such a miserable one. I believe I should have waited for A LOT more reviews.But having spent $85.00 on this pillow, there is no money left to buy one of the shredded memory foam pillows. Unfortunately, that is the decision I should have made to begin with.
