We bought this because we have a rambunctious car who lives to dart out of the door when it's open too long. We installed this system and he jumped straight up and over our fence when he felt the shock. He came down on the other side and by the time we got him he was hiding behind the garbage can continuously being zapped. It maybe lasted a minute but it was enough to give him a pretty nasty burn on his neck and now he's terrified to go outside, even on lead. We got a lecture from the vet on these devices and a nice big bill. Not convinced the device could have hurt the car that badly I put the collar on my wrist and crossed the boundary. I was hit with shooting pain immediate and constant. It was extremely unpleasant and I'm a 230lb man. I can't even imagine what my 9lb cat went through. This is just not worth the price or the harm you can inflict. I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone.
