I wish to give it 2.5 stars -- the average of design/idea (5 stars) and materials (1 star).The materials and workmanship of this clip are very poor, and think it would break quickly if ever asked to hold a 50lbs load.  If you are wishing to hang something very light weight, perhaps it would not be bad, but I planned on using to hold my bags which are over 15lbs (but way under 50lbs).  Not only are the joints wobbly* (please see update below about joint), metals very light weight, but also has poor workmanship (glue squeezed out where the magnet is placed).  If this were a quality piece made in the USA, twenty bucks would be understandable!!  But this piece of junk is made in China, and does not come close to being worth twenty dollars --- I would put five dollar price tag on it, at the most.Where the Qlipter does succeed is the design!  I just received it, and am disappointed in the poor quality materials, as it will change my intended uses for it, but I still think this thing will come in handy.  Maybe someday the makers will fix the quality issue, then they would have one heck of a awesome product!!!!*6-8-15 UPDATE:  Direct Premium Buys sent me a replacement Qlipter, due to my possibly receiving a defective item.  The replacement DOES have a much tighter joint where the hook is attached to the carabiner -- so tight, that it does not move freely, and must be pushed to move the hook portion.  It has left me wondering what the design was supposed to be, however, I will say, I think the lack of wobble in the replacement will make that joint last longer.  Unfortunately, the poor quality materials are all identical.I showed the Qlipter to people, let them handle it, play with it, then asked them how much would they pay for one....between $3.00 to $6.00 were the answers I received.  When I told them the Qlipter cost $20, everyone of them thought it was ridiculously overpriced.  While the Qlipter is a fun conversation starter, I still stand by my original review.  I really would love to see a real product version of this design, though....keep this current cheap version priced at around $5.00, then make a real piece for $20.00 -- I still love the concept!
