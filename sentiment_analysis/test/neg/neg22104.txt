Will update this review in a few weeks but here's the review thus far:04/29/2016After a month of struggling with Moov's customer support, I was able to get them to send me a shipping label so that I could exchange my Moov. First of all, they wanted me to pay for shipping, when they had a defective device which I have never seen or heard of before. Second, they wouldn't ship the new Moov until they received the original. While I get it, they're a young company and don't want to lose revenues on customer's who are possibly lying, this is a wearable device which means everyday that we aren't using and want to be using it is messing up our flow. Well I sent my Moov back to the company and they have never contacted me since. I have not received a new one, they have not responded to any of my contacts. I'm reporting this company to the Better Business Bureau and I recommend that you avoid them because they literally just robbed me of $70. Ridiculous.03/21/2016-So we received a replacement Moov for my fiance, then my Moov started acting up. I kept losing my workouts, the Moov tracked them completely, would store them, and then two days later they would be gone, poof... Next my Moov started disconnecting and reconnecting, and today it officially stopped connecting altogether. I'm lowing my review from 5 starts to 1 star because of the combination of the Moov not working well and the poor customer service. I reached out to customer service and was told to leave feedback each time I faced an issue. I did this repeatedly and the Moov team never contacted me to set up a replacement Moov or anything. Now I'm left with a completely dysfunctional device. Pretty pissed...01/31/16-so my fiance and I ordered the Moov Now for each other, his arrived before mine did-not sure why...but at any rate, he's been playing with his all weekend. We have done an 8 mile bike ride and a 9 mile run. We are both hard of hearing, and were able to understand the coaching pretty well. The fiance rides a single speed so he found the coaching a little annoying since he has no gears to shift, but he thinks it will help me a lot since I'm trying to learn how to ride gears. The running coaching was surprisingly accurate, recognizing very acute changes. Sleep tracking data is awful since any passive minutes (or time off the body, for example, the fiance removed it after a shower to let it dry without irritating his skin as his fitbit sometimes does) are tracked and gave him credit for 11 hours of sleep while we really only slept about 6.5.02/03/16 UPDATE: My moov has arrived, I have been loving it, as has my fiance. Although yesterday while changing clothes, the moov got stuck on something and the ankle band actually snapped. That was pretty shocking as it seemed to be a durable rubber. Amazon, as usual, has had excellent customer service and will be issuing a replacement.Two immediate concerns are the reason why this review is currently at 4 stars, which are the fact that the wrist/ankle bands simply have two prongs that secure it, and the Moov sensing device slides out of it's band anytime it catches anything. To resolve these, we've taken a piece of velcro and wrapped it around the device, we also are using string to tie two loops together providing additional security on the band. We selected these methods because we want to be able to remove and move the Moov as often as we want, which sometimes includes switching bands or changing the battery when the time comes etc. We feel very secure with out investment this way and it was at no additional cost as we just used things lying around the house. If you've developed any other methods that might work as well, please let us know and let us know if our methods work for you too!
