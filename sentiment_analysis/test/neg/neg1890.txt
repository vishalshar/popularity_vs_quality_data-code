I have been using Thync for a week. I use the calm program before sleeping and I have definitely been sleeping better, deeper and longer.Effect is subtle but if you think about something that is especially stressful for you beforehand and then compare the same thought after a 20 minute Thync session there is a clear difference in how your mind and body react. The effect is similar to a glass of wine or pint of beer but without any of the chemical effects.20 minute program leaves me a little "spacey" but before sleeping that is exactly what I want - no intrusive thoughts or distractions.The strips are good for 5-6 uses but I bought a tube of electrode adhesive and the first strip is still going strong after 15 uses.Is it all a placebo effect? Possibly, will keep on trying for another couple of weeks and update my review.UPDATE: After trying the device for a longer period I am returning it. Just too much cost ($4 per time) and effort for too small a benefit - I have used it every night (with new strips) and the sleep effects are not as pronounced.
