I got my first one from Amazon, broken one, same as another buyer here before, cannot plug in the USB. it is really a design flaw. I really like the design and the function it suggested, so I went to bestbuy to get another one. this one is working. but really just disappointed.1.  The sleep data not really accurate, cannot distinguish the REM,light and deep accurately. I have S+ By ResMed Personal Sleep Solution. That one is much more accurate if you want better accurate data.2. The voice function really bad, I have to say " OK Sense" many times to get it work. sometimes I said once, and it recognized, but most of the time didn't. (They asked me to disabled bluetooth, I did, but not working)3. The support really sucks. Usually takes 2-3 days, or even longer to reply a help ticket from you. So a simple ticket can take 1-2 weeks to finish.
