Like a lot of other reviewers, I bought these despite the trending poor reviews.  After a couple of months of use and a disappointing experience, i returned to the reviews and noticed that the 1 star reviews are getting close to outnumbering the better reviews.In the interests of full disclosure, i will admit that i have not used any of the fitness functions or the 'left side' at all.  I travel a lot for work and bought these primarily for music, particularly the internal music storage as I thought that would be a cool thing to have on the plane, with no need to connect to my phone.Pros:  (The extra star for this) it IS a cool piece of tech.  Beautifully designed and probably the way of the future.  Just not quite ready for prime time.  Also, they don't have noise cancelling, but do a decent job if inserted properly keeping plane noise out.Cons:-First things first, the thing I most wanted about them was the internal music storage. While that worked OK (despite the 'fiddle' of getting your songs on there and also adding new songs purchased on your phone) you can't shuffle.  That was a major drawback for me.  (*Note:  It is probably easier to load and update songs from an android, from an iphone because you have to use iTunes its a PIA).-They don't seem to hold a charge.  After a short flight, put them back in the (fully charged) case but when I came to use them on the return flight the earbuds and the case were dead.- On a longer flight, they gave out after 2 hours.  You can put them back in the case to charge up but of course then you can't use them.  My LG's will do a 6 hour flight with still a bit left.- The two sides don't seem to hold the same charge.  The right side gives out quicker than the left (only an annoyance but still).- The touch controls are very difficult to master.  I watched all the videos and practiced, but still when in normal use I found it very fiddlly to pause, next song, etc.- The touch controls (especially on the left side) is a little too sensitive.  I found if I wanted to put my head on a pillow on the plane, it would constantly set off the left side controls.  I know you can turn that off...  but if you did want to use the left side as well as the right I would imagine that would become annoying pretty quick.- Overly "safety conscious" in that the max level is still too low (IMO)- Not terribly comfortable for small ears.  After a couple of hours wear they actually hurt.  I can wear my LGs for hours and practically forget they are there.That's about it.  Nothing major but an accumulation of things that make me wish I had saved my $300.
