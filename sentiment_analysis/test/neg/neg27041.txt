Automatically I felt cheated, because the tin wasn't full when I opened the canister. Then I felt doubly disappointed by the flavor, or lack there of. Initially I didn't get a hint of caramel popcorn. The next cup I doubled the amount of tea leaves and I steeped it a lot longer and admittedly it was much better. It's quite likely that I'll get about eight cups total. Do the math for yourself and decide if it's worth the premium.
