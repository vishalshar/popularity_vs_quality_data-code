I never write reviews as most of the products we purchase from Amazon have been great BUT this product has been nothing but a headache!!!  We purchased Blossom about 8 months ago from Amazon and just had it installed by a professional  electrician and spent $200 to have it rewired from our previous irrigation system.  We thought the $200 was worth it to have complete control over our sprinkler system from anywhere in the world.  Boy were we wrong!!  It worked fine the first 2 weeks but we have had nothing but issues ever since.  The darn thing won't stay connected to our wifi and it says it's watering EVEN when it really not doing a thing. We were away for 3 weeks and felt self assured that our new lawn was getting watered only to return to a completely brown lawn. I set my alarm to 4:00am when it's supposed to be watering and watched for an hour when Blossom kept saying it was in the process of watering and absolutely nothing was happening on our lawn.  I was flabbergasted!!  Since then we have had to unplug AND REPLUG OVER AND OVER AGAIN the system and UNPLUG AND replug every 2 days to reconnect to the wifi.  This worked in the beginning but the last 2 weeks we have not been able to water our lawn at all cause it will not reconnect to the wifi.  Once this happens you can not....I REPEAT YOU CAN NOT WATER YOUR LAWN.  We have tried everything and now watering our lawn manually with a hose and manual sprinkler which is absolutely ridiculous trying to do this in South Carolina in 98 degree weather.  I have never felt so helpless and in no control.  I want to put the old system back in place so I can start my system manually but can't even do that with blossom cause it will not connect to the wifi.  Once that happens you are doomed.  Do not - I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS SYSTEM if you want to keep you irrigation system going!!  We have to rehire an electrician to rewire a different system so we can water again.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISSATISFIED with a product that really seemed so promising.
