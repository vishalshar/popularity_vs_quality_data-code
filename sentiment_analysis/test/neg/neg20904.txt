This is a good product for the really serious golfer that will analyze his game on his computer after his round. The technology does not work while using the device. The application on your phone is useless because the shots recorded can not been seen on your phone until after the round is completed and imaged in on your PC.They have a new version of the product coming out that should be much better and user friendly. I wouldn't recommend this model. Wait for the new one.
