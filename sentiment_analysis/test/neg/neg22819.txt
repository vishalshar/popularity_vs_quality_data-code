I purchased these wanting to try a healthier snack, Although these "chips" taste good they are more like dried chewy fruit. I did not receive any apricot or mango, only apples. These packages are labeled as multi-serve but beware - they are only the size of a small chip bag like those you would get at the gas station. Horribly over priced for quality and quantity.
