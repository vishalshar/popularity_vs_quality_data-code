On only my third trip the handle completely broke.  Very disappointing.  Currently in MKE with 5 more flight segments on the trip.  This should be fun.There are no secondary handles anywhere on the bag, so I'm really out of luck.  WOW, for this kind of money, I expected better.UPDATE: Now the lock mechanism is broken, too.  It requires a key everytime, no quick release.  STAY AWAY from this bag.  We'll see if the Blue Smart Team cares to remedy this problem.
