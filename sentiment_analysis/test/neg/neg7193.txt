I like the look of the watch.  It feels nice too. Unfortunately the band doesn't fit well And the "black peg " that keeps it together isn't aligned ..  The other great part is that it's a big watch but the downside is because it's so big the crown takes countless screen shots Siri is always telling me she's not sure what I said.. Because of the button  and fills my camera memory.
