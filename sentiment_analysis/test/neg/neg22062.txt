This was so disappointing! I bought this card with such high hopes of pranking my brother-in-law. There was so much anticipation as we waited to give it to him and see his reaction once he realized it kept going.I'm not sure how he did it, but he was able to get the music to stop playing after about 2 minutes. Such a bummer!!
