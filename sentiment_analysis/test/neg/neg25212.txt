I really wanted to like this phone. When I received it I was giddy to open it up and activate... I did so.After waiting for the software update I juiced the phone up and began using it. My disappointment came when placing my first call and the earpiece was so crackled and bad it physically hurt my ears. I thought it could have been the other caller so I decided to test with a few friends to realize either this phone has poor call quality or my unit's earpiece is damaged and DOA. It wasn't a minor static noise, mind you, it literally kept cracking at a loud volume (no matter what volume level I adjusted to) that would make anyone's ears bleed!Another thing I was disappointed with was battery life. I haven't had the chance to give it "real world usage" but after a 10 minute call my battery went from 97% to 86%! That's terrible!Anyways, I'm sadly returning this phone because first impressions are everything.
