Does a manual come with this product? I only received the device and a cable.  I successfully charged the device, I think that I should have some recordings but there are no buttons on the device to playback what was recorded. I reattached it to my computer and it was not identified...  Right now, this expensive device gets a zero! I downloaded the App and have tried to sync the Bluetooth and that doesn't work either. Epic fail! I was so hopeful
