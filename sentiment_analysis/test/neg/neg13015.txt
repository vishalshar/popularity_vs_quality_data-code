I think the video quality on this thing is terrible. I used it indoors, I would say our lighting is decent. My iPhone 7+ doesn't have issues with the same lighting, but on this the quality is very poor. All recordings were done on to the micro sd card included. I haven't tried streaming and probably won't. I will just return it.  I don't find the litt boxes on the app to work that well either. It automatically creates a couple and then the others are simply impossible to figure out how to setup.
