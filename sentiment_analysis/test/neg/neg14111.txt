Despite claims of being compatible with Android phones these earbuds aren't. I was really hoping these would be my end to searching for wireless earbuds, unfortunately I'll have to find something else.Additionally if you own an Android device and want to know if they ever fix the compatibility check the skybuds app on Google play store first. I wish I had done that, I wouldn't of gotten my hopes up and wasted my time.
