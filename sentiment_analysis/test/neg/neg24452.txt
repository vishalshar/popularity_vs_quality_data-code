If I can give it less stars I would. The setup out of the box fairly easy. Once setup though the app asked if I wanted to do a firmware upgrade, sure why not? Well that was a mistake since after talking to tech support, they verified if you do this, it will fail. So anyone with a ver B1 with firmware 2.0, do not upgrade the firmware or it will cause the unit to become unresponsive and no way to fix other than send the unit in for replacment.I am trying all kinds of these type of units to see which is more reliable, I experience units that do not turn off or turn on 100% reliable on the schedule I am setting. I also have ones that get a better internet signal and others that require the router to be rebooted if the plug looses power. Time I am sure will fix these glitches, but waiting 10 days for a replacement is not acceptable right out of the box D-LINK!!!! back to Amazon you go! Loving my prime acct.
