With cold season here, I'd been looking for a thermometer.  I'd previously tried the Swaive but it had three issues.  1. It wouldn't reliably pair with my phone. 2. It didn't produce consistent results.  3. It used proprietary sensor covers that could only be ordered from Swaive.The Withings Thermo promised to overcome these limitations, and indeed it fixes two of them.  It uses Wifi to send the data back to Withings and push to my phone.  Aside from delays of up to 1 minute performing this transfer, it works reliably.  Second, it doesn't use sensor covers so there's nothing to buy (other than batteries)The problem is accuracy.  I can take three readings one after another and get results that vary by more than 3 degrees F.  For tracking temperature and fever, a range that broad makes Thermo useless.  For now I'm taking three readings and trying to figure out which one seems reasonable, but I will continue my search for another product.
