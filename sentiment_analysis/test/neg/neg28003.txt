The drawing "game" requires you to look at the screen, not paper, and to try to trace the lines of a picture. It is much more difficult than you might expect. Kids get frustrated. I incorrectly thought that the lines were projected onto the paper. I do not recommend this product if the drawing piece was what was important to you. Not worth it.
