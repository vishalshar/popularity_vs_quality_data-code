Received package. Tried it out as I was skeptical about all the reviews. Fit perfect into the MacBook. Used my external hard drive but would automatically eject itself and re-connect. First issue. Secondly, the device got warm. Didn't think nothing of it since I had read some reviews that this could happen. Some said it would get extremely hot. Didn't get to that point, yet. Then I tried using my iPhone to charge from the device and that's when it got extremely hot. I finally took it off and decided to send back. Good and well thought of device only if it didn't heat up. Don't want a burning device on my MacBook!
