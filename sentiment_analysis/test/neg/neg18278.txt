My main attraction to this was the wristband. I've had bad experiences with different models of Fitbit and was open to trying something else. The package comes with the Pulse Ox, a wristband and a clip. Unfortunately, the wristband does not provide a tight fit, so the Pulse Ox keeps slipping out (and one won't realise it's gone!)I've had to search furiously for it on at least two occasions. At a 100 bucks, this isn't something one wants to do. This morning, I went nuts searching for it. At a point, I was certain I had flushed it down the toilet. Fortunately, I found it...under my pillow. I must have dislodged it in my sleep.I never remember to switch to the sleep monitoring function; I need something that just recognises the fact that I have fallen asleep. And if you forget to switch it off, it won't take note of any movement/steps.
