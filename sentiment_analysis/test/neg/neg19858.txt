After reading all the reviews available on the web on this speaker and it's competition (JBL charge, UE boom, etc) I ordered the fugoo style on Sept 22, 2015.  Sound quality was key and I wasn't disappointed.  It doesn't get as loud as I'd like for the beach but for such a small speaker, let's be realistic...so not a deal breaker.  10 months into using the product, I took its waterproof claims to the test and submerged the speaker less than a foot into a pool for 10 seconds to test the claims.  Sure enough, it kept playing.  Though it later died, and thinking the battery was just out, tried to charge it.  That's when issues started.  First it would not hold its charge....and seem to only work with the charger plugged in.  Then later it stopped working all together.  Still within warranty, I worked with the excellent email based support (never got a return call via phone) and got a replacement.  The only issue now with the replacement is the battery life.  Have tested running the speaker continuously st half max volume.  According to Fugoo, this should last 40 hours.  After 2 test cycles, I'm seeing 17 to 20 hours max.  50% off from advertised battery life is more than enough to account for testing variances.  My warranty period just expired so not going to try to submit a warranty claim. Sure I realize battery life on these devices diminishes over time, but didn't expect it to drop this rapidly in one year.  I see prices on Amazon for this speaker has dropped 30% as of the beginning of October 2016.  This puts the product price more in line with what it delivers and considering the new battery life after one year of use, assuming I didn't get a defective unit.  Giving this speaker 2 stars instead of 4 since I'm seeing approximately half of the 40 hours of battery life expected.  Will continue to run a few more battery life tests to see if anything changes.
