I purchased this specifically because it was military grade approved for 4+ feet drop. I had it for less than 3 weeks and a 3' plain drop onto a level surface caused the screen to crack - well, thankfully the glass screen protector only. But still.I had used a different cover for a similar phone before, and it survived worse falls over the course of 3 years.Update:After continued use -mainly because after the high cost I didn't want to shell out more money - I am encountering what others have seen: the black rim is coming undone.I really had hoped to get something top-notch for the $60 price point.
