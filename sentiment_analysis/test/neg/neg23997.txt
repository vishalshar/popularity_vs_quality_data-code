The device seams OK for a single loop EKG.  My problem is with the business model of AliveCor.  Upon purchase and installing the app, seller advises that "Free trial of premium features through February 2017 including personalized heart health reports."  There is no description of basic vs premium membership, so I called AliveCor.  Turns out the difference is that, with basic, you can save only ONE EKG - making historical review and trend analysis unavailable.  Only Premium members will be able to store their EKG history.  This removes a key feature of the device.I asked "so, in order to save MY health data on MY phone, I need to pay for premium?" Yes.  "How much" $10 per month.  Seams like a lot for this feature. Disappointed this is unclear up front.
