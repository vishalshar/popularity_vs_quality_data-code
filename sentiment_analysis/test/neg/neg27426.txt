Giving these bulbs 2 stars because of installation and compatibility with Echo.  Each of my bulbs is approximately 3-5 feet from a WiFi extender but each bulb would not connect to WiFi the first, second, or third time.  After the fourth try they connected.  The installation card that comes with each light is small and the print is very, very small.  Thirdly, Alexa could not change the color but I did find a workaround.  I had to use IFTTT for EACH bulb.  Time-consuming but I set up on IFTTT all went well.  I have TP-Link bulbs and they were far, far easier to connect to my WiFi.UPDATED January 8, 2017: Since my review 3 bulbs, located on my first floor, go offline 3-4 times since installed.  I wait 5 minutes for them to reconnect and after 5 minutes I have to reset each bulb.  Nothing wrong with set up.  I have Apple AirportExpress in each room and the lamps are 4-5 away from each bulb.  Also, the BR30 DOES NOT work in can lights with metal lining.  No problem with my 2 TP-Links bulbs also in the same room.  I plan to sell Lift bulbs on eBay and buy more TP-Link bulbs.
