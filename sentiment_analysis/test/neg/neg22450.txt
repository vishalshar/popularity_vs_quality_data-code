I am a little disappointed... firstly when the packaged was opened.. the cord connecting the router to the computer  was packaged badly because the cord was bent and the cord cannot be used.. I had to find a cord from a previous router to use it... also on the touch screen it had a line running vertically  down the screen on the left hand corner which not supposed to be there..
