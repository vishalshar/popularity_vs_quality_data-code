This remote was supposed to be the lynch pin of the mess I call my home automation system/entertainment system.  I integrated this with my Echo / Smarthings Hub.  On the entertainment side my Lg EG 9100 Oled TV / Hopper 2nd Gen / Nexus Player / Lg Dvd Player / Lg Sound Plate.  Having set up my Smarthings with custom API's and various Smart Apps I figured this would be a breeze. My guess is if you are going to read this it is not going to make a lot of sense but if you decide to buy this it will make sense.  First off set up was fairly simple logging in and giving all the accounts permissions wifi etc etc.  After that it turns into a mess.  Logitech insists every activity needs to power on the device but when you switch to another activity it powers down the all the devices.  So your TV turns off switching between Dish and the Nexus Player etcetc.  So fire up Google and start to read. You must go to each individual devices and change so it will only Power Down with the Off button on the remote.  Moving on I was setting up my Nexus player to scroll down and start Kodi through the phone app.  The DIRECTION buttons worked fine but not the SELECT command.  Great do some more reading and I get the bright idea to turn on Simplink or CEC HDMI control on my LG Oled TV after that I could insert LG TV COMMAND SELECT in my Kodi Activity to tell the Nexus Player to SELECT.  Huge mistake the television just started changing inputs on its own depending what devices were on.  I probably could have reordered the the commands to POWER DOWN / INSERT PAUSE/ SWITCH INPUT but I said screw it as that is a pain and sometimes you must wipe the entire activity from scratch to delete one command as I found out dealing with SELECT issue in the Nexus Player.  Thanks to all the reading I was doing on my phone it was low so I switched to my desktop.  After going through and setting up another Kodi activity on the My Harmony program on the desktop the SELECT function worked.  At this point I was feeling good about the process until you dive into your Alexa set up.  Another Logitech mess to deal with.  Logitech decides call your tv and Dish multiple things.  For example, Hopper, Dish, Dish Network, TV , Television, Smart TV.  So your ten activities turn into about 40 and Alexa gets confused and says their are multiple devices with that name.  Ok, start reading again and not good.  Logitech does not let you delete the activities it sets up only the activities you set up.  You can go through and make Alexa forget the activity but if you make a new activity you have to rediscover and they pop up again.  So I had figure out something else other than groups in Alexa and going through and forgetting things in Alexa.  Since Logitech decides for you there are actives are so important that you can not delete them you need to take your Harmony activities and sync them with Smarthings hub.  That worked perfectly having Alexa control your Harmony Activities through your Smarthings Hub.  Then came the final straw with Logitech dealing with my Activities through my Lg TV.  The Lg Magic Remote uses WiFi 2.4 signal for the remote.  The problem came with the fact I could not add the HOME function to my Logitech Activities.  For example I had an activity for Amazon and it consisted of TV ON / SOUND BAR ON / VOLUME LG TV / SOUND BAR OPTICAL OUTPUT/ RIGHT DIRECTION / RIGHT DIRECTION / RIGHT DIRECTION / SELECT. Well the LG did not always go back to the same spot on the home screen so it was hit or miss if it would select the correct tab.  Go into My Harmony and add a command.  Nope Logitech only supports IR learning learning.  I gave up and packaged everything.  My Magic Remote lets me run my Nexus Player and does pretty good with Dish.  If you are looking for a remote just to control things this does it fine. If you are looking for a remote to automate tasks keep looking.  As for the one star review that is more about the Logitech not letting you delete your account.  I reset the hub and remote but still not sure if it wiped my info out.  Oh well I hope this helps others and will keep looking for the next gadget.
