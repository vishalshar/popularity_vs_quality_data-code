I purchased this and was using it fine enough.  I tried to use to again more recently only to discover the android app was updated and no longer worked with my device.I've sent an email to Seek Thermal to try to determine what is going on and have not received a reply after 10 days.To be clear, the thermal imaging was nice.  It's the best option available at this price range -- Still, I'm left with a product that stopped working and no customer support to assist.Reading recent review shows many similar issues.  Has Seek Thermal bailed on their customers?Update:  I've gone through 5 or so responses from customer support and it's gone no where.  The responses indicate that their representatives are not actually reading the emails.  Further, the phone number for support on their website is disconnected.  Reviews from the app on their google play store show a lot of their customers are having issues.  Seek Thermal appears to have broken customer support.We've spent our hard earned money for this product and we expect it to be supported.  If Seek Thermal can not support their customers then they are just taking our money.
