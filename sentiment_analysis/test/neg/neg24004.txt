I purchased the Kardia after it was recommended by my cardiologist.  I tried numerous times to take my ECG during symptomatic episodes only to have it tell me that it was unreadable.  Only once did it actually get a readable ECG and that was only when I wasn't symptomatic.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's actually having arrhythmias.
