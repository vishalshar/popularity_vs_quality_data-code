I was really disappointed when I received it. The bottle looked like it been kicked around.  It didn't come in the box where you have the barcode and expiration on there. The dispenser stick was broken.  Also around the dispenser top it was cracked!!! Looks like this product was either tampered with or not straight from a good manufacturer. I'm buying this straight from the brand website.  I don't trust this seller. Returning immediately!!!
