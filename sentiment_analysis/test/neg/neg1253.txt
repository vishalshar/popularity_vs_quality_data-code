Wanted to love this, but am returning it.  I was an early adopter of the original Shine and had two of those, because my first one fell out of the band on the street and was lost.  I thought I would try the Ray because I was used to the Misfit app and up until the loss of the Shine, felt like it was a good tracker.  I had my Ray for 2 days when the alarm function stopped working. Then it would never sync up with the Link app so I could not use that feature.  Then the incoming call/text notification only worked sporadically.  The step counter did not function properly either.  I walked a clearly marked 6 mile trail without stopping and the Ray only gave me 1.1 miles worth of steps and noted that over the course of three different periods of activity.  I contacted Misfit customer service via email multiple times to see if anything could be done, because I every time there was an issue I checked the app, my bluetooth, etc. and all signs pointed to this thing being connected, the alarm set and on, and notifications "on" and it synced after walking.  I received a single, largely unhelpful response about signing in/out of app and that was the last I heard from customer service.  Its too bad it did not work and customer service was no help, because the thing looks really cool and it was just wanted I wanted to wear along other jewelry/watches.  But $100 to much to pay for a plastic and aluminum accessory that does not work.
