This is a bad idea. The screen is very low resolution, so given narrow view angle it takes quite an imagination to understand what you see. Additionally auto aperture needs some time before gets stabilized so you can start your process of figuring out what is this you have in front of your camera. Then it is not auto focus so you have to twist the small lens on it to get decent sharpness. Two hand operation. On the top of it it clicks all the time scaring every living thing around. Useless for walking in the fores in search of animals. I have the other version with wide angle lens. That is just fine to use at home looking for lack of in-wall insulation in winter.
