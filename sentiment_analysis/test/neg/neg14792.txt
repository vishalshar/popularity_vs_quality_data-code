I catually reviewed better camera glasses that cost half the price with better resolution.So let's begin:Cons:1. The camera has built in Wifi that do not connect with the app on my android.2. Since the app doesn't work I couldn't check for the resolution I'm using on my camera (glasses) assuming the default is 1080p, the quality is not that good.3. The image is not fast enough and not smooth, grainy and for some reason too zoomed, I guess it's supposed to catch the sight of the eye but in fact if the resolution was really Full HD it would be perfect.4. The sound is terrible, since the mic is on the camera temple only, you get very laud but not clear sound and only from the left side. The glasses camera has a lot of noise and volume is not clear while on the GoPro you can hear only me, no background noise and a true stereo.5. The left temple with the camera in it is too heavy making the glasses to tilt to a little to the left and not sitting straight or comfortable.6. The left temple ( the camera) gets hot when in use, and even hotter when connected to the computer for download the videos, I will never wear a heated/heating device on my body needless to say on my face, taking a chance of explosion or radiation from the battery and stuff.7. The instructions are not clear and I coudln't figure out when is it filming or how to take a photo. I never new when it's on or switching from camera to video, confusing.Pros:1.The look of the glasses is very cool and I like the structure of them.2. You can detach the temple and using the screwdriver replace the left temple of any glasses or sunglasses that you have, turning them into a camera. Unfortunately, that's the only thing differentiate this camera apart from other camera glasses.To sum it up: I wish it would work as it promised as I was excited to replace my GoPro with them as they look very cool and seem more comfortable and useful than walking with a band attached to my forehead... But, I guess I'll stick to my GoPro.Another thing that made me disappointed, it doesn't even come with an SD card for the price!!!My review's Video quality is 1080p and could be seen on my Youtube channel Chris Love , just look on google for the review.after the introduction you can see the quality you get from the glasses and right after you can see the same video from the GoPro to compare quality.I paid full price for the camera on May (Pre-order), got it after 2 months and had to return it as it's not worth the money and feels too dangerous to use because the heating device - beware, might not be safe to use!!
