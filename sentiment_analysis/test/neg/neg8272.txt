I bought this last summer and so far so good. However, the colour is a bit off (the yellows are more green and oranges more red), and for some reason, I get a gray menu line at the bottom of the screen (1 MHL and the resolution) and I can't get rid of it! There's no where on the menu option from the remote or my computer (Macbook Pro). Quite annoying. Also, this projector is not good for presentations, small text is difficult to read at high resolutions (720p+), however large subtitles are legible. It's a bit loud for such a tiny thing and the battery doesn't last a whole movie. All in all, it does the basics --shows a movie and is super portable. Downsides are the poor colour, battery life, menu display gray line and the MHL to HDMI cable that came with it is very short (about 2 feet), so you can't move it far.
