The cookies only worked once, during setup. Afterwards, trying to program the cookies for the various habits kept on failing. I was told by support to upgrade the firmware on the mother and cookies but it made no difference. I was only able to program 2 of the cookies to work with an app. Afterwards, over the next month the cookies eventually *ALL* went offline. The only way to make the cookies come back online again was to delete and re-add them. Obviously, this is a serious product flaw.Furthermore, the cookie batteries all depleted to 25-50% within the month I had it (and all the batteries were new), well short of the promised 6 months. (Also, the battery meters are in 25% increments, pretty inaccurate imo).The sense mother dashboard has a slick UI with a bunch of animations. But the functionality was extremely limited, and the UX was pretty confusing. Perhaps they should have spent more time on adding useful features and fixing bugs instead. Given the sensory capabilities of the cookies (if they had ever even worked) you would think they could come up with better features instead of the few "Apps" they have on the dashboard. For example, you can't combine motion detections to trigger an alarm, i.e. if either the door or the fridge was not opened within this timeframe, send me a message.All in all, a good idea but terrible execution with some fatal reliability flaws.
