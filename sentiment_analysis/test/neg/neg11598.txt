First, let me say when the product worked, it seemed to work fairly well.  Recently something changed and that is why I am extremely disappointed.Setup was slightly frustrating and took about and hour.  Except for the first Luma, I had to make multiple attempts to register and activate the second and third units.  The setup was through my android phone app which itself was simple enough to use.  However, I started to call the red ring, the new BSOD.  I saw way too many of them during the process.I was getting reasonable throughput on my FIOS via the Lumas.  It was generally low 50s down and low 40s up.  We had a short power outage overnight recently and the up speed was never more than mid teens since then.  Today I had to reboot my main router.  The LUMAs took over a half hour to reestablish their network.  I had my regular internet up and running, but had to leave for work.  It was about a half hour after I left that the network app finally said online instead of offline.  I was told when I got home tonight the network was not working properly though it said it was online.  We had to move the laptop to a wired connection to get the printing done.  So I rebooted the network fully and the problem returned.I called LUMA.  Evidently there is some kind of issue and they don't know what it is.  The tech had me use a paper clip to reset the main unit connected to the router as it wouldn't activate but the other two would rendering the system inactive.  Afterward, I got the Blue Ring of permanence.  After about 20 minutes I was basically told to call back tomorrow if it isn't working by then.  This product works well for the most part, when it works.  But it doesn't appear ready for primetime at this point.  You cannot even see what updates are coming and that you might even have an issue.  You don't get a say.Seems like the people who went with EERO are happier.  Maybe I should have gone that route when the release was delayed.
