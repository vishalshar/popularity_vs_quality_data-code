****** Updated Review*****Amazon shipped me a replacement quickly as the first one I received was dead on arrival.  I was able to set up the watch and connect it to the app pretty quickly.  However, its performance is still disappointing.  When first connected, it shows the location of my office.  I took the watch home with me, and I checked on the location of the watch again two hours after initial connection; however, the app shows the watch is still in my office, while it is actually next to me.  I checked again another hour later, and it showed "Cannot connect to hereO".  There is no way for me to reset the watch to get it reconnected.It is definitely not reliable, and it's not worth paying the monthly fee of $5/month after having to pay $199 for the watch.  I definitely would not trust this GPS watch to track the location of my child.  Very disappointed.****** Original Post******I received this GPS watch with much excitement, but I was much disappointed.  The GPS watch is a dud right out of the box.  The instructions were terrible.  Simply said charge it for 2 hours and connect it to the app.  After charging, the watch continued to display "OFF", and it can't be turned on.  It's going back to Amazon for sure!I was able to try it on my younger daughter.  It's like a watch, so it is very easy for my daughter to remove it.  The wristband is short, and my daughter is on the skinny side, it's already using the last hole on the band.  It will be too small for her next year, if this thing ever works.I also just realized it's not waterproof because it's charging connector is on the wristband.  It's only splash proof, but not water resistant or water proof.The watch itself is a little bulky, and there is something very hard and thick protrudes on the wristband.  I attached a photo showing it.  My daughter said it's uncomfortable.  If your child has any sensory issue, this watch won't work for you especially it can be easily removed.It's very disappointing after spending $199 on this purchase.  I am switching back to My Buddy Tag, even though it's more like a virtual tether and not a GPS watch, but My Buddy Tag works and it's much cheaper with no recurring charges.
