It worked for less than 6 months now stuck in CD mode .I contacted Innovative Technology  they will replace it but I have to pay to ship the defective/broken one back to them as well as pay shipping on the replacement. I requested a shipping voucher but was informed they don't do that. By the time I'm done, I will have paid more in shipping (original purchase, return of defective item, shipment of replacement) than the item cost. I will not be buying anything else by this company. I will contact the FCC and the BBB about this product.
