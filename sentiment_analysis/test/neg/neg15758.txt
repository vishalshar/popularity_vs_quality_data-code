Pretty unreliable for me.  It often goes down with no rhyme or reason.  Configuration for Wi-Fi was a bit of a hassle as I had to dig up an old iPhone to actually get it configured (doesn't seem to work connecting using a Windows machine without command line).  Support is responsive and helpful to a certain extent, but it would be nice if the thing would work reliably.  On the plus side, I get notifications every time it goes down (which means I get a lot of emails).  They think it is a Wi-Fi issue, even though I run many wi-fi devices in similar locations without issue.  Running a network cable from one end of my house to another is going to be a sucky project, especially if it doesn't actually solve the problem.  Also, paying $5-10 a month to actually get visibility to your data seems kind of pricey after dropping $250 on the equipment.
