After owning many different models of Jitterbug phones by Samsung over the last 5 years, this new one by Alcatell is terrible. First the ringer is far too quiet for an older user. It's set at max ringer and the best you can do is lay the phone on it's face to hope to hear it when it rings. Doesn't matter the ring tone set. Second, and the worst part about this phone is that unless it's held just perfectly, noone can hear on the other end. It's muffled and inaudible. This is a serious flaw for an older person in my opinion. I was reluctant to buy this phone since a different manufacturer than the previous models but I gave it a try. Unfortunately there's some much needed improvements to be made on this one.On another note not related to the phone. I've had to call Greatcall(Jitterbug) for various reasons over the years and it's always been a smooth, pleasant experience. With this phone I've had to call several times to try and relieve the issues I've had, and I've been met with the recording "we're experiencing unusually high call volume today, for faster service please call back another time". Now this has gone on every day for a week and the wait times are very long. 30 minutes so far. And the representatives are short and come off hurried. I'm getting the feeling these are starting to slide at Greatcall unfortunately.There are a couple plus' I can give. This one is actually USB capable. I can transfer my photos from my phone to the PC which the other models I've owned cannot. Also the reading magnifier MIGHT come in handy, but I'm returning the phone before I could actually use it realistically.
