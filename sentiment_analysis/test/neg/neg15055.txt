Lacking software limits usefulness.  There's no adjustment for emissivity, there's no manual scale for temperature range, pixel temperatures are not saved with the thermogram, there's no scale on temperature range on the thermogram.  The device itself doesn't seem to be able to pick a stud out of an exterior wall, or objects out of a room unless there's a huge temperature difference.  I can't even see any of the circuit breakers in my electrical panel, even when the air-conditioner is operating.If the software is updated, it may be quite a bit more useful, but the thermal noise still seems quite high.
