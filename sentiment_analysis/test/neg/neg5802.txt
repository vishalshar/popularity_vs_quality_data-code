I am not sure about this product yet.  I thought it a great idea and it is so small and compact looks really good.  I have followed the instructions to download the software - don't like downloading new software - and turned off my computer which is only 2 months old. When I turned it back on again it was very very slow.  Not something I need when I use it for work.  When I went to find the software it says I had to register which I did then it all disappeared and I could not get to the dashboard area.  I uninstalled and reinstalled and the same thing happened.  Therefore I have uninstalled it again.  Needless to say my computer is now running at full speed.  I am not going to re-install this again until I read some more positive reviews - I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
