Pack has nice size, shape, right length shoulder strap.  My basic complaint is simply it's not worth the price, but it's simply not worth the money.  For this priace it needed upgraded material, maybe leather, more pockets heavy duty zippers, better closures. I'll use it, until I find a "Nice" bag, then I'll stuff it with supplies and throw it in the back of the truck.  It's a $10 bag that should be selling for $25.
