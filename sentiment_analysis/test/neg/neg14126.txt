Looks great. Radio works. Turntable works. USB playback works. CD player only works when it wants to. It will stop reading in the middle of a track and you can hear it spinning. It starts back where it left off after several seconds of silence. I haven't tried recording yet. I haven't tried the cassette tape play back yet. But decided to write this ASAP to let people know it's not worth buying! Also, the speakers are OK at low volume but you'll need external speakers if you want higher volume without distortion. Because there is only one output (the headphone jack), you need power amplified speakers. Don't be fooled by the RCA jacks on the back. They're input only which makes no sense. There's only Bluetooth input so Bluetooth speakers won't help you either. Oh wait. Now the CD player quit all together. Just spins occasionally but plays nothing. Bottom line, if you want something that looks nice and nostalgic for show, buy it. If you want a functional, multipurpose system, buy something else!
