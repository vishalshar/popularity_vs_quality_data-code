The concept is fantastic. However, it will not stay attached to the toilet bowl, I contacted the company who sent new suction cups which did not help. I cleaned the toilet and wet the suction cups, it didn't help.The actual device and the box it comes in looks like it should be at a dollar store. Really, $3 would be the most this is worth,The only reason I didn't send it back is because it's a hassle. If I had bought it in a store locally, I definitely would have gotten a refund:It shouldn't be on the market now, They need to fix the problems.
