The phone, screen and button are too small for a senior to us for email or texting. The instruction manual is huge!!! A senior is supposed to learn this?? I'm 52 and can' t get through it. So it really can't be used well as a smart phone. The worst part, is using GreatCall. The $35 plan quickly became $100 with no notice of overages. I can't even view my bill. Waited over an hour for customer service and did not get through. Tried to email customer service from the website and it did not go through. I'm angry and disappointed with the lack of billing support. Needed a lot of support while setting up the phone which was fine, but really?
