Be aware that if purchased separately you'll need to buy the reflector and the stand for the iPad separately as well. This is a bit expensive for magnets with numbers on them, again be aware as it is not stated anywhere on website. We will have to send this back or order stand. The docking system is $70 and I'm not sure how to order that.
