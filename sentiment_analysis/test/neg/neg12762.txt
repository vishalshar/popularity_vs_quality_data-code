This is a scale with a lot of nice features. Setup is easy, it's Wifi enabled, the app is pretty good. However, it's a terrible scale. I'd get as much as 10 lbs difference between two consecutive measurements. The fat index and water percentage was even more wildly inaccurate. Finally, their prize feature of Pulse Wave Velocity never worked.I contacted their support for help and they contacted me with a generic email without answering my actual question. I'll stay away from all Whitings product in the future.
