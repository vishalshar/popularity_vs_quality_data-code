very bad experience!I bought 2 units and used both of them at my suitcase and my wife's, Over the last 3 months we made no less than 20 flight segments around the world. I bought also the program for 6 months. It is not true it is free to track your luggage.The results are:1 - in most of the times I didn't receive any message of where my suitcases were2 - in some cases I received at least one message for one of them. It never happened that I received the message from both of them3 - in some cases I received the message once we were already at the hotel, 1 or 2 hours after leaving the airport with both suitcases4 - when I track the devices, even paying all the fees the system always says both devices are in Vancouver (we were there for 5 days about 45 days ago). There's no way to change this.Conclusion: waste of time and money. It is not a solution! Just doesn't work properly
