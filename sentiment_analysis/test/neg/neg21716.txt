It's way too sweet, almost undrinkable.  The flavor of the mushroom and star anise should not be combined with stevia.  Maybe some people will be able to tolerate the flavor, but it's certainly not something I will ever be drinking again.  Go order some plain lion's mane extract and drink that, it'd probably be much more tolerable than this, and you can find your own ways to disguise the taste.  The one plus?  They come in individual packets, so they're suitable for travel.
