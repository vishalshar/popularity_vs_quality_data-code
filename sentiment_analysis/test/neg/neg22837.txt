I bought this phone for my blind father and he likes how heavy the phone feels compared to his old ones. He doesn't like that the phone doesn't talk to him like his old phones did, it made it easier for him to navigate the phone. We thought by getting a phone that was geared towards the elderly that this phone would have functions to better serve him but it he doesn't think so.
