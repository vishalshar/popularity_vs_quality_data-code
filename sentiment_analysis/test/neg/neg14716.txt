Arrived completely molten and in semi liquid state. Instead of Chewy Banana Bites, its more like molten chocolate lava. The manufacturers needs to rethink about shipping the items in hot weather condition or modify the structure and packing of the product so that the item is as chewy as advertised. The product that arrived was in a state for consumption of non-humans. Maybe Aliens.
