I really wanted this to be a great product. It seemed to solve the problem I've had with last dozen or so iPhone cables; the fraying at the ends from pulling the wire out of the socket or bending it. Unfortunately the cable is a little TOO stiff. You can't move your iPhone around the table without feeling some resistance from the coiled cable. Also, when I unplugged my phone the Lightning adapter came out of the cable with it. I was going to ask for a replacement but I think I'm just gonna go with a refund. They need to make the cable less stiff
