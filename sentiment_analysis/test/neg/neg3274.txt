Amazon was very helpful and responsive in helping me return this item for a full refund. I have had many problems with the performance of the phone. It locked up repetitively. I only had 1 charging cable I could get it to charge on. It would redirect itself to random places mid task. At one point it would allow me to make phone calls, but the person on the other end couldn't hear me. Rebooting would fix the problem, it did correct itself sometime the next day. Very unreliable.
