I like these vitamins from an actual vitamin standpoint but if they don't stop sticking together in the bottom of the container I'm going to stop buying them.  Past orders have not been like this but the last two have - I thought it was maybe just one bad bottle but now I'm dealing with another.  For what it's worth I use the men's version and it's got none of these problems.
