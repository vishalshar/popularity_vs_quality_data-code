Only 3 stars!  Too bad because this is a great entry level thermal camara.  Amazon clearly shows that both the standard and XR versions have an adjustable focus ring.  The version that I received does not (an earlier model).  The app is a bit glitchy but not the end of the world for me.  Finally the earlier versions of the app had adjustable emmisivity settings.  This version (as of September 2015) is pre set to .98 (skin).  Otherwise not bad.
