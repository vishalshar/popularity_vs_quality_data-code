The lid does not open as they say it should.  Each time I open the lid, I have to pry it open with a knife.  I even watched the video demo on how it should open to make sure I was not doing it incorrectly.  It just doesn't work.  It does not hold very much water and I to refill in several times while working out.  I do like that it tracks my hydration level but the other problems far outweigh that benefit.  It is highly priced and not worth it.
