Needed to set up two tv's for presentation for a church setting.  The set up was confusing, and once I finally got the two screens set up, the connection kept getting dropped and there as a 10-12 second delay.  I had emailed for help, but only received "tech savvy" support with very little actual help.  They kept blaming my problem on my computer, top of the line Apple, and our internet, which was at high speeds and full strength.  Because of the $600 investment, I tried for a month and a half to get it set up and working, even hiring a professional IT person, who could not get it working right.  I asked for a refund, which was denied.  If you have stagnant displays that you want up all day, this is the product for you.  But if you actually need to do any kind of real time presentation, where you click for slide transition and need it to follow in a timely manner, and keep your presentation on the screen for the full meeting time, this is definitely not the product for you.  It does NOT live up to its promise, and the company seems to be lackluster in its support and concern for customer satisfaction.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  You will regret it.
