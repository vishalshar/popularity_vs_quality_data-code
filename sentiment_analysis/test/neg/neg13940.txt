I only give reviews after using a product for an extended period of time. Sometime I feel the urge to give a review in order to help others make good buying decisions.I don't recommend this product for a simple reason - educational value is low compared to the price I paid.It is just another mediocre Robot that attracts eager young minds without providing much educational experience beyond a few hours offun play and laughs. I'd say my three boys have played this Robot a few times since I bought it, and each time they spent about 30 minutes or so with it. They have also used the MIP app on my Android phone to design routes, make special movements, etc. However overall I felt MiP is quite limited to what it can do, and even more limited to what an eager young mind can discover by playing hard and getting creative with it - there is not much you can do, really.I'd say, if your kid is easily bored, don't buy it because your kids will get bored easily. If your kid is not easily get bored, don't buy it either because your kid will end up spend more time on it without learning much or having too fun a time.Please note that the above review is also base on the price I paid. I'd think if the price drops below $50, I'd consider it a good toy (still not great). Otherwise, I suggest you look elsewhere.
