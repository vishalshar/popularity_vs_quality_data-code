Doesn't work as described. after playing with this, trying to get it to work, I'm not impressed. Like others have posted, you can see some vague outlines of objects within 200 ft. But they are blurry and past that its just a bunch of colors. I have to take myPelican iphone case off for it to work in my power port. The manual focus know is cheesy, loose. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend.
