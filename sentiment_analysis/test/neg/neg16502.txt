I enjoyed the product, for the week that it worked properly. After a week the reverse tap method that creates all the micro foam stopped working with any beer I tried. On top of that, Amazon refuses to replace the unit. I have to return it, get a refund, and repurchase it - the catch is the only units available that are fulfilled by Amazon are twice the price I originally paid. What a joke.
