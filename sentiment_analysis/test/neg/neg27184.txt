I found the Android app (AnyMote Smart Remote) first and tried it out with the Echo/Alexa for controlling my TV... I liked it well enough, that I thought this would even be better....The problem is, you have to have your smart phone always part of the setup, it is the tether/pass through/hub... If your phone is not home, you can't use it.  So I need another smart phone to make this work...  If you disable the Bluetooth on the phone (to save battery), you can't use the app.  You have to have location services turned on to use this (they blame it on google since it is going over Bluetooth - somehow my other Bluetooth devices don't require this???).The voice integration is hit and miss.  You have to setup the thing right and makes sure the devices are named.  Then you have to remember the correct syntax.  I also have a roku, that is supposedly usable over wifi and I couldn't figure out any of the voice commands and there is no advice on their web site.  I will probably only use this if I buy a cheap android phone to have in the room to act as a hub.***Setup Tips***Their web setup page is not very intuitive to navigate.1.  The app is called "Anymote Smart Remote" Play Store - The instructions imply that it is called Anymote Home.2.  Under the app, to add this you need to configure it as an "IR BLASTER" Under Settings with the blue tooth enable - completely not intuitive.3.  Once you connect to it, the firmware then needs to update.  It took about 10 minutes.4.  Then you assign the IR Blaster a name - For example "Bill"5.  You can then add a TV or other device.  You need to pick where the signal goes through.  1) The phone's built in IR Blaster/sensor or 2) The Anymote named "Bill" or  Whatever name you have called it.6.  You can name the device - "TV".7.  You enable Alexa Integration by searching under "Skills" in the Alexa App for "Anymote"
