I order this product 6 months ago and I saw the reviews and it seemed amazing and so I ordered it and I got it long ago. I just found the product in the shipping bag in my drawer not open and I opened it brand new and I realize I can't even use this because the tip of the USB is bent so it won't fit in a USB drive. I don't recommend this unless they replace mine and then it works
