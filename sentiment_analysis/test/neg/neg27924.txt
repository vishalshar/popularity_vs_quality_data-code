It just never worked. I purchased it to keep in my bag for the day it would be needed (which isn't often). It never worked, as in never. A small light comes on indicating it's being powered by the computer, however, no media or cable connected to / through it works.Well done Juiced Systems. Great quality control in delivering a product that doesn't work.
