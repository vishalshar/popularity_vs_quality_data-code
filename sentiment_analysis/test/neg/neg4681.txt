I bought thinking it would be easy to fly and not to much of a hassle to take on my hikes. I received on March 31st. Flew it for the first time on April 2nd. Used my android phone to connect to the G-Box and the Ghost 2.0. As soon as it took off during its firs take off, it flew into an upside down U shape and right in to the ground snapping one of the guards and propellers. Took all the Guards off and replace one of the propellers with one of the eight that was in the package. Decided to try it one more time. Everything is connected properly. Settings are set to take off and hover at 10 meters(33ft). I press take off and it goes straight to around 300ft and hovers. I press return, no response. I press Land no response. I press it two more times before I get a response and it starts to descend. But before it fully descends, it stops at 240ft and goes right back up to 300ft and higher. It does this about two to three times more. Then on my third/fourth try it finally descend below 240 ft with about 68% battery life remaining. As it starts to descend at around 175-200ft. Somewhere around there the motors just shuts off. By the time I realized it was free falling to the ground, it was too late. Did a lot researching and read a lot of reviews. Got a lot of positives about it, so I gave it a try. To be honest, I am really disappointed in this product. I tried calling the USA help line twice. No connection the first time. Waited 10 mins called again, got the voicemail, left a message. Haven't received a call back yet. it has been over 24 hours.  I am returning my product for a full refund. From my poor experience, I do not recommend this quad copters. There are much better options out there. I personally owned a Walkera QR X350 Pro and a DJI Phantom 2. Never had problems like this with either. I will stick with those two brands.
