I'm an experienced consumer electronics and android software developer.  And the setup process for this camera was the most frustrating I've ever experienced.  I never succeeded in getting the camera to connect to my wifi network (even though the AP is about 8' away through a mere wood wall).  Repeated tries resulted in unhelpful messages from the app and the android app itself hung twice.At that point I decided I no longer had confidence in the product.  It is unfortunate because the industrial design and hardware seems great.  It seems that their software just isn't ready yet.
