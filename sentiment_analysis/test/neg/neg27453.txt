This product is worse than a cheap knock-off.The package arrived at my door looking a lot like an explosive device: a cardboard box, wrapped in black plastic and completely covered, I mean EVERY SQUARE INCH of it, in shipping tape.  The package smelled so bad that I took it back outside to unbox it and left the individual games (I ordered multiple games as office party gifts) outside to air out.Many of the individual game boxes were crushed on one corner or end... not very appealing for a gift.  Even though I had not purchased one for myself, I decided that I better open one up.  I am glad that I did.  Some of the cards are misspelled.  Some of them make no sense, obviously translated incorrectly.  Many of the cards are duplicates and therefore unusable in the game.  (A photo of just a few examples of the cards is included with this review.)At least one game is missing important pieces.This is by far my worst online purchase ever.  Very disappointed.
