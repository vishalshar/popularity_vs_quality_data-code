The good - The LEAF by Bellabeat is so pretty! I wanted a fitness tracker that was more versatile to wear and looked nicer and this does just that! The breathing exercises in the app are a great idea as well.The bad - Very inaccurate! Despite my app being up to date, the LEAF just did not pick up all my steps (I kept wearing my FitBit Charge along with the LEAF to test accuracy). Every day, it was off by thousands of steps. I tried wearing it on my wrist, on my waistband, and clipped to my shirt with no luck. It also claimed that I was asleep while I was at work! I had my inactivity alarm set for every 1.5 hours, so there's no way I could've sat long enough for it to think I was sleeping.I wanted to love the LEAF and I gave it a good chance, but its inaccuracy was a big letdown. I hope that the Bellabeat team works to improve the accuracy of this tracker, as it's a wonderful concept.
