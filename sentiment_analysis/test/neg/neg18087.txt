The concept is good-- combo measuring cup built into the air-tight cover. Color coded with window near the base to see when your canister is getting low. Unfortunately the covers were SO tight I couldn't rotate them,which is necessary,  on any of the 4 I purchased. My husband couldn't twist them either so I had to return the whole lot.
