Recently 53 updated their software, Paper, to allow what they call Surface Pressure. First there is not pressure sensitivity, the name is misleading. With iOS 8 and the updated Paper what this means is you are supposed to be able to tilt Pencil to use its broad side to create broad lines as if there were pressure sensitivity. It looks great in the video and it was the reason I bought Pencil. The problem is the bluetooth connection has to be bluetooth LE. Turns out iPad 2 does not use this bluetooth technology. It uses an older bluetooth, understandably. My complaint is that nowhere on the 53 website did I see this important technical specification. For such a detail oriented company I was surprised at this omission and it cost me $50. (I made my purchase more than 30 days ago so I cannot return it ). So buyer beware.
