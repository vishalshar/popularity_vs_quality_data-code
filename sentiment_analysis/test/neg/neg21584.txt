For me the Portal router didn't work as advertised.  First some background info on the Portal router.The router's ace in the hole is its ability to tap into frequencies within the 5GHz spectrum called Fast Lanes (DFS - Dynamic Frequency Selection).  Normally these "Fast Lanes" are reserved for radar but the manufacturer of the Portal (Ignition Design Labs) has found a way to exit a "Fast Lane" when radar is detected and jump to another "Fast Lane".  So this highly desirable feature would be a godsend for those who are in close proximity to other routers which is the case if you live in an apartment or condo complex because the "Fast Lanes" would allow for much less congestion.But there are a couple of caveats.  1) Your devices need to be able to detect these "Fast Lanes".  In my case my LG OLED EG9100 and oppo BDP-103 do not and the popular Roku 3 also doesn't work these additional frequencies.  To know for sure what frequencies a particular device can detect you need to enter its FCC ID at this website: [...]2) Here's the rub for those devices that won't be able to utilize these "Fast Lanes", they only detect the 2.4 GHz band from the Portal router.  You would think you could still use the "traditional" 5GHz channels but that's not the case.  The Portal with a future firmware update will have a compatibility mode that will allow 5GHz non DFS devices to detect the 5GHz band BUT in this mode the "Fast Lanes" are disabled so none of your devices would be able to utilize the additional 5GHz bands.  Sort of a catch-22 situation.As for my experience with the router.  I wasn't as impressed with the esthetics of the Portal router as some media folks have been. The router is pretty light weight and the white casing on top is composed of a hard glossy plastic that will be prone to scratches.  But on the plus side all the antennas are hidden away.  Set up was as straight forward as possible - I did my though the web based app.As for performance, I wasn't able to connect to the 5GHz band with my DFS capable devices and channel 6 was selected on the 2.4 GHz band.  Unfortunately this particular channel is highly congested where I live.  This router is supposed to find the least congested channel even after the initial set up but that wasn't the case with me - it was "stuck" on channel 6.  And to make matters worse there is no way to force the Portal to use a less congested channel.  As a result performance was decidedly worse than the TP-Link Archer C9 router that the Portal was supposed to replace.Even with the caveats I mentioned earlier I was like a kid on Christmas day in anticipation of the Portal so with much frustration I returned it.
