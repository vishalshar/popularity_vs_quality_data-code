this is not as advertised. Cheap and a piece of crap. most of the time it never turns off, i have to pull a battery out to shut it down. when you push the lever the other way to create the head,it works maybe 30% of the time, usually just pours more beer just like when you pull the lever towards you......again, piece of plastic CRAP
