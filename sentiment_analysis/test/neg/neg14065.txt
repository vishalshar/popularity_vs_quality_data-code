I know I should have just stayed away. But the pretty colors of the IllumiBowl called to me. Plus, I was hoping to avoid nocturnal pee crust creation by my husband. Annnnnneeeeeway. My husband liked the idea of it. The colors were beautiful & enticing, but the darn thing petered (ha) out within the 2nd week. I'm considering sending it back, but I don't have the motivation. Buy it if you want, but I consider it disposable, like toilet paper.
