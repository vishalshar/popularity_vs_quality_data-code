I'm a big fan of World Peas' fava crisps and had been looking forward to trying this flavor. But after trying these, I don't think the ranch flavor tastes like ranch. Instead, it has a sour/bitter aftertaste that lingers in your mouth. I will be discarding these and instead will purchase the BBQ flavor, which is EXCELLENT.
