Everyone who feeds Great Life food knows there have been serious problems in recent months with distribution.  I was thrilled to see it back in stock at Amazon because it's the only dry dog food one of my Labs can eat due to her multiple sensitivities.  When I opened the most recent bag I noticed the individual pieces of food were much smaller than normal.  I thought it might be due to the sale of the company and new or different manufacturing processes, so I checked the bag.  What I found was the expiration date: 10/17/15.  This bag of food has been expired for over a year! Seriously, Amazon?I was forced to use it because anything else makes my girl sick but I am not happy about it.  Check the expiry date before using!  I am reordering because I have to have it but this will be the last time if I receive more expired product.
