I really wanted to love it. I have the shine2 (and love it) and was really excited to get the Ray. Unfortunately it only sync up to my app for 3 weeks. Now nothing.Also seems it's tracking is way off... a trail I take that is 6 miles, only registered as 2 with Ray. Super bummed. Design is beautiful.
