Purchased to attach to BC when diving. Unable to get good view unless aomeone helps adjust it to point straight. Even when you so, the camera angle will adjust upward once entering water. Nice concept, but will likely only use on back pack when mountain biking. Need to put extra padding behind plate or the screws will dig into your shoulder when riding.
