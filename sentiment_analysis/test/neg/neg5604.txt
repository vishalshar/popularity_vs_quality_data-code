UPDATE: So they did not launch the bridge and have stopped responding to my emails. They sent me the sensors that they had promised either. Right now this is a glorified remote control, nothing more without the Internet bridge... Revising my rating to 2 stars based on a good but incomplete concept alongwith poor customer service.Original review:It's a useful device that helps replace the garage remote control with your phone. I am looking forward to getting the bridge too so that I can remotely control the garage door. The device functions as advertised and I like it so far.
