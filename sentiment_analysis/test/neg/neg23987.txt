Well, where shall I start? I'm sure the people at Primal make a well intended product. I don't think for a second that they are trying to hoodwink consumers. It may be that my particular body chemistry conflicts with Primal's deodorant, but here are my impressions after about a week of use. The deodorant is very greasy. It goes on greasy and stays greasy until it wears off. There's no way to apply it without wasting some on your fingers. Then even after I wash my hands I still have a greasy residue. That said, I'd still have been happy if this deodorant actually deodorized. It does not. Well, it covers odor for about 3-4 hours. When it wears off I have a body odor so bad that I can smell myself. This is not good. It's like my body odor has fought back with a vengeance and won. Yes, you will smell without offense for a period, but when you stop smelling good, if you're like me, you will start smelling bad. I bought two jars of this pit peanut butter. Given it's viscosity, it might make a good personal lubricant. Just be careful where you apply it.
