UPDATE: I CANNOT recommend this product. I am reducing my 4 star rating to a 1 star rating. I have two base stations in two different states. Flight Risk got out a couple of weeks ago both base stations said she was in Florida when she was in Indiana. I unplugged the Indiana base station AND reset the the Indiana whistle zone AND uninstalled and reinstalled the phone app AND tried tracking her by both laptop and app AND made sure I was tracking her on the Indiana base station (although that shouldn't matter - the only reason to have two base stations is to charge the unit when I am at either house), but by then someone had contacted me using the Dynotag barcode that they found my dog (this was after I had been out looking for her for about an hour) and she was back at home. At that point it showed her at home in Indiana - but I already knew that. This morning she got out again, and the tracker says she is inside her Indiana whistle zone. She is not. Again I have rebooted the base station, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, etc.. Battery is at 71%. It is so very frustrating because sometimes (not always) I take her for a walk it notifies me she is out of the whistle zone (and we take long walks). When I ship her back and forth between Florida and Indiana I am able to track her in transit. But now, twice, when I really need it to work, she might as well not be wearing it. Here, in Indiana, I live in an urban area. It is rush hour and I am near many busy streets, and I am helpless. And if I didn't say this in my previous review, updating the map when it does work only every 3 minutes is just too long a period - my dog can cover a lot of ground in that time and she can double back past me on the other side of any obstruction (e.g. a house) and when I get to where she was she is back to where I was - not helpful. WHEN it works it is accurate, but accuracy only matters if it functions consistently. Obviously with a dog nicknamed Flight Risk you understand why I want a GPS tracker. Today she defeated two doors and a fence gate to get out. I need a unit I can count on, and the Whistle GPS tracker is not it. I apologize to anyone who may have purchased this unit based on my previous recommendation.My dog's nickname is "Flight Risk." She is chipped and also wears a barcode tag (Dynotag, no battery limitation) to help when she makes a break for it, but I have had two occasions now to use my Whistle tracker. It has proved reliable and durable (including multiple excursions into salt water). Battery life is excellent - several days. Its location accuracy is very good. It is not a small unit and has some weight (see product description) that would, I think, make it unsuitable for a small dog (I suggest a barcode tag). It has what I consider to be a major drawback (hence my 4 star rating). The GPS only updates every 3 minutes. A Siberian Husky can cover a lot of ground in 3 minutes. I have two homes, one urban and one rural. In an urban environment she can move between houses which limit visibility, especially at night. While the tracker is accurate, because of the time lag she may have moved a significant distance OR just around to the other side of a house. Then you have to rely on things like the sound of her collar to zero in on her location. In the rural environment (Florida) brush limits visibility. By the time I move around the brush, she can be hundreds of feet away. Again I am listening to zero in on her location - if I am close enough. I give it 4 stars for its durability, battery life, and location accuracy, but withhold the 5th star because 3 minutes is a life time if you are tracking a fast moving dog. Sometimes I start moving to where she "is" only to find that when I get there she is back where I "was."  I realize real time location is asking too much, but 3 minutes is forever when you have a dog that can easily move half a mile in that time. That might be ok if visibility is not an issue, but not in the two environments I use it. I think it is a good product, but it would be a great product if it could update every minute. On a separate note, I had to resolve a technical issue and the customer service was excellent (although conducted via e-mail which might be too slow in certain circumstances - maybe there are quicker means but my problem was not urgent). Nonetheless it is very reasonably priced for what you get, and given my dog's ability to plan escape routes and run without fatigue - basically forever, I feel much better having this tracker. If your dog is not an escape artist, you may consider a barcode tag that can offer someone who finds your dog a wealth of information at a much lower cost to you (and actually has some location capability) without having to worry about battery life (although again the Whistle Tracker has great battery life).
