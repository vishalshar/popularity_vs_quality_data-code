Awful product. A lot of useless notifications related to social media but when it comes down to the actual GPS tracking technology - the device just does not work. I take my dog in the car and drive around populated areas (NYC) and get a notification an hour after he leaves his Whistle Zone! Sometimes I am 25-40 miles away from the whistle zone when I get the notification.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Try to find something else that has a better GPS technology.
