Good idea, poor execution in the product I got. I've asked for a replacement and Amazon is providing one no charge by exchange - i.e., they are shipping immediately and I will receive replacement day after tomorrow; I have to ship my defective product back at my convenience within a month (but will ship it today so I don't forget).  This is one reason why I keep buying at Amazon.  The device is not yet as cheap as I expect they will become, since this is a 'first' regarding FDA approved EKG for this configuration (they say).The two sensors are a bit more than 1" square each, on a bit of black plastic that holds a battery and circuitry.  This piece comes in a 1/16" larger black plastic mounting case into which it can securely snap and which has a contact adhesive on the back, if you want to affix it to your $1000 smart phone.  Didn't think so, but it is there.Software installation was easy.  You will need to download a free app (I have a Nexus 5, so I downloaded "Kardia" from PlayStore; they have a paid version for $1.99, and other paid products and additional services to help relieve you of your consumer cash surplus).However you may want to think VERY carefully about saying yes to giving away your privacy regarding your health status. We still live in a country where it is considered good business and 'smart' to use any data including health data to make a profit, and in particular,  This company will NOT promise to never use your own health data for their benefit instead of yours, if you read the fine print, so go into this with eyes open.  >>> You have to give them a copy of a tracing before they even unlock the app <<< - ostensibly so they can confirm it is working OK.  (Not a bad idea for a company to do QC for health devices - but totally a bummer if/when companies keep/share the confidential data, or sell your arrhythmia data to employers or insurers!)  This is not only unethical, it should be criminal and rigorously policed, but our government is substantially in the pocket of medical insurers who love to know and profit from your health secrets, at your expense.  If they do that.  Read the fine print online in the privacy statement and just see if you are OK with what they don't say they will never do with YOUR personally identified and economically sensitive health data.  Which is your property until you give it away.  Thereafter it is never yours again.  But since you are a smart phone user you doubtless are oblivious to such concerns, and press "I agree" with your eyes closed, on a weekly basis.HOWEVER, the product has a guest mode, so you CAN use it on people who are 'not identified' to Amazon or Kardia, with possibly less risk (at least, this is true for most people as of mid 2016; but DO remember that an EKG is a biometric that can be used in a restricted scope of people for unique identification, and that, unlike passwords and user IDs, biometrics are irrevocable.).For the product I recieved, the communication link between sensor and smartphone was very weak; I drew this conclusion after making the following attempts to make the application work:  I tried literally hundreds of placements of sensor against Nexus 5, variations in finger placements on sensors, applied sensors directly to precordium (chest wall), and still got only 5 or so 30 second readings in 2 hours of attempts with two persons.Most readings dropped in less than 5 seconds and started over within a few seconds.  Initial signal strength readings were 4-5 bars, but almost invariably dropped to 1 bar within 5 seconds.  This seemed potentially like a battery power issue, so I bought a new lithium CR2016BP button battery for it (with use by March 2024 shelf expiration date), and perhaps it made an improvement, or perhaps I was just getting slightly better at finding a combination of pressure, placement, and stillness that worked.  My Nexus 5 was fully charged and has a new/great battery.  The few times it worked, it worked well and displayed a single lead normal 56 bpm sinus rhythm with tight QRS and good sized T, which it diagnosed as normal sinus rhythm; for me the P was visible but small (using fingers on sensors; perhaps different placements on chest might produce a larger P); for a 87 bpm 'guest' user the Ps were totally lost in the noise, even after the enhancement (smoothing function) ... but it is also possible this guest user has an atrial multi-focal pace confusing things a bit.However the idea is great, the form factor is great, the convenience great, IF it works... and I'm sure it can be made to work by this company or another, soon.  The big issue that I see, is that one should never use such online / cloud tools with identifiable and sensitive health data (PII), unless one has an ironclad guarantee in plain english that your sensitive and identifiable health data will NEVER be shared with anyone. Period.  And that, if they DO ever have a use case where it is in the PUBLIC interest to possibly share one of your EKGs, they will come back to you at that time for your informed consent, after having presented their purpose to an IRB and received formal ethical approvals for human subjects research.I DO read most of the privacy agreements as a matter of professional interest, but more and more there are few that protect the user's interest; most such policies were written in the light of the knowledge that over time, information businesses make their money by using and reselling behavioral and other information you give them, and so, increasingly, these policies are written to try to reassure you while they take everything they can.  I would not have agreed to use this product if I suspected I had an abnormal EKG, or was running for office, etc, since I pay for my health insurance and buy my own life insurance, and nothing in the cloud that is of high value to industry or governments remains private for a long time.  The rate and size of health data breaches grows every year, and is growing faster than other sectors.  Use this and other similar products (like fitness apps) with your eyes wide open, and only after you've studied the permissions settings on your smart phone, and the privacy agreements/policies for each of your apps (since your apps often share data with each other).But I'm a doc and I like cool/useful technology, and if they give me a WORKING replacement version of this device, I'll increase my assessment.If you found this review helpful, please indicate this, and I'll be more apt to continue to make the effort to share my experiences.  B^)  Thanks!
