While I like the concept and design, the magnets are not nearly strong enough to hold an iPhone 6+ when using a case. I tried 3 different cases that I have, placing the metal square inside as shown in their videos but a modest vibration releases the phone. I also tried this with a slightly smaller phone - my wife's HTC one, but with similar results. I contacted the seller and asked if the adhesive on the metal plate would stick to the exterior of a plastic/rubber case. They stated it would, but it did not stick - at all. The reason I gave it 2 stars vs 1, is the design is clever, but the implementation with these magnets is flawed.I was going to return it - but then I discovered this is not the usual free shipping return via Amazon. Hopefully, the USPS return postage will not make it impractical to return.
