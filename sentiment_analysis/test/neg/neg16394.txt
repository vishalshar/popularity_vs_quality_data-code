I would not recommend this product to anyone. When I first came across this on Amazon, I was like "Oh cool" and bought it. After about 2 days into using this product, it locked me out of my own computer! It continued to do this until I deleted the app and removed the USB and everything else. Believe the past reviews, and at $60, I would expect better quality and not such "Cheap" engineering. I would not recommend this product to anyone, and I recommend you buy something else on Amazon.I wish this product would've worked, but unfortunately, it didn't.
