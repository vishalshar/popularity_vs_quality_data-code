The drive is fast, without question. The problem with the drive is the dependability. I bought it to host a VM, as I was running out of space locally and my old passport drive was too slow for I/O to run the vm. I plugged this drive in and copied the VM over. Unfortunately, not before realizing that this SSD drive occasionally decides to unmount itself- every 10 minutes or so, it's as if I've unplugged it. I hear the USB disconnect sound in windows, I see the drive disappear from explorer. It comes back on its own after a few minutes.I've tried different ports and different machines with the same result. If you need quick file copy access, this is a great drive. If you need it for interactive work, I'd suggest a different drive.UPDATE 201/11/16:Today, it has stopped being recognized. I see the light, and windows attempts to mount, but the best result I have today is "The drive must be formatted". Downgrading :(
