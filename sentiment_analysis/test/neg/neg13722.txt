My cat won't touch this stuff.  Tried to get him to eat it - but he won't.  Just wasted $25 as they don't let me return it...bad part of using Amazon for pet food.  My cat LOVES Primal freeze dried turkey and is 'okay' with Stella and Chewy Duck & Turkey options (in case readers want good options for picky cats).  This one is a big NADA.
