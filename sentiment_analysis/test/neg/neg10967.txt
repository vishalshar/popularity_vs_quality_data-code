Purchased two of these one for myself and one for my wife - hers stopped working after 3 days (would not turn on with a full battery)  mine works but not all the time  it loses the data and time mid day and fails to sync half the time.  If one had failed, that could be just a defective unit but both clearly indicate a poor quality product.  You get what you pay for  next time I will spend a little more for something that works.
