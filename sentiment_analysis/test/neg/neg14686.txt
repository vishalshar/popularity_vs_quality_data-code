Not a strong microwave - things have to cook for a lot longer than I thought they would. Also, the buttons are covered by this cheap plastic covering and after just a few weeks of using the microwave MAYBE once or twice a day, the plastic is already wearing out and beginning to break down. I can already see where this is going... within a few months, the plastic is going to just be broken, and I won't be able to see those numbers. If you want a cheap microwave, get this one - I should have known that you get what you pay for.
