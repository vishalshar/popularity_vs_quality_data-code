Sphere arrived with one tiny sheet of instructions, whereas Dino shape ones get a whole booklet.  I had to download a full set of instructions, but only after my son set it up and had so many questions about what to expect, how much to feed it, what on-going care should be, etc.It appears as if the company mails you a sphere and then separately sends you Dino food (refill bag) and Dinos, so you don't receive an actual kit, so to speak, as you would if you ordered the Dino shape.So if you buy this, download the instructions (ahead of time, since timing is important when they arrive), and then watch YouTube videos, which also help.  That being said, they grew well and after 2 weeks, the appearance is quite nice.  Although the glowing doesn't last more than a few seconds after the shaking stops. My son had hoped that the glow would last a long time.
