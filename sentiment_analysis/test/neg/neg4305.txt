I love the idea but I experienced a few problems.  It connected to the app just fine but I wasn't receiving any notifications - even when I was super stressed and knew my breathing was tense - nothing.  The main reason I wanted it was to pull me out of those stressful moments before becoming overwhelmed.  I also didn't like the guided meditations that are with the app.  I've been using Headspace for meditation and it is WAY better so I don't see myself using the meditations that come with Spire.  I need to have my phone with me for it to work.  I thought without my phone it would vibrate when I'm stressed or I need to take a breath but it appears to need my phone.  Also, I don't take my phone with me when I'm running/walking so the step counting thing isn't going to work. I could have lived with a few of these problems (esp as the app is improved) but the real deal breaker was that I found it uncomfortable.  I tried both waist and bra- at first I didn't notice it but after an hour or so I started to get a dull ache. I don't think I could comfortably wear it for an entire day.
