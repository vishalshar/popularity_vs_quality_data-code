Bought this to use in our camper.  Tried it out soon after delivery and found it satisfactory.  Went camping a few weeks later, machine was useless.Filled with water and unit brewed 1 cup of coffee, but would not work for a 2nd cup.  Light would rapid flash and unit would not operate.  Unplugged, refilled, unplugged etc.  Unit would not brew a 2nd cup until trying it the next day.  Even then, only one cup would brew.
