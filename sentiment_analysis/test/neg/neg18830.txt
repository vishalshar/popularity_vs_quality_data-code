I was soooooooo disappointed. After reading the reviews I thought it would work but it didn't. I sprayed it close...didn't work, I sprayed it couple of inches from my hair, the fiber was all over my face and t-shirt. I'm using my fingers to put the fibers in my hair. Not good at all. I wanted to give it one star, the only reason I didn't is because I used my finger to put this product in which I shouldn't have to do. Not good, not good at all!
