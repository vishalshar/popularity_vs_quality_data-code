Disappointed. Within a few weeks of use, one of the parts holding the latch fell out and now the lid won't close. My daughter only used it for 4 weeks before this happened. You would think the manufacturers would have made it a little more robust with less tiny fixings that come loose when making a product for little kids. Considering how much I paid for this, I'm seriously unimpressed.
