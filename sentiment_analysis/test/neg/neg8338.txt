Not worth the money.  I recommend just buying child's crayons that you can write on glass with (Crayola makes some) and using a window or mirror as your writing surface.  This was too difficult to get down smoothly, wasn't truly clear, and was impossible to reuse after moving.  It lasted a couple of days then went in the trash.
