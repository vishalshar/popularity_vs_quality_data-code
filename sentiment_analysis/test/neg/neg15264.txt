This product is immature, and not ready for prime time.  Furthermore, it does not work as ADVERTISED.  28'?  NOT... this thing barely works past 4 feet.  I've tried it in multiple locations multiple directions and the claim that it works 8' x 360deg and has three points that reach 28' is a LIE.  Also, there is absolutely no marking showing the directions... at all!!!  You have to sort of judge by the lighted logo on the top, and instructions in the app... which turns off after 1 minute, so making periodic adjustments towards perfection is impossible.  Also, it is very height sensitive.  If there is a big spread in height between multiple receivers, it can't hit both.  I had to add an IR Extender so it could see BOTH my TV & DVR... whose receivers are about 2 feet apart in height. It runs on 2 AA batteries... really?  not chargeable??? Furthermore, the app itself is BUGGY BUGGY BUGGY and DOES NOT DO WHAT IT CLAIMS.  It has my remotes, but is missing buttons??? For example, it can control my Channel Master DVR but has no FFW or RWD??  So, no matter what, I have to have my normal remote on hand.  It does not work AT ALL with google voice.  I mainly got this so I could integrate with Amazon ECHO and IFTTT to at least power on / off, pause, play, etc. via Echo.  DOESN'T WORK.  With IFTTT it just works for a little while, then any change you make it stops working.  If you enter the notifications section, it locks a blank notification on your phone and you can't get rid of it.  They chose the trigger phrase, "Alexa, ask anymote to..."  except Anymote ISN'T A WORD.  Alexa RARELY recognizes it and usually responds with "Adding Milk to your shopping list" or "can't find 'anymore' in your music library".  I noticed that today (christmas day) as everyone in America is opening and training their brand new Echo's, the training is down... which makes it EVEN LESS RELIABLE using AnyMote.  It still works for ALL MY OTHER DEVICES (Nest via IFTTT, Phillips HUE via native echo + IFTTT, WeMo switches and outlets via native echo).  The IR stream is also buggy as heck.  If you set up macros to do multiple things at once (like create a single button that toggles BOTH TV & DVR), if you don't have the perfect delay inserted between commands, they just over run each other, and often, when you have it right, they still just don't work half the time.  If you're dreaming of a fully voice driven smart home, this product in conjunction with the app is not mature enough.  It just doesn't work, and the developers needed to spend a few more years on this before unleashing it on the market.  As for me, I'm looking at other IR blasters here on Amazon, and chalking this one up to a bad purchase.  Also, if you've read this, and gotten some idea that I am an intelligent, tech savvy person, then you should also realize how unworkable this device must be for me to give up on it.
