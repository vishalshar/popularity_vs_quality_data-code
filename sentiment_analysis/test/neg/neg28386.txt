Don't waste your money. The balls slowly roll out and don't go very far.  I have small dogs, Dachshunds, and the balls are so small one of them almost choked on one, so I can't imagine how these would be safe for larger dogs. They are hazardous , you cannot use a different ball. The holes on the IFetch are made just to use the balls included. I returned mine.
