I could excuse the fact that they aren't as loud as the wired contetpart due to such a light weight devices needing to power the driver in the headphone, but it promises distance. I have had it cut in and out having my paired device in my pocket. I hated that. I like to longboard without cords but it would get crackly, making me want the cord. 4.5 stars if this wasn't an issue.
