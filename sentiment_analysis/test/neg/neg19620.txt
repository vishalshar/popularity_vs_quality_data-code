I dont write reviews often, but this one deserves one. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews. In a 4 hours period I was able to unlock it only 4 times....technically 1 hour for one unlock. I installed uninstalled the app, i reset the app, i cleared cache, and nothing worked. The quick clicks wouldnt work either. I would recieve a green unlock blink but the lock itself would remain locked. Furthermore the battery indicator was low from the start. The lights all worked, just the lock wouldnt unlock. It would after a long time of working at it. I replaced the battery to see if it was that but the lock behaved just the same. Do not recommend as the reviews of its reliability is true.
