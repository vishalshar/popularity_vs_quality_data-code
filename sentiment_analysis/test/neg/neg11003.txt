This stuff works as advertised, but you better use it fast. Mine still has 3 months left before expiration and its all dried up.I didn't see the note on the inside packaging that tells you to put it in the refrigerator to keep it pliable longer until it was too late. But if the expiration date says it has 3 months to go it should still be usable.
