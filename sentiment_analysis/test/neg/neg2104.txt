This product looked like great fun for my mushroom-loving 10 year-old.  We opened the box and found many dried up mushrooms and a broken internal bag.  We emailed customer service. We were told that they mushrooms were just eager to grow and that we should still get a good crop.  Well, we followed the directions exactly and harvested exactly one mushroom.So, we tried again on the other side, again following the directions exactly.  This time we have zero growth after 4 weeks.  My 10 year-old is very disappointed as he looked forward to growing mushrooms for our family.I wonder if we hadn't had the pre-growth and the busted bag if we would have been able to harvest a good crop.  I wish the company would have sent a new box rather than telling us to try and get a crop out of this one.
