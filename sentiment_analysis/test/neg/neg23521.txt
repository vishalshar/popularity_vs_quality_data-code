Got my petcube. I've been waiting to buy one for months. So excited. Took it out of the package, and set it on the shelf. The setup was incredibly easy. Everything went smoothly. Click to view my camera - app force closes. Tried it on my other android phone, force closes. Tried it on my android tablet, force closes. Tried it on iPhone, crashes. Unplugged, plugged in, unplugged, re-setup, set ports in router, disabled firewall completely, reset again, rinse, repeat, etc. Force closes app. I can watch other cameras all day, but mine? Force closes immediately.  Now I'm waiting to hear about getting a refund.
