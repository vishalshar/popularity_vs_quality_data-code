They are nice and soft.  Thickness is good, but I would like them a little thicker.  I wear a 14EE shoe and the large socks fit me fine.  They could probably ditch the overly fancy box they come in and drop the price of the socks.  I would order them again.Update:  They won't stay up when I wear them, so I don't wear them anymore.
