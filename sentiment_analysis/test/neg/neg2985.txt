The performance is great, but sometimes I am unable to log into the laptop. When the password field appears, it starts auto populating with * characters uncontrollably. The only "solution" so far is a hard reboot. I clicked on the password reveal icon and sometimes it's "0"s, at other times it's space character. Either multiple keys are getting stuck or there's a problem with the internal keyboard. I am thinking of returning it.
