Blossom is not great at customer service. Also, there were a lot of issues with the app and needing updates for important features.  The best deal about this is we can turn the sprinklers off from our phone, other than that...not impressive. It almost killed our lawn in the beginning because it wouldn't turn on because it was raining in our city (even though it never rained at our house)
