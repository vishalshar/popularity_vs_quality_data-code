At first I loved this case, during the day while I was at school I would use my phone and go down to 20%, so I would turn on the thincharge before I went to work and by the time I got off my phone would be at 100%. But now about 3 days into having the case, the case stopped charging. I will plug it in and it will continue to blink red three times(meaning it is >1%). I tried just charging the case to no prevail. I did not beat on this case, I never got any water into the charging port. For this reason alone I advise you not to get this case, if you are anything like me and normally don't spend more than $10 on a case, spending $60 on a case just for it to stop working a couple days after receiving it is frustrating.
