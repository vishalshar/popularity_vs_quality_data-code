This bag was nearly confiscated 3 times traveling overseas and I have been pulled out after security screening almost every time even in the States. Traveling between China and Korea, as well as within China I was asked to show the battery. Since I was unable to remove the battery for them to see I ended up being questioned by security officers three times. Each time the said they were going to keep the bag but ultimately when they were able to get a more senior officer who spoke English I was able to keep the bag. Security took me more than 30 minutes and I missed one flight. Even in the States I had to step out while the bag was checked for explosive residue after the X-ray screening. I will never carry the bag again.
