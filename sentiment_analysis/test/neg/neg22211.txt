If you're short on time the 'bottom line' of my review is this: BUYER BEWARE. I wouldn't purchase this had I known.I don't like submitting negative product reviews for 'start up' companies because I sincerely support up-and-coming businesses and when I see an idea I like I am more than happy to invest/try out the product. I was SO excited for garageio. I watched the company's video, liked the product, the people, etc. Now I'm just frustrated. After spending about an hour trying to get the "black box" to merely connect to my network (this is step 4 of about 20 steps...step one and two are basically 'plug in the black box...') I have given up (they say it 'takes 15 min., some masking tape, and a ladder' to install...I have all of the aforementioned, plus a law degree and IT experience, but apparently that's still insufficient).Regardless I hopoed garageio had worked because it's a great idea.Unfortunately, my experience is that the information advertised by the company is false/misleading. I have wasted enough time trying to (unsuccessfully) set it up to my network (not to mention the actual garage-door wiring...15 minutes???), then writing this review (see above: BUYER BEWARE), and now I have to package up what seems like 100 little pieces into this tiny little box and send it back to Amazon/Garageio...just to wait for my refund.However, I rely on other consumers' reviews when I purchase a product so I think it's fair. This product is just horrible. From what I read, it's still in 'beta' but they don't tell you that. I have been struggling with mine for about an hour in order to get it to connect to my network (with which I am pretty familiar/saavy).
