The battery pack stopped connecting to the phone after 1 month of having it.  Therefore, I was unable to use it to charge the phone.  This was also after I already returned the first one that did not work at all from the very beginning.  I love the concept, but it just doesn't work.  I never like to write bad reviews, but now I am out $100 after having an item for 5 weeks and I cannot return it.  DON'T BUY THIS ITEM.
