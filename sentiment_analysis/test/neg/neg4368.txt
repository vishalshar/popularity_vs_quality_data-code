not very good tool in any way.  It blows out all the soap you add into in a matter of minutes.  I went back and researched it to make sure i did not do something wrong but I followed the directions..  turn it on and in a matter of two minutes all soap is gone and I am just spraying water.  This whole brush hero line is borderline worthless.  Save your money and buy something else.
