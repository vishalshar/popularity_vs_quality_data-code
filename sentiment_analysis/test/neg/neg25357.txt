I will be returning this product. I bought it for piece of mind (expensive piece of mind) but Canary has been so unreliable in the almost 4 weeks I've had it. I was really happy when I first got it and when it worked it was wonderful. However it's gone downhill from that first week and even more so when my free subscription to Canary Premium expired. Since then I haven't gotten any detections except for when I stand in front of it for a while. Before, Canary would turn on as soon as it heard me open my front door. Or it would turn on with my alarm clock in the morning or when I turned the bathroom light on. Now I get basically nothing,whether it's armed or disarmed it's extremely unreliable.The video play back on the app sucks too. If you want to skip ahead it won't let you, it just starts over from the beginning and you have to sit and wait for the whole video to play second by second.I really wanted this to work out. The video and audio quality is wonderful and the night vision mode is the best I have seen. I also really like the design of the device but it just doesn't work for me.
