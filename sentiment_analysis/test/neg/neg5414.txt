Do not buy this product. The antennas are extremely poor and susceptible to tiniest of magnetic fields. I flew it in total 3 times, all 3 times the controller kept disconnecting. The third time it got carried away all by itself, and I lost it. I tracked down the location where it said it was, but it wasn't there. Highly disappointed.
