Now I know why this stuff is called "Pasta"...it's as brittle as pasta.  I made several efforts to transfer it to a spool that was compatible with my printer.  If bent even a little, it will snap like a piece of raw angel hair pasta.  I had to revert to leaving it in a spool-less coil next to my printer and let it self-feed.  No luck, as it snapped when it fed into my extruder.  In order to print ANYTHING, I would have to sit by my printer and hold it delicately and guide it perfectly into my extruder.  Terrible stuff.
