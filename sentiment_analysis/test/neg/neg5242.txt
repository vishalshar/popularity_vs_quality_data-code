I really wanted to like it, but it just fails at too many points:1. A single point IR blaster to control multiple devices in different locations in a room is always going to have a hard time succeeding consistently and Anymote frequently fails to communicate.2. The most disappointing thing was the Alexa integration. It is technically possible to make it work with Alexa and I succeeded in making that happen BUT the remotes are not properly set up for that integration (e.g. the power/arrow/etc buttons have no equivalent name to speak) and perhaps worse is the syntax: "Alexa ask ANYMOTE to DO WHATEVER on REMOTE NAME". You have to know the remote name and what the button is called. It's clunky and faster to just find the remote.3. I tried to teach it to work with my light switch but it's learning functions were so glitchy I gave up.4. I decided to use it without Alexa because I liked the macro functions, but they were so unreliable it wasn't worth keeping it.So I returned it.I can see how it might be possible to get it to work for you but your setup needs to be just right and you will need a huge amount of patience to get everything working.I hate dissing a startup that is trying to create a really useful product and I could see how a future version might work, but this one sadly does not.
