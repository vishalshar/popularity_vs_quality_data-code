This is a wonderful little product and appears to be well made. It's well-thought-out, with the three USP 3.0, a microSD, and a SD card ports. But, as a number of other reviewers have reported, it loses connectivity. Even without the computer being moved at all, connection to external storage is intermittent. That moves the rating from great, to almost useless. It's a pity.
