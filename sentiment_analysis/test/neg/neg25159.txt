Doesn't fit well with larger backpack straps. For me it was extremely hard to mount this to a backpacking backpack (aether 60) and there were few few positions it would work in which caused great discomfort against my shoulder due to its location. Probably great on lighter packs or for different sports, just not for backpacking using a multiday pack weighing 40 pounds.
