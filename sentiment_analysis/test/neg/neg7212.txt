It basically does what it's supposed to but it has one FATAL flaw, which is that the little magnetic piece does not stick well to the lid of the Scoopfree.  The metal is very thin, maybe there's just not enough there for the magnets to really grab and hold in place??In my case, this plastic strip fell off in the litter area, and got caught by the rake, which dragged it around and ended up breaking 2 tines off of the rake!!!  In looking back now (should have done before!) through the initial few reviews, several customers have complained about this piece just falling off, I guess they were lucky and it did not ruin the machine.  I have 2 Scoopfree boxes and this one was out of warranty so I guess I'm screwed.  I have the Litterworks version of the plastic tray on my other one and now looking at the metal piece it's twice as thick and has never fallen off.  Petsafe should be able to fix this pretty easily but until they do I would not recommend this tray even though typically I prefer to buy "real deal" accessories as I work under the assumption that they have all the specs and engineers to do it right.On a positive note, it is nice that they include the free bag of litter, but that does not make up for my $129 loss.  :(
