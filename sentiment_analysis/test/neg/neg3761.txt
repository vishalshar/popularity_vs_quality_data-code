They work good if you load your music on it and don't use the Bluetooth but I still had the right side go out and not play music but the left side was still working fine.  Every now and then the right side would come back on and stay. The fit is not great for the right side would not stay in an it did not matter what adapter you used.Then this happened, I got them back in September and now all they are good for are ear plugs for one of the pins came out on the right ear pice and now it will not charge(see photos below)
