This is an update to my original postoriginal postit works when you need it to. just like a iPhone..apple should sell this in their stores. i know its expensive for a little cable. but it works when you need it too, no matter how bumpy the ride is, especially in a jeep.update*it finally broke. the lighting snapped in half. Honestly I thought nomad would be a quality product, but it broke just like a cheap plastic.
