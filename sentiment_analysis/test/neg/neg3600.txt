Disappointed with so many aspects of this game.  First,  when it arrived,  the packaging was shredded and the box of the game itself was crushed and torn like it had been run over by a car a few times. I opened the box to see if the cards and mouthpieces were damaged but they seemed to be fine.  However, when I had some friends over to play the game we noticed several things were wrong.  First,  the cards had many,  many duplicate phrases. It's as though they just reprinted the same cards over and over again to make it look like a full deck. So when we played,  we would pull a card and it would be exactly the same phrase someone else had just said.  This doesn't exactly make the game very challenging.  Second,  some of the words on various cards were misspelled or incorrect making things very confusing when trying to play.  For example,  the word basketball was spelled "baskherball" on one of the phrases on the card and since there were duplicates of this card,  it meant that it was misspelled on several cards.  Another example,  the word returned  was spelled as "returner". There were other incorrect words as well.  One would think that the makers of this game would perform better quality control and proofread the phrases before printing the cards and selling the game.Overall,  I'm very dissatisfied with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.  The only positive thing I can say is that the dental mouthpieces worked as they should.  This is the only reason I gave this product one star.
