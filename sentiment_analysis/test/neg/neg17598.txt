This pump is very cumbersome on the hair fibers container and, I find it's difficult to hold and use.  I some times have to use 2 hands, 1 to hold the container and the other to push on the pump.  Its very awkward to hold. It just doesn't work properly. Sometimes it gets stuck, no fibers come out. I would not purchase the pump at all.
