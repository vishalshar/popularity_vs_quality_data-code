The setup was somewhat simple until it tried to link to myDlink home account.  Then the iPhone app crashed and would not open again. Tried accessing the device over mydlink.com and told me that the device needed new firmware - which I attempted to install 3 times and they all failed.  When I attempted to install manually the link took me to the Taiwan D-Link website.  I called support and their only suggestion was to reset my iPhone and try again. I don't think that's the solution and they should dig into their code and solve the problems before wide release.  Returning today.
