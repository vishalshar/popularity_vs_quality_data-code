It's a real shame. The band overall seems a really good construction but there are so many oversights in the sizing that make it uncomfortable and near impossible to get it to fit right unless you have a wrist EXACTLY the right thickness for one of their massive notches. And don't forget you will need enough left over of the strap to lock down the strap into the pegging system they provide.Really too bad because I like the construction of the product but what is the point of a new watchband that you can't adjust to fit properly.
