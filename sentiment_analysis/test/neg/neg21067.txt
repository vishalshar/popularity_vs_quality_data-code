I am quite unhappy with this purchase.  I received a 5" antler despite reading that the average is at the very least an inch longer than that.  The antler also is a bit thinner than I usually purchase.  I gave it 2 stars because it does appear to be an actual Elk Antler and regardless, my dog will enjoy it.
