It is not the fault of the product, but I obviously misread something.  The vitamins are made to take multiple times a day. They we gummy, chewable, sugary & too many calories per pill.  They did not taste bad, just really sweet.  As a pre-diabetic not a healthy option.  I sounded like the best vitamin option I had ever heard. If you only took one a day I would not have given them away.
