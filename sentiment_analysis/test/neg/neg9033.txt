This is the worst phone I ever had. It is not consumer friendly as described by other reviews which I feel is skewed by the company. In addition the customer service makes many mistakes from setting up the phone to billing. Lastly, it is not cost effective. The minutes go by quick and is very costly. I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy Prime Core for $39.00 without a plan from T-Mobile. I pay by the month for $40.00 and get unlimited talk, text and 3GB of data. In addition, if there are any issues with the phone or plan T-Mobile will take care of it on the spot. My recommendation is to stay away from plans that have no stores, they usually outsource their customer service in order to cut costs and you will compromise your private information.
