This would probably be a pretty good product if you lived in a big city with great Verizon LTE coverage.  In the country, it really required 5 bars to locate your pet, and even still was only marginally effective as a tracking tool.  It only lets you see where your pet was a few minutes ago, and doesn't get a super accurate fix (+/- 100 yards).I had a bunch of issues with the hardware itself, not holding a charge, not charging properly, shutting down randomly (unfortunately, when my dog was missing and the tracker was fully charged).  I called Whistle several times and they were polite, but never offered to replace the unit or refund me for the service charge during the months that it was not functioning.  For $10/month, I expected better coverage and customer service.I guess you get what you pay for, it's pretty affordable and worked without issues for almost a year, which is pretty good peace of mind for the price.  My recommendation is to wait until a newer model comes out, hopefully it will have a stronger antenna and better battery.
