I wasted money on this. I bought it for my working vacation to Germany and Italy. I got a signal once in the airport in Munich. Nothing after that. When I got to Italy I ended up buying a local Wind data card. I could never get a signal. With the virtual nor the card I bought. I ended up using my iPhone as a personal hotspot. Now I am heading back to the USA and guess what? The return time has expired. Do not waste your money on this.
