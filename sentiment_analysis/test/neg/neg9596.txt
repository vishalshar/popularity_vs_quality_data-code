One of the reasons I choosed Pebblebee, is a desire to help fellow ex-Boeing engineers (stated on website).So, I bought 2 units. Binding to my iPhone 6 went smoothly. Works perfectly when I pick up my mail on the street and left my car keys in the kitchen, a distance of about 50 ft, my phone beeps. But after only one week, I could not bind any of the two. When trying to bind, The Apps got stuck on "Hints" - " press side button  .. 2 beeps On and 3 beeps OFF ". I reload a copy of the Apps; still the same !.Well, they are on way back to Amazon.About the design:Hard to press the button on the side - have to look at it.Battery cover requires a special provided tool. Why not a coin ????.Battery cover is flush - impossible to lift it because the close tolerance. I have to use a steel tooth pick from CVS.Even after you open it, the battery is impossible to lift. Again I have to use the steel tooth pick ( may short battery ! ). Broke when using wooden one.Battery is NOT the commonly available CR 2032 or 2025 (these are available at even at 99 Cent store). Probably have to order online !.Very hard to discern between 2 beeps (ON) and 3 beeps (OFF) - too fast. A better way is one beep for ON and long beep for OFF like the iTag.
