I am very disappointed with this kit. I have purchased and exchanged this item twice because the batteries fail to charge. The type of battery used (LIPO) will not tolerate being fully discharged and it looks like there is a design flaw that will cause a battery that is installed on the control module to discharge. Both kits batteries are showing near 0 volts and will not take a charge. This is unfortunate as the kit looks to be very well put together and interesting to use for my 10 year old.
