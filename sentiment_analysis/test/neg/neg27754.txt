Received this mirror at the end of July for my beach house. So it was only used on weekends. Lasted 2 months and the mirror is completely dead. Won't turn on, won't do anything. This is unexceptable for a $400 mirror. I have another one of these mirrors at my primary home, I've had it for about 6 months and works well but I would not suggest purchasing this mirror. To much of a risk for $400
