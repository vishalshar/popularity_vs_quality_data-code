I purchased Prynt for an iPhone 6s, and a second one for the new iPhone 7 Plus.  The 6s works fine, and is a neat gadget.  However, despite the writeups saying that the 6Plus adapter works for the 7Plus, it does not appear to work (due to an App/OS issue, apparently, not the hardware).  I haven't received any update/feedback from Prynt yet... but apparently the app and/or firmware is not compatible with the 7Plus yet.  If it were, I would give it 4 stars.
