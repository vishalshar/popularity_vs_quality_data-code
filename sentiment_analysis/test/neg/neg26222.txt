I have amazon prime and this took an extremely long time to ship. When I recieved package, it was actually shipped from China. It had no directions, duplicate packages of cards in the box, and the box was extremely mangled to the point I cannot even store contents back in the box. As far as the actual game, the cards are not difficult enough in my opinion for people to get what your saying wrong. Every time we said what the card had written on it, we were able to guess right away. Not impressed.
