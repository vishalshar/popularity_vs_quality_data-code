This product is terrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. The first time I used it, I put my phone and it in my pocket (they're about the same size, and both slim). When I took them back out, the lightning connector stayed in my phone, while the cable came off. My pocket is was not tight, and I handled the items with care. Seems very cheaply made. I'm not sure how this item has such good reviews.
