I can't state enough how disappointed I am with this purchase.1. I had the same problem that a lot of people had with the device staying in the wrist band. I figured that it must have been resolved at some point and wouldn't be as bad as the online reviews stated. I was incorrect in that assumption. I couldn't sneeze without this thing popping off. Any time pressure is applied to your wrist/arm in a perpendicular direction to the band it pops out.Note that Misfit customer service is really TOP NOTCH. I emailed them and they sent a new band out that stays put. Problem solved.2. Within 2 months the unit stopped syncing to my phone, even though it had power. Replaced batteries and tried every method I could find on the internet to resolve it on my own, deleting and reinstalling app and turning Bluetooth off/on after every step. I was not rough on the unit, in fact, I took great care in not being as rough with it as I am with a lot of my stuff. I didn't get it wet aside from a few jogs in the rain, even though they said it can take being fully submerged.I would like to note again, their customer service is really top notch. They told me to send the unit to them and they will investigate what happened and send a new unit. I am in that process now, but I really wish I hadn't made this purchase. I bought this unit to have something that I thought looked a little less noticeable on my arm and might hold up a little better under wet conditions. This is just way more hassle than I would expect from a product and I'm probably just going to give the replacement unit away and it can be someone else's problem.They do stand by their product though. I have nothing but good things to say about the company, I just really dislike the product and really, really wish I hadn't dropped $100 on it.Phil
