They're  constantly improving this device, works great.EDIT: 10/9/2016 - After Android was updated to 7.0, the connection on my Nexus 6P no longer works. I own numerous other bluetooth devices, and they all connect without issue. However, since the update, the app simply will not connect to the device. Support said they had a Nexus 5X with Nougat and it was working just fine. Over a month ago, they said they'd try to look into it, but I still cannot use the device.
