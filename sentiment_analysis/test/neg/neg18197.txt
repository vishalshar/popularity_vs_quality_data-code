I was very excited to get a "smart" sprinkler. Sadly it requires way too much attention on a regular basis. If there is any rain anywhere nearby (which is every day in the summer in Florida), it will not run due to recent rain.  Since there is no regional control it does not realize how much water is required to keep my lawn alive. I have to check to see if it ran then manually run my sprinkler most days that it is supposed to run.I tried to email for assistance but customer service was a joke.
