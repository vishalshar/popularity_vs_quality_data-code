I like Rokform products, so inevitably I got my first iphone case here. At 34$ in 2014, I was barely able to leave the case on. The attachment ie. carmount (the main selling point for me), though an elegant idea (a block of plastic with 3M sticky tape on the back to attach onto your car anywhere) fell off my car after I hooked the iphone onto it and rode for a few minutes.Many times, I had to remove the bottom half of the case, to connect ear phones or chargers, because the case was in the way of plugging in. Eventually I lost the bottom half. Anyway, it's a great concept, but the car mount needs to improve and the holes in the bottom of the case for the ports need to be wider.Honestly, I feel like a got a bum dash mount, and do want to give it another shot.
