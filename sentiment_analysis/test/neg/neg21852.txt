I so wanted to like this coffee maker. It is cute and appealing, seems to be very well-made and works as it is supposed to, I suppose. However, cold brewed coffee may not be to your taste (as it is not to mine). I've tried the technique several times with different apparatus, and never has it even come close to the flavors produced by good old hot water. Certainly give this a try if you think cold brew may appeal to you. But don't be too disappointed if you have to return it.
