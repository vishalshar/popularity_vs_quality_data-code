Yet another piece of crappy tech fantasy.iPad is built for fingertip-width resolution. Finer control, which this product promised, is a load of crap. Trying drawing a fine line with the black rubber diaper thing dragging along obscuring your view. My fingertip offers better control and resolution.Pressure sensitive? Nonsense. Either thick or thin, and the transition is not smooth. Most of the time the stylus simply stops writing.Switches randomly between writing and smudging. Who the hell needs that nightmare in the middle of a project?Additionally, IMO, the 53 Paper app is inferior for rendering compared to Procreate and other readily available and often free apps. Paper is free, yet its interface hogs the bottom 20% of the screen and when using in its landscape orientation is worthless. Color picker gimmick designed more for stone age tweens than anyone who needs a real palette and proper mixing tools. I'm deleting the app as well. I've got four apps, two of them free, that do a better job rendering and allowing adjustments to the tools.I am very disappointed and disgusted with the slick marketing of this overpriced and retarded toothpick.This whole Paper 53/Magic Pencil thing feels like a scam, IMO. Overpromised garbage, I think.Returning the thing to Amazon in the morning. Total waste of my money.
