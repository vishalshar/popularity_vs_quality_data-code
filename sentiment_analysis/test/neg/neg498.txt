I bought the iOttie EasyView after having a great experience with iOttie Easy One Touch. Did that mainly for the looks. That was a bad decision :( Should have gone for another One Touch.The EasyVIew is easy to install and view, and looks better than the OneTouch.  It sticks, from what I can tell, just as good (or as bad, if you are trying to remove it) the OneTouch: near impossible to remove. If/when you manage to remove it from the dash/windshield, it comes off clean - no residues at all. Putting your phone on the mount is just as easy as OneTouch. Those are all good.The problem is with removing your phone. Unlike the OneTouch, the EasyView requires you to pull on one of the "arms" on the side. The problem with that is, it exerts severe pressure on the "neck" and the "foot" of the mount. In my case, the foot really held on well, but the "neck" didn't. No matter how tight I set it, after removing the phone a couple of times, the neck turns to whichever side you are pulling to release it. In other words, after every few removals you have to re-adjust the neck. Though the foot holds on well, I can see how it gets exerted, and I am not sure how long it will be before I have to re-stick that too.For me it is way too much trouble for nice looks. I will most likely get another One Touch. Or something else. The EasyView is going back.
