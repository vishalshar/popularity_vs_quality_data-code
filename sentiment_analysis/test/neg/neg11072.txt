I was please with this product the first time i purchased it.However about a month ago I purchased 3 kits and they were all rotting and falling apart. The first one i soak for 10 hours and it had dissolved in the water. Disappointed I check the other 2 kits and they were at same condition. I tried to return and get a refund but I wasn't allowed to.  I'm just really sad 50 dollars went to waste.
