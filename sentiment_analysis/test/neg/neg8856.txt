Not secure. If you take pictures or video there is NO way to NOT make those images public. Their "Moments" section is a bunch of random images of peoples homes and children. It's a complete invasion of privacy and you can't turn this option off. Also, as mentioned by other reviewers, there is no user interface to manage online. Documentation is slim (Air sensor capabilities not explained AT ALL)  and their website is completely useless.I'm returning this today.
