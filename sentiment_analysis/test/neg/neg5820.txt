Had some initial trouble with the install by following the written instructions and online video.  That was not quite complete enough to get the Lock working correctly.  I will save some people some time and frustration by telling you to install the lock and then the app.  Go through the settings (avoid the calibration and go to the manual settings).  This will get you over the "proper rotation issue".My problem with the product is the zwave functionality.  I bought this because I have Samsung SmartThings and THOUGHT this integrated.  I can't get it to pair up with the hub.  I've tried many ways based on the online comments and such.  No luck.  I'm moderately pleased until that works.  I hope support helps, but I am skeptical.Will update to more stars when that is worked out.  Until then, only 3.Update:  Going to 2 stars.  SmartThings has dropped support and I wouldn't have purchased this had I known.  Bluetooth is fine.  Zwave is useless.  Support was no help.  Boo!
