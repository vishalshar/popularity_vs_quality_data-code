I had to return it, it was not useful. Neither the hardware, nor the software are good. You basically have to spend much more to get the real thing, there is no cutting corners with thermal imagers for now. Unfortunately, Seek Thermal is not the answer - I was hopeful that it would be helpful, but barely.
