Very disappointed. I have a son with dyspraxia and this looked like the answer to my prayers. Dyspraxia affects fine motor skills and tying shoes has been difficult. My son has size 11.5 feet and Hickies are NOT MADE to accommodate a foot that size. In fact they were snug on my 11 year old with narrow feet size 3 shoe. She didn't like them.  Not what it is hyped up to be. We tried all 3 suggestions, especially the loose fit, and my son would not even get his foot in the shoe with the Hickies on. Understand these are going to be TIGHT and uncomfortable.
