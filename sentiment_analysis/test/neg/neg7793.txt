What?!! I can't believe all the 5 star reviews. Really makes me question the authenticity of these reviews. I just received my Soma carafe and I have to say, this is truly the WORST product. I really, really, really wanted to like this, but seriously can't get over the fact that the filtered water tastes EXACTLY the same as the tap water. I live in NJ and I know the water in our area is not so great, you can taste and smell the chlorine. But after putting the water through SOMA, the taste and smell of chlorine was unchanged. I thought maybe I needed to run water through the filter a bunch of times? So I must have run it through maybe 10 times. Still the same.  I couldn't even swallow the water bc it was so nauseating. I thought maybe I was just being sensitive, so I had my husband try it. He immediately spit it out. His reaction completely confirmed my thoughts about this product. Like I said before, I REALLY wanted to like this product...the design is so beautiful and it's really the only filter pitcher out there that I could find that is made out of glass. But in reality, design and beauty mean diddly squat if there is no function. I rarely write bad reviews...I usually write a review when there is something I really like. But I felt like it was my duty to warn everyone out there to stay away from this product. Don't get fooled by the smoke and mirrors of marketing.I also want to point out that I own two water filters: Everydrop (used in my refrigerator) and Brita pitcher. Both filter the water wonderfully, at least from the taste and smell perspective. I never really tested the water with a TDS meter to compare. However, I do believe that taste/smell should be a pretty good indicator. Perhaps the Soma does a good job filtering other impurities aside from Chlorine? Even if that's the case, it really means nothing if I can't stand the taste of the water.
