I purchased the august doorbell and smart lock. I am happy with the smart lock, but very unhappy with the doorbell. It just doesn't work.1. They claim to have a motion detection, but I have yet to receive a single motion detection alert.2.  When someone rings the bell, and I try to answer from the app, the app stay in "connecting" mode for a very long time, in this mode I don't get a picture nor can I speak to the person.. by the time the app connects (if it connects), the person already left.. so I result to work around, when someone ring the bell I shout and run...My power and wifi signal are up to spec.
