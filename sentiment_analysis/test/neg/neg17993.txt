I ordered the one light keyboard to teach my kids how to play piano.  Upon opening the box, there was no power cord. So, no way to power the piano. Still, I can't find any info on how or what exact power cord to use.  Don't want to put the wrong type of power source and ruin the piano.  Guess I expected more.  While the product might be great...I can't use it without power and I didn't order it to be used with batteries.
