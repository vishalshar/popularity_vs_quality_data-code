I loved it when it arrived...But after 5 days of using it is worthless!!! I can only get about 90% charge from it and it takes about 3 hours to do so.Other cases have almost the same thickness and charge faster and give a full charge and more.They say this case has 2600mAh and it should at least give you more than one charge but it doesn't.!
