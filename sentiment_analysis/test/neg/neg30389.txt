I've bought this watch with a happy thougt in my mind because it is close to what I wished to get.I've used it for the first week quite dissapointed because was missing alerts, it was disconnecting often. Then the first App update and first firmware update showed up. My watch transformed in what I was expecting: fast reaction, more powerful vibration, a dreap come true.Then. a couple weeks after, a new update arrive. They said it should fix a lot of problems (problems that I didn't have). After this update, I started experiencing exactly the problems they were saying it was fixed: disconnection continously even when the phone and the watch are 2 feet away, missing notifications or notifying 10 seconds after the phone started ringing, etc.So, I've created an account on their website and asked if there is a way to downgrade the firmware. The answer was never no, but, instead, they've sent me a beta version of their app for android (I own an Iphone6, this being mentioned in the first post). I've told them again and I've received the IOS app. But, how to install it? It is not signed by Apple so itunes wouldn't install it on my phone. So I had to jailbreak my phone in order to install it.Tested the app for a while. It was a bit better, but not as I wanted it, and I need now to restart the watch every week or so to be reactive again, because sometimes forgets to react even if it is connected to the phone.Anyway, I've accepted this and moved on. Until I started traveling and noticed that the watch gets disconnected from bluetooth very often when I use 3G data or when the phone switches from 3G to 2G in areas with poor coverage.Of course, I've reported to the manufacturer my observations.A week after, I receive a message from them asking me to disable the activity tracker from my watch, this being the reason for disconnecting.How did they know I was using it, I don't know. But the activity tracker on my watch is not active because I prefer vibrations over the pedometer. So I've told them again that is disabled, explaining again the 2G/3G problem.Over two weeks passes and I receive a message from them saying... see below:"Dear Marius,In the light of this, you can manual change the settings of your network on your phone, whenever you are at home, does your network change frequently? If not, changing the network settings will definitely help. I shall refer this to our development team for them to have a look at this. If you could provide us some logs it will definitely help."So, they are telling me to stop using my 3G connection (which I am paying for) because they are to lazy to look into the issues of their product.I do not recommend to buy this product or any product from this manufacturer because support is way below the common sense level.Also, one more reason, even if they say that they use mineral glass for this watches, mine scratched quite quick. My previous ProTrek watch was going through harder situations and still didn't scratch like this one.The battery on my watch lasted for three months only, unlike they advertise.Conclusion: Does not worth the money. It is to expesive for what is it doing. It is to expensive for a company that doesn't care about their customers.
