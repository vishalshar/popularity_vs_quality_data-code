attempted to use it with Android 4.0.1, my mistake! should have checked google play before to see thatapp only works on 4.2.2 and up.so, huzzah! excuse to buy new phone! now using android 5.1.1. app loads, runs.STILL no connection on blue tooth, though phone reports it likes it and is paired, triby does not.also triby does not connect to WEP home wifi, so no way to update software, now way to set up or usethe boat anchor that is triby. support pages say need 10.34.0 or up to use with android etc.that's what i have in triby! does not work. can't upgrade, no wifi, nothing to upgrade to....quick start guide says download full user guide at support site... no such .pdf document, justa few FAQs poorly organized. give it a year or two, if still on the market maybe try again.... or get an echo/dot.
