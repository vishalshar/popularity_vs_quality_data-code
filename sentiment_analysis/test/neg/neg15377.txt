You need a lot of time to hone the skills to fly this.My trouble is that by the time I think I've adjusted things to get it to work, the battery is too low for it to function properly. It is pretty cool though, and if the price was to drop to half of what it is. I'd get enough for all 25 kids in my 6th grade science class (we study flight for s quarter).
