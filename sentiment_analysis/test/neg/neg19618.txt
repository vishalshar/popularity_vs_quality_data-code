Simply put this lock does not work as advertised.  I think the concept and premise is there, but the execution is very much lacking.  The one-step unlock method does not work well at all, and by that I mean it works 1 out of 10 times.  I use the lock at the gym when I work out and when first trying to unlock it so I can put the lock on my locker I have the lock in one hand and my phone in the other, press the shackle and nothing, Although the app clearly is telling me to press shackle to unlock.  Same goes for after my workout when I press the shackle to attempt to unlock, nothing.  I have defaulted to simply using the pass code for when I want to unlock the padlock, its faster than taking out my phone and trying to trouble shoot why the app is not registering the lock.  I am not sure if this is a hardware or app issue, but I do not think this should be marketed as a lock that unlocks with your phone.
