This is a weird situation. The unit itself is very good, loud, with easy controls. Waterproofing is perfect. Sounds better than the next step down at ~$100.Problem is, I've now returned 3 for weird reasons. 2 were because one mounting screw that goes in the bottom simply didn't fit. Twice. Two times. Two entire units with a bizarre manufacturing problem. Okay, four weeks later, after returning one to Amazon and getting a new part from the manufacturer, it's working fully for the first time in the month that I've owned it. Then I go to update the firmware, and the update fails somehow and it bricks the device. Completely destroys it. How long to get a new one from the manufacturer you might ask? 2-3 weeks. Out of 9 weeks I've owned this device, I have had it in full working condition for 2 weeks. And now I get to wait 2-3 more weeks.So, this is probably the best one when it works right. But if you need it to be 100% working when you get it, and you don't want to deal with a bunch of downtime, stay far, far away.
