I cannot recommend this drive. It has decent transfer rates and it was nice when it was first released. I have 2 very big issues with it though.Issues:1) It overheats and throttles and eventually just shuts down and dismounts. Either the controller doesn't throttle well or there is a defect but this is a common problem on this drive. After having tried a couple other USB3 SSDs, I can say the problem is unique to this brand. For the price, this drive is just not worth it when you can buy a Samsung T1/T3 or Sandisk Extreme 500 for about the same price without these issues.2) Rate capacity. Now, the vendor claims that the drive is 256GB. However, Sandisk uses similar provisioning and rates their drives at 240GB. The inside of the drive shows a Toshiba mSATA SSD with a 240GB sticker on it. So while it may TECHNICALLY be correct that it has 256GB of flash, it really doesn't matter if it's the same size as all the other SSDs which are advertised as 240GB SSDs, right?I emailed customer service over the issue and they promised to mail me a new controller to try fixing the overheating issues. You know what they sent me? A new USB3 cable. Gee thanks. BTW, that did not fix the problem.I give up. I'll just use the drive as an oversized USB flash drive for small files only as anything larger than 10GB will overheat the drive and kill it. If MyDigitalSSD ever sends me a new controller and it actually fixes the problem, I'll make sure to update this review.
