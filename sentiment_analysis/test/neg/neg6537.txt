I hesitated buying this, as I prefer drones with a controller. Read the positive reviews decided to go for it. The drone arrived, packaging was great. Written instructions, not so great, found some youtube videos on setting it up, and binding it to my iPhone 6 plus with its black box.Took it out to a field, had 10 satellites, calibrated it, which for some reason it failed  twice, even though there were no trees, or buildings around, and did auto take off. It hovered perfectly. Had a problem with the app controls. Landed it, restarted everything, tried doing the calibration again, got calibration failed for the third time. Again, the drone did not respond the app controls even though I had the black box strapped on my wrist and pointing to the drone. It veered out of control and crashed twice. Luckily I didnt take it more than 15 high. When it crashed both times the motors shut off, nothing broke, except for the camera dislodging,which was the only plus. As I stated Iprefer controllers, instead of anything app based.I really liked the looks of this drone, but it did not work properly for me. Am not a novice to hobby grade drones, so had to send this one back.
