The case is beautifully made: nice felt, high quality rubber, very protective.The issue I had which prompted me to return it is that, once put on, the phone's power button was finicky: it didn't click, the slightest touch would turn the phone on or off. The volume buttons had a nice feel, but the other side clearly had an issue.
