My experience was nothing but bad and given the issues not sure if I can trust the data that it provides.  Will be going back.I was running the app on an Android phone running 6.0. My big issues were:1. Took on average of 2-3 tries to collect the data.  Sometimes I got a message that not enough data was collected, other times the application just hung. Required a phone reboot to get it to work again.2. Having Bluetooth  & Location turned on is required to connect the device. Like many phone users I have Location OFF to extend battery life. They ask for Bluetooth to be turned on,  but not Location.  Application will hang on a data capture attempt until you turn it on, but it never sets the location on the app.3. Calibration never worked. After 8-10 tries I gave up. When it went to capture data it just hangs4. Application response is horrid. 60-90 seconds between screens.5. Capturing data on average took 2-5 minutes. Kept getting asked to place my thumbs.Tried working with Support, but it took 10 business days to get the first response contrary to the 2 days specified in the automated response.
