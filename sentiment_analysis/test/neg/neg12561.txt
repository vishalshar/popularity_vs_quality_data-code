I've found this product applies easily, especially after a fresh hair wash.  However, the product "clumps" into tiny balls on my scalp as it's in contact with the warmth from my scalp, or after wearing a hat.  I don't wash my hair every day, and do need to re-apply more hair fibers each day, but not as much as applied after a fresh wash.  My hair stylist advised me to avoid this product, as the clumping acts as a suffocating effect on my scalp, affecting new hair growth.I've used Toppik fibers previously, and while it is more expensive than Infinity, Toppik never clumped for me.While the price for Infinity seems a good deal, and enticed me to purchase it, I will not be buying it again.There are more and more choices coming onto the marketplace to consider.I've just purchased the Samson hair fibers, used it for the first time today.  Time will tell how that one works!
