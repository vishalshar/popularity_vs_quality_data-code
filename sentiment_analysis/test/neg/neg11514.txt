I purchased a Sloane undershirt  through Amazon and many more directly through Sloane. I love the design. It sure works! It truly is invisible. That's the good news. The bad news is that the quality of the workmanship sucks, big time! Not one, but four of the shirts are coming apart at the seams. I am extremely disappointed that an undershirt costing over $30 would be so poorly manufactured. It's a good thing that my lovely wife is an awesome seamstress who has undertaken a huge job of fixing the problems. I owe her big time. I owe my fellow Amazoners a "heads up" message. I owe Sloane nothing but this review.
