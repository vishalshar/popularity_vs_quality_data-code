Pro's:1.  shiny2.  pretty light3.  gives you more quality time on your phone trying to figure out why the this thing isn't unlocking againCon's1.  Never seemed to open the same way twice2.  As soon as it gets cold, make sure you bring your bolt cutter3.  An ultimate POS that is using suckers (like me) as Beta testers (so here is your feedback!)4.  Save your money, avoid this POS like the plague it is5.  The cheap idiots don't even send a key....a key isn't even an option, so, when the battery dies (like two months after you buy it and its colder than, oh, say 0C), you are toast....I bought two of these.  I WILL NEVER BUY THEM AGAIN.  THEY CANNOT BE USED OUTSIDE ANYWHERE THAT WINTER HAPPENS.  GARBAGE.I'd give this product a negative 5 stars if that was an option.Sadly, they got my money, I hope this review helps you keep yours.
