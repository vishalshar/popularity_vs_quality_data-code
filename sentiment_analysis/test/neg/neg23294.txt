I love this I phone 6 case, I love the attachments, I love the magnet but after having it for about 6 months now the black rubbery plastic part is now falling off of the clear plastic part.  I also don't like the open slots in the side for the lanyard attachment because it allows debris to get inside your case.  You have to clean the inside of your case every other week so you aren't walking around with a disgusting looking phone.
