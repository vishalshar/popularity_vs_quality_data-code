I never write reviews, but felt compelled to voice my opinion.  This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased.  The suction cup for the light would not stick to the toilet, the motion sensor was too sensitive and caused the light to come on all of the time....day and night, wearing the battery down very fast.  Placing the device, cleaning it and changing the battery are very unsanitary.  Get a good night light.
