I have written the next emails to support@lifx.co BUT they don't answer.I've had problems doing the setup up process for my third generation LIFX Color 1100 A19 bulb. It never connects to my WiFi network. The troubleshooting steps I've done are;- I tried the normal setup up. It didn't work. The bulb didn't become part of my WiFi network. It seems that step isn't working.- I repeated that process after the I did a hardware reset process ( I turn it ON/OFF five times and it flashed red-green-purple-yellow). It neither worked.- I downloaded the MacOS LIFX Firmware Updater, I ran it but that app only searched 1st and 2nd generation bulbs, hence It didn't find my bulb. Å¼Was that due to I have a 3th gen bulb?I'm worried and a bit disappointed of the things have happened. I'd be glad with your help and support.***There have passed three (3) days and it has been impossible to setup up my 3th gen LiFX A19 color bulb. It's a shame that even using and running all the options that your company shows to solve the problems have been unsuccessful attempts.I'm really very disappointed with a lot of things: The mails, I've sent, haven't been answered by you. The apps don't work at all with this new generations of bulbs (neither using Android nor iOS), the rescue mode of the bulb never activates, the Windows and MacOS programs to Update the firmware never find that bulb (they only search for 1st and 2nd gen bulbs).It seems that you launched a product which you can't support or at least you aren't prepared to.I hope so you answer me as soon as possible. Thanks***
