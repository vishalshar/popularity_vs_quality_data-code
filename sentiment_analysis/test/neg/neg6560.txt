Not what I was hoping for - this speaker is far from worth the $60 price tag (compared to other Bluetooth speakers). It has some pretty major flaws, and unfortunately, the seller just offered to try another one of their speakers (which I can find similar reviews). The speaker that this replaced (Brightech DanceOut, no longer sold) was about half the price, but had a much better experience than this one..A few of my biggest complains are:- The quality of sound - I'm not expecting a full sound system, but I expect higher quality for the price- Inability to disable light - I want to use this on my night stand, without it blinking throughout the night, or having to cover it- Odd reaction when plugging in phone to aux - Had the unit do weird things to my phone (google keeps thinking I'm trying to search for something...), when I plug the aux cable in - something that never happens if I aux to another device- Bluetooth works fine - but would rather aux in, to save battery life on my phoneOverall - I had big hopes for this speaker to fit my needs, but unfortunately, it falls short... not worth the time!
