The concept for this bag was a great idea.  After receiving the bag it looks like it has significantly changed from the Proto type model.  The majority of the features of this bag are completely useless for carry-on luggage.  There is no need for anyone to way there carry-on luggage.  This feature would be much more useful on a checked bag.  The bag I received will not even power up. Not sure if it's an effective power button or if the system is just fried. Dead on arrival.  The wheels were a big selling point for me. I loved the design. They have changed these significantly and  the changes are not reflected in the photo. I will be returning this in favor of another TUMI carry on bag.
