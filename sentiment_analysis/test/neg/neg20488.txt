There was good build quality on this product, but it is aimed for a solo rock or metal act, IMHO  I play a variety of gigs, and my solo gigs are "cocktail" type gigs.  Despite having "tons" of patterns, there was not a usable basic swing pattern, basic cha cha, basic bossa nova, rhumba, etc. It had some of these patterns, but they all had weird fills coming out of nowhere, which is incongruous.  Also, unless you have your complete set list programmed in advance, you will be leaning down to the floor to twiddle the knobs to dial in the next number.  Not good if you take requests.
