I actually really like the pencil as a stylus, and I love it when it works. It works very well with other applications, but it is abysmal in Paper. It fails to connect, doesn't recognize the eraser, and blends whatever I'm working on just about every other time I put it to the screen. If you'd like a demonstration of how it SHOULD work, I suggest using it in Autodesk Sketchbook. This is my second one, by the way. The first one's eraser stopped working after I had it for a few weeks. What I don't understand is how this great idea and great implementation repeatedly fails in the very app it was designed to enhance. Clearly the technology isn't to blame because it works so well in other places.
