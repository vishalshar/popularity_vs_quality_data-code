The jury is out. My buddy has one that turns on and off an outlet and it works great. I just want notifications of movement. I received one when I first set up the rule and now I can't seem to get it to work. I tried making a new rule and unplugging it for a while. I haven't completely reset it yet, but I might have to try it. It displays the temp though. Hmmm. So far, not worth the money to me. If it actually worked it would be a start. Then, if it worked with IFTTT, it would make it useful.
