These devices require wps be enabled on your router in order to connect to your network, so if your router is not in a completely secure location you've just created a security hole. There is no browser based configuration page. You have to use a 1-star rated ios or android app to configure the devices. They may work for your average single family home (provided the p.o.s. app will connect), but they are pretty worthless for any other use case.
