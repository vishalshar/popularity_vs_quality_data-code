I really wish I could return this.  When I received this, it worked very well.  Now a few months later, it barely works with HomeKit and always jams or will not connect with my phone.  Unless your deadbolt is PERFECTLY aligned with the door jam, don't even bother.  It took far too long for August to get in line with iOS10.  I am not sure how such a large company can be so behind on the OS it is supposed to work with.
