I loose my keys and wallet all the time. I not only wanted, but needed this to work as advertised. It works fantastic when on a key ring. I was able to set my keys on a picnic table in my front yard, and walk two doors down. My phone, a SG4, could detect it two doors down, about 100 feet away. The ringer was loud enough I could tell what direction it came from and easily find it when close. The problem is when the Tile is inside something. A wallet, purse, brief case and it doesn't work. Inside my wallet, my phone can't detect it 3 feet away. Inside a purse or brief case my phone can't detect it when my phone is sitting on top of the item. I will keep this one for my keys, but was planning on getting more for my purse.
