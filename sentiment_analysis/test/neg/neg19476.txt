I want to like this device. I love the idea. But I'm a reasonably fit 55 year old, which means I try to do better in things. I meditate a little, but want to do more. I exercise, but should do more. And I want to lose weight, but not a lot. I have a little belly, but not too bad for someone my age. But after 2+ days, the Spire is leaving irritating red marks on my abdomen where the unit comes up against my belly. If its not positioned high enough when I sit, it asks me to move it higher. Which means my waist band looks like I'm wearing high-waisted 1980s jeans. When I take it off for a shower, I am greeted with a notice to reposition it so it can detect my breathing. It isn't really for sleeping, yet (?), so in the morning it chastises me for being out of sync for more than 6 hours, the limit of the units memory before syncing with my iPhone. And I won't even talk about it getting upset if a trip to the toilet takes too long. I really hope they can improve this, because it does have promise. But for now, I'm disappointed and putting mine in a drawer somewhere.
