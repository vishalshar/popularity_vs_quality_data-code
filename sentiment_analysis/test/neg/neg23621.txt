Description says it is aroma free. It stinks so bad I had to triple wrap it and put it where I seldom went until I returned it today. So glad it is out of my house now!_______________________________Update:Amazon received my return on this item on Aug 17, 2016. I do not remember making this review....I think these are the comments I put on the return order. I NEVER would have given this item 5 Stars!!!!! I have now corrected it to one star, so Wendy, thanks for mentioning the incongruity of bad experience and too many stars!  I am smell sensitive, yet this was not a subtle, not so good odor. It was outright horrendous. Perhaps it got contaminated by something else that had been near it.  I ordered it straight from Amazon from this product page on a Lightening Deal. As I suffer from Fibromylagia, I had high hopes for this product._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________2nd update:The company customer service will provide me with an unscented set, so I will upgrade the stars by one.  Glad to see a company that cares about individual customers!
