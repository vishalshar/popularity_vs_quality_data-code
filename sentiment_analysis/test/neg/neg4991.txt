Not ready for prime time.  Bought it to replace the Ring I had that never worked. Here's what has happened in the past month of ownership.Customer service is very elusive, the web site is not customer service oriented. You need to dig to find an email or phone contact.Our whole house is networked with additional APs to provide great wireless pick-up throughout the inside and outside of the house. This unit fails to stay attached to the AP that is less than 10 feet from the door (all other appliances have no issue). The wifi signal according to the August APP on my phone is between 52 and 55 (Reading Good on the app), but sometimes disconnects with this signal. When I discuss the connection issue with customer service they blame it on the house, doors, and everything but the unit.  Even with a good signal (according to the app), my phone has a hard time connecting to the Doorbell Cam.  Nine times out of ten it fails to connect, and when it connects, it takes 30 to 45 seconds to make the connection.  By that time the person has left or the thief has already broken into the house.  I purchased this unit to supplement the gap in our system, but now moving to an IP camera system to replace all this junk.
