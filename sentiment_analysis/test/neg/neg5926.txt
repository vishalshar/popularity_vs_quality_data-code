I really was excited about this pillow after reading the reviews.Let me state that there is no issues with the quality of this pillow. This issue is it just wasn't a good fit for me.Bad neck angle which led to severe back pain through out the night.  I gave this pillow 5 nights and was constantly waking up to some sort of pain in different areas of my body.You really don't understand proper neck alignment while you are sleeping until it's out of whack.The 6th night I went back to my old pillow and slept like a baby.I am still looking for that perfect pillow as my old one is worn out. Unfortunately this one isn't it.
