Did not work for me.  I used it for about 4 or 5 days.  I smelled like I wasn't wearing any deodorant at all.  It actually seemed to make me smell WORSE than if I didn't have any deodorant on.  It was really embarrassing being at work when it was clear this stuff was not working.  What's the point of using a "natural" deodorant if it doesn't do the key thing it's supposed to do--cancel (or at least significantly minimize) underarm odor.  Putting rubbing alcohol under my arms would have done a better job.  Not ordering this stuff again.  It may work for others, but it sure does not work for me (whether because of my unique body chemistry--and I'm not naturally a smelly guy--or because it simply does not work per se).
