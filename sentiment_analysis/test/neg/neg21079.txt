In product description it says should be good for two to three weeks with one cat.  NOT TRUE.  We have one cat and the litter must be changed weekly.  The crystals do not absorb the urine well and the box ends up a sloshy mess of crystals and cat urine.  It does not absorb 5x better or last 5-10 times longer than clumping litter.  If anything we use twice a much at three times the cost. The auto scooping unit also move most of the crystals to the back of the litter box behind the scoop screen so the litter box has little coverage on the bottom.  We must routinely take the lid off and manual redistribute the crystals.  The crystals also stick to the paws and between the claws and we find crystals all over the house a problem we did not have with traditional clumping litter. I do not recommend the crystals or the auto scoop unit.
