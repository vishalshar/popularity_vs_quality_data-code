I had so much difficulty trying to connect the device and at $300 i shouldn't have an issue.  Couldn't connect my iMac to it and even had it in the same room.  Plus it has limited functionality with phones. Tried to update the device and that was a complete fail as well.  Not at all happy with anything about it. Plus the range is horrible. Not to mention the dongle is HUGE!  Automatic chat had no response on their website so it goes back. I could have bought a few of these to work with my AV business, but after trying it, it's a big NO. I will go other routes. Spend a minute just plugging in wires or spend an hour trying to get this thing to function properly.
