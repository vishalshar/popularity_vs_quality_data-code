Their customer service is the worst ever. I installed the doorbell and everything seemed to work....except the static on the speaker is horrific making this unusable as intended. I have placed several calls and opened several tickets for assistance all to no avail as I have actually only received 1 callback to be able to actually speak with someone. He stated he would be calling me back the next day....a week later, I am still waiting. The open tickets still have not been addressed.I purchased Skybell due to the fact that it works with Nest CAM, which it does do, although delayed. I will be returning this product as soon as I can get a call back to initiate the return, which appears will take quite some time.Our son purchased the RING doorbell and has not had any issues with it. Although it does not work with NEST, at least I will be able to actually speak with whomever is at my front door when alerted. The whole purpose of these doorbells, is to be able to see and speak to anyone who is at your front door.
