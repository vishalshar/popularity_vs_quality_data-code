I am furious with this product right now.  I bought it and started to pair it; now for my irritations:(1) I recognize that I live in a twitter-filled internet of crappy security and dubious privacy, but I would just as well prefer your app NOT plunder my contacts.  An app to track my dog does not need to know the contact information to everyone in my address book.  Asking me to grant those permissions is ludicrous.  The nice thing would be to have two apps, one for people who have no idea about privacy and security who want to have others tracking them, and one for people who just want to know where their lost dog is and are willing to pay you for that information.  I wonder if defibrillators ask you to give up your contact list when you want to use them?(2) Last night, I charged the device and started to register it.  I went through the process to register and selected a two-year plan.  When I was at the confirmation screen, I started to have doubts and remembered the Amazon reviews.  I decided after all, I did not want to sign a contract and wanted to do a monthly subscription until I decided if this was the right product.  You know.... there's no 'cancel' button on the confirmation screen.  I hit back, and it broke your app and my account.  I cannot change my account, delete it, recreate it, or fix it.  Your app has reached a unanticipated state because I opted to cancel at a confirmation screen.  How did this make it past the design phase and testing?  Now, I have to call your office (not open last night) so you can manually fix a predictable poor state in your data model.Conclusion:This is a great idea, but so far, it matches some descriptions I have that the great idea is poorly executed.  From the number or reviews. if someone did this correctly, they could make some serious bank, and in just a few hours, I have learned whistle has left some room for a competitor.  Just remember.  I am (and others are) willing to pay, but I am trusting you with a family member.  This should just work.UPDATE=========Called the tech support, and they were super nice, and comiserated that there was a problem with the app and it has been reported.  THey fixed everything up in a few minutes, but I'm still upset about the contacts and app design flaw.  I disabled access to contacts through Android's interface, and it crashed a few times, but now seems stable.  Too bad I can't opt out of that permission on install.
