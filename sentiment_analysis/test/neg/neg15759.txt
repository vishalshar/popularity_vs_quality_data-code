I could not get the WiFi to work. After reading several articles online I found that windows OS does not like ADHOC networks. I tried several command line commands via netsh but had no luck.I then spent hours running cat 6 cable to it only to find that the device isn't reporting data properly. It will only report info when you initially plug in the unit, then it will stop. The sensor light stays lit along with the link light of course.Another thing that is strange is when I unplug the sensor the sensor light just stays on. I left it unplugged for several minutes and the sensor light stays on. Also when I plug in the sensor the light goes out. I reseat it and the light stays back on. Seems very strange to me. Also the link light stay lit when I unplug Ethernet. I don't get it.Also I think its terrible there is no smartphone app for this just a website where if you want more than 180 days of history you have to pay $10 a month!! The whole idea of this thing is for me to save money. Lastly I think there should be a windows/mac app for this.
