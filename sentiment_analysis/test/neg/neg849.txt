Update 11/24/16... finally got a 128 oz growler that was bought for me for my birthday in August ... august 2015. The quality of the item is passable but poor. What do I mean? Whatever they use to bend the goose neck isn't doing a great job. It looks more beaten into a curve than anything.. the brushed stainless steel was obviously touched up on the one I got as the brushed lines don't flow.. the cap went on held pressure and dispensed beer! For some reason towards the end of a pint pour it sputters and throws beer foam everywhere which I find annoying. Has done this every time.... Sounds ok but the big let down.... the vacuum tech really sucks and i suspect its not really vacuum insulated. Why do I say this? I have the stanley vacuum insulated growler and it doesn't sweat on the outside when it's filled like this does. Granted the Stanley is 64 oz and this is 128oz so not a same on same comaprison but the Stanley far surpasses in keeping the beer cold.  If you want an expensive party trick this is for you but still gets 1 star because for the cost the item should look well manufactured and it's not. For the cost the item should pour beer well and it doesn't and for the cost it should keep beer cold and it doesn't do that well.I don't know why this put a date of October but I got this on December 12..  The advertising picture does not represent what you are paying for. The entire goose neck is of a different inferior construction. There is no way to disassemble the goose neck as would appear to be the case in the photo.  I have just received this and am very unhappy with the quality of the product . The sight tube is beat up with deep gouges along each side. The tap handle is off kilter and gives me grave concerns on longevity. The cap itself does not feel like it fits properly. It does not thread easily nor properly. It sort of cross threads then pops into place.  I have done a pressure test with mine. I filled the growler the same day with beer. It is an attention getter; however, it ruins the joy when the same excited people make mention of the same issues I saw. Anyway. The system seemed to work well at first. I drew two 12 ounce glasses and pressured up to about 5 psi. Let it set over night and pulled another 12 ounce glass on Sunday. I had to up the regulator to increase to 5 psi. on Monday (12/14/15) I went to pull a glass and nothing. I opened the growler and had to pour the contents out. The CO2 was out and my beer was flat. So I am getting a replacement and hoping this is just an initial run issue. The replacement was worse than the first one I got.
