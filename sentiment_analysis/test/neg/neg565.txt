Works fine for my devices. Not sure about the durability though. The little loop where it attaches doesn't seem strong enough to last. I'm happy with it, for now, and I'll update this review when it breaks.EDIT: Well, it broke today, this thing lasted a year and worked well while it was in use. It didn't break where I expected it to though, I was concerned about the keychain loop or possibly the flexible cord, but it was the USB Type-A connector that broke on me. If it were less expensive I'd be happy with it, lasting a year is fine for something that's cheap, but having the plastic housing crack away in the key fall apart so soon is not acceptable at this price.I'm putting this back on my Wishlist, I did really like it while it lasted, but I'll be waiting for a big sale before picking up another of these things.
