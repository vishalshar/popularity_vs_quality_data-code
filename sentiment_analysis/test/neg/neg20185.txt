The scale I had had a hard time connecting to my iPhone 6S Plus and my fianc√©'s galaxy note 4.  The few times we did get it to connect and log out info, the gps was off.. By a lot.  This product is a great concept and I hope they can get the bugs with the Bluetooth worked out.  We ended up sending ours back.
