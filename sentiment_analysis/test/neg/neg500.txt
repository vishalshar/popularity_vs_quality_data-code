At first I really liked this product, but then the Gel pad at the bottom of stand started to tear off and its creating problems at my dash board. I'm surprised that this gel pad is having these melting problem in Northern California where weather is really moderate all around the year, so I can not expect this thing to works well in hot weather. I tried to contact to iOttie and they asked me to send this unit for replacement and I have to pay the shipping.. so rather going through this hassle its better to buy a different product. Please check the pictures in Customer Images section to understand the problem.I would not recommend this product at all...
