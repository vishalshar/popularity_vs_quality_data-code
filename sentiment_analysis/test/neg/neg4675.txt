I've had the drone for a couple months now, and I sort of regret buying this unit. First off no live view of what the camera see's unless you buy their over priced VR goggles. So you could spend a bunch of time flying and come out with some of the worst footage because the leg of the drone or the propeller is in the shot the entire time. The last straw for me was, even in touch and go mode the thing does not operate as it should, and cannot even land properly for the most part. Out of 20 Landings 15 resulted in it crashing itself. And just recently as of yesterday I had it in touch and go mode, was about to land, hit hover mode and the unit goes into a wild circle at full speed, doesn't respond to commands, and then self destructs itself into a tree littering itself, the camera, and the propellers from 50 feet up all over the ground.. Pretty useless and unsafe to fly even in touch and go mode.. And let's not forget the forced tutorial in the beginning that nearly got a Black lab killed and me utterly scared. First time flying it, it forces you to go through a tutorial, As I started to fly the drone a dog came out of no where and was trying to jump at the unit. Because it was stuck in tutorial mode I could not land and turn off the drone. Terrible terrible and really bad for safety.. You guys have a lot of work to do over at ehang.
