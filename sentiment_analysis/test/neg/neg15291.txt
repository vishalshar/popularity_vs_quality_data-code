We live downtown on the eighth floor with slow elevators that break down a lot so potty training a puppy was too hard without finding an indoor solution. We started with PupHead grass which was working ok for us the first 10 months of potty training until our bulldog outgrew it and stared relieving himself on the sides of the grass, spilling onto the floor.We purchased this product hoping that it would be easier to clean & use by our bulldog. In theory the Pet Loo being raised was the solution since he'd have to hop on. However once he jumped off for the first time the grass went flying & freaked him out to the point he would only use the grass if we placed him on & took him off. We ended up using screws to keep the grass from moving but he'd still be shaking in fear every time we put him on it. We left it out for him for about a month to see if he'd warm up to it himself, meanwhile taking him on his daily walks 3x a day. He never did warm up to it but he did end up holding his bowels while we where at work.Cons:Poor design - grass has rubber backing which takes days to dry fully & still slips under the weight of heavy dogsHorrible smell - I rinsed every time I'd place him on it with water & clean in twice a week in the tub and it still smelled worse than the Puphead grassEye sore - other potty grass on the market don't look as cheap as this onePros:SInce our dog was petrified of the thing it actually ended up potty training him. We now just take him out 3-4 times a day & he's doing fine not having a place to go in the loft anymore.If I had to do it all over again I'd buy the larger version of the pup grass we had before which was a bit more expensive. We ended up tossing the Pet Loo this weekend.... I guess you get what you pay for.
