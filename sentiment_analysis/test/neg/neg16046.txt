I bought two. One for my husband, one for myself. When they work they are great. But out of the two I bought, one failed. The one that failed indicates there is a charge when plugged into an outlet, but when I connect it to a phone it doesn't work. I have tried different phones and different USB cables and plugged the phones into the working battery - the working battery charges the phones fine. It's like there is something loose in the port the USB cable is plugged into in the battery - but I'm not a technician so that's just a guess.To make matters worse the failure occurred over the course of one of our excursions.I've owned it about 6 months and used it over 3 to 4 multiple day excursions. That's not good enough for a "rugged water proof" product. I need a solution so will be buying something else, but not this.
