Reviews for Mac, Windows, and AndroidMy experience with this product is mostly from use on a Mac, however, I have also tested it with Windows and set it up with the Android appMac Review (Windows and Android reviews below)Works well, but lacking in security.Security Flaws (for Mac - which is in beta):- It does NOT actually lock your Mac (more details on this below and in video)- It does not lock the computer when the USB key is removedIt does NOT actually lock your Mac if you have auto unlock enabled.  I show this in the video.It shows a nice screen that basically says Hey, this computer is locked, hit enter to manually login but it can EASILY be bypassed simply by opening Mission Control, then using force-quit to free the mouse cursor.  I figured this out within less than a minute (seriously) of having the software installed.  Just pop open Mission Control, add a new desktop, and grab any windows you want to from the original desktop.  Or at that point you can just close the Gatekeeper program completely.  Wayyyyyy too easy to bypass.  It tries to lock the mouse cursor from moving but fails.  It might keep someone that just wants to quickly snoop on your stuff and that doesnt know anything about computers from getting in.  But its just a veil of security - and a very thin one at that.Locking with auto-unlock disabled works well, and takes you to the login screen.  Pairing was easy to do, and it locks/unlocks consistently - not securely, but consistently.Again, its in beta for Mac, so issues are understandable, and I had issues with it not recognizing the gatekeeper key, and required a system reboot.  But a flaw that turns a security-related product into basically no security at all, even in beta, is almost inexcusable.Suggestions:- Actually lock the computer by taking the user to the switch user screen or something (this may be difficult for the developer to do because of restrictions imposed on the OS by Apple - but please, dont try to sell a security product that isnt secure and doesnt do what it says it does).- A notification before locking, like on Windows, would be nice- PIN unlock, like in Windows, would also be nice- An option to lock the computer automatically (to login screen) when the USB key is removed would be coolRating:  2/5 stars - the lack of security is inexcusable for a product advertised as offering extra security.Windows ReviewWorks much better than Mac, and ACTUALLY locks the computer!  Takes you to the login screen and everything.  Signal strength is the same, functions basically the same as the Mac version, except it actually works, and has more features.One suggestion, like I mentioned above, would be:- An option to lock the computer automatically (to login screen) when the USB key is removed would be coolRating:  5/5 starsAndroid AppIt appears to be convenient, and would be - if it worked.  The Android app only functions to find your Gatekeeper in the event that it is misplaced.  It will make the gatekeeper beep, and the app will also beep and show you a meter based on signal strength.  However, it was difficult to pair the gatekeeper - it wouldnt show up in the device list, tried again later and still wouldnt, then tried again later and then it finally did.  I tested the locate function and it seemed to work well.  But the next day, I actually wanted to put it to the test.  I set the gatekeeper only 5-10ft away from me, and opened the app.  It couldnt find the gatekeeper.  Your key is out of range and cant be located.  Relaunched the app, rebooted the phone, still nothing even with proper permissions.  It simply could not find the gatekeeper.Rating:  1/5 starsOverall, 8/15 stars = .533333 which is a little bit lower than 3/5 stars.  However, the lack of security for Mac is inexcusable (I know its in beta, but please dont try to pass off a completely non-functional product as even beta when peoples security-critical data could be at stake), and the Android app just didnt do its job at all in my case.  So I took off another star, for 2/5 stars.  I would be glad to change this review if they can fix these issues, and they say that a new Mac version will be available in the coming months.  So hopefully that fixes the Mac problem, and they can fix the android issues as well.
