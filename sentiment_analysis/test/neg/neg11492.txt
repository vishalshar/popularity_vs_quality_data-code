These are the worst underwear that I have ever purchased. I normally wear Saxx but I thought I would give these are try. When I opened the package a chemical smell came out, I left them laying to air out but they stink. So I tried them on just to see and they were so uncomfortable. The ridge of the pouch rubbed. They need to go back to the drawing board. There are better choices such as Saxx, Separatec and 2undr.
