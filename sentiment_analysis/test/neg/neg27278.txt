Great idea, beautifully designed, excellent packaging, slick advertising, responsive email support, a hit for gadget freeks like me...but pretty much unusable.  I love this product.  One of the best gadgets I've seen.  It is small, has two rechargable batteries, very nice design, and a great idea.  However, it uses bluetooth, wifi and 2-g cell data access to work, and even then it is very, very slow.I bought this because it looked like a great idea, cool gadget, and might help me track my puppy when she gets out of sight  However, it takes forever to find the unit and usually says it can't find a 2-G network, or is out of wifi range (most of our property, and the battery is dead (when it isn't).  Regretfully, I will be returning this, but it's a great effort.  For under $50 a year it would have been a good way to monitor the activity of our puppy.  But it does not do that.  Yup, after a half hour it let me know that she was out of the "safe zone" (my wife took her for a walk, so I already knew that, and after she got home and was by my side, it notified me that she had returned to the zone.  Not helpful.  I am hopefull that this talented company will improve on the technology, for their design is excellent, their idea is great, but it needs to be worked on.
