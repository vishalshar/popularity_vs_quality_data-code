The build quality on this lock is seriously awful. I've gone through two locks (the second seems to be working okay electronically, though it makes a disturbing rattling noise when it closes. The first one was going through batteries too fast because of problems with the internal gearing, it didn't "auto unlock" reliably, and it didn't connect to an Apple TV as advertised---more on that in a moment). I'm now (I hope) on my third keypad. The first failed outright after a few months (not surprising, they're made out of cheap plastic that you wouldn't expect to last long out of doors), the replacement was defective out of the box (the motion sensor that turns on the backlight---critical at night if you forget to turn your porch light on---didn't work). We'll see if I'll get a third one. I'm still talking to August's miserable tech support. When you call into tech support, you get put on hold for half an hour, and are then connected to people reading scripts (in Texas---I asked). They make you jump through ridiculous hoops that clearly don't have anything to do with the problem. Once you've wasted half an hour or so doing that, they'll reluctantly "escalate" to tier two by sending a text message to somebody in California (yes, I asked) who may or may not respond in a timely way. At least once, the California guy didn't respond at all, which left the guy in Texas completely flummoxed.Also, the lock is useless over the internet. The August Connect is complete garbage: unreliable at best, and it usually won't connect to the lock at all. The original lock did NOT talk to my 3rd Gen Apple TV (Model #A1427), though the docs and literature both claim that it will. I haven't tried that with the replacement, yet. August tech support is, yet again, worthless. Email tech support say it's Apple's fault and they won't address the issue at all. Took half an hour to get through to a tech on the phone, who downloaded the lock's internal logs, but he never got back to me as promised and has no direct phone line.If you need internet connectivity, look elsewhere. Frankly, I'd go with the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt with Century Trim in Satin Nickel (BE479 CEN 619) if you don't need the auto-unlock feature. If Schlage adds auto-unlock, I'll replace the August in a heartbeat.
