This lid is baffling: the construction is very solid, and it includes a separate rubber seal on the rim so it should be leakproof.  But, the pop top opens waaay to easily, and the entire pouring lid assembly comes off way too easily.It seems like maybe this is a good design, but quality control is not sufficient.  At any rate, I'm disappointed that I wasted $8 on this lid.
