My son needed a towel to lay on for rest time in Kindergarten and I was excited to find this one. It's oversized and has a pillow. However, the first time we washed it, we followed the directions - used a delicate wash cycle and dried on low and the zipper for the pillow broke in the dryer. Now there is no way to secure the pillow inside of the towel. Considering the price tag, I expected better.
