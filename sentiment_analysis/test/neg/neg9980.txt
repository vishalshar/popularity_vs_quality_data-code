So I bought this after extensive research and reading reviews. I had a few things to fix and thought this would be the perfect fix. I first tried it on a leaky kitchen faucet. The faucet had cracked on the plastic handle so I took it apart, dried it 24 hours, cleaned the cracked area with alcohol and dried for another 24 hours. The Sugru was faily easy to use. Cured for 48 hours and the leack was simply smaller and when i rubbed the sugry to see if it stuck, it simply came off in pieces. Second fix was a plastic face plate that broke off at the screws that hold it into place that belongs to a kitchen air fryer. All that was required was adhering the screw tabs to the plate and it seemed to mold quite well. After a couple of days, again they fell off when I gave them a soft wiggle to see how strong they adhered. Third fix, my wife's iphone charging cable was cracked near the end. Just like in the Sugru pictures Tried to mold white sugru around the cable. It looked pretty for a week because now the sugru itself cracked with normal use....si now I need Sugru to fix the Sugru?  I am dissapointed that this stuff does not work on plastics as well as I thought it would because nowadays, what breaks that isn't plastic?  Would I buy this again? No. I regret buying it as it has been a costly trial and error adventure with this stuff. I will stick to my wife's glue gun or Gorilla glue as they are not as costly to use.
