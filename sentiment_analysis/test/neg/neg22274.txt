First bottle cracked so badly all the liquid leaked out. Tried the second one now and so far so good. Sent email to manufacturer about cracked bottle but it fell on deaf ears. No reply. I tried a second and third one, stupid me, they all split even with just water in them. This product is a scam. Don't buy one no matter how cheap they are unless you need expensive oak for your smoker. Can't believe AMAZON is associated with it.
