RUN AWAY FROM THIS POSI wanted to like it, but it does everything it can to make you hate it...First, the build/material quality is awful. The clear tank is uneven and rocks around, the white tray was warped, the lid is badly shaped. The rocks shipped with the unit are Not As Pictured, there was almost enough to cover the bottom 1-rock thick making this oddball tank look even worse. (Look at the pic I am including)Second, the design is lacking to the point of making it dysfunctional. The pump will not stay stuck to the 'glass', the way the tubing and wiring are supposed to run make it impossible to remove the tray without pulling the plumbing, as it is, out and feeding the power cord back through the tray... they could have had the tubing and cord run around the outside of the tray instead of in it, can't imagine why it was engineered like that.Third, and most important to myself, this is not a good hydro/aquaponic design. The water only touches the bottom 1/5 of the grow stones in the baskets leaving the top 4/5 dry. I guess you could adjust this by plugging the drain holes with taller tubes but then the water would probably fall back out of the slot the pump tube sits in. The instruction for the seeds have you smearing them on the top of the dry grow stones... seriously.There is absolutely NO Aeration in this setup. The drain holes are so close to the water line that no oxygenation is occurring from falling water; your plants and fish will die. I realize Beta fish don't need as much dissolved O2 in the water, but that means you can only use a Beta fish and your plants will have a very hard time pulling nutes. Without enough O2 in the water you will get anaerobic bacs and fungi really quickly. I managed to fit an airstone tube mashed in with the power cord for the pump but it had to be kinked and the tray fits even worse now.I thought the bad reviews on this were due to inexperienced users that may not have understood hydro/aquaponics, but really this is just terrible.I have built many hydro systems and am preparing to do an aquaponic build; I figured I could use this as a test bed for determining good PH/Nute values, but I think I am going to try to return this, even on sale it just isn't worth the parts it is made from.Save you money and time and just buy a little tank, pump, and grow tray. It shouldn't cost any more than this and will function better in every way.
