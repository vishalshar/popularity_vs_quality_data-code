Total setup disasterNo support in 4 days and 3 emailsTerrible Bluetooth connect issuesIn theory and by design a great attempt but total failure on support and the manual is useless amd doesn't support the basic operating instructionsThey blew itI wish I had seen the Wired review I would have never paid for these ... what a disappointment
