I bought these after watching a fun tutorial on brush cleaning from youtube by Michelle Phan (i think that's her name?)  quite a few of her tips are really fun so i thought, ok, she said her brushes dry in an hour or so, i'll try it.  My brushes remained wet for 2 days!  when i prop them to drain with my own little contraption of cotton pads and cups, they dry MUCH faster than with these brush guards!  if you have a second set of brushes to use while these are drying, go for it!  but do not think that your brushes will dry quickly with this at all.  they fit snuggly enough but the sizes were a little off for my particular brushes and the brushes would slide through and hit the bottom of the bowl or cup where i had them propped up.  it's not expensive so i'm not crying over losing $8 but still, my $8 would have been better spent on a dollar tree shopping spree than on brush guards.
