Very disappointed in this product and the service provided.  Despite contacting customer service several times via email, and attempting to call them at the number on the bottom of their email (came back as wrong #!), this does not work with my Craftsmen garage door opener.  The wires are aluminum instead of copper, so if you are putting into shared wire terminals they are always looser than the copper which is thicker.Nice concept, but I cant recommend this product.  We are returning this item.
