Update: unfortunately the box is leaking badly! The thermos part is leaking no mater how carefully we closet it and the box itself is leaking. I uploaded photo were the box is closed and  you can see the space between the lid and the box. Yes, the box is heavy, but unfortunately not leakproof.Finally one box that fits all needs! It has part that can hold stews and compartment for fruits or something else. It does not fit in my son's lunch bag, so I'm going to buy for him a new bag, because I want all of his food, water, napkins and silverware to be in one place. It is expensive box, but seams of good quality and hopefully will last years.
