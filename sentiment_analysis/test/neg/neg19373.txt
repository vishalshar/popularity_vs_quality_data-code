The concept is interesting and the mushrooms grew without a problem; however, it's a one spawn growth and not worth it for the price, you can find a higher volume of mushrooms for cheaper at whole foods or another specialty store. Product is basically a gimmick; fun if you want to grow mushrooms but not useful for actually using them.
