This pkg came from China smashed to a pancake! I expected a game box from the photo - nope. Everything inside appears to be ok by just taking a few things out to check. This a Christmas gift ,so I am bummed it's not in normal quality condition. I hope the fun we have makes up for it. Positive: arrived earlier than the ETA.
