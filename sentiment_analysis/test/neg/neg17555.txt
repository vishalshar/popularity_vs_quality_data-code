I had this for 3 weeks and transferred my necessary data to it from an older one that my dog chewed on.  The previous one lasted 2+ years. This one fell apart after 3 weeks! I pulled it out of my Mac as usual, but only the tip came out, not the drive itself, exposing the drive to dust and the elements. At first I had to plug it into my USB port and gently push on the end until it registered on my Mac (the light comes on, but it is always red now). Finally, I put a tiny bit of glue around the edge to keep it on; the tip stays on, but I still must gently push the drive into the USB port to get it to register. I am disappointed and have already ordered a different flash drive. I will keep this a back up only, but won't order another one.
