I bought these for my 10 year old, so he wouldn't have to tie his sneakers and hence get me out of the house a little quicker ;). We used the "loose" method (video on website) and they fit great, he was able to get his feet in easy-peasy and they weren't tight at all. Right now, his feet are the same size as mine, so I tried them out... all was great.  I'm giving this product one star because HALF SNAPPED within A WEEK. He doesn't have wide feet, and the hickies were not tight at all. Boys are certainly a little rougher on sneakers, but it is comical how quickly these snapped. Considering how much they cost, I would not recommend this product to anyone with an active boy. We're back to old fashioned shoe laces (and patience while he ties 'em up!).
