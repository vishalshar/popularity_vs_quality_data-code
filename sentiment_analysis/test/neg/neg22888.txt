Leaks BADLY. After using this a couple of times, I ended up throwing it out because I was wearing more of my drink then ended up in my mouth. I use regular Ball brand wide mouth mason jars, but no matter how much I tried to adjust or tighten the seal, it leaked large amounts. Useless. I am going back to using the Cupow lids, even though they lack a cover for the opening.
