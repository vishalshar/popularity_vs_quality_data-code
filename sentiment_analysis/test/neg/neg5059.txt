OK -- this is an update to my earlier review.  I dropped my rating from 3 stars to 1 star, primarily because their customer support is not very supportive.  They have failed to get back to me in over a month, in spite of repeated tries.They did not include the strap that I could use for swimming -- and, though they promised a month ago to send one, they did not.The application is simplistic at best, and does not integrate with Google Fit on my Android Nexus 6P.  It constantly loses connectivity with my phone, without any notice, and I have to manually re-connect it, so the notifications features are pretty useless.The leather strap is treated with something that gave my wrist a rash.  I've never had this issue with any other watch that i've tried in the past.The app keeps no history, and only tracks steps.  It really does nothing else.  It would have more useful (and cheaper and less hassle) for me to simply keep a misfit in my pocket, and put on a real watch.  I wanted that perfect combination, but this is not it.I cannot recommend this watch at all.*****Earlier review (when I first got it, and provided 3 stars)I did say:  It's an OK watch, but it falls short of its marketing.It's a good looking watch, and the leather strap is nice, the analog Ux very cool.But, the accompanying app falls far short, especially on Android.  I was led to understand that the app would provide feedback for swimming, counting strokes and tempo. But, it barely tells one how many steps you take. If it would integrate with other third party apps, perhaps it could improve.The watch constantly loses connectivity with my Nexus 6P running Marshmallow, and I have to manually reconnect it whenever I've been away from the phone.For $300, I expected better.
