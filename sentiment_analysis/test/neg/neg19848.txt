I'm having a lot of problems with this. I bought two, one for each dog. First thing that became an issue is that the tracker for one dog continually tells me she is out of the Whistle zone when she is right next to me at home. This created a scary situation when I was at work one day and the teacher said she got out but was at home. Next, sense it works off of cell phone service/GPS, if you are close to mountains, they become useless. I live in Denver. We are often close to mountains. Now, the tracker that was giving me false alerts does not seem to be giving any notifications. Just yesterday we left the house with the dogs on a trip 2 hours from the house. I only got notifications from one dog's tracker. The other only says if it's on the charger and when fully charged, nothing else. I have realized I am past the return date by a couple of weeks so now I guess I have 2 very expensive items that are useless to me. I guess if you live and only visit flat lands they'd be great but not in Colorado.
