The idea of having various electronic circuits (latch, inverter, pulse, etc.) on chips that easily snap together magnetically is a great one. If all you want to do is snap the parts together in various orders to see what happens, and you don't mind being price-gouged, you might get some enjoyment out of this as you see how many different ways you can light the light, buzz the buzzer, move the servo arm, and run the motor. The magnetic connections don't always work well and sometimes some jiggling is needed to get the signal to pass from the battery through all of the connected chips. If you want to actually try some of the suggested "projects," however, you will quickly start wondering what the designers were smoking. The projects require you to scrounge up your own parts (tissue box for the robot's body, wheels cut out of cardboard, a "flame" cut out of tissue paper, etc.) and the results are dismally clumsy and fragile. I'd say this kit might be worth about a quarter of what they're charging for it. Save your money.
