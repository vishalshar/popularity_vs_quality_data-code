Got these delivered yesterday. First off the quality and sound on them are pretty good. However, I got constant disconnects from the ps4. My ps4 is literally less than 10ft away from where I sit. I tried changing the frequency from my router from 20mhz to 40mhz like some people mentioned on another forum, but still got disconnects.Maybe mine was faulty?The mute feature is cool, HOWEVER, when it would disconnect while muted it would unmute the mic when it connects automatically back on to the ps4. Which is not good at all.  When I use a gaming mic and I want that mic muted, it has to STAY muted. I don't want have to worry that my mic isn't being muted because it randomly disconnects from the PS4.In order to know if your mic is muted, you have to have the "Boom Microphone" attached and when it is muted it will light up blue at the tip of it. But what if I don't want to always use the boom microphone? I would literally have to disconnect the USB attachment to assure me that the mic is muted.The mute feature and privacy on a gaming headset is the most important thing to me, especially when you have kids in the house.They are also very bulky and heavy.
