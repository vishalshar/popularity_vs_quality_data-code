I had five of these, they looked beautiful in my newly decorated yard. I thought the expense was worth it. They didn't last a year. They did work well with the app. Had very few problems with that, but for the price of them, the fact that you can not replace the battery or that the company does not have a return policy is just not worth it. So disappointing because I bought them before they hit the market.
