UPDATE: After 1.5 months of use, I developed a rash. :( I contacted the company. I stopped using the regular. The company sent me samples of a "light" deodorant and deodorant without fragernce. I still keep getting a painful, red rash. This is so disappointing as this was a great deodorant for over a month. I'm giving two stars since the company sent free samples of others to try.PREVIOUS REVIEW:I love this deodorant!!!!!! I have been using toms and this is the bomb dot com compared to toms. It smells great and so do I. Love the natural ingredients. Highly recommend.
