I bought this with high hopes but unfortunately the appstore crashed every time I tried to download something and gave me error messages. I tried all the fixes from online and contacted support whose instructions were to download a developer file but they did not tell me how to install it. Amazon customer service was awesome and sent me a replacement (and return label for the first one). The replacement had the same problem! It might be that Amazon had a bad batch as others don't seem to have had this issue.
