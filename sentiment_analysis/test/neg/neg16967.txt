Terrible set up process.  From the start, this product would not reliably connect to wi-fi.  Tried multiple times, multiple locations.  Tried on Android phone first.  After a dozen unsuccessful attempts, tried on iPhone.  Was able to connect Hug to wi-fi on iPhone but when it came to pairing the sensor (miniHug), got a network error. Troubleshooting instructions from the manufacturer suggest that you rename/disable your 5GHz network.  We have a bunch of devices on the 5GHz band and did not want to reset every one of them.  A supposed cutting edge product like this should be able to distinguish between 2.4GHz and 5GHz.  This is getting returned.  Waste of time. Thumbs down!!
