I REALLY wanted to love this. Right from opening the box I was disappointed. First, I received a pebblebee that had a dead battery. I went out and bought a battery for 6.95 because I planned on taking this device on a trip with me the next day. When I finally got to turn it on it would not connect to my iPhone or iPad. Tried do what I could which was restarting both my mobiles, pebblebee device and app. Nothing. I emailed the company but I'm not expecting a response anytime soon. I read on the site they will charge you a restocking fee if it is returned.edit: no response from company. Returned the pebblebee and purchased tile instead.
