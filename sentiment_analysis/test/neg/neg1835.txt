The night our office was robbed the canary conveniently went offline. We installed our canary and it operated perfectly for two days. I would check in from home and see that everything was alright in my office. The night of the robbery the canary went "offline." This is the worst thing to happen to my family business in 10 years. I have no video footage of the act. Here's the fatal flaw of the Canary, there is no onboard video recording, the device must be connected to the internet to work in any capacity.This is such a serious oversight I can't believe it. When you browse the canary website, they are clearly a technology company first. They relish talking about the geekery of their product: the bluetooth, the motion alerts, air quality? blah blah; it's a good sell. But when it comes to the SECURITY there is very little substance on the website (a few buried articles in the help section). Wouldn't it be wonderful if this stupid device didn't need to stay on the internet and could record to internal memory if it was knocked offline? It can't. Wouldn't it be nice if it had an internal Li-Pro battery that could keep it running when the power goes out? It doesn't.FLAWS:Canary's site says when motion is detected the device notifies you, so then you can look and decide to call the cops. That's great if the thieves decide to rob you at 6pm when you've got your phone close by, but unfortunately most people are sleeping when they are robbed. There is no automated defense options. and, for people who habitually leave their phone in another room, forget it.You can't set it to sound the alarm on first unusual activity detection. No standalone automation.As mentioned, if the power or internet go out, you're SOL. No internal battery or video memory storage.No door/window triggers.The iPhone app has a BUG, when you toggle the app to set the Canary to "Away" mode (more strict motion notification), it often doesn't change and you have to repeat the process 2+ times, if it ever changes (i gave up sometimes when it just wouldn't do it).CONCLUSIONThis product is designed for tech dorks (like me) who are unlikely to ever get robbed in the first place (not me), and want another useless piece of BLUETOOTH enabled garbage that will allow them to spy on their pets.
