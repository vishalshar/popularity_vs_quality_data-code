I gave this phone to my girlfriend as a temporary phone and so far it has gone terribly. The gps is terrible and now she gets lost more than usual. The phone can barely be heard so everytime I call her she never hears it because the speakers are terrible,When she does pick up I can barely hear her and be able to commuicate accordingly. The camera is of the worst quality and always lags and the prcessing system is ofcourse terrible as well.the only pro the this phone has according to her is that it looks "cute".
