I first bought the D-Link water alarm. I set it up carefully in my basement and even tested it with a little water. Months later I added this Wi-Fi Siren. I set it up carefully in my kitchen, tweaked the settings with my smartphone to be sure the siren was loud enough. The green light gave me assurance that all was connected properly. I woke up in the morning, went to the kitchen and heard the beep from the water alarm in the basement. NOT A PEEP FROM THE SIREN. Sure enough, basement flooded by leaky washing machine hose. I'm glad the alarm worked, but the siren was apparently wasted money. My Wi-Fi was working fine. I did receive a notification on my smartphone once I turned it on.
