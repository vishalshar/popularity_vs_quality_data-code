I don't get all of the good reviews.  This product is crap.  My daughter loves to build things. I saw this on Shark Tank and bought it right away.My daughter got frustrated because the pieces weren't staying together.  I tried to help and has the same problem.  The motor is a joke.What a waste of money.  Back in the box to never be played with again.
