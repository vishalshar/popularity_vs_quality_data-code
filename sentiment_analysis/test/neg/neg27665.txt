The product arrived as described, no defects or anything. However, I found myself not using very often because it's hard to control. It doesn't traverse even small bumps and you need a large area to play with it because it's hard to control. If it would have only cost $40-$60 I wouldn't have quite the same buyers remorse that I have now.
