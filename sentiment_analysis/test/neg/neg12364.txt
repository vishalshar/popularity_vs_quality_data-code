I love the concept of these, and if you consider what an apple will cost you, the price is not unreasonable. The problem is that only about a third of the package can be eaten. Most of the chips are either burned or filled with so many seeds that there's not much apple surrounding it. If they had better quality control this would be a really great product.  (I get that they might be planning a product that includes the seeds, but I refuse to believe they're supposed to be burnt.  There is a difference between crispy and burnt, and these are definitely burnt.)
