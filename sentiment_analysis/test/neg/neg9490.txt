I had the polarpro filters for my Phantom 3 and loved them so when I saw these for the Mavic that I had pre-ordered I also pre-ordered these. I wasn't worried in the least and figured I could trust the product. Man, what a mistake that was. Tried these on the Mavic today for the first time and it was an epic fail. These slip on nice and snug.  too snug really.  Why too snug?  Because Polarpro wants you to put this on the lens AFTER the gimbal has already booted up and calibrated (when the motors are working, you know, to keep it stable?).  If you install it prior to powering/booting up (like I did at first) you'll get a gimbal overload message asking if you've forgotten to remove the bracket that keeps the gimbal in place . In other words, like other reviewers here have stated, if you DO install this after power-up you'll literally be fighting the gimbal motors to install it.  So think about it. The gimbal doesn't like the bracket that locks it in place to be on there (they built an error into the drone to prove it) and that thing's holding it completely stationary. How much do you think those motors are going to like your fingers manhandling that lens to mount these things (while they fight to rectify the problem your fingers are creating)?  Does Polarpro really expect people to repeat this process every time they fly?  Really? It's unfathomable to me that this ever hit the market. My guess is the only way this would work is if DJI were to provide an update which would essentially tell the motors there's a filter installed (adding weight).  Anyway, This might be easier on a phantom 3 or 4, but on the extremely small Mavic lens??.....There's no way I'm risking damaging those motors to use this.
