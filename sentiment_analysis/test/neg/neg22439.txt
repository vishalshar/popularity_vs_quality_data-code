Very disappointed in this product after testing it.  The battery lasts ~3 days at most for me, and the updates on your pets whereabouts do not come in a timely manner.  Ive gotten the error that it is having trouble finding my pet a few times and i live in a heavily populated area just outside a major city with good cell coverage.  We took the dog for a walk the other day and did not get an alert until we were very far away from his zone. He could be a half mile or more from the zone in the time it took to get an alert.  This device has also given false alarms placing him well outside the zone when he is sitting on the couch in the center of the zone.  The other night it took over an hour for it to let me know he had returned to his zone after we got home from taking him somewhere.  For something with a high monthly fee for tracking ($10 month to month) i would say this is not worth it at all.  Luckily i only got this for when im on vacation to check up on the dog and dont really depend on it...  Unfortunately if i go out of town for more than 2 days ill have to include the charger and now and  ill have to wonder if im even getting the right info from it.  I would rate it as better than nothing
