This product is mediocre. This nursing cover has an adjustable strap,  and something that the company refers to as " stiffening material" sawn into the top of the cover. The stiffening material forms  a half round stiff shape that allows you to look at your baby during nursing.Pros: it is nice to have the " window" to look at your baby. The adjustable strap is a convenient feature as well, and allows you to put it on quickly. The cover has a nice little drawstring storage bag. Reasonable price.Cons: the fabric is underwhelming, it looks and feels really cheap. The pattern is "blah", it looks like bedding. It is not super breathable,  my baby was overheating under it during a muggy day. On the other hand the fabric is not heavy enough, and would start flying and fluttering from the smallest wind gusts. The d rings on the strap did not hold their position well, and the strap kept loosening as I was feeding my baby. I had to constantly adjust the cover, hold it down, and fidget with it, all while trying to feed an active infant. It was a difficult task, and switching breasts was impossible without exposing myself. It was ironic that all my friends used simple receiving blankets to cover themselves, and had much less trouble, and I had to pay money to be frustrated by my especially designed product.
