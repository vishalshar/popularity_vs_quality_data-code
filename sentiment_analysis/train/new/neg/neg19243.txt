I had got these pacifiers at another store and they did awesome for me until the baby lost both of them. I then found them again on here. I received them. We had them for about 2 weeks and somehow the one part of the pacifier became detached from the other part. I'm pretty sure this is not normal and I was not happy to see that it broke the way it did. The baby could've choked on it!
