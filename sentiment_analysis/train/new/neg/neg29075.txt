I purchased 2 of these, given the high star rating, thinking they would be a great addition to my pantry for storing baby food.  Thankfully I only wasted the time to assemble one of them before I realized how poorly designed this product is.  It seems as though the shelves should "lock" into place, but they really don't.  Several times while trying to fill the silly thing, the middle shelf kept falling down, even though I had it "locked into place" just like the instructions said to do.  Not only that, once I had it completely full and the shelves were being held up by a miracle of God, I could barely get the thing to rotate.  Rotating this product from the bottom tier is nearly impossible.  I honestly thought about keeping the organizers and super-gluing the shelves in place, but then I decided that I would just return them for fear that it wouldn't work and I'd just be even more frustrated.  I have never returned anything I have purchased online, so this should tell you how disappointed I was with this product.  Just a warning out there to those reading these reviews:  Even if you follow the instructions to a T, the product still comes apart at the least little jostling, causing the shelves to fall; it's not "user error"...it's "product error."  I will be finding another system to use.
