Update 26 April 2015- just a month later and the rubber has split and is peeling.  Never even been in the dishwasher!  Just hand washed after use.  Baby is 6 months old and has no teeth.  Because it split and is peeling, we won't use it as it could trap bad things (bacteria) you don't want to have in baby's mouth.  It's dangerous.  Was good while it lasted, but I think a spoon should last over a month, with only occasional gentle use!  Rotating between the 4 baby spoons we have means this has only seen maybe a couple weeks of use in the grand scheme of things.  Maybe it was a defective spoon?  Built in obsolescence?  Are they the only made in the U.S. small baby spoon around?  We've got some of the recycled milk jug ones, but they are still too big for our little one... Hopefully our others hold up better.Old review:Made in the USA!  Now we don't have to worry about sticking something in our baby's mouth that was made in China out of who knows what.  They did stain with baby food carrots, but I think that'd happen to just about anything...It's so hard to find things for the baby that aren't made in China.  All the teething toys and spoons seemed to be made in China... so glad we found these!
