This is the 2nd teething necklace we've bought from this seller, "Art of cure". Its very pretty. However. The pictures make the beads seem a LOT larger than they really are. The individual beads are about50% smaller than the clasp. Which was not evident in the pictures. Another issue is that the clasp is so much bigger and heavier than the Amber beads that it always hangs in front and doesn't stay behind the neck like it's supposed to. The previous necklace we bought for our teething child was their three strand two color version. Again, it was BEAUTIFUL. But this too had some issues. As soon as the baby became aware of it and started to play with it, the beads started to come off. They were just too small and fragile. As the beads started to come off, this left a lot of string exposed and slack due to the way the string was woven in between the beads and NOT tied in between each bead. This caused the necklace to elongate, making it too long to wear and unsafe. I was able to take the slack out of the necklace but it was neither easy or intuitive enough that most people could figure out how to do the same. Last month, after having the necklace about 18months, it finally gave up the ghost and too many beads were missing for me to attempt to fix it, so we bought this one. Yes, two in the course of a year and a half for ONE baby/toddler.  For the reasons above, I am only giving this a 3 star rating, and will not be buying from this company again, in spite of the aesthetics of both necklaces. Pretty is as pretty does. So thanks Art of Cure, but unless these issues are fixed, I won't be a return customer.
