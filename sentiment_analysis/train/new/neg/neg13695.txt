the bear is fun, but the entire wand or plastic blower piece pops out too easily, even when not squeezed very hard; also, the bubble mix itself does not produce the best bubbles or last that long - we've improved it greatly by adding some water and baby bath soap, which produced fantastic bubbles. i would not actually recommend this product to others...
