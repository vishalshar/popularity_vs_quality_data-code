Having owned a couple Boppy nursing pillows, I was really excited to recieve this pillow.  We love our Boppys!  However, I am not thrilled with this iem.  The quality is just not what you would expect if you are a Boppy nursing pillow fan, particularly for the somewhat hefty price tag.  The fabric is not as heavy, soft or durable. The stuffing is somewhat stingy and moves around a bit so the pillow does not stay as full and fluffy and firm as you would hope.  I find the design (with the 2 seperate sections seperated by a seam) to be pointless, that spot with no pillow always got in my way when I was trying to sleep with it.  It is just not going to completely solve your pregnancy related sleeping issues, and although I doubt anything really would if you have the severity of sleeping difficulty and discomfort I was experiencing, I think you can get the same level or relief and sleeping assistance with a much less expensive body pillow or two.  I think this Boppy just isn't firm enough.  That being said, it has been a really nice "nursing in bed" pillow because I can wrap the small section up around behind my head and have the long section down around my waist, under my arm, with the baby lying on it to nurse him in bed.  Again, not worth the price tag, but a good use since I already paid for it.  Conclusion:  As I stated before, don't expect this to solve all your sleeping discomfort issues, depending on the severity, expect an over priced nursing pillow.
