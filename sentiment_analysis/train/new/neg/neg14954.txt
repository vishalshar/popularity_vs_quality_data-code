This carseat has a lot of room for improvement.-  It doesn't breathe. My baby ends up sweaty and hot after rides, even when I remove the foot muff. It also sits him in a very slouched position with his chin digging into his chest. Our Britax Companion never did that with our daughter.-  The sunshade is useless. It only covers about 75 degrees up (90 degrees being all the way up to the handle. It has a little pop out sunshade to cover more but that doesn't help really.-  I am pleased with the ease of installation (using the latch system) and leveling with the click of a button. I'm also hoping that after I remove the infant padding my baby will be more comfortable in it. The main reason I purchased this was because it works with my strollers (bumbleride and uppababy).The bottom line is that there are better infant carseats out there.
