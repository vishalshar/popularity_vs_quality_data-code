Ok, so I've been reading about the health hazards of using plastic to store food, to eat on, to drink from.... It can be all so overwhelming! Being a good mom (or at least trying to be) and wanting to protect our children, I bought these glass bottles for our boys 4 and 2 1/2. We received them a couple of days ago and was very excited about them. I read all the instructions, I put them in the dishwasher and got the boys milk ready. I gave it to both of them and they got really excited about them. They loved the color, the feel of the lining outside and the fact that they looked pretty cool. When it came time to drink from them, however, they looked at me a little perplexed. Now remember I read all the instructions so I did pinch the valve before they began to drink from it. Don't get me wrong, they CAN get milk from the sippy cup, it's just that after a couple of sips and a lot of hard sucking, their jaws get a little tired. As a result, they tend to drink about a 1/3 of their milk where as before they would drink all of their milk.UPDATE: Ok, so after really trying to use these sippy cups, I've come to the conclusion that they are just not for kids, at least not for my kids. My boys really can't drink from them. I actually have take out the silicone valve in order for them to drink. Unfortunately, when I do that the water just spill out if they set it down on its side. We use them to store water on rode trips but really, it's not very convenient and not what I had originally bought them for. I wouldn't buy again for this purpose.
