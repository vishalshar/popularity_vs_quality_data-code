I have the Jenny Lind crib & LOVE it. My two year old grew out of the pack n play changing table so I purchased this matching changing table for her room. Immediately disappointed. Defects/ gouges in the wood that were painted over that are directly on the front. (Hubby had already assembled so I'm not wasting his time by returning it). Then when I moved it against the wall my finger nail left a mark on the wood. Why is this piece so much cheaper in quality than the crib?! For the price, I was expecting higher quality. Two stars only because it does feel sturdy under my two year old who weighs 26lbs & for the storage space underneath. I was able to transfer all of the items out of the pack n play & still have some shelf space left.
