This mat is a great learning tool and is very interactive. However the mat I received was scratched in two spots. Also, the paint is flaking away from the mat and I haven't had it for 3 months! I'm sure that with continuous use most of the paint (and therefor pictures of the animals) will be gone very soon. Apparently not to be used on a daily basis. Upset that I paid so much for something that won't be used for long.
