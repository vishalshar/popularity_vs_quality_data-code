As foam tiles go, these are great. The size, quality, color and weight are good. They are durable and provide a good surface for my daughter to play on.I love that I can resize her play area as needed (reduce for company or increase for a play date)But if I were to do it again I'd order interlocking carpet tile. Even with the texture these provide, it is difficult for my daughter to crawl on these. I often need to move her to a nearby area rug. Carpet tiles would have been perfect.
