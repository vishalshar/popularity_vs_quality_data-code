This products needs a redesign, it does not fit the big bulk plastic shopping carts like Target's. I also used it in restaurants when I would place my baby on a highchair. Other than that it was great, it helped keep my baby from sliding around in the shopping carts and high chairs.  I personally never used the handle bar part. I like how easy I can roll it and stuff it into my diaper bag.
