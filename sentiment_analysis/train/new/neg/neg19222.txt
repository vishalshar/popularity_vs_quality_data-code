This whisk is no where near 9 inches long.  More like 7 inches and the "stainless steel" rusts if you leave it soaking.  Junk.  I have a true Stainless 9 - 1/4 and I wish I could remember where I got it from.  If you buy this, rinse immediately and dry immediately.  It is so difficult to get quality these days.
