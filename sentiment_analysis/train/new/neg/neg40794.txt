Lets start with its a $25 cup holder. Why did I buy it? Because I felt a $1200 stroller should come with one automatically and felt like it was missing. My main issue with the cup holder is that it's constantly popping off when I collapse the stroller to store in the trunk of my car. Since I have an suv I have to search for it under all my seats. It's projectory is quite impressive. Aside from that it does have a nice design and fits nicely with the style of the stroller. It even comes with an extra part for attaching it to a stokke that doesn't have a preexsisting slot for the cup holder. Just be careful with it.
