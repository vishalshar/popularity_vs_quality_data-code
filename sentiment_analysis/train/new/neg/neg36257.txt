The bookcase is sturdy and would have been excellent but arrived with the back panelTorn and unusable and the 2 permanent shelves were chipped .. The side panels were supposed to be labelled left and right but were not.. Assembly was easy and the parts all there. Too bad it was damaged. I am hopefulThe manufacturer will replace the parts  . If not disassembly and shipping of the 108 pound package will be tough on an old guy like me.Update today sept. 8. I contacted MDB by phone today and was promised that replacements for the damaged parts will be delivered in. 7 to 10 days.
