I find that the level 1 nipple is still too fast for my newborn, who is an eager eater. You really have to test the flow first. Usually before I I give it to her, I turn the full bottle upside down to check temperature and the milk just squirts fast before the seal. When this happens while I am actually giving it to her, she chokes and coughs because too much milk was coming into her mouth, kinda like an overactive let-down nipple. Since the milk is flowing too fast for the baby, she ends up getting uncomfortable gas. So it depends on what kind of an eater your baby is - if she is a "barracuda", it's gonna be a problem. So I switched to Dr. Brown's bottles, which works for her.I don't have any leakage problem like a lot of the reviewers mentioned, and these bottles with the wide rim are super easy to clean, the short built makes it stable and doesn't easily topple over ...I do like the Avent's manual/electric breast pump - so I am now using this set as milk storage bottles.
