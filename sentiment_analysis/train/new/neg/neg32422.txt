I bought these 2-pack baby burpies in green (owls and spots) and yellow (elephant & giraffe and spots). Both printed fabrics are really cute.They are made of nice fabric, are well made and the padded section in the middle absorbent of various baby liquids.I use them as burp cloths, under my baby in his bassinet as an extra layer and under my baby's head in his pram in case of any little accidents. They're very versatile.My biggest complaint is that these are advertised as made in USA (on Amazon and on the company's website), but clearly the company is in transition as in both the green pack and the yellow pack I received one cloth made in USA and one made in China. This is true of some of their other products I purchased too, thinking I was buying made in USA when in fact, they were made in China. This is why I have given only three stars.
