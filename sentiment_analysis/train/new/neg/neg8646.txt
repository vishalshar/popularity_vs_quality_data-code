The toy itself is fine. One must hit it very hard for things to open and equally hard to close it back, but we would have been fine with that, except that while trying to close the toy with her finger, our 9 month old got her finger trapped on a gap between the animal and the door and got a huge cut on her little finger that bled for 2 days. I understand that accidents happen, but this deep a cut should not happen when naturally playing with a toy. Watch out for those gaps. At least she got her finger out, which for a little while, was stuck there. I was starting to wonder how to get her finger out without hurting it even more when it thankfully slip away. Adding a picture of the damage to the images.
