We owned this seat for less than 24 hours if that tells you anything.  My husband spent almost an hour just getting the straps where they were supposed to go.  On top of that, it didn't fit very well in either of our vehicles (his F-150 or my '08 Jeep Liberty.)  We decided to spend a little extra and get a Britax since our daughter was only a few weeks from her 1st bday.  We love it, she loves it and everyone is happy.
