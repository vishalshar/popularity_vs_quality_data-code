This is a fantastic idea and good enough for the price point.  The changing pad is kind of silly - not very padded - but, it's nice if there's no where else to change the baby.  It could be improved if the pockets could be closed (creams swim around and could easily fall out).  The baggy thing is a fantastic idea, but poorly executed.  The roll is so tight in the little spot, they cannot be pulled out because the velcro closure pops open; a little zipped pouch would have been better.  The covers are also a bit flimsy, so they warp when it is filled with diapers, wipes, etc.  I don't have mine packed - 4-5 diapers, 1 small tube of Weleda, and 1 pack of wipes.I have two kids, however, so the idea that their diapering stuff is separated, but can be transported in one bag is invaluable.
