A cute toy, but the size threw me off when it arrived.  I'm annoyed with myself since I obviously failed to read the dimensions when I ordered, but I do feel like the picture and name of the toy are somewhat misleading.  Be aware that this toy cannot stand up on its own as pictured here, and it does not wobble back and forth on the base and then come back to center--it just constantly lists to the side.  The base is rounded, but also very narrow and the entire toy isn't even as tall as a Ticondaroga pencil.The size, coupled with the design, just doesn't make sense to me. I was looking for something that would stand on its own while the baby played with the beads.  Rather, this is an object that the baby must grab and hold with one hand in order to play with any beads--a somewhat impractical task, since grabbing it by the wires makes it hard to push the beads along.  In other words, it's a glorified, oversized rattle at the moment. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but it did serve as an important reminder to always carefully read  the description, including the dimensions, when making a purchase.
