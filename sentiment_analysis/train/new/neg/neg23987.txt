My 2 year old is absolutely thrilled with her costume, but it is very flimsy especially considering the $30 price tag. There is a belt with velcro on it that stuck to the flimsy red dress, a very thin felt-like material. It already snagged it upon taking it out of the packaging. She will have to wear something else underneath as the material is very thin, you can see her underwear right through it. Not to mention she will freeze if this is the only thing she has on. Sort of disappointed with this purchase. Wish I knew how to sew or I would have used my money to make a sturdier dress.
