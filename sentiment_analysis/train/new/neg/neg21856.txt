Regardless of some negative comments about it being thin, I bought this blanket because it's simple, cute, easy to match, and the most important, very cheap -- it was only about $7.50 when I placed order.Here are the truth: it IS very thin, much thinner than the other "Carters Snuggle Me Boa Blanket, Pink" at $14.99 at the same time. I would rather spent double to get the latter, which is very pretty, feels comfy and cozy, looks much higher end and good for a baby shower gift. Since I bought both for my own baby girl, I don't mind of keeping this thin blanket for warmer weather/temperature. But it's not just thin, the quality is not pleasing either - actually it's as fragile as it feels like. I barely used it within the past 1 and half months and washed it just twice (machine wash, normal setting of my new LG roller type washer), its corner at the bear face is already worn out. I come back to write this review and notice that the price is even enhanced to 20 dollars - Kidding me?Therefore, it's your choice to get this blanket if it's still below 8 dollars, but if it's $20, please don't waste your money and get the "Carters Snuggle Me Boa Blanket" at below link - I bet you'll be very happy with it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UD65L8/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
