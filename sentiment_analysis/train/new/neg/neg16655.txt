This is a really nice seat. BUT it wouldn't fit right in our 2010 Subaru Forester. Maybe if the little one would always be alone in the back seat? But The driver [or passenger] would always have to be short - as the front seat can't be very far back due to this seat's footprint when rear-facing. And it's really wide. It got great reviews and we had an earlier model of this seat several years ago for our first grandchild - that one had a smaller footprint. If you have the room in your car for this, you'll probably love it - and your baby/grandbaby probably will, too! These seats should come with more practical details to make the purchase of one much less daunting!
