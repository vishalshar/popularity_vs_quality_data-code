Ingenious design I put this crib together for one of my customers. What should have been a 15 minute job turned into an hour and a half. OK that did include unpacking everything putting it in the elevator that the box didn't fit in and up three flights in a townhouse. Also running down to my truck 2 different times for tools I shouldn't have needed. I had to shave close to 1/8" off the dowel for the front brace to allow the front rail to set properly so the screws would thread in the front rail. Also 4 of the nut ends which are imbedded into the rails were at such an angle I had to either straiten them with a punch, otherwise there would have been no way to screw these parts together. I would think most people would have packed it back up and returned it. I know my customers would have if they attempted assembling this crib.Would have been 5 stars if not for the PITAss and warped pieces.
