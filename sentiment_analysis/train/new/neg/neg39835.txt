The rocking horse is a nice quality - solid wood held together with screws (not allen-wrenched little deals).  It's a little tall for our 1 year old, but our 3 year old fits on it comfortably, so I think we have several years for both kids to enjoy it.  The design is simple and will be aesthetically pleasing as a piece brought out for Christmas-time once the kids outgrow it.  The polyurethane job on it is poor, however.  There are bubbles and drip marks, unfortunately in the most visible places - the seat and the rails.  Some of the stain was chipped off or absent right around where the neck meets the seat.  I can deal with all of that, but the smell of this horse is a problem.  The box arrived and I set it on a spare bed, and covered it with a blanket to hide it.  When I went to move it, the blankets surrounding the box smelled so strongly of chemicals (not polyurethane, but something else), that even after washing them, they stunk.  I put them out in the frozen air to try to drive out the smell - we'll see if they can be salvaged.  I put the open box outside to air it for more than a week, and brought it in to assemble the horse - very easy with good instructions.  I put it in our closet and covered it with a blanket for a couple of days, and a smell developed in our closet, and on that blanket, too.  I can smell something "off" when I walk into the living room where it sits.  I'm not sure why the smell is not clearing out, and worry about the mystery chemicals we could be inhaling.  If the smell doesn't dissipate, this will be a waste of money because it will surely have to go.  A shame, because it's a nice, simple little horse.
