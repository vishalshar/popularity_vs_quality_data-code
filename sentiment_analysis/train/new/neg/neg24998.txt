The only benefit of owning this baby monitor is that when it wakes me up for the 200th time in the middle of the night, I can search Amazon for reviews on this piece of junk and laugh out loud while reading. This is literally the most worthless piece of plastic and speaker I have ever owned.It beeps loudly and repetitively just like an alarm clock in the following scenarios:when you turn it onwhen you roll over in bedwhen the dog rolls over in bedwhen it even thinks it sees your cellphonewhen you use your electric toothbrushwhen you fluff your pillowIf you even think about sneezingIf it's 4am and your baby is finally sleeping soundlyIf it's 4:15 am and you are finally sleeping soundlyWhen you breatheThis thing is trash. in the words of another reviewer- if I can save just one poor parent from buying this- I can go to bed satisfied, knowing I made the world a better place- but not for long before this stupid monitor loses its mind and wakes me up.0 of five stars- would not recommendNow if only we could just get the monitor to sleep through the night.
