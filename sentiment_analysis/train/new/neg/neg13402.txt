I think the huge variation in reviews on this tub has to do with how different babies will sit in it. I too bought this one because it folded up under the sink and I didn't want to have to store it in the middle of our bathroom. It did the trick when our little guy was a newborn, BUT:- The water now barely covers him at 5 months (16 pounds! he's big). If you try to fill it higher, the water spills out through the hinges as everyone else has said- He bangs his head and feet on the hard plastic edges. He's active now and likes to splash the water. Problem is, the tub really isn't that big, and he wacks his head and feet on the tub and gets big red marks on his skin. He actually cried the other night when he hit his head.- The non-skid back really doesn't do the trick. He always ends up sliding sideways, and has done that since he was a newborn.Really though, overall we've been happy until now. I think it's just time to move on and for the price, it's been worth it for 5 months.
