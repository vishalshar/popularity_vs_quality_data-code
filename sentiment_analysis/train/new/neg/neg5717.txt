These are good for the price, but they will leak from around the legs... my son is chunky too and they still leaked out. I think its just the inferior gussets, not the sizing. Also, these seem to be tempermental in the washer. Will work well until after several washes then starts to leak worse. Of all the alvas though, the minky do work better IMO than the others.
