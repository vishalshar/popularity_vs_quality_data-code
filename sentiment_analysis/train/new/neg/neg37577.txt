Sizes are WAY off. Maybe try adding about 15 lbs to the suggested size to get a better idea of what size to get. My 3 1/2 year old son is 35 lbs and the mediums (20-25 lbs) are still a tad big on him. We just got them and he already had an accident and it leaked through(probably the leg hole is too loose) and got his shorts wet.My other suggestion is to take them off with the kid standing in the tub. In hindsight, that should have been common sense, but I pulled them down and a big puddle of pee spilled out onto the bathroom rug. I got a pack if the nylon and a pack of the vinyl so it still remains to be seen which is better, however, I do kind if wish I'd gotten smalls instead. I would hope he'd be potty trained by the time these fit him the way I imagine they should.
