It is nicely designed and produced. Good materials, good details, baby friendly. I have nothing to complain about this part. The problem is, the baby bed is still about half feet lower than your bed. So you can not simply halfway get up and take the baby close to you. You must lift the baby  to cross the lower bar first before you hold him close to you. This is just impossible for me after the C-section. My belly could not give much strength. I was annoyed for quite a few days. And decided leave the baby on our bed and drove away the dad to sofa.I wonder why it has to be lower for half feet. May be required by the regulation? Sometimes I feel the baby products have too much safe concern and sacrifice too much convenience. The life now is safer but unhappier.
