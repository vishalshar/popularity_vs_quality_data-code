The cover does what it's supposed to...covers the high chair.  The back of it drives me crazy.  The elastic is uneven.  Meaning, there is more elastic on the right side than on the left side, so when you see it from the back it looks uneven.  It's all gathered on the right side and there is NO gathering on the left...I guess it wouldn't be a problem if the high chair was always up against a wall, but it's pushed up to a center island in my kitchen and you ALWAYS see the back...  I should have returned it, but I didn't have the time.  My bad.
