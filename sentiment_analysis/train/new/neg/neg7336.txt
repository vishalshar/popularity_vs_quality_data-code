Let me first start by saying, I love this brand. I am the owner of a bamboo polka dot gunnapod, and thought it was amazing, so when I saw this fleece one, I had to have it for our cold New England winters! I am severely disappointed. The zippers are flimsy & cheap, the lining is poorly sewn, and now little strings from inside seam are getting caught in the main zipper. I know it's not a huge deal, but when you're trying to wrangle a wiggly baby before bedtime, it's just super frustrating. How can one brand have so many variables between lines?
