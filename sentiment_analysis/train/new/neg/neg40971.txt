These burp cloths are cute, but they are not that functional.  Sure, they absorb spit-up, but only a very minuscule amount.  They are very thin and do not last beyond one feeding/burp session.  They are also not very soft.  My husband is the type to not be bothered by many things, but he refuses to use these for our daughter because they feel too rough to him.  Right now, I use them under our daughter's chin to catch milk dribble because it seems wasteful to just throw them out.  I use a different cloth over my shoulder for burping or clean-up.
