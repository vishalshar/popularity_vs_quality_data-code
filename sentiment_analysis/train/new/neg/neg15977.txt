This was a good over all mattress.  There's nothing wrong with it.  But nothing great about it either.  It's kind of squeaky and has that "covered in plastic" feel even through a pad and sheet.  It's not just firm is STIFF and didn't seem very comfortable.  My next child will be getting a posturpedic or temperpedic model.
