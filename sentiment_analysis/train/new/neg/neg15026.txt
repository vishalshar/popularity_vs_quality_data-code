Overall, this seems like a decent console - I'd give it 2.5 stars if I was given the option, but rounded up to 3 stars to be nice.  It was made out of a plasticy-canvas material, so it was lightweight.  The velcro seemed nice and sturdy. The cup holder holes probably could only accomodate a regular sized water bottle or other slim drink cup - definitely nothing too wide like a super large water bottle or cup.  If I had one phrase to say to you as a potential purchaser, I would say - you get what you pay for.I had to return (thank goodness for the free return policy!) because this universal console did not fit my odd-shaped Stokke Xplory handle bars.  I ended up buying the stationary OEM Stokke cup holder, as it seems to be the only thing that fits that stroller.
