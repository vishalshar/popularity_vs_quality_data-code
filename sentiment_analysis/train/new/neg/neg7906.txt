What I like about it:- It has a small depth so putting her cookies in there wouldn't fall off the table.- Lightweight- Easy to cleanWhat I don't like about it:- Only works on hard surfaces; doesn't work on fabric tables (which almost all restaurant have cause they use table cloths)- My daughter figured out how to lift it off almost immediatelyI wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I think it's  better off buying one of those travel toddler seats instead. Much better of an investments cause they come with a table top anyway. Just as long as you're willing to lug it back and forth from the car ;DI've tried using the TableToppers that you stick onto the table. Same problem with that as with these. My daughter was able to lift it off easily and they don't stick onto table cloths. I think its easier to carry masking tape and taping a large piece of table mat instead. At least that MIGHT stay put. If not, maybe Duct tape lolMaybe this would work for my daughter when she gets older as we take her out so she has her own little table plate... so far it's just junk..
