I received the replacement for the 1st one received and it has the same issue. the fabric used to line the bed skirt (under the baby bed)) was also TORN all the way around the actual fabric.  I am very unhappy with this, the fabric used for the skirt and the quilt and bumper pads is great but the "pelon" type fabric used as filler for under the mattress is of very poor quality.  I am going to have to take it out and find a plain crib sheet and sew it into place.  For the price of this set you would hope that the quality was up to better standards.Would never buy this product from this mfgr again and will be telling others of my experience,
