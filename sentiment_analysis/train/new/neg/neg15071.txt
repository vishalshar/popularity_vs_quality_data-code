my daughter is 4 months and she hated tummy time.  I've tried the boppy pillow but she didn't like it until we tried this Tummytime Mat.  She doesn't play with anything that comes with this mat but the pillow helps props her up so she can look around.I gave this mat 3 stars because after just the 1st wash, gentle cycle with Dreft, the fabric looks pretty faded.  Plus, I had to borrow my husband's strong hands to fill the aquarium pouch.  From the picture, I thought the mat is somewhat cushioned but it doesn't.  The toys that come with this mat is pretty lame as well.
