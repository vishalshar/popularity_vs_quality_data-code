The good news: our baby latched on to these nipples like no other -- a quick, easy, natural, deep latch. We loved this bottle and nipple for about a week.The bad news: This bottle gave our baby lots of gas, and even affected her digestion. We thought it had to be something else, but it started pretty quickly after we switched to this bottle, and then went away when we switched to Dr. Brown's.She doesn't take to the Dr. Brown's nipple quite as well, but Dr. Browns doesn't give her gas, so it's an easy call for us. A bummer, because the shape, design and firmness of the nipple is awesome.Just goes to show that every baby is different, and every new parent should invest $50 or so in buying one bottle from basically all the players out there, and see what works for your baby. Good luck to all you parents out there!
