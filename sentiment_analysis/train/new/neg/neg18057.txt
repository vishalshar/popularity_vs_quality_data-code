This product would qualify for zero stars. The description promises way more than this delivers. This unit projects colorful stars onto the ceiling, and is bright enough to show well in a small dark room. However, the unit is so poorly built that it disintegrates in your hands - the top falls off, the top ring falls off, the wall comes off - an adult can put it back together and it still works, but it is a choking hazard for a baby. Also, despite the description, there is no music - this provides only lights. So it does not work for putting a baby to sleep. Do not recommend this, get a better unit with music!
