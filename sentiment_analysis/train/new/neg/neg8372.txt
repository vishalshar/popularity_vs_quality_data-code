I got this and it arrived fine. It looks nice, but unfortunately I will not be able to put it anywhere near my baby! It was going to be part of the nursery decor next to the crib! That will never happen! This product has an overwhelming chemical smell. I don't even feel safe putting dirty clothes in there, the chemical will probably still be on the clothes after washing! Buyer beware!! The hunt is on for another pink hamper!!! This is NOT the one.UPDATE: I wiped the hamper out with soap and water and aired it out. It sat aside for about 2 months before my baby arrived and the smell dissipated. It's not as smelly as it was and eventually I was able to use it. I would have liked to have found something else, but this served it's purpose. I wanted to update my review to be fair.
