I purchased this almost 4 years ago. The color and concept are nice. However, it is not sturdy. The drawers are constantly falling apart and I have tighten screws and use wood glue to hold it together. I purchased the crib which is very sturdy so I am wondering how they could ensure that the cribs are of the highest quality, but this chest is falling apart? I would think it would have latest a few years without collapsing on me. I am looking to find another chest in Cognac to match  the toddler bed:(Update: I found a high quality piece at a furniture store to replace this piece of garbage. HOWEVER, now the dresser combo I purchased from Storkcraft at the same time I purchased this chest is falling apart. Wow! The customer service response was: 11/1/2016Our units do not have universal parts unfortunately, however if customer's purchase these and there are issues they would be advised to return to the retailer. Please be advised that that unit may also come out of the return warehouse.SERIOUSLY????  I am totally confused. The instructions state do not return to the retailer but call the manufacturer, now they are telling me  to return to the retailer? The trust is gone! Purchase high-quality wood products from a furniture store instead. Wasted $$$, but I will be sure to SPREAD the word on all of the websites that I can find so that other consumers do not have to deal with this GARBAGE. It would be one thing for the poor quality furniture, but the HORRIBLE customer service? Really? No Thank you!
