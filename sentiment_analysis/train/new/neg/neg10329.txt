This crib is beautiful, reasonably priced, and sturdy. We set it up one afternoon and were satisfied with it, so we broke down the packaging and left to run errands. We returned a couple hours later and the entire nursery reeked horribly of paint fumes--bad enough to give me a headache. We tried airing the crib out in our garage for six weeks, and while the smell improved, it is definitely still there. I just could not put my baby in a crib that smelled so strongly of paint, so we ended up ordering an entirely different crib and are now stuck with this one because we can't return it. Lesson learned.
