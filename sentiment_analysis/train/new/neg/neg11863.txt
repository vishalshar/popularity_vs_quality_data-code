I was disappointed when I removed the polyester fabric to wash it and realized that the mattress rests on an MDF board.  I called the manufacturer to see learn whether formaldehyde is used on the mattress support and they confirmed that a low level of formaldehyde is used in the base (conforms to CARB Phase 2 regulations).I feel incredibly disappointed.  The Amazon website as well as BabyBjorn's website spell out every single material used in the cradle, yet somehow the information about MDF in the mattress support is omitted.I know that most people probably don't care about low levels of formaldehyde in baby products.  But I wanted to post this in case you (like me) are choosing this product because it is marketed as nontoxic.I would have chosen a different cradle if I  had known the mattress rests on a board made with formaldehyde.
