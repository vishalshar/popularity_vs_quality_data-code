I don't know about the stairs at your house, but ours are the same width at the top as they are at the bottom.  I bought this value pack because I thought it would have everything I needed to install two gates.  However, because I needed both extenders for one gate, I am left with a second gate that is too short.  I now have to purchase additional extenders, which are overpriced.  I see now that the picture shows very clearly what I get in the package, but at the time, I didn't realize that I wouldn't have enough.That being said, the gates work well.  They are easy enough to unlatch one handed while you are toting a 25 pound baby and her various necessities up the stairs in the middle of the night.  They sometimes do not automatically latch if you just let them go behind you, but a gentle push will make sure that they lock.  They were easy to install (we used the pressure method) and I don't think that they are going to do any damage to the walls or baseboard.Overall, they are adequate for our needs and I predict that they will last a while.
