It was disappointing to see that the "red" is actually a muddy, brownish maroon -- not the bright, eye-catching fire engine red shown in the photos.  Also, the car's "squeaker" doesn't work -- it's just a big blob that does nothing.  And what's this bell other reviewers mentioned?  Mine has no bell.  Perhaps mine was a product of poor quality control, perhaps it was stored improperly awaiting a buyer.  Either way, I'll be looking for a better toy company next time.
