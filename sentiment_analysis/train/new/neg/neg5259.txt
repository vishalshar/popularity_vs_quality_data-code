I started to cloth diaper my son when he was six months old, so I was a little late in the game BUT I did do research before I bought and decided to use a combination system of Thirsties Duo Diapers, and gDiapers (using both the reusable cloth and disposable inserts.)  My favorite part about the gDiaper is that the velcro tabs attach in the back, where my son can't reach them to take off his diapers (he's now 11 months old and has done this at least five times.)  My least favorite part is the durability.  I own 10 gDiaper covers and after only four months, the velcro tabs are no longer sticking practically at all, and the rubber inserts are just falling apart.  The newest set that I bought here on Amazon, out of the two that came in the box one is already have velcro issues.  I followed the washing and drying instructions to the "t", have attempted stripping the velcro to get it to stick again, and nothing has worked.  I know other people have had a great experience with these diapers, but mine just has not been that positive.  So much for being able to use these covers for a second child in the future.
