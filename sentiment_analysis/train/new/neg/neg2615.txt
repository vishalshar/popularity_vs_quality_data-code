this product is by far the worse product i have ever bought and assembled. 1st of all the directions were off and the picture on  the box is different then the installation instructions. 2nd the set screw for the part that goes against the wall doesn't go in far enough i had to shorten it to accommodate the baseboard. 3rd i had to put a 1 1/2" piece of wood to make it work because the connecting pieces only work between the bars. If you buy this you better be a handy man because its a nite mare to assemble and no reading directions only pictures
