After reading rave reviews, I decided to give these bibs a try. I was disappointed by how hard and inflexible they are - I would not want them around my neck! I tried to return them to the seller, BabyHaven, and was informed after multiple email exchanges that they would not refund my money. Being an avid Amazon Prime user, I find that extremely frustrating.I'd only buy this bib if you're 100 percent sure it's the right option for your baby. I recommend the OXO Tot Roll up Bib. It's much more flexible and the hybrid fabric/ silicone combo is much more comfortable.
