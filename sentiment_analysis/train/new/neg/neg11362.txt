I thought I had written a review on this before, but I didn't see it, so....Our kids are messy eaters (common problem I imagine) we wanted to get them a placemat, but we wanted something educational and engaging, not something plain. This seemed perfect.It is really thin, very hard to clean, and the ink wears off very quickly, it had started to came off in a week, who swaths were gone in a month. I'll take a picture and upload it here, where did the ink go? My son's mouth maybe, that isn't good.I decided placemats weren't the thing, so many had bad reviews like this one. I got this "place tray" instead Placetrays ABC Toddler Tray Placemat months later it looks like the day we got it, very easy to clean.
