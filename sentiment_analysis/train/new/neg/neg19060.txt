I bought a book just like this one, but for an 'Aunt' not 'Grandma,' since it was from the same company I thought it would be of the same quality. Especially because the people receiving them are mother and daughter and surely will be seeing each others books. The one that said 'Aunt' on it was perfect but this one had a problem with the photo pages. Every other page was upside down. The photos have to be inserted from the top, not the side, so the ones that are upside down fall out. I had to put a bit of tape at the bottom to keep them in but now it is not longer the quality of gift I was looking to give. I don't know if this was just a fluke or if all the 'Grandma' books are like this but if the pages were right I would be totally satisfied with this product.
