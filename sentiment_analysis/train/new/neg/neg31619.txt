I didn't like my popular, brand name lightweight umbrella stroller because of the inaccesibility of the basket.  I researched and researched for something under $150 to use mainly as an indoor stroller- it came down to this and the City Mini Micro.  I purchased this stroller.  My baby seems super comfy/happy- he can pull up on the belly bar, the recline and sun shade are awesome, I LOVE the basket beneath.  What I don't love is the steering- although it pushes easily, it feels heavy and its just not as smooth as my big, outdoor stroller (heavier, but I can push with a fingertip!) or previous umbrella stroller.  I'm worried about how long this will hold up- it doesn't feel rickety, but not substantial either.  The brake is hard to disengage sometimes.  I wish it came in another dark color other than black- we bought Greenie and baby has put his mouth all over the bumper bar, so I'm sure I'll be cleaning the fabric frequently.  Overall OK stroller, fingers crossed it holds up and it will serve me well for the indoor use I purchased for.
