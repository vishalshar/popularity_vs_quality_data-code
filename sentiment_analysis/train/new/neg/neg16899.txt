I ordered this Nuby bowl set because they were listed as BPA free, and safe. Also, they appeared to be a nice size and of nice quality from the photo. What I received seems to be an "average" product and it does NOT say that it is BPA free on the packaging. The bowl set is made in China (I am trying to avoid products made there) and the colors of the bowls are different than pictured here, ours are green/yellow. I actually don't mind the color difference but thought that people should know. I would NEVER again pay this high (Approx $20) of a price for this typical set of bowls. If you want the standard feeding set that you can find in any discount department store, go ahead and buy this set.
