My little one LOVES Ni Hao Kai Lan so I thought this set would be ridiculously awesome.It's attractive but as a caveat, it's I think a 200 count so the sheets and pillow case are a bit rough.  The underside of the blanket is much softer but I didn't want my daughter sleeping on such rough sheets.  It worked out well since my daughter uses this blanket for the sofa and I keep the pillowcase as a spare.  A bit of a waste regarding the sheets but she sleeps in a twin bed anyhow.
