I was excited tp get this bag but then extremely disappointed when a zipper came off within ten minutes of having it out of the package. My favorite thing was probably the super cushy shoulder strap but I didnt like how narrow the bag is. If something is at the bottom it would seem difficult to get out. However, based solely on the quality of what I received, I am returning this bag and getting a different one. I'm sure there are lots of people though that have had a better experience than I did. It could be a good diaper bag in some cases i'm sure, just turned out not to be what I was looking for especially after it broke.
