I bought this walker thinking it would help my child through various phases of her development. First problem is that the walker is not height adjustable so my child wasn't able to use it until she reached a certain height. By the time she reached that height she was already cruising. I then converted the walker to cruiser mode but it was just awkward and bulky for my daughter to push around. Not to mention, the walker is difficult to turn and the wheels don't glide very well. I guess you get what you pay for.
