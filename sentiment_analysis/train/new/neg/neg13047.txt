This is a great bathtub...for older babies.  I wouldn't recommend for a newborn.  To difficult to use for a small baby.  I would put a towel in the tub so baby didn't slide, but she tends to pee right at the beginning of her bath getting the water dirty.  The way it is designed, the plug is in the middle.  When using for newborn one side is propped up making the drain ineffective.  So to get the dirty water out you have to lift screaming slippery baby out and dump water.  It's too much Hassel. I just bathe baby in sink for now.  The tub will be great when she is a little older though.  I will start using it again then.  One other problem it the legs are really difficult to fold back closed.  Every time it is a struggle and last time a piece of plastic snapped off.
