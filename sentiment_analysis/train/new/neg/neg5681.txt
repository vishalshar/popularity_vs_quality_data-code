Didn't really clean the nipples very well that I stuck in there and positioned it correctly to catch the water jet of the dishwasher. I had better success just placing the nipples directly on the plastic spokes of the top rack of the dishwasher. I got this to save some space in the dishwasher for other things but the idea didn't really work out. It might be useful for other things
