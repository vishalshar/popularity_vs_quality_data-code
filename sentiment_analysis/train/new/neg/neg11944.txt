Although it took some getting used to, we liked this bag after we found out the best way to organize it for us. The only problem is that after only 6 months of use the bag ripped along one of the seams and now the fabric is fraying. This bag was not cheap, and I expected better quality from Columbia. To get it replaced I have to pay to mail it to the company, and at their "sole discretion" they will either repair it, replace it, or send us something "of comparable style and color". hmmmm....not what I'd call good customer service :(
