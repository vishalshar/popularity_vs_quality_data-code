Good "first" chalk, but would not purchase again.Pros: Pretty colors, light enough to wash out of face/hands/clothes. Easy for one year old hands to hold, felt less concerned about this brand going into baby's mouth briefly than others. Good "first chalk" while learning what to do with it,Cons: Price: Too expensive and not enough to share easily, and every other child at the playground was attracted to this chalk. We've made more friends using the Crayola pack of 48 square shaped (no roll) sidewalk chalk. I keep bags of 3-4 pieces in the cabinet so we can easily grab one and go, and no tears if it's broken or shared. Now that our child knows not to put chalk in the mouth (usually!), Crayola is fine.
