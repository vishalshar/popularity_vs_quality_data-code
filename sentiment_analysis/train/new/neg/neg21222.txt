I ended up returning this. First of the all, I would not describe the color as gold. It is more of a khaki color which I didn't like, however, I was still willing to give it a try and get over the color. Unfortunately,  it did not meet my expectations. Although I love the pockets, this backpack is extremely heavy and sags when being worn making it very uncomfortable even when just my wallet was in this. I ended up purchasing a Belvah quilted backpack from Amazon which was half the price and I LOVE it. Fits everything I need with still feeling very light and comfortable.
