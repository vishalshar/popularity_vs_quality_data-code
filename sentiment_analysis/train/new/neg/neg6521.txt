So, you can't argue much about a stuffed animal net. However, having owned a few in my day, I'd have to say this one wasn't what I was expecting it to be.First of all, it's shaped like a circle, not a triangle like they usually are. And it doesn't have any eyelets to put the hook through. The netting feels a little flimsy and cheap. The border of the netting is stretchy like an elastic waistband, which I found to be rather strange. So setting it up was a little tricky.As you can see, it hold quite a bit of stuffed animals, except I wouldn't say it was "jumbo", like the description says. The netting ripped as I place stuffed animals in the net, so eyelets would've been helpful for that reason.All in all, although I wouldn't but it again or recommend it, it did the job so I can't complain.
