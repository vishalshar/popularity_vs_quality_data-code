In theory this is a good sturdy gate. Once we got it installed it is very secure. Unfortunately we had to take a hammer to the wall attachment because of what I can only assume is a manufacture error. The holes that the pins clip into are too close together making the latch not close. A significant safety flaw in a baby gate. We called Regalo and even had them send us a new piece thinking it was just ours. Unfortunately the new piece they sent was just as bad. And so my husband sat and pounded in the holes with a hammer until it the latch pins fit(see pic). Now it is installed and very secure but anything we have to take a hammer to is not getting a good rating in my book. Plus the plastic latch seems very flimsy and is often getting out of line making it not an easy gate to walk through (see pic). Frustrated by this purchase but we don't have many options for gates since we have a banister on one side of our stairs and wall on the otherEDITED: it's been 6 months and we couldn't be more disappointed in this gate. It has broken three times in the 6 months we have had it. I do not at all feel like this is safe for keeping my child from falling down the stairs. I have contacted customer service twice and both times did not receive an answer. I am very very disappointed. Please don't buy this product. Unsafe, hassle to install, and poor customer service. Done waste your money.
