I purchased these frames because we are a fan of Dr. Seuss. The frames arrived promptly however I noticed that the frames are stacked on top of each other during shipment. One of the frames had noticeable scratches from the other frame stacked on it. The material itself is cheap particle board and the paint appears to have a matte finish...it does smudge easily I found out the hard way. Overall, if you get the frames undamaged and on the wall, they look beautiful but just prepare yourself for the possibility they are scratched.
