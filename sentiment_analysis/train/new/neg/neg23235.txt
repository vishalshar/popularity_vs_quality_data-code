This is the only brand of washable nursing pads I have tried, but I definitely prefer disposables to these.I liked that they were less wasteful than disposables, they were relatively soft, and when they stayed in place they did absorb okay but definitely not for as long a time periods as disposables.For me they were not discrete under a bra due to their perfectly round shape which would bunch up, they tended to shift under nursing tops (when not wearing a separate bra) which meant I would leak on my sheets while sleeping, they retained a slightly sour milk smell even after repeated washing, and overall failed to perform as well as the disposables I tried (I liked both kinds of Lansinoh pads).
