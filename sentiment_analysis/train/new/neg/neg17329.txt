For the first 14 months of my daughters life, knowing only this product, I would have said it was fantastic! It did get the job done, at least somewhat, but after a trip to the ICU with RSV Bronchiolitis, we were introduced to a far superior aspirator and now I have to say that this is just okay in comparison.Having tried the different aspirator here are the differences I've noted:1) I dislike that the pieces come off so easily with the Nosefrida. I can't tell you how many times I'd be blowing my little ones nose and the tube would pop off of the main chamber, or the tip attachment would come off. This is really annoying when you've already got a flailing baby who wants the torture to be over as much as you do!2) I like that the other aspirator screws in instead of pops off like the Nosefrida does.3) Of greatest importance: The tip of the Nosefrida aspirator is so flat that its hard to get a good suction on baby's nose, which isn't easy to begin with when you have a baby who is strongly PROTESTING. The other aspirator goes INSIDE baby's nose. It works nearly as well as the suction machine in the hospital. We compared the two side by side while we were still there.While I will say that Nosefrida seemed fantastic, it was only because I knew of nothing else. May I recommend to you "Baby NasaKleen"?I feel like if we would had that one all along, we would not have had so much trouble clearing our baby's sinuses.Thank you.
