This product fit ou City Mini well enough and our 3y/o was just fine standing there, holding onto the push bar.  The problem came when we actually tried to the push the stroller.  You either have to walk with your legs comically far apart, or you can bend at the waist to get your arms far out in front so you have enough room to take human-sized steps.Maybe we're just too tall, or our stroller's push bar is too low, or some combination.  Maybe we've been walking wrong all along and a proper gait requires your feet to be at least 24" apart.Again, no fault with the product itself, really. The wheels glide nicely and turn well.  It seems sturdy enough.  We just can't make it practical.
