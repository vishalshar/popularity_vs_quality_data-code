I dont know what I could be doing wrong.  I tried this 5 times in 2 days and was very dissapointed.  I am really stressing trying to find a good thermos that works for my daughter at day care.  I dont microwave any of her food so I want to give her warm options at daycare.  I read all the great reviews and thought this would be perfect.  I boiled water put it in the cup for 12 minutes.  Heated the pasta to very hot and after dumping the water out of the thermos immediately put the pasta in so I would not let any heat escape.  I screwed the lid on tight and made sure it was on properly.  3 hours later the pasta is cold.  What am I doing wrong?? It must be me since so many people have had good experiences.  There are 4 hours between when I make lunch and my daughter eats there is no way this would stay warm for that long.  I think maybe liquids would stay warm in this but not regular foods.  Did I just get a faulty thermos?  I really wanted to keep this its really cute to.  My sister said stainless steel thermos's never worked for her either, maybe I will try the plastic insulated kind.REVIEW UPDATE 1/21/11Instead of returning this item I had amazon replace it.  I figured since so many people on so many websites gave this a good review that there must have been an issue with my food jar.  I am not entirely convinced that every reviewers food jar worked I really doubt some tested it before they sent there child out with it.  But like a said I ordered a replacement tested it last night 1/20/10 and it 4 hours later the food was still quite warm, perfect temperature for my 1 year old.  So I think that maybe my original food jar had a faulty vacuum which if it fails will not keep food warm.  I plan on testing it a few more times over the weekend before sending her out with it but it was warm at 2 hours and warm at 4 hours.  My first food jar didnt even keep the food warm for an hour.
