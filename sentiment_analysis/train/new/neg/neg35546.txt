I am not a germaphobe, but I do go grocery shopping a LOT, and want my baby to be comfortable and happy while I do it. I just used this for the first time last night as Zoe is just now sitting up, and I LOVE it! It is SO easy to put in the cart, and the leg holes matched up perfectly (at Super Target) and the little velcro stayed fastened. She looked so happy and I wasn't worried when she started sucking on the hand bar thing - because it was covered! By the way, I read another review that complained about the strap not being attached and another about this  being so bulky. I threw this in the trunk of my car and I usually park by the cart return thing, so I just grab a cart and put the pad on, put baby in and go! Not so hard and I'm not lugging around anything. And I did have to thread the strap through the 2 slits initially, but it stayed so it's not as if I have to do it every time. I don't think that's a problem either!UPDATE!!! Okay, now that I've had some time to use this more and baby is getting older and moves around more - I WISH I had spent a little extra money and gotten one of the covers that has elastic around the whole thing so that it's a tight fit. My baby wiggles and tries to stand (she's now 10 months old). The few places where there is velcro comes undone. I see kids in the nicer ones that conform to the seat area TIGHTLY - and I'm sad that I got this one. :-(
