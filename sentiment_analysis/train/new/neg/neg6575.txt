I love the leatherette fabric and the look of this seat, but it isn't a good seat for daily use. Babies are messy eaters and food gets in the crack between the metal frame and the leatherette. There is no way to prevent that from happening and you can't remove the fabric to clean it. Food also gets on the arms of the seat that sit on the counter. This is especially hard to clean because of the textured button right on the top of it. My daughter also kept pulling on the back rest since it velcros to the back. Other than being worried that she might break it, it always got dirty from her messy hands. I ended up returning the seat and ordering the Inglesina seat instead because you can wipe down the fabric or remove it completely to put it through the washer. The fabric completely covers the frame and there is a tray that prevents food from getting on and under the arms of the seat on the counter.
