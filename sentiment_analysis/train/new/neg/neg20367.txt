This mat is simply clear plastic with a sewn seam on the edge (not at all unlike a shower curtain) and seems flimsy. It smells terribly out of the package as it's "off gassing" so who knows what chemicals are on it. I expected something sturdier and better quality but I suppose it will serve it's purpose as a drop mat under the highchair to protect my new dining room rug. I'm not sending it back but I wouldn't order it again.
