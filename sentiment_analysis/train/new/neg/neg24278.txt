The word 'overnight' was misleading.  They seemed to work ok but were thinner than my Flip pads (and they look to be made the same).  These pads seemed more like a daytime booster pad.  It's just hard to tell when you have to buy CD products over the internet.  We don't have any local shops that sell them.  They even look thicker in the picture!  They look nice and plush in the photo.  In reality, these pads are thin.  And they are not cheap either!
