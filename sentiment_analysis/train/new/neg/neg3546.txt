is it not illegal to not declare that you are transporting seeds from one country to another, these seeds came almost 2 months after i ordered and no organic certification. on the declarations stamp on the package, it said the contents were a bag, not seeds. it was just a baggie with seeds, no markings except "cherry tomato" on the bag. i got about 30 seeds. didn't notice anywhere in the listing about being from singapore.
