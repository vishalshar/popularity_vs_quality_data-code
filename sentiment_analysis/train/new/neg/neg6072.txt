As first time parents, out of all the baby stuff we had to buy, this was definitely the most expensive and overpriced piece. I am definitely not into luxury goods, but after recommendations from friends, it seems like this was worth the price when you factor in our baby's safety and comfort. I also wanted something that is sturdy. As soon as we place our infant son in it, we threw this car seat was not working for us. He was so uncomfortable and cried the whole way home. Even now, he cannot stand to be in it for more than a few minutes.First of all, this whole system, considering how expensive it is, it not functional at all. Everything is a bit harder, heavier, and counter initiative. The car seat itself, is super heavy and very difficult to even carry from and to the car from our house, which really negates any benefits the 180 degree turn the Orbit system has. The car seat is also very deep, like big deep dish baby bowl. As a result offers no air ventilation or circulation for the baby, even in a very cold air conditioned car. Every time we take him out, he's drench with sweat; making long (over 30 minutes) trips very difficult. Also, he's only 2 months now and already feel very tight in it. The deep dish design doesn't give a lot of room for him to grow so we're not sure how much longer we can use it.Overall, with something this expensive, you would expect a premium product with amazing functionality, but this is not even on par with a car seat we bought to replace this for 1/5 of the price. It's really ridiculous and one of my biggest buying regrets.
