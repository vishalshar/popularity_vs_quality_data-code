I needed to fit 3 bands; wedding set and anniversary band. Not easy! Sizing at the jewelry store would have been $130, too much for now. There is one snuggie in this pack that fits all 3 bands, but it was so tight and big, I couldn't tolerate it. My husband "lopped" about 1/16" off of the length and filed the thickness of the snuggie down. I put it on all three bands, with the slit facing out. Now it's perfect, comfortable, stays in place, and keeps my anniversary band perfectly aligned with my wedding set bands.I priced a similar pkg at a local Claire's. Not as many in the pkg and it was $7.95 - way overpriced.Even with the modification, this was our best option. I ordered two more packs. My husband will modify the other two of the size I needed so I'll have backups if needed. There are several sizes to choose from in the pack. Some of the other ones would have worked. I wore one for a few days just on my wedding set. I didn't like it, but it did keep all 3 rings on my finger, which is the ultimate goal. It did pop off of my finger once, a little scary! I would certainly not trust them enough to go digging around at the beach, or ride some waves, but for ordinary things once modified, they should be just fine.I hope they will make these a bit "thinner" in the future. Our modified version is a 4 star. :-)2014 - For questions on what to use to file down the plastic - use a grinding tool, like a dremel tool. My original one is still on my finger, working just fine and comfortable. Backup still in my drawer for when I might need it.
