First off - these are great for every day use. I got the "liner" size since I was just looking for a pantyliner. There is no way that I would be able to use this for a regular "flow" day but they are pretty comfy. The only thing that was bugging me was that I could find anywhere about the materials that they use to make these. They do have a place on their website for diaper materials, but that didn't help me with this, so I wrote an email and this is the response that I got:"Materials composition for our feminine pads are:Shell - Face : 100% Polyester / Back : PolyurethaneLining : 100% PolyesterInner Layer : 66% Biconstituent Fiber (80% Polyester 20% Nylon) 34% Polyester"I personally use products that are of natural fibers (bamboo/hemp/cotton) - so now, that I have a pair of these - I'll use them but probably won't buy again. If you're not picky about fibers and such - it's an awesome product.
