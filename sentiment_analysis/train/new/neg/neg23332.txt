I purchased this seat after my daughter did not show an interest in inserts.  I liked it because of it's simple design, easily removed basin, and it appeared to be easy to clean.  However, I was not happy with this purchase.  First, since the splash guard is not removable, that makes it uncomfortable for use with girls.  Then, as any Mom who is potty training knows, you have the little one sitting on the seat for quite some time.  Since this seat is so small and hard, it made it very uncomfortable for her and therefore she did not want to use it.  Finally, the fact that the basin is easily removable, make that TOO easily removable.  My dauther would yank it out in a split second and cause a huge mess.  However, I think this could make a great seat to carry in your car for emergencies.  I put a plastic bag around the basin, put the basin in the seat and it's neat and great for use when stuck in traffic, "I HAVE TO GO NOW!" or when the public restroom is NOT something you'd like your child to use.
