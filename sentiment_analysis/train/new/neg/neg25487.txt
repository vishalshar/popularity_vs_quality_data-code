We registered for this high chair and, after using it for just a few months, are hugely disappointed. This chair is a total piece of junk. First, setting up and transitioning the chair is complicated (had to watch several YouTube videos to figure it out). Second, the top, inexplicably, became loose from the base and, despite two unhelpful calls with Bloom, has never been quite right.  The "egg" seat has been wobbly on the "stem" of the base and we've been unable to stabilize it.  Third, the smaller of the two trays snaps to the sides of the seat but for some reason has become uneven (one side is higher than the other) and we cannot fix it.  Fourth, the chair is VERY hard to clean, despite what seems online to be a very streamlined design.  The material of the seat cover is hard to wipe down and collects food.  The tray connections have tons of little grooves which collect food as well.  The chair is also clumsy and heavy to move around, despite how easy it looks to move on Bloom's website.  This high chair is an expensive, unsafe, wobbly, dirty mess.  We are giving it away today (perhaps to someone with a degree in mechanical engineering who can get it to work properly) and buying an inexpensive chair that at least we feel safe putting our child in.
