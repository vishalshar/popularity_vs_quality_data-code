I was looking for something to add to my diapers to boost them up over night.  I wanted to like these but the shape is not great.  They are too skinny to fold in half one way and too wide to the other.  You basically have to fold them in thirds which is pretty bulky.  Plus they are not as absorbent as the hemp inserts I bought from babykicks which I like much better.  They are soft though.
