I thought we had used the trailer up to 12 times but my husband says it was no more than 5, often no further than a few miles, and it is ruined.  The seat back the child leans against is torn from the bar at the top.  There is binding at the edge of the fabric that is the only thing holding it to the frame at all.  We've only used it to carry one child at a time, and she weighs under 30 lbs, less when we first bought this.I contacted the company through their website and they said to just try returning to the store.  They actually said they would have replaced it for me but are out of parts.  No offer to contact me when more were available or help in any other way, so I thought that was a stupid thing to say.It looks like I can't add a photo to the review, so I'll try putting it as a customer image at the top of the page.
