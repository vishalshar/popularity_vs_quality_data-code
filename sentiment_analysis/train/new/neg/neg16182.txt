Should have gone with the regular jumperoo.  This thing is not my favorite.  After reading so many great reviews, I thought I'd try it.  My baby likes it, I do not.  It's bulky and cumbersome, and moving it?  Good luck.  There needs to be better switches for adjusting the legs up and down, mine sticks, or will go too far up and come off completely.  There also needs to be a button to lengthen/shorten the 'walking' distance of the legs.  Even on the highest setting, my 6 month old's feet are flat on the floor, so I guess he won't be jumping in this jumperoo.  Just not a fan, which is disappointing.  Our oldest loved his rainforest one, should have just gotten a new one of those.
