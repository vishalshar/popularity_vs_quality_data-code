Not really sure what to do with these... After washing and drying, they shrank so much they're the size of washcloths. I'm really disappointed because they cost a lot of money, relatively speaking. They're not big enough to be burp cloths unless you use them as sort of a bib under baby's chin while they're feeding, but they're sooo tiny! Definitely disappointed! This is the first product review I have ever done in the 14+ months I've shopped on Amazon.
