I bought this while I was still pregnant. I heard good things about it, but really didn't have much knowledge around strollers. Now that I have a 6 month old and several new mommy friends, I can tell you that I absolutely wouldn't buy this stroller!Pros:1. Big wheels- we live in an urban area and wanted to be sure that we could navigate through the city parks and sidewalks.2. Seat that sits forwards, backwards, and reclines in a few positions. It was nice while he was tiny and as he grows. He loves facing out, but when he falls asleep I can easily tilt him back to be fully reclined.3. The memory foam seat. I wanted our kid to be comfy.4. The telescopic handle for my tall husband.5. the "auto" erect feature. When you flick over the clasp, the stroller 'pops' open.... most of the time!PS. The uppa baby stroller has all of these same perks, plus none of the cons.Cons:1. Pathetic sun canopy. Doesn't really cover babies face. Had to buy an after-market shade and it's a pain.2. The storage at the bottom of the stroller is useless. It's more like a shelf than a basket.3. It's difficult to open and close. It's very stiff, even 6 months later.4. The brakes do not work on hills!!5. You can only use one brand of car seat- MaxiCosi. This car seat is a complete piece of junk. It was recalled TWICE in the last TWO years.PS. The uppa baby stroller has all of these same perks, plus none of the cons.For $[...]  you can either buy this stroller or the UppaBaby! I highly recommend choosing something else. Even the BOB is better.
