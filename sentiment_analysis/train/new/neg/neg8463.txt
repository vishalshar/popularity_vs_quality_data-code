The Popsicle "stick" come out the Popsicle too easily. And the guard isn't wide enough to keep it from melting all over the child (and everything else). The plastic is hard where you can't pinch out or loosen the pops from the molds without setting them in some warm water... and that defeats the purpose. Finally, the sticks are short so the pop falls off once it melts at all! I have only used them once. It was fine with no other alternatives... but I probably won't use them again.
