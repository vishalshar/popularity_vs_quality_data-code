When we first bought this stroller, it was great. Easy to fold, lightweight. It is a little hard to get through doorways and you can't get it through most stores at the mall, but we still liked it. About 3 months after we purchased it the handle that lifts up for your child to get in, broke. So now it does not open. It has been a year and now the wheels wobble and it is hard to push. It can not make it over cracks in the side walk. I really think this is cheaply made. The baskets are worthless. They are sooooo small and hard to get to. I would do a lot of research before I purchased this stroller.
