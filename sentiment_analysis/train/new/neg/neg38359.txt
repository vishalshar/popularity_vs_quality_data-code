We've had this mattress for over two years now and I'm convinced it has played a role in our children's sleep issues. While I understand crib mattresses need to be firm, both of my children sleep considerably better on other, slightly softer mattresses. Obviously it is too late for me to return this, but I would advise against this mattress - the deceptive "soybean foam" is an added detractor.
