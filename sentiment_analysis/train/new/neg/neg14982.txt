Purchased this for my son's bed set, loved the print and decoration of it all, was very easy to assemble without even using the instructions, very self explanatory.... However, I ended up returning it after just one week. It sits lopsided when u put it on the crib, and it was VERY loud. The music is loud, winding it was loud, and the music plays at a fast speed which kept my son awake rather than soothing him to sleep.... If the manufacturer could fix these issues I'd repurchase in a heartbeat because I love the style.
