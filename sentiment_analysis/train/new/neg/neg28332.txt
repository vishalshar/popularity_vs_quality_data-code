I just bought this carseat at Costco for and my 2 1/2 year old.  Her head is pushed forward even when she isn't sleeping.  But when she is sleeping, her head falls completely forward, and it doesn't do that in other three carseats we have where she is able to turn her head to the side and rest it on the seat.  We took a several hour car trip shortly after we got it, and she complained about her neck hurting the whole time.  So I sat in the back with her and tried to make it as comfortable as I could.  Two days after we got home, she couldn't move her neck.  After tests for all kinds of potential health issues didn't find anything at all, the doctor said she probably just really hurt her neck in that seat.  He told me to get rid of the seat because anything that hurt her neck to the point that she couldn't put on a shirt or ride in the car because the bumps her her neck, is not safe for her. Don't buy this seat!
