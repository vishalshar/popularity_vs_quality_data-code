Brightly coloured and cushioned enough in case of falls or toppling over. This number mat was alot smaller than expected. Wish I had not bothered buying this one but the alphabet one instead as this is way too small even for just one baby to play on. May have to buy another set to add on in order to have more playing space. I bought this for my 6 month old girl to practice sitting on as it provides more cushion than just carpet incase she falls but found I could not turn away for even a second while she is playing on here as she could pull the piece up and start chewing on the knobbly edges. (Choking Hazard) So please be extra careful when leaving your baby to play on this. Beware and becareful to those who are considering buying this product.
