The ball that we received looks similar to the one pictured, but the packaging is completely different! It makes no mention of being non-toxic or BPA free. It just says "easy to hold", "squeaks when squeezed", "great for teething" , "made of soft vinyl" and "washable" and "soft and squeezable."  Plus it is made in China.  This is going back to Amazon. No thanks!
