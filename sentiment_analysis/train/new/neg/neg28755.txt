I thought the apple part of this toy was softer.  It is a hard plastic as well as the leaves.  I removed the ring on the top and my daughter likes to chew on the leaves, as they are textured.  She only holds on to it for a few minutes and moves on to something softer or chewier.  It may also be a bit too heavy for her as she's only four months.  Will be better for her in a few more monthes.
