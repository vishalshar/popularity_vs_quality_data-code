We have the Sir Leapsalot set by Wendy Bellissimo and we LOVED it at first. I'm writing the review here because the comforter is the same as the Starlight set. We washed the comforter as directed and it pilled immediately and looks terrible now. The back of the comforter doesn't seem to fit the front anymore, one side shrunk more than the other. Also, the comforter is a square shape, not a full-size toddler bed comforter as most crib sets include so we cannot use it once we move our baby to a toddler bed. I love the look of our set and the bumpers, curtains, sheets, and bed skirt are fine, but I am terribly disappointed in the comforter. We spent a huge amount of money on this set and I expected it to wear better. Our little one is only 9 months and I've already thrown away the comforter. For the money, it's just not worth it.
