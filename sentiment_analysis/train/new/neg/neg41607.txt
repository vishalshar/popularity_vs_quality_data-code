I am disappointed in this product...The description for it quotes that the wool is an inch deep but mine is not at all and also very thin and sparse - nothing like what I expected for Australian/NZ wool (I should know since I come from Australia) and nothing like the photo - the picture shows a lush sheepskin with the baby's hands disappearing in to the wool...a baby's hand/fingers would not disappear in to the one I received... not the quality which was described nor what I expected after reading the other reviews
