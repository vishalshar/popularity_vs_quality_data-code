These Dr. Brown nipples are different from the usual nipples we've always used, which usually come in a 2-pack. This 6-pack version has a large "3"  on the wider part of the nipple vs "Level 3" on the rim of the old nipples, which makes it easier to see. However, the rim now has notches on the underside. I'm not sure why they did this, because they now leak. They don't leak while feeding. However, if the baby doesn't finish, it leaks when you turn the bottle up again. We thought we didn't use it properly or didn't tighten the nipple well enough, but it didn't matter. It leaked for all 6 nipples.I'm not sure if the design of these nipples have been updated or if they're a different version that Amazon didn't differentiate the product name and description well enough. It simply came in a sealed, plastic bag inside a sealed cardboard box. I returned them and bought the 2-pack version with the retail packaging. No more leaking!
