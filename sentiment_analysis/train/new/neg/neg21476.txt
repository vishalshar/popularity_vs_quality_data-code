I have had this stroller for about a year and a half and really loved it in the begining.  I moved from Hawaii and when I began to run again the allignment issues (veers to the left) had gotten so bad that I would get blisters on my right thumb from holding it back.  I was going to buy a new stroller, but on a last ditch effort I took it to the local bike shop for a look.  The guy there had a jogging stroller himself and he worked on it.  He messed with the front tire (I had already tried to do the instructions to no avail) and he got it to go straight.  Now I enjoy running with all my blisters healing.  My daughter loves the pockets and the room she has (she is 2).
