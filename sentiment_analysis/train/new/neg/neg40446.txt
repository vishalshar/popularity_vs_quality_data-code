Ended up not using this. Seemed to be low quality. I can't see how you would consistently regulate the volume level. What's the max decibel level that should be pumped into the belly? I was afraid I would mess up the baby somehow. The company should consider a regulator / gate to ensure you don't exceed a certain level.
