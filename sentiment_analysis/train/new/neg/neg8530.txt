I purchased two of these to baby proof our home for our twin boys. At first I was really pleased. However, my boys started pulling on the gate and found out if they pulled hard enough it would open. This rendered the gate useless. I've returned both and am going to try a different brand altogether. Also I was really trying to avoid permanently installing a gate but I feel I have no option but to do so as the pressure mount would slip from time-to-time also causing the gate to be useless. The opening to walk through the gate is also quite narrow so it made it difficult when carrying laundry or really anything beyond yourself. Don't understand the amazing reviews as this gate is just OK.
