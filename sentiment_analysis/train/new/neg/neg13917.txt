I looked at several Ergo carriers before buying this one.  All of the other ones I looked at had a zippered pocket on the front.  This one does not have that.  It does function great as a carrier, but I am very disappointed that this particular model doesn't have what I thought was standard on all their carriers.  The pocket on the other carriers is large enough for keys, phone, a diaper and some wipes--very convenient.  The embroidery is not worth losing the pocket.
