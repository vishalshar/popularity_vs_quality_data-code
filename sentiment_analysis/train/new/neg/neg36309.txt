We had the worst experience ever with this seat!  It did not work with the latch system in my two year old Subaru so we had to use the seat belt technique.  The latch to push to loosen the seat belt in the chair was in a position that was difficult to reach and pinched my thumb several times.  The belt tightened by pulling down...which was next to impossible as there was no room to pull down when it was installed in the car.  The baby got stuck three times as the red release button would not release when pushed (in cold weather)...meaning we had to carefully drag him out from under the belt.  We came very close to cutting the belt on two occasions!  We finally gave up and returned to the item to Babies R Us...this took over an hour as they couldn't find the item number even with my receipt and we ended up losing our shipping cost and $10 coupon even though the product was clearly defective.  We purchased a Britax instead and it is awesome :)
