I got these replacement spouts, cause the ones that come with the cups kept breaking (too easy for my little one to chew through the spout)- but they don't really work and make it hard for my kid to get the milk out. I ended up transitioning her to a sippy cup with a harder spout- so she can't chew it... worked MUCH better. The original clear spout that comes on the sippy cup (nuk) were great as a starter cup- but my child has a lot of teeth and loves to chew. So lesson learned! These replacements were just odd and didn't flow the same- so she never really took to them- and when she tried, it kept getting sucked in like there was no air flow???
