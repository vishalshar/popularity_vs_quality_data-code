This product worked great the first day. The adhesive installed very easily and I allowed it to cure for 24 hours before activating the locks.  It worked great the first day until the adhesive starting shifting around and the locks  would no longer lock!! Good thing the kit came with screws for installation as well.  I'll have to remount them using the screws instead of the adhesive. The lock itself is awesome! You can't see it from the outside at all.  You get a key with it and you simply touch it to the magnets in the lock through the cabinet door and they unlock.  Its really cool how they work. You don't even have to twist the key thing. Just a touch of the magnets releases the lock.  If the adhesive was much stronger I would have give this product a 5 star rating.  I'm sure once I mount these with screws they'll be perfect.
