The package and website says the Weather Shield WS1101 is "[c]ompatible with all BOB Sport Utility Stroller and Ironman single strollers."  Nonsense.  Each stroller is designed differently and BOB tried to make one thing do it all; they failed with this and the Ironman stroller.1) The front of the Weather Shield has a metal bar to prop it up in a tent-like fashion above the front wheel.  On the Ironman, the slots for this bar are nearly a foot closer than the bar was designed to fit.  I had to get a set of vice-grips and channel locks to bend the bar to fit.2) Once bent, the Shield is no longer snug at the front.  It does not fit under the front frame and there is nearly a six-inch gap above the front wheel.  So much for keeping wind and weather out in front.3) The whole cover 'drapes' over the stroller; it does not fit snugly at all.In sum, this is looks like a fancy $50 loose garbage bag on an Ironman stroller.  It does cover the child, but certainly not without modification and adjustment.  For the price, Bob should try to make one that actually fits the Ironman.
