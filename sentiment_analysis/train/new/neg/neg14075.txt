I own this steam sterilizer and the Munchkin brand. I prefer the Munchkin brand to this one mostly due to the fit of the lid. The Munchkin lid snaps onto the base in two places and feels very secure when carried by the top handle. This sterilizer's lid is far more fiddly to put on and feels much less secure. But, it will get the job done of steam sterilizing.
