Seems to work well on our hardwood floor for our infant to crawl around but there definitely was a smell to the mats.  I took them outside for a few days but the smell was still there.  After bringing them in and running an air cleaner the smell seems to be almost gone now after a few weeks.  I was going to return the product due to the smell but since the smell is almost gone now, I won't return it. Overall it works well...just the smell is/was bothersome.
