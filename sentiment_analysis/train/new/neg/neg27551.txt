The 2 previous reviews make good points. Mine is about the general uselessness of the item even IF it was a good idea - and the other 2 reviews raise excellent points.I bought this so I could see my rear-facing infant. First of all, it is next to impossible to install in about the most common SUV seen on the road (Ford Escape). Ours doesn't have a headrest in the middle...and the option we have according to the directions simply doesn't work. After getting creative, I was finally able to get the thing to stay put reliably. The second problem came when I went to actually use it to play music and the lightshow. I clicked the remote (the ONLY way to turn the sound and lights on) and nothing. It seems to want to work only if the moon is in the right position and you hold your face in a certain position. I am serious...the thing is a complete waste of money.Unfortunately, my husband tossed the box and the receipt by accident (didn't realise I wasn't done with it all yet) and now I can't return it. Grrrrrrrrrrrr.Save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do NOT buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
