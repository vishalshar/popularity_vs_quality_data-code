My husband and I purchased two of these gates when our first son started crawling. They  have worked very well for us (he's almost 2 now) until the other day when one of the locks broke in the locked position. (I was surprised to see so many posts today with the same story, yet this gate got great reviews last year)I had planned to contact the company, but it sounds like many people have gotten the 'run-around' in dealing with them.I agree with another post by the pediatrician...this is a great concern if you have to leave the gate closed in a locked position. Not only is a fire of concern, but having to climb over the gate with my baby (6 months) requires a bit of acrobatic skill. Given the gate is at the top of a stairway, I'm hesitant to climb over it with a baby in tow, so now, we leave the gate open, which defeats the purpose of the gate in the first place. Frustrating, to say the least.I guess we'll be looking for another gate since we'll need one in place for at least another 2 years.
