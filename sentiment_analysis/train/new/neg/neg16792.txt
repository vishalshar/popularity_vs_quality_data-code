We bought this for our son before he was born, and found over the course of several months that we couldn't get accurate readings with it. Our doctor recommended rectal readings as the most accurate. We took his advice and switched to using a rectal thermometer, and have never had a problem since.Three star rating because it works, just not as well as other methods.
