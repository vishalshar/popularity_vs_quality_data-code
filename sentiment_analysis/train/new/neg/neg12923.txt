Poor quality.  2 stars instead of 1 because it was cheap.  You get what you pay for.  As many reviews mention, it's very easy to scratch the coating.  Had a couple of scratches already out-of-the-box.  The cam lock screws/nuts don't tighten very well.  You'd do better to get an Ikea dresser.USE YOUR WALL ANCHOR!  Not heavy enough to reliably stand on its own and not have to worry about tipping when the drawers are opened.Interesting to note...we got this to match the DaVinci convertible crib/bed.  While the cam lock screws and nuts from the crib had the same problem, the coating on the crib isn't scratching off easily like the dresser, even though it seem to be the same surface.
