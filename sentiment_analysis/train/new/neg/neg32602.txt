This outfit is for a baby around 5-9 months of age. I ordered it for my 2 months old baby  photo shoot but when I received, it was so big! The description clearly says 0-9 months, so I gave it a chance. My baby is 9 lb and this outfit will most likely fit her when she is 5-6 months old or even bigger. The hat is huge and fit my friend's baby who is 12 months old. Also, the diaper cover doesn't have a slit for fastening a button. Overall, it's a cute prop for a photoshoot and I am going to work on it to make a hat smaller to fit my 2 months old baby.
