I bought this for a rear facing car seat (faces me when I walk).  It was okay, easy to put on the stroller and carset, but i figured it would get too time consuming having to put this on and off the carseat in order to move it to and from the car since it attaches to the stroller and the carseat.  It would probably work better for a system that was a stroller only as it is pictured.  Other than that it covers enough area to keep my baby out of the sun.
