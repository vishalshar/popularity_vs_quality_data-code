I bought three of these, two blue and one cream.  I like the cream flannel one better than the blue terry ones--the pattern on the terrycloth is printed and the paint is sort of stiff.  They are generously sized and soft.  However, I do not like that the two layers are not connected.  That makes them very bunchy which makes them annoying during diaper changes (which is what they are for!).  That said, they are for that reason convenient to stash in a small diaper bag because they fold up pretty well and don't have the tendency to re-fold themselves the way stiffer traveling changing pads do.  So I don't use them at home, but keep one in the diaper bag.  I haven't had any laundering issues, but I line-dry them.
