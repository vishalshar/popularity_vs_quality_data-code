This is a great toy in theory if it were more sturdy.  Over the course of 8 months I ended up purchasing 3 of these.The first the buzzer eventually stuck in place and wouldn't stop.The second just stopped working.The third the music sounds off.All three of these I replaced the batteries but nothing worked.  They were never dropped, thrown, and they never got wet they just quickly wore out.The positive is the features when they work.  One button makes the eyes light up, another makes the toy vibrate and buzz, and a third plays a variety of classical music.  My son was fascinated by the toy and the "ears" on the side are great for little hands to hold but are also designed to be gnawed on as a teether.The eyes blink but a nice touch is that they change how they blink depending on if you are just using the eyes blinking or if you add in music and or vibrating/buzzing.I am however surprised that this toy is listed as $20 and charging extra for shipping.  I bought these toys for $5 each at rite aid.  For the quality of the construction $5 is about right.
