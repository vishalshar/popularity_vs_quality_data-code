bought this item several months before my grandson was born. bouncer appeared to be well above average quality and workmanship. Bold colors, nice modern looking item. assembled without issue. I never tested the vibrate/music functions and now find they do not work properly. My grandson loves the bouncer....if you can get the switch to turn on. you press buttons and you press buttons. finally found that you roll a tissue in a ball, place it over the button and tape it in place to hold the button down. disappointed because it was a fairly expensive item. (price is about half now.) for the cost the quality control should be better, lesson learned. amazon customer service was great however i understand that because of the amount of time which has passed there isn't much they can do. next time test everything.
