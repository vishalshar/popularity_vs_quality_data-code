These diapers absorb well(much better than disposables) and are easy to care for. They are also soft on my baby's skin and keep him dry. He's never had a rash with these, and let's face it, they're super cute. For these reasons, I give the diaper 3 stars; I just wish I would be able to use them longer.The size 1 says it fits from 6-18 lbs, so after testing the absorbancy, I purchased 24 of them. This was a high up-front cost (almost 500 bucks}, but I planned to use them until he was around 9 months old or close to 18lbs. When we brought our baby home, he weighed 7 lbs. He was getting a rash from his disposable hospital diapers, so I attempted to put him in a Thirsties duo diaper. However, it was way too large for his 7lb body and left spaces for things to escape, even on the smallest setting. It also pulled at his umbilical cord stump and made it bleed, so we had to wait for his cord to fall out at 3 weeks of age to begin using these diapers. They were great at first, but he is now 12lbs and, although we have them on the largest setting, they are too small for him. When he moves around, the velcro just comes undone and- if the diaper doesn't come completely undone and fall off- he ends up leaking out of one or both sides. He is only 10 weeks old, so my $500 diaper stash was only good for 7 weeks.My son is in the 50th percentile for both height and weight for his age- completely average- so there is no reason why this diaper should no longer fit him at only 12 lbs. I would be understanding if he were around 15 or 16 lbs when it began to stop fitting, but it's absolutely ridiculous for these to stop fitting at only 12 lbs when Thirsties claims they last up to 18.I'm now stuck purchasing an entire new stash of diapers, and I won't be including any Thirsties diapers or products in my stash. This is really too bad, because I would love these diapers if they were only true to fit.
