Had this lunch box for less than a week and had to order something else. The clasps were impossible to open (I had to pry them open with a knife) and the top lid warped so that it wouldn't close properly. I always washed it by hand so it wasn't a dishwasher issue! Just such a pity since it was the right size and very cute, but just not worth it!
