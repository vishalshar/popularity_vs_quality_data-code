We've gone out almost everyday since I've purchased 2 of the tandem trailers!  My daughters, 6 and 4 years, love it.  It's great excercise for us, especially with the extra pounds on the back.I, like one of the other reviewers, have had problems with my seat turning and staying there whenever I make a turn.  The pivot point on the tandem looks like it's built to pivot up and down, left to right.  However, it is just to tight.  I suggested that my husband loosen the bolt but that causes the trailer to wobble to much.  I've learned to not make that many 90 degree turns!  I hope to contact the manufacturer and try to resolve the problem.  It looks like the washers might be on the wrong side of the connection.All that said, it is a great thing to be able to go bike riding with the kids and not have to worry about them riding their own bike and all the waiting for them to catch up.
