I have been using the Maclaren Techno XT since my son was a newborn and he is now one.  I bought this stroller specifically so that I could use it when he was a newborn and not have to buy an additional stroller when he got older.  It turned out that he hated laying all the way back when he was a newborn (we used a baby carrier instead) so I rarely used the stroller until he was closer to six months.  He is very happy in his stroller now.My main issue now is the straps.  It was totally fine in the summer when he was small but when it got cold out and I installed the Maclaren Footmuff (like a sleeping bag or Bundle Me) and a coat on my little guy, I had to make the straps longer but it has been a CHALLENGE!  My husband and our full time sitter tried to adjust them too and they can't extend the straps either. We've managed to strap my son in the stroller for the past few months, but what happens next winter when he's even bigger?  I'm very curious to know if other people have had a similar problem.  Also, the clasp is a little hard to release (you have to push both the front and back) but that isn't so much an issue for me, though my husband hates it.Other people noted that too many bags on the handles will make the stroller tip over without child and also there is no cup holder and the basket is small (and pretty much impossible to access if the seat is fully reclined).  These are all annoying but not that big of a deal for me.The PROS are that it's nice looking, easy to fold, not oversized or too heavy, durable (I take it everywhere in Brooklyn, NY), and really easy to push around.Overall I've been happy with the stroller but there are definitely some kinks to work out.
