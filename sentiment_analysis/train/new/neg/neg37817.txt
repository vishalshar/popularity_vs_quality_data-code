These are not "two" stickers, they are 2 sheets of about 12 stickers like you'd buy at wallmart.  They are not terrible stickers, mind you, and really compliment the Hot Wheels wall tracks we just got our son for christmas.  none of the stickers are bigger then maybe 2x3 inches or so, maybe a little more (i'm pretty terrible with guessing measurements...I don't regret this purchase, but was hoping for big stickers, like the size of a sheet of paper.
