I purchased these in hopes that it would really simplify pumping and feeding.The adapter is awesome, but if you get the blue cap box then you'll only receive one adapter. The white cap box has two adapters. I personally prefer two as I pump both breasts at the same time. But, I ordered two of these kits expecting to get two white cap kits and I received a white cap and a blue cap kit. Not what I wanted.The lid and ring system is great and doesn't leak when it's stored as stated in the directions (lid down), but guess what? Neither the white caps nor the blue caps work without leaking on the new Playtex Nursers that have the Twist-N-Click lock. I tested mine out various ways and they leak like crazy! In order for it not to leak, I have to remove the liner from the ring (with the milk still inside) and carefully transfer it to the bottle. Then, use the bottle like normal.This will still save you from having to buy special liners just for breastmilk, as you can still pump directly into the drop-ins and use them. This system may work better with older style bottles, but it does not work well with the newest style bottles.I still plan on using this system, but unfortunately I can't use it the way I'd intended.
