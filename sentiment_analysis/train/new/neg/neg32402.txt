I bought this and the NUK Trendline Silicone Spout Learner Cup, Blue/Orange Dots, 5-Ounce at the same time for my back-then 9.5 month boy.I like the design that my son doesn't have to suck hard on it. And this is the first one he actually tried to drink from it and resolve his resistance to sippy cups. so at first we like the green sprout first because he doesn't know how to get the water from the Nuk and green sprout sippy seems easier for him. But we noticed that he always cough after drinking from Green sprout because he doesn't know how to control the water flow so we decided to use Nuk. Anyway, we eventually favor NUK better than Green Sprout sippy for the following reasons:1. Green Sprout Sippy's handle is not removable. It makes it hard to put it in stroller cup holders, side pockets of a diaper bag, or my purse. With NUK, I can easily put it in my purse without worrying leaking.2. Green Sprout Sippy's lid is very very hard to open. I have to spend 2 to 3 minutes to open it so that I can wash.3. Green Sprout Sippy's water gets dirty easily because the food in my son's mouth gets into the cup easily during drinking. I felt I have to dump the filtered water and wash it after every use.4. As mentioned above, my son get minor choke when drinking from it in the beginning. Now he is used to NUK and grown up a little (11 month old), he doesn't get choke anymore.5. You have to watch the baby during drinking then close the "sippy mouth" so that he can play with it. otherwise, my son would throw the cup or tile the cup and the water just leaks all over the place.Now, it basically being idled and only be used when one time I couldn't find the Nuk one. For other failed sippies, I at least can use it to store cheerios or snakes but this one is too hard to open so I haven't found a better use of it.
