This cup was a great transition to a zippy cup for my children since the straws were small and easy to use. But they leak! I have purchased replacement straws and that seems to help but they are also a pain to clean and mold easily grows in the lids near the silicone seal ring. These cups don't last forever but I used them for a few months and they did the job nicely.
