Background: We had our first child in 2011, my wife nursed for 12 months.  We used a high end Madela pump for when she was at work, and for nighttime, once our daughter started sleeping through the night.  The Madela was a bit loud, a bit heavy.  We had twins in March 2015.  I wanted to see if there were something more portable, for my wife to use at work, quieter for use at night, and efficient.  The reviews were quite good and the price was right.  In the 8 months since we have been using the device it has failed twice now.  The first time within 3 months of purchase.  You cannot call, you have to email in your issue.  To the company's credit, they replaced the item back in June.  Last night, the replacement item, after 5 months of use failed.  A series of lights flicker on and off, and then it just shuts down.  We have it plugged into a high end surge protector, so not an issue of a surge frying the unit.1 Star, for poor quality control, 2 failures in 8 months, on 2 different units, this is unacceptable.  My wife woke up at 3 AM, she had to pump, was in a lot of pain, and the unit would not start.  She had to wake up our twins so that she could be relieved.I cannot in good faith recommend this product.  Avoid this product, as it's quality control, quality assurance systems are not up to snuff, and I would hate for some other family to go through what we have.  A pump needs to be 100% reliable, needs to be tested in the real world, with mothers trying their best to do it all.  Adding an unreliable pump  to the equation, nope, not a good idea.
