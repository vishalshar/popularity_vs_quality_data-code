It does the job, it's not fancy. It's a good buy for the buck. Haven't had any problems with it. My son is big for his age (7 mos, 21 lbs) and I don't think it will last much longer because the highest setting isn't that tall. They are not really clear about the limitations anywhere on the box. On the plus side, it frees you up a little from having to carry the baby around all the time.
