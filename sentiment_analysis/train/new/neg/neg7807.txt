My son loves his jumper!!! He plays with everything on it!!! He turns his swivel chair around and jumps up and down while smiling and laughing!I love the jumper except for one thing...the holes for his legs are somewhat tricky to get his legs into!!! Other than that He will sit in that for what seems like hours to me! I can get TONS of mommy things done while he keeps himself busy with his jumper!!!I love that they put a mirror on it!!! When he swivels his chair around and see's the mirror, he will stop and investigate the handsome little guy he is looking at!!! lol
