HORRIBLE RIPPED OUR LEATHER OFF THE SEAT!  We used these in a newer car with leather seats for about 8 months - and when we took them out they ripped the actual leather off our seats!  There is a terrible rubber-like material on the underside that apparently adheres to leather - we had no spills or other liquids touch it - it was in a secondary car that rarely had anyone on the backseat at all.  DO NOT BUY if you have leather!
