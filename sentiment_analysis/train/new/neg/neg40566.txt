We originally bought one of these in 2015 and were happy with it (even though belt routing is problematic, both in that it inhibits the harness and also in that the belt under tension does not lie flat on the back but actually protrudes somewhat into the kids back (using the latch tethers solves the issue in harness mode and it does not manifest when used as a booster)). This December we bought a second one (manufacturing date November 2016) for our other car. Unfortunately, Recaro decided to redesign the seat (cost savings?) such that it is essentially unusable for our kid. Our daughter is 3 years, 30 pounds and in the 30th percentile size-wise (hence on the low-end size and weight wise for harness mode). When using the seat for the first time she complained about pain and that it was pinching her legs. Recaro decided to shorten the strap for the bottom buckle to an absurdly short length. Even at her size, the plastic protrusions of the buckle pinch her femoral triangle (this is more pronounced than visible on the images when the harness is actually properly tightened). It is unclear to me how a regular sized three-year-old (not to speak of a 60+ pounds six-year-old) is actually supposed to use this seat now. Recaro customer support was of unhelpful. In a chat session, they asked to restate the complaint through their web form with images. The reply to that request was that the shorter strap was a "performance enhancement".The images show the difference between our first and second seat.
