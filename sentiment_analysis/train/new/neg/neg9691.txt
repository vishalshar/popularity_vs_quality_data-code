This crib is fine.  I have had no problems with it at all... but every time there is a crib recall in the US... it seems this crib is involved.  I have had to had parts replaced twice.  I have been stuck on the phone with this company for literally an hour trying to get the parts to fix it.  I have been given the advice,by Storkcraft employees, "Don't place your baby in this crib until you receive the parts.  You might want to buy another crib TO USE IN THE MEANTIME!"  Seriously?!  If I could afford two cribs, I would never have bought this one to begin with and just bought one that's SAFE.  The parts take forever to get here, and are confusing to install.  Just save yourself the time.
