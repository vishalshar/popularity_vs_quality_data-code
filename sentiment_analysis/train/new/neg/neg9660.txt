The description that this swing can hold a child up to 25 pounds isn't helpful and has hidden danger.  My baby is about six months old and weigh about 18 pounds.  At between four and five months, she began reaching for things.  One day, while I was not watching her, she reached back and stretched her hand.  Her palm was accidentally caught between the swing and the seat's frames.  The trap was so bad that it stopped the swing's momentum.  It was very painful for her and could have broken a bone or dislocated a joint.My recommendation to those who buy one is to be very careful using the swing when your child starts reaching.  If your kid is really active, perhaps stop using the swing.  Don't base your decision of weight recommendation.  This rocker swing has been one of the baby items that has been really useful to me and stop using the swing can be hard.  The main advantage for my baby has been helping her poop; she does her business more than 50% of the time sitting on the swing.
