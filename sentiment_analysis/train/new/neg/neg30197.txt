With twins we have been trying to find a hands free approach to feeding our babies. We have tried multiple devices and this was one we came across. It's similar to other holders like it, concept is the same but it did not perform as well as we would of liked.  The first thing is that the pillow the bottle rests on is way too stuffed, the bottle ends up tilted at a high angle which creates a high downward pressure. The elastic that holds the bottle is too tight. Lastly there is a velcro strap that goes behind the babies neck which is not recommended. Between the downward pressure, tight elastic and neck strap, it makes it almost impossible for the baby to push the bottle put of their mouth if they are done eating or choking. The bottle is pretty much forcefully kept in place instead of resting on the mouth.
