I had been looking for non-toxic rubber duckies for my baby's bathtime - she loves to chew on her traditional rubber ducks, which are made in China, smell like vinyl, and are probably covered with toxic paint. So I was thrilled to see these whimsical and supposedly non-toxic Boon Odd Ducks, and I ordered them with high hopes.However, they were a disappointment from the moment I opened the package. First of all, they had a very strong, nasty plastic smell. It was so unpleasant that I decided to leave them outside in the sun before I would let my baby play with them. It took a full week for the smell to lessen, and even now (two months later) it's still detectable. Regardless of what individual toxins these toys have tested free from, they are obviously leaching chemicals of some kind, and I'm not sure I trust them to be fully non-toxic.Furthermore, they are not as much fun as traditional rubber ducks. Their tall, stiff shapes make them unstable in the water, and they tend to fall over and float on their sides (especially the orange-and-white one). Their lack of pliability makes them less interesting to my baby. She mostly ignores them.And then - as the final straw - one of the four ducks recently began to leak. I can hear water sloshing inside it when I pick it up. So much for supposedly the supposedly sealed and hygienic aspect of these ducks! Now it is even worse than a regular rubber duck, because I have no way of cleaning out the stagnant water.So, although I really *wanted* to like these cute and creative rubber ducks, they have not lived up to my expectations, and I would not recommend them. (I sure wish someone made a good-quality rubber duck out of natural rubber latex...)
