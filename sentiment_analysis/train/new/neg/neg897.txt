I have purchased three of these in the past and am now about to purchase my fourth.  I am buying it because it is the best thing on the market for toddlers to preschoolers who aren't quite big enough to reach the kitchen table yet.  It is comfortable, sits securely on the chair and is about the right height for kids 18-24 months and up.That being said, it does have a few flaws. The first is that the sides tend to break and rip causing a big mess (and an ugly booster) over time.  It's still functional, but rather unsightly. I'm buying a new one now simply because I can't stand looking at it any more.The second flaw is that the foam used seems to react with the finish of my wooden kitchen chairs.  Over time it has stripped the finish off all the areas that it sits on.  For that reason,  I would not recommend it for frequent use on fine wooden furniture...
