Works great if you position it ABOVE the base plate so the foot rest panel sits on top of the base plate, but if you have to place the plate UNDER the plate (like it is positioned in the photo) then it is not nearly as stable.  The "locking pins" pop right out at the lightest pressure. The pins should be able to be locked closed to prevent this. I haven't decided if I will send this back to get zip ties to prevent the foot rest panel from slipping down.  I shouldn't have to do anything to it, for $60 it should work as advertised. I thought this would be a great item based on the reviews. Im extremely disappointed. I do not recommend unless you plan on using it for children with short legs and the foot rest can be paced on top, but when your child outgrows that position your stuck with an almost useless piece of expensive plastic.
