This is an adorable thermos and well sized for early on in starting solids.  The base circumference is similar to the insulated straw bottle.  My child usually eats only 3-4 oz at a time and so far, I found that even with pre-heating the jar, my piping hot 4 oz of mush will have cooled to a lukewarm easily after 2.5hrs.  I have not found any leaking issues (I tested with water).
