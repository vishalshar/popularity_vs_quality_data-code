I should have listened to the review that said it's too short. I didn't understand why it would need to be long since I have scrawny arms, but it is because you want to carry your car seat in the corner of the handle, not the middle. I have the Chico keyfit and since the handle curves fatter in the corners, you can only put this arm cushion right in the middle of the handle. I returned it.
