I bought this to make my son purees however it was such a waste of money since it doesn't puree smooth. It would leave a bit piece of meat in it all the time. So I switch to a normal blender with BPA free plastic, it was a hugh differences. I would not recommend to buy these baby food blenders,the power is not enough to make all the food smooth. I would spend on a normal blender to make baby food cause it's more powerful and makes the puree so smooth than it.
