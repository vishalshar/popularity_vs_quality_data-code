The bag is the perfect size and very cute. The external is the easy to clean plastic. However, the strap gets on my nerves! It is so wide and stiff that every time I pick up the bag, the strap is twisted. So with one hand on my purse and/or baby, I am trying to yank the bag into submission. And moms are always doing things one handed.  Also since the strap is so wide it falls off of my shoulder while I'm carrying baby. The bag is too small for such a wide strap. Needless to say, I have put the bag aside for something more one-handed mommy-friendly bags.
