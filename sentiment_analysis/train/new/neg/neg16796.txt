I cant say too much  bad because I really do like the design, especially because this one can be used either for boy or a girl. I didn't know what I was having, kept it a surprise, and I was able to buy these ahead of time still. But my only complaint would be that the stickers are a little too thick for staying on fabric that moves, and quickly starts to unstick, even after just a few seconds of trying to photograph the baby they are on. And they will NOT re-stick a second time if you want to change the baby's outfit during the shoot, or to use for multiple babies. I would probably be a lot happier if they would at least last a couple hours on the onesie.
