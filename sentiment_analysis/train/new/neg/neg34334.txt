I LOVE THE BOX, IT IS PRETTY. UNFORTUNATELY  IT CAME POORLY PACKAGED. THE GLASS WAS SLIDING AROUND INSIDE THE BOX. I AM LUCKY IT WASN'T SHATTERED. ALSO THE DOUGH USED IN THE FOOT MOLD MUCH HAVE BEEN PAST ITS EXPIRATION BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT HOLD THE SHAPE OF THE FOOT. IT ACTED MORE LIKE MEMORY FOAM AND KEPT RETURNING TO ITS ORIGINAL SHAPE. I HAD  THIS SAME BOX YEARS AGO WITH MY SON AND HAD NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS.
