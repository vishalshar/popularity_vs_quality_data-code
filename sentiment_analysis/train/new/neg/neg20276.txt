This review is based off my 7 month:  He loved the colors and the shape - immediately knew it was bottle-like, was excited, and wanted to use it.  He held it correctly and placed the spout in his mouth, but no matter what he tried, my 7 month old was not able to suck out the liquid with ease.  He grew frustrated and thought maybe he was using the sippy cup wrong and tried putting other parts of the sippy cup into his mouth.  My 7 month old finally screamed in defeat, cried, and pushed the sippy cup as far away from himself as possible.  His mom gave the sippy cup back twice, but then the 7 month old tired to frantically get away from it and batted it as if his life depended on it and cried thinking mom was doing an evil trick.  My 7 month old now cries whenever he sees the sippy cup even at a distance.  It was a terrible experience for my son that has made him unable to transition to a sippy cup of any kind.Mom's review - I am giving these away because even at 18 months of age, my son hates them and screams.  We went with Gerber Graduates NUK with one hole in the hard spout, removed the non-leak part, and now my son uses a sippy cup.  He just in not for sucking to get fluid out - it needs to flow.  So for other kids who were great at breastfeeding and suck/chew hard - this sippy cup should work just fine.
