I thought this set would be perfect for my toddlers, the easy clean factor of "Soft polyester fabric is easy to clean with mild soap and water" was a huge selling point for me....This is false!!  The first spill was on the couch, on the face of Spongebob, when I tried to clean it, the coloring for the mouth smeared all over the place!  AND the spill did not get cleaned up, now the couch looks worse than it did with just the spill on it.The little plastic feet have to be attached when the furniture arrives, this was a task all its own...there is no marking for where to line up the feet and no instructions were included.
