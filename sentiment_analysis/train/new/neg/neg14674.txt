This isn't bad for the price, but I should have just gone for something more expensive.  I was trying to find something to attach an iPad to the back of our Subaru seats, and was hoping this would work, but no luck.  The pockets aren't placed right for it to be used that way for a kid in a carseat.  But worse, it wasn't very well made and didn't stay well on the seat.  Maybe I just didn't put it on right.
