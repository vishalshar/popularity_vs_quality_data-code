My son loves his soft taggie blankets and was getting cold at night since he's too young for blankets in the crib.  I was looking for something warm and soft for him to sleep on it.  This is not it.  Feels like cheap cotton, not at all soft and warm like I was expecting.  Doesn't even feel like flannel at all.  I returned and ordered fleece sheets.  Price seemed to good to be true, but reviews were mostly positive so I bought it.  Right back in the box for a refund.
