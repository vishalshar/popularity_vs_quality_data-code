I should have read the reviews before I ordered these bibs.While they are cheap, they are not what I need.The bib itself is not a bad size, the problem arises with everything else.Like another reviewer said, this is just cheap terry cloth with vinyl backing (I could have made one using plastic bags from the cereal).  They are so thin you can actually see through the vinyl, it feels cheap.The neck is about 3" in diameter, so unless you have a baby with a very slim neck (or a newborn), this will not work.  I tried this on my 5 month old and I had to attach just the tips of the velcro because I felt it could choke him (I checked on him every 5 min either way).  Because of that, baby was able to pull it off without issues.Absorbency is almost non-existent when you have a real drooler, I had to multiple bibs because these were left soaking wet.I would not recommend this to anyone and had it not being because I threw away the packaging, they would have gone back.
