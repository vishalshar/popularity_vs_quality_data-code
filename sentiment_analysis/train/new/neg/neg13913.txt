We had a handed down FP swing that we loved, but it didn't have shoulder straps and it was becoming dangerous as our 3 month old was falling sideways in it. I still wanted a swing that went side-to-side, but also needed the 5 point harness and a plug in. Although the overall quality of this swing was good, we ran into a few issues. First, the seat seemed to tilt to the side a little, which looked uncomfortable for baby. Second, the plug didn't work, and it would only work with batteries. This was so disapointing as the plug was one of the main features that interested me in this swing. Also, the seat didn't recline very far, and since our little girl is only three months, Id prefer a better recline so that she can nap comfortably. Also, the toys don't spin around on their own and were very easy for my toddler to remove. There were some possitives as well. First, I found it pretty easy to put together. There were only three screws that needed a screwdriver and the rest just snapped into place. Also, the fabric seems quite durable and would be easily wiped down. Also, there is a bar in the back securing the two legs to each other, which helps the stability. Overall, the swing just didn't seem all that nice after having the FP swing. Our will be returned and we will be buying the FP product.
