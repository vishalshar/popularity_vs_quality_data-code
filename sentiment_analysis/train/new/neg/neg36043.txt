I used this gate for my dog who had seperation anxiety because it didnt have the mesh holes.. He did one of his expiodes while I was gone at work and I came home to a metal piece on the floor and some of the wood chewed off. The gate was still standing up though, some how my 55lb dog (who stands about 5'5 when on his back legs) didnt tear this thing down. Before I got the gate I was moving my couch in front of the kitchen and somehow he would manage to leap over the couch and the bar stools I had stacked on the back on the couch to try and keep him in the area. Big fail. He did dent the plastic a little, or maybe he was scratching really hard at it. Either way, the gate held up. The only thing I cant stand about the thing is if you have to constantly put it up or take it down. Since I had to get the tall size for a big dog, I couldnt just step over it. It became a big pain but I also gated him in the kitchen. Would recommend for a calmer dog that is tall and big.
