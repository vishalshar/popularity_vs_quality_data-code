We bought one of these window shades about a year ago. It didn't cover our SUV windows adequately, which meant on long trips we'd have to adjust it to make sure it was blocking sun from our child. It lasted pretty well for about six months or more. We ordered a second one for our other back window, but right about that time one of the suction cups on the first one stopped working. One or two suction cups on the second one stopped working about a month or two after we installed it, so it didn't last nearly as long as the other. We've tried cleaning the windows and the suction cups to remove any oil put there by fingers or hands, but nothing seems to work. We even tried moistening the suction cups (even though the manufacturer says the cups shouldn't be moistened because they don't need to be), to no avail. Once the suctions no longer work, these shades are useless; they dangle next to the heads of our children in their child car seats which is an invitation to grabby toddlers and completely ridiculous. We're going to try some of the cheap, vinyl, stick on screens now. I bought these because they were supposed to provide good coverage for SUV windows and  be easy to install and uninstall. They don't provide adequate coverage and easy installation is pointless when you have to reinstall them every time you get in or out of the vehicle, once the suctions fail. This product needs some work, for sure.
