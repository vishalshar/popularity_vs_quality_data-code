I gave these three stars because they are a great product super soft and absorbent  however, the sizing is way off. I purchased the infant ones for my newborn and they were amazing. They held up great. As he got bigger I needed the next size up. It says they fit 15-30lb babies. This is not true. The prefolds are so huge that there is no way they could fit a 15lb baby without looking like they have 3-4 diapers on at once. My guy can't even lay down with these on. They will be great when he is older... Maybe 1. They did not shrink up like the previous ones did.  I would add a photo for comparison but it won't give me the option.
