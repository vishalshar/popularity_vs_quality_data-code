My 4 month old loves to put parts of this toy in his mouth, or look at the colors on the horses feet. I also really like that I can hang it from his activity mat and I think he gets fascinated by the colors. That said, this took over a month to arrive from when I ordered it, but I waited patiently. When it did arrive, stuffing was coming out of stitching lines that weren't straight and strings were hanging off everywhere. Ok, so I cut off the strings and pulled what stuffing I could see out of it. But this toy's washing instructions are surface only washing. So it was a pain to have to get every crevice I possible could clean with sanitizing wipes since I knew my baby would put it in his mouth the first chance he got. All in all, I guess it was worth $8, but I probably wouldn't order from the company again. Especially since it came with a bizarre card that read as follows:"Tks a lot for your 5 stars comment: *****Thanks for your purchase, please give us a 5 stars feedback if you like our product, also leave your well-meaning advice if you have.
