I bought this high chair because it was the #1 recommended by consumer reports.  I like it fine, but it is hard to clean and mine did NOT come with an extra covers as some other reviewers apparently did.  I wish I had that extra cover because it does get dirty and needs to be washed regularly.  I have a 9 month old and our high chair cover is stained and I am not impressed by how it has held up from being washed -on delicate cycle.  I have looked online and as far as I can tell I can't even purchase another cover separately.  it also has some crevices on the corners that the removable tray does not cover that get food trapped in them.  as far as I can tell they are purely decorative and a little tricky to clean.  It does fold nice and flat.UPDATE: I did obtain an extra cover by calling Graco customer service, but it is a different color.  I was surprised when the extra cover was vinyl coated, I wasn't expecting that.  But I think I like it better.  My advice for others purchasing this high chair would be to check babies R us for discontinued styles for half price, then if you want the machine washable cover make sure it comes with an extra one -some styles do and some don't, so why pay the same price for one without the extra cover? -or get the vinyl coated one.
