Look at these prints! I chose "Raindrops/Umbrella". So cute and on trend. They are thin and easily washable. I think I'd like them better if they had snaps instead of velcro because the velcro ends up getting stuck on other items in the wash so I end up having to wash these separately. The velcro used on these is standard, not the safety kind. I don't know what it is about these bibs but whenever I put them on my daughter she constantly tries to eat them. For this reason, I prefer to use terry bibs instead. I'll try again with the full-size Bumpkins bibs when she gets a little older. Note that this "starter" size is quite small and can't be used comfortably on an larger/older baby. I think next time I'd just buy the full-size version and forgo this size.
