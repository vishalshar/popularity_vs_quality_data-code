Lightweight, easy to install, easy to get in and out of the car, attractive... yes yes yes.  BUT, There is improvement needed on this model.FIRST  The infant insert is of a terribly scratchy unnatural material... yuck.  It irritated my newborn's skin horribly.  We took it out and used a different insert instead, which the manufacturer does not recommend doing.ALSO  There is white piping that comes across the back on the inside of the cover (it's under the newborn insert in the picture and you can't see it).  It's bumpy and protrudes out from the cover.  When your baby is big enough to remove the insert, the piping is right at the back of the head, on the part that sticks out the most.  My baby got a big red spot there where that piping was rubbing on her all the time.ALSO  For the life of me I can't figure out how to remove the cover without taking apart the seat.  I must assume then that this cover is not washable.  My darling girl had a big blow out poop all over her seat, and I can only wipe it off (yuck).ALSO  It would be nice if the seatbelt part could be pulled out just 1 or 2 inches more, because then you could have them open and use 2 hands to put your child in the seat.  As it is now, they keep flopping back into the seat before I can get her into it, and she ends up sitting on them and then I have to dig them out from under her to buckle her in.  This is a pain and a real drawback and has woken up my little girl more than once.  And it is terribly uncomfortable for her.Chicco, you can do better. Small improvements can make a big difference in our lives.
