I another review that said it was really big but I thought how big could it possibly be?  I didn't pay attention to the size listed and it's huge!  I seriously thought about returning it because it's not smaller than what we already use, and because of the reviews that said it doesn't stick well.  I opened it up in any case only to find out that it's still not big enough for all our bath toys even after I got rid of all the ones growing mold.  This does get the toys off of the ground though which is very nice.  I'll deal with the not great wall mounting when the time comes.
