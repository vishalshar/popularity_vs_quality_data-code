I love this Rock n' Play.  My daughter has slept in it since we brought her home from the hospital nearly six months ago and we love how it snuggles her and helps her sleep.  We will use it until she grows out of it and then only begrudgingly move her to her crib.  All that being said, I got this exact style at Target for $50.  Do not get it here!
