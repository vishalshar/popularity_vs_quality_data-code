My 3 year old daughter has been able to get out of her harness clip for the last 6 months. I ordered the DIONO clip and she figured that out in 20 seconds, so I ordered the Houdini Stop and again, i wasn't even out of the driveway before she could unlock it. Absolutely ridiculous that i've spent money on these items and they won't accept a return once the box is opened.
