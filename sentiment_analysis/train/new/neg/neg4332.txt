These are adorable and obviously go with the bedding well, BUT they should alert you that if you have textured walls they dont stick well. they aren't like other wall decals that are more vinyl, these are more of a hard plastic and don't stick well to the wall... but they are so darn  cut I will probably come up with a solution for the ones that are continuously falling off.Long story short if you DON'T have textured walls you should be fine...
