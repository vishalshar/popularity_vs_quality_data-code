I really liked that this was highly-rated and had a Greenguard certification. I had to return the first one I purchased because after two months of an infant lying on it, it had formed a deep ridge in the center on both sides. You can see it in my picture, even without any weight on it. It was much worse with the weight of a baby on it. When my son started rolling, he often couldn't roll out of the middle. Not safe at all. I called Sealy to see how they could address my concerns and I was informed that this product is not manufactured by Sealy at all. This is made by Kolcraft. After calling to speak with them, they agreed to send a replacement. The replacement mattress, unfortunately, has the same issues as the first. After calling Kolcraft again and persistently explaining the safety concerns of a sagging crib mattress, they will only send another of the same mattress. They refused to refund me, said they had "done me a favor" by sending me the first replacement, and that the ridge in the center "isn't really that bad" and that this sort of thing is normal for any crib mattress. When I'm looking for a firm, safe surface for my baby to sleep on, something that "isn't really that bad" is not acceptable. I finally called Amazon and their customer service department was amazing. They agreed to a refund and I will be returning this mattress and finding something else.
