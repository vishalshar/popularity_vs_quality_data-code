I bought this apron towel to compare it against the typical hooded baby towels because I found myself getting wet when taking baby out of the bath and this one was highly recommended on Amazon.Pros:-This wrap around one is a lot larger than most hooded towels. The size will help expand it's lifespan and grow with baby.-The apron wrap does help me get less wet when bathing my little oneCons:-However, the towel isn't as soft or absorbent as I would have liked, especially for the price. I didn't find that it got particularly softer in the wash either. My baby doesn't seem to mind, but I think I would continue to use the softer smaller hooded towels that I received until their skin is a little less sensitive.Overall, I like the idea of this towel and it has some use in my routine but I'm not sure if I would invest in second unless it was on sale.
