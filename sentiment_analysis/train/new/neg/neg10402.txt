This "rug" is more like an un-stuffed pillow. It IS cute but totally NOT a rug! I was shocked to see ORANGE eyes but luckily the orange matches my daughters new bed set so its not a problem. I only paid $14 for this so its not worth sending back. She will love it and thats all that really matters.  Its very soft - almost like a blanket. I would NOT recommend putting this "rug" down on tile or hard wood floors without some type of slip pad underneath. If you are looking for something that actually feels like a rug this item is NOT for you. Also, although I looked at the dimensions and had an idea of its size the picture is a little deceptive.  As for shipping - yes, very fast shipping. It was shipped folded up in one of those tyvek (plastic-like) envelopes.  I would bet that if you cut one side of the seam you could stuff this and make a large stuffed head.
