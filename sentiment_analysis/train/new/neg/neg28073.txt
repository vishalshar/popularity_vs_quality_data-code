Update: I think I jinxed myself after writing this positive review. Since writing this I have had THREE of the cups somehow leak liquid between the outside of the cup and the inside of the insulated liner. That basically makes them unusable bc they are sure to develop mold or something disgusting in between those layers, especially when it's milk in there. This is frustrating for a mom of two boys who always want matching cups as it has been one cup in each set (one Cars, one Monsters, now one of the Planes cups). I can't figure out how it gets in between there or how to get it out, I end up just having to toss them. I still use and love the ones we have but I won't be spending any more money on these cups in the future.I've been using these for about 2 years now. I recently came on Amazon to buy some more and was surprised by all the negative reviews. These have been the best sippy cups ever for both my kids. They went from nursing straight to these with no problems transitioning. The cups keep milk or water nice and cold, fit perfectly in cup holders, rarely leak (maybe a droplet or two when thrown) and have been fairly drop proof. As for the negatives, I did drop one myself in just the right way on ceramic tile that the outside shell cracked off but I'm talking one drop out of  thousands so I'm not worried about it. Also, the lids should be occasionally scrubbed bc one of the older models did develop a spot of mold on the valve. Again, no big deal I just check the spouts more often now and try to remember not to let them sit. And I think the convenience of the one piece lid outweighs that extra step of visually checking when I get it out of the dishwasher. Still these aren't deal breakers compared to all the positives. My kids LOVE Disney so these are their favorite cups and I would definitely recommend them to a friend. Obviously because I'm back buying more right now.
