Printing job of the set is not the best but you get what you pay for I guess... What I do love is that the sheet blanket has the end fitted so it will stay in place. That was a wonderful idea. I just wish the printing job was better. Some of the facial expressions on the fairies are a little odd or off. But overall my daughter loves it, she is 3 in November of 2015.
