Some carseat manufacturers require vehicle headrest support to the top of a high-back booster, and some do not. I ordered this seat for my 5-year-old son without realizing that it requires headrest support from the vehicle. We do have headrests in all seating positions of our 2009 VW Jetta Sportwagen, but it is easier to install child restraints with the headrest removed, as they stick out beyond the back of the vehicle seat. This booster fits nicely with the vehicle headrest removed, but with the headrest in place as advised in the booster's manual, it creates a gap of about 4 or 5 inches between the back of the booster and the vehicle seat back. I emailed a photo to Peg Perego customer support and they emailed back (very quickly, so their customer service was prompt!) to say that the gap was not acceptable and if the back of the booster does not sit flush with the vehicle seat back, the booster can be used without the back. Well, we already have a backless booster (which can be purchased for about $20 depending on the brand) for travel or short rides with friends, and I didn't pay nearly $200 for extra head and side protection only to use this thing backless! So back it goes.The fabric and construction of the seat is nice, and the seating area is quite cushy. The latch connectors are a nice feature to prevent it from becoming a projectile if it were unoccupied in a crash. The cupholders are dinky and when I tried out the recline handle it seemed to stick a little, but that might just be because I wasn't used to it. If it had worked in my car I'd give it 4 stars, but if you are thinking about purchasing this seat first look at your headrests to see if they might pose a problem with installation.
