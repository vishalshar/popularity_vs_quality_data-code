I have the 2006 european version which is the same besides the seat fabric.  Its a cool stroller but I haven't used it yet because its been broken for almost a year now and dorel won't help resolve the problem.  The hydraulics are set inside the main tube and presses against a metal piece which reinforces the stroller when expanded, and bears the force when you collapse the stroller.  Well that metal piece broke no longer has the hydraulic action. While I can still manually expand it and it still locks into place, I dare not put my son on it because without that hydraulic piston reinforcing the weight, the stroller with collapse.  If anyone can help I woujld appreciate it.Another problem is the tire started leaking but I managed to find Innertubes from a sporting good store to replace them.  In case you end up with a puncture or leak in your tires ( As many or most people will )  You want to replace the innertube with a 12" tube.
