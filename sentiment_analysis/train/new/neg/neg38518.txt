I really liked these at first, but after only 2 or 3 washes, they've started leaking, right through the PUL cover. I checked the PUL and it doesn't look damaged, the insert isn't even that wet so I know it's not because they're too saturated. I checked to see if the inserts/lining were still absorbing water and they are, so I don't need new inserts, it's just coming right through the cover. I don't know what's wrong, but it's happening to every single diaper and my baby has only fit into them for about two weeks.
