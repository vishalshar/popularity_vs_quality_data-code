I purchased two of these to add to my collection.  I checked their website for information about prepping the insert before using, and didn't find the info, so I emailed the company.  They quickly responded that no prepping was needed, and that the inserts would absorb just fine right away.I have been using them for a couple weeks now in my regular diaper rotation, each one used once daily.CONSThey *immediately* leak into the crotch area on both sides, even if I use both inserts.  When I say immediately, I mean I put on the diaper, my son peed, and his pants were wet (along with the onesie).  Other diaper brands seem to leak out only after they are saturated a few times or sat on (carseat) or have moved out of position, so it's strange that EVERY time I put these on and he pees, his pants are instantly wet.  Maybe it's the fleece pulling the pee out to the pants?  The leg holes are just elastic and don't have that "gusset" like Thirsties diapers have.I usually use a Thirsties cover with a prefold folded in thirds laid in the center with a piece of fleece over it, and never get any leaks from that unless it's just way over saturated (multiple pees) and/or been on way too long.I tried to make excuses for this Coqui diaper and keep giving it chances, thinking it was just a big pee, it wasn't put on right, etc. but in reality I have been using cloth diapers for almost two years now and it's most likely not user-error.  I am currently trying to insert my folded prefolds to see if the error is the insert itself and if it'll work with my trusted prefold...I'll let you know!  I really wanted these to work because of the pros listed below:PROSvery softfits well (my son is almost 30 pounds and is still three snaps in, lots of room to grow)colorfuldries quicklycute frog on backtrim
