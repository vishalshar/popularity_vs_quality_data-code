Its a little bulky so its hard for the kids to slip by to get to their seats in my prius.  The cup holders are slightly small so our foogo funtainer bottles get a little stuck, not horrible.  I like it for the most part.  My kids accidentally snap the tray off all the time, its practically useless.  I still like it because my child in the middle seat has a place for his drink. I have three seats across in my prius so we cant use the middle cup holders.
