This holds up to about 8 ounces topsBut I've spilled with this thing a few time so prepare a mopAnd if you're holding the baby and trying to do itThen all I gotta say is "forget about it!"Because you have to shake the thing to get all of the formula outand it's a little wide and stoutSo we've been using this thing for a while (for our first kid and now our second).  And though it gets bad reviews, if you want cheap and functional, this will do it.  Though it is far from perfect (I see people mentioning the Munchkin thing and that looks pretty good).  This one holds up to about 8 oz and will last you about one kid's cycle.  Tried using it for my 2nd kid and it started to develop cracks.  So not the best of construction, but again, it's cheap.  But the munchkin one is only like $2 bucks, more, I would try that other one first.
