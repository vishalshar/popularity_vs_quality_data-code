We ordered the Bummis One Size Swim Diaper so we wouldn't have to keep ordering new sizes.Pros: The diaper is really cute and has leg gussets, so works well to contain poop (it's been tested several times), which is great.Con: Runs VERY small!  The way Amazon has this product listed, the sized diapers and the One Size are grouped together, so it's hard to weed out the reviews for the One Size diaper specifically, which is a bit annoying.  I did find a couple of reviews that said the OS diaper was small, but I figured that since babies come in all shapes and sizes, those people probably had chubbier babies and we wouldn't have an issue.  I was wrong.  My son is slim, 60-80th percentile for height and consistently 30-40th percentile for weight and 12-18 month clothes are baggy on him.  At 14 months and 21lbs, this diaper is on its last snaps for waist size and is not going to last us until he's potty trained at 2+.  So unless you have an extremely skinny kid, this will probably not be a "one size" swim diaper for you.  Disappointing.
