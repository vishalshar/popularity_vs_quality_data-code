I thought this football would be smaller.  I have a 9 month old son and wanted to get him something football related.  I saw this football and thought it would be perfect.  However, the ball is the size of a real football....way too big for my son to enjoy.  He also isn't really liking chewing on the tags as much as i thought either.
