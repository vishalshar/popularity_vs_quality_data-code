This is a brilliant idea and I like the design.  It was quick and easy to install and turns your toilet into a simple bidet.  It is attached to a little T in the water inlet, and you just squeeze the nozzle to start the water flow.  The water is cold, but not really uncomfortable if you have "sturdy" nerves.  I think it is refreshing, and I love to feel completely fresh and clean even when I can't shower.  Most units that turn toilets into bidets seem gross and hard to clean, but this hangs outside the toilet and is completely sanitary.I would have given it 5 stars except that the materials used are so cheap that I don't expect it to last more than a few months.  The cheap little nozzle leaked after only half an hour, and the whole thing is cheezy looking.  It really is only a spray nozzle, exactly like the ones used on kitchen sinks. I paid $40.00 for this little thing, and when I saw what it was, I realized that I could purchase good quality components from my local hardware store and duplicate this for less than the cost of this item.  And my version is MUCH BETTER QUALITY the Saria Bidet Spray.  I just bought the components and made high quality bidet sprays for all 4 toilets in my house - for less than the cost of this ONE unit all by itself.  I am keeping this one, but I wouldn't buy something this poor quality again.  I wouldn't have minded buying them, even for this really high price, except for the poor quality.  IT IS NOT WORTH $40.00 when better quality components can be had for less.  The rip-off quality is why I gave it only 2 stars.I would have given it only one star, but feel like the idea alone is worth probably the price, and I don't mind paying for that.  Still, if the manufacturer had not been so greedy, they would have made a better quality product and I would have purchased all 4 units and given this 5 stars.  As it is, I think the manufacturer shortchanged both themselves and their customers.
