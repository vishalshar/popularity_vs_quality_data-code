My little one looks like a super hero/olympic swimmer in these.  He's a healthy-size 18 month old and even though I ordered him a 3T, they still leave red ridges around his little legs & waist after wearing them at the pool.  It didn't seem to bother him, though.They do, however, manage to keep poop in.  Which is awesome.  BUT its so hard to wiggle him out of the wet, tight diaper without getting poop all over the place & him.  The disposable swim diapers have tear-away sides for easy removal...and well worth the extra cost for the convenience of not having to deal with nasty swimming pool poopies!
