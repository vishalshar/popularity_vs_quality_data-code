Hand monitor stopped working after a month. Contacted customer service with no resolution.  Picture quality is very grainy and poor. It states color monitor but everything is different shades of grey.  With less than bright light the picture is dark grey.  I have nothing good to say about this monitor or company.  I suspect that many positive reviews are not from actual users.
