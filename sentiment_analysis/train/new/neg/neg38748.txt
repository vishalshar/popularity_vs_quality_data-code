I am quite disappointed in this cover.  The material used causes me to get hot when I'm using it. Also, the velcro isn't placed appropriately.  The rough side is attached to the pillow instead of being attached to the strap, which causes material such a burp cloth or clothes I'm wearing to get stuck to it.  This tends to scratch body parts when coming in contact with it too. I also have the organic version of this cover and the rough velcro is placed on the strap not the pillow, which is more functional. I would not recommend this product.
