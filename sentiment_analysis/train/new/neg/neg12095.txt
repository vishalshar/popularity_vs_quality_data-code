This is something you buy someone for a shower gift to be cute and neat-o, but not a parent buying for your child.  The 'boo cube' is a hard plastic block.  Where do you soothe the child? Through the material or through the block?  I ended up sewing material around the block, which helps. But still, silly price for something not so useful for a mom. Plus blood is hard to get out of the fuzzy material.
