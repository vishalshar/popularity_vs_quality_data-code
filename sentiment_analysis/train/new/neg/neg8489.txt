A life saver when your toddler starts exploring.  We use it for the mall, the park, while also walking our dog, really for any activity where a toddler can "get free" with the blink of an eye.  Gives kids enough freedom while also keeping them in arms length.  Bear is just as it seems, a bit lighter in color.  The negatives are that the front straps are very close to the chin, we have actually caught our childs skin in the clip, so be careful when closing it.  I do wish the bear was a backpack, in that you could put 1 small item in it, since our child calls it a backpack.  Cleans in the wash, hang to dry.  3 stars due to the clip issue.
