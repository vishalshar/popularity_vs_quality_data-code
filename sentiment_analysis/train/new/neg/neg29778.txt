The quality is not at all what we had expected. I thought for sure with the price of $300 that it would be very strong, but this is sadly not true. The wood scratches exceptionally easy and the crib as a whole is quite flimsy. It is sort of hard to believe! This is the first crib we have ever bought as we just had our first baby, but I am disappointed with the fact that we spent $300 on something that proved to be poor quality. I do love the looks of it!
