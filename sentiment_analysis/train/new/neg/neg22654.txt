I was really excited about my pushpack until I opened it. I could have went out and brought sample sizes of things and came out much cheaper. Some of the product looks like things you could actually get free from the companiesselling them. The shampoo and showershower gel included is smaller than the hotel size! Good luck getting one showers worth from that. My pack was incomplete. It did not have the toothbrush and toothpaste in it. All in all, now I still have to go out to shop for more things to add to push pack to be prepared for my labor. At least I got a cute bag and some stickers for the baby out of it.
