Crib looks promising, but after days of trying to assemble it and scratching our heads when the pieces just wouldn't come together - we finally realized it is because Dream On Me packaged the WRONG SCREWS into the hardware.  ALL 10 of the main screws were an inch too short, hence why the pieces would not bolt together.  On top of that, the 3/4 inch smaller screws were also shy of the full length, thus those will probably be a problem too.  Unbelievable that the majority of hardware was packaged incorrectly.  Wasted so much time, mental anguish, not to mention trying to find alternate appropriate hardware since I'm not sure when we will receive the corrected hardware.
