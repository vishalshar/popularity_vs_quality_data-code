I purchased this twice because I thought the first one I received was a defective sheet that this not fit all the way around my daughter's bassinet mattress that is 16x32. Lo and behold, the second one did it too. These sheets do not fit snugly at all around the mattress. It reaches only about halfway down. Even when I force it on, all it does is  scrunch up the mattress making it a crumpled mess rather than a smooth flat surface for me to safely lay my child in. I tried contacting the seller and I received no response. Save your money and go with a different brand.
