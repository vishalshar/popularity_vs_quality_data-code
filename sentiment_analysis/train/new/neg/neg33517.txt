I guess I'm the dunce and didn't know there was such a thing as a toddler size bedding set, I thought toddler referred to age group. There's not a thing wrong with the product, would normally give it 4 stars except it doesn't fit a twin day bed. There are no individual sheet or comforter sizes listed in the description, only the size of the packaged bundle in it's wrapper, so there is no help there for the clueless, like me. 3.5 year old grand daughter loves it, insisted on keeping, so only the bottom fitted sheet doesn't work. She uses the coverlet like a lap quilt.  I'm using the fitted bottom sheet like fabric goods to make her a nightgown or apron so we're getting our money's worth one way or another.  The colors are nice and bright so 3 star review is just attention-getter to make sure other not-so-with-it-grammies "get it".
