We have two Sunshine Kids Radian 80 seats, a Britax Marathon, and this Britax Boulevard.Britax Pros:  seats look comfy, cover is easy to remove, harness straps pretty easy to adjust, integrated lock-offs make it easy to get the car seats in & out of the vehicleBritax Cons:  Storage for excess top tether strap stinks.  It has an elastic strap that looks really handy initially, but the webbing slips out of it really easily and it isn't really stretch enough to get a couple wraps.  The pouch doesn't really keep just the excess (it's a big floppy wide mouthed pouch that according to the manual is intended for storing the entire tether when it's not in use - although if you call with a complaint about it, Britax will tell you that you should have been using the pouch all along and reference a bunch of statements in the manual that don't actually say anything about that) and is in a spot that gets jostled a lot in my minivan.The big kicker:  if the strap comes undone and slips out the door without you noticing immediately (easy to happen with a big minivan door, rear facing seat, and black strap - especially at night), there is a significant chance your seat will be totally ruined and you'll have to buy a new one (if the red stitches on the tether tear at all when the tether gets yanked around in the door they say you have to treat it like it was in an accident - meaning no repair parts).  It happens often enough that as soon as I started to tell the customer service rep that the end of the tether had gotten damaged when tangled up in the door, she started right into a pretty pat spiel about how if I'd driven with the tether stuck out I'd need to throw the seat away and go purchase a new one - before she even asked me if I had, or told me I could inspect if any stitching had torn (which it hadn't - it was just snagged up at the very end where it got tangled).  Our Sunshine Kids seats have a nice plastic compartment integrated into the top of the seat that has a little tab to help hold in the roll of extra webbing and works very well for keeping the excess tucked away, so I expected something equal from the Britax in the same price range.  At the very least, make the strap brightly colored so that it's noticeable.On the Britax, skip the pouch & built in elastic right from the get-go and get your own rubber band instead and then tuck it somewhere in the middle of your car just in case your rubber band comes undone.  Otherwise just skip the seat altogether, because it's not worth paying $250 twice to have one functional seat at the end.
