Edit: I've now had these in my truck for 2 months. Every 2 weeks they fall down. Almost like clockwork. I have cleaned my glass and the clings, I've tried everything I can think of. I'm currently looking for some similar, but better to replace them with.Exactly what we needed. My newborn rear faces in my truck that has giant windows. Even with window tint it feels like the sun is always in his face, so this was the perfect purchase for us!
