This bouncer is easy to put together but that might be part of the problem. With moderate pulling, my 4 month old is able to pull down the crinkly leaf and sun-mirror. Just a couple of plastic prongs keep the pieces in place so it's not very sturdy. It's much smaller in stature (not really in circumference or base) than the Fisher Price Jungle Jump-a-roo (which we regrettably gave away after our last child) and smaller in base than other "exersaucers" but other than the compact size, this one doesn't have too much going for it. I would return and get another Jumparoo it if I had kept the box--ironically, the box was too big to store.Update:Amazon is processing the return for the item without the box. Back to the Jumparoo for us!
