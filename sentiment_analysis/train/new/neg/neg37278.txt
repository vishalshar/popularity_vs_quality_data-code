Hmmm...  The description clearly states it has "elastic that fits around the hood."  That is patently false.  I have now received 2 of these.  Sent the first one back, as well as the replacement, which was identical to the first.  I have a hand-me-down, single, Pliko stroller.  There is no way for this cover to be secured to the stroller that I have.  None!  Per the, very poor, instructions, one is somehow supposed to snap it on. The cover comes with 2 female snaps attached on each side.  My stroller does not have snaps located there.  The only "elastic" on this cover, are the 2 elastic straps at the foot end, which easily wrap and secure around the frame.  I searched on-line for a how-to demo.  No dice.  I even turned it inside out and tried attaching it to the single male snap on the inside of the frame, at the base of the hood.  Not only was it incredibly challenging to maneuver it into position, it took quite a lot of strength to "snap" it on.  Obviously, it is way too cumbersome to be the intended use of the cover.  Additionally, it is not broad enough to go across the bonnet and attach on the other side.  (When I just sat it on top of the bonnet, as in the photo, it looked like a good fit, just no way to secure it on my stroller).  I really did make quite an effort to figure out a way to make it functional.  In order for this to work, there must be male snaps, bilaterally, on the outside of the bonnet or the frame.  Check your stroller prior to ordering.  Good luck!ps - 5 stars for Amazon return policy & responsiveness.
