I ordered this item based on the raving customer reviews and I wound up being sorry since I didn't actually see it first to judge for myself.  Sure there are lots of pockets, but once you fill them with the necessities, i.e. diapers, wipes, creams/powder, a few spare onesies, etc., the bag is so puffed out and awkwardly bulky you can barely carry it.  I have another baby on the way & bought this in the hopes that it would accommodate both sets of items for my toddler and the newborn, but so far we've filled it just for my oldes and we know there is no way we'll be able to squeeze Baby #2's stuff inside.  The bag is a pretty Pooh design, and the material is soft but it's not at all surface washable as the cloth stains easily with daily usage, and we have not attempted to put it in the washing machine yet since the inside is lined with plastic. We wrecked our last diaper bag cleaning it this way.  There is no way to fully clean this without destroying the interior.  The handles are sturdy and the shoulder strap is long and adjustable, also comfortable on the shoulder.  It's priced on par with other diaper bags so I guess it's a decent item, but I'd recommend that with a diaper bag it's wiser to see and touch the item to make sure it fits your needs and not buy blind like we did.
