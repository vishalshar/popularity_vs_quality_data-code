So, I figured that by what this item has on the packaging (environmentally friendly plastic) that it would mean there isn't BPA in the plastic. Come to find out this item does in fact have BPA in it. Most states are working on laws to ban the sale of baby items that have BPA, and I just find it odd that you can still purchase items with this dangeous product in baby items.
