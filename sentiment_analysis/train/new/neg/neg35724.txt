I researched a lot of monitors.  For the money, features, and based off of reviews I chose this monitor.  Well the clarity of the picture is good, but I was expecting the quality of the picture to be as advertised or close to it.  The night vision is great, but the normal day vision does not have the vvibrant colors shown in the advertisement and doesn't even come close.  I thought we had a defective monitor so I called Lorex and no one has been able to answer out question about the quality of the video.  They have sent us 2 replacement monitors out of the blue.  Never asked for them which I guess was nice.  We exchanged through Amazon and got the same video results.  Maybe I'm naive, but I expected more based off of the manufacturer description. Also th volume is definitely not loud at all.
