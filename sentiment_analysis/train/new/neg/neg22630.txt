This seat cover came up in a search for a Britax seat cover. It was shown next to much more expensive covers. It doesn't actually fit the seat correctly, I had to cut it to get the straps through. It doesn't actually cover all of the seat, and the cloth is very thin. Not worth the shipping to return and my daughter likes it better than nothing so we kept it. I would not recommend purchasing this cover.
