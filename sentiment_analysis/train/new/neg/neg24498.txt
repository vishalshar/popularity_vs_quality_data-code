I've never written an Amazon review, but I feel compelled to do so with these diapers.  I wanted to like the FuzziBunz One Size Diaper, especially after reading all the glowing reviews here. I ended up buying about ten of them before my daughter was born.  At first I loved these diapers.  My daughter was a newborn and they fit her beautifully and came in such vibrant, fun colors, but after a couple of months I could no longer comfortably fit my daughter into these diapers (even after adjusting the elastic in numerous different configurations).  They have a very low rise and are super trim in the legs.  My daughter is only six months old and can barely fit in these.  I can't imagine how they're supposed to fit her when she's over a year old.  To make matters worse, they leak around the legs.  Again, I've tried adjusting the elastic but to no avail.  But here's what really takes the cake: I've had snaps falling off left and right on several of these diapers, which is a shame because they're not cheap.  I'm very careful to wash them in a cloth-diaper-friendly detergent and have taken good care of them. I'm shocked to find them falling apart after only six months of use.  Shouldn't a diaper this expensive last through a few kids? I have a few other brands of diapers as well that were purchased at the same time and have had none of these issues with them.If you want a better product in the same price range, try  BumGenius 4.0 diapers and GroVia Hybrid diapers.  These diapers are my very favorite.  Each offer a much better fit, elasticity, and sturdy snaps.  I've also not had any problems with leaks when using them.
