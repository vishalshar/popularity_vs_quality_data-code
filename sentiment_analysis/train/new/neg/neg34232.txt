These came with single sided adhesive pads.  Yes, single sided.  If you buy these, you'll need the double sided 3M tape and have to fiddle with cutting it to shape the contours of these.  It also showed up in a Ziploc bag too.  It's almost as if someone in working out of his basement tossed and few rubber pads in a bag he grabbed out of the kitchen and some adhesives he found in a junk drawer and made me pay for it.  DO NOT BUY THIS!
