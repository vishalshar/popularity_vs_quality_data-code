I have received several compliments on the look of this cover; the pattern is very pretty!  It's a very lightweight material, which is nice for not being too warm or heavy on the baby.  However, I think a more structured fabric might hold form better (this one tends to sag easily onto the baby's face since it is so lightweight.  Not sure though, as this is the only nursing cover that I have ever owned.  Generally works well though, and folds up nicely into the diaper bag.  I'm glad that I decided to get one rather than rely on just a baby blanket or scarf (the plastic rounded piece at the top really helps to be able to peek in to see the baby as she's feeding)!
