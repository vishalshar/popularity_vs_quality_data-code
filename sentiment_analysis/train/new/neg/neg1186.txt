I think this is a decent product, but it was really hard to tell what the color looked like in the picture (I THOUGHT I knew what it would look like until I got it). It's not my favorite, but it is neutral enough and won't clash with too much.  The material is decent but not very soft.  It fits very nicely over the My Brest Friend Pillow.
