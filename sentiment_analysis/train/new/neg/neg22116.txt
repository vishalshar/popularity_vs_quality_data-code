These are ok.  I wanted to love them, but the opening at the top is too difficult to unscrew and I find I reach for the other ones out of ease.  Also, my kids don't seem to like these as much, and even the 5 yr old has trouble getting the last bites out because it kind of gets stuck at the top.  I would  not buy again.  They are, however, easy to clean if you can get the tops off.  Mine unscrew clockwise, which always throws me for a loop as well.
