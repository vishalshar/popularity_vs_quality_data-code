The toys on this are cute, it's durable and easy to clean.  I also have the Rainforest Booster and prefer that one because it has adjustable height, which this one doesn't.  Other than that it's a good seat. The straps don't come off, so when then get dirty I just put a bowl on the seat and soak them in hot soapy water.
