When I received the package, I saw printed on the box that it was only for mattresses up to 10" thick.  This information was not in the product page.  My pillow top mattress is 13" thick and the arms on the rail will not accommodate it. Also, the feet that go between the mattress and the box spring look like they would warp the mattress and rip big holes in it.The top portion looked like it could fit snugly on my pillowtop mattress, but even if I could fit the rail in, I don't want to damage my mattress.
