Despite the mixed reviews, I had high hopes for these guards. Unfortunately, they are next to useless for me.First, the screws included are absolutely awful. Despite pre-drilling holes, four out of four screws sheared off when I was trying to install the first guard. So I was off to the hardware store to buy better screws.With my replacement screws in hand, I removed a drawer and installed the first bracket in the gap for the drawer. The next problem arose, however, when I tried putting the drawer back on the tracks. It wouldn't fit under the bracket...So I uninstalled the bracket and determined there is no way for me to install the bracket with the drawer in place (unless I purchase a low-profile 90 degree screwdriver of some sort).So, I thought, I'll at least install the guards on my cabinet doors. I made it through the installation without too much trouble. However, the "1 inch opening" feature was closer to 3 inches. In fact, there was plenty of room for me to reach my forearm halfway into the cabinet and remove several objects. If my arm fit, my son could definitely reach his whole arm in. I had the bracket installed as far back as it could go but it left far too much room.Overall, this product is simply unusable for me.
