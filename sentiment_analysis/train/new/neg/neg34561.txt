I bought it for my 20 month old daughter for our family beach trip.  I thought it was a really good idea since she runs around everywhere and could easily get lost.  I put it on her in the hotel room right before we left the room, and she had already taken it off before we got to the elevator.  I put another one on, thinking I can distract her so that she forgets about it but she took it off in less time than it took for me to put it on.
