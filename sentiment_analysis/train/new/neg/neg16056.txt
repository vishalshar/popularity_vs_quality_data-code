I got this gadget bc I like most new parents are worried about SIDS. This will give you some reassurance, it definitely works. But with that said, it's so sensitive it was going off practically every time my son moved. It's a horrendous feeling to have the alarm go off at 2 am and grab your kid out of his bed bc your frantic and he's just fine and now screaming at you for 30 minutes for waking him up. But with that said, that is way better than the alternative. It was useful to me when I was very anxious about SIDS, it will ease your mind and help you sleep better at night. My real complaint is the battery life. I've had the device for about 2 months, used it maybe 6 times and it's already dead. Definitely stock up on batteries if you plan on using this every night. Otherwise, it's a handy tool to put you at ease.
