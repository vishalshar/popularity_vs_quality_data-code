I hoped this would work for napping accidents.  My 3 yr old son has been wearing this for naps for about a month.  EVERY time he has peed, he has gotten really wet and sheets needed to be changed.  it seems like the flaps that hold down the insert actually absorb some pee and spread it to the rest of the cloth part of the underwear.We used cloth diapers for two years.  Always had to use disposables for sleeping at night, cloth for napping was OK.  Hoping to find a better "pull up" cloth option for napping for toddlers, so if anybody knows of a better solution or how to make this one work better please reply!I put photos of what this system looks like when put together.  Also the first photo is of how wet it got on the outside.I wash this in the machine, hang dry or low heat in dryer.My son is 34 pounds and the XL fits him OK, maybe slightly big.  I can pull it up enough so it's not loose in the crotch.
