We recently bought this for our seven month old son (less than one month ago).  He uses it only when he is in the car for longer car rides.  I just noticed the other day that it already has a rip in the leg.  He has used this only a handful of times.  Although the tear will be fairly easy to sew, it is frustrating to have to mend this seeing as though it is quite new.On a positive note, it is super adaptable and easy to use with any type of pacifier.  I like that you can remove the pacifier from the stuffed animal for easy cleaning and sanitizing.
