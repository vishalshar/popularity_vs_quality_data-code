I love the music, and the giraffe that lights up, but the mobile part doesn't work without holding it and moving it around and even then it doesn't always work. I had to tape it into place and still doesn't work consistently. This is a bummer because my 8 month old LOVES to watch it go round. At least he also enjoys the music and the night light.
