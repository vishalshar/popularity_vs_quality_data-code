We bought this to help entertain our kids on a car trip. It was okay - they didn't really seem that interested in it on their own. At one point they were both crying and we were an hour away from our destination, so I sat with them and kept playing the annoying dog's song over and over (trying to get it synced up, but failing) until they passed out. So there was that. Ruff ruff. I was singing the song over and over in my head that night.
