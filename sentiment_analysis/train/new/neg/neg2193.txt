The only useful thing this pacifier clip does it make it harder to lose the pacifier. It neither ataches well to the pacifier or to any item of clothing or blanket etc...The plastic end meant to attach to the tab of a soothie pacifier is so stiff and bulky it gets in the way when the baby is trying to suck and sometimes it makes it much more likely to fall out. This is not a secure way to hold onto the pacifier either and it usually falls out in a very little amount of time.The clip on the other end is laughably small and weak. If your baby is more than a month old he or she will be pulling this clip off of anything, if it doesn't fall off on its own.I would recommend the Alexabella pacifier clip instead - even though it seems to be bizarrly expensive. It doesn't break like the Walmart clips and it is the most secure attaching paci-clip I've found.
