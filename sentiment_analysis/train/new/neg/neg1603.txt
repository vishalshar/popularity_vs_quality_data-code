I bought these before I had my baby because I had heard rave reviews.  This has been my first time pumping and I wanted to be prepared.  I use the Medela pump in style for 4 months and I prefer the Medela flange, they just seem to fit and suction on more efficiently.  These flanges fit the medela parts exactly.  I do not notice a difference in milk production between the two, so that is good.  I just dont think having the angle on the flange made pumping any more efficient or comfortable for me, so I really didn't need these
