The set overall is just okay. My little one will only play with two of them (the soft cloth one and the hard rattle one). The only one who plays with the blue bumpy one is the cat. If I could rate all the balls separately I would. The cloth ball is my little one's favourtie and although it doesn't roll well (because it is fabric and not completely round), he enjoys that it stays within reach. I would give that one 5 stars for sure.The rattle ball would get 4 stars. He can pick it up and grip it. It rolls really well. Perhaps when he is older he will enjoy it more.The blue bumpy ball gets 1 star. It doesn't roll well. It isn't stimulating and it had a strange odor that frequent washings has final reduced.
