I have both the Lily Pad Frog and the Monkey designs.This is okay for its intended purpose, as long as it only touches the baby's butt. My baby slept on this with her face touching the pad (bec I figured, it fits the entire bassinet, so might as well use the full length). She developed red bumps all over her face for days, until we figured this was the culprit.  True enough, her face cleared when we removed this pad.Yes, that means I could've just bought the smaller version instead (lap pad).
