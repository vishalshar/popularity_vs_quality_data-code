i never got to even try it out i ordered it in December but i didn't have my baby till march so when i went to wind it up for the first time for my baby it wouldn't wind the winder just freely turns but doesnt wind and since i didn't realize it was broken till march the seller wont do anything for me so i paid 40.00 for a useless mobile
