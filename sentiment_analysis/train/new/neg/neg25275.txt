I bought these so that I could keep them plugged in all the time and save the bulb and energy used with the on/off light sensor but it doesn't work. When I turn on the bedroom lights, the night light doesn't turn off. Maybe my lights aren't bright enough to trip the sensor. Who knows. I'm just using them as a standard night light and unplug it when I don't need it. As a night light goes, it's great. Bright enough for me to see what I'm doing and check up on my little one but still dark enough to keep him sleepy during his night time feedings.
