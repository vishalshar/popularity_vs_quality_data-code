I got  this set despite some bad reviews, because I have other items from the same company and they were pretty good.The brush is so soft that it only brushes the top hairs and  from the first use left my granddaughter looking like she had grey hair, that's how much it shed. The comb's teeth are so thick that it doesn't grab any hair!. So the whole set is absolutely useless!
