I bought this on an Amazon lightning deal. It was kind of a mistake.  I thought it would fit on just any changing station but I found out it was a bit small.  As soon as I put my son on the changing station, the cover would come off the changing station sides and then blank my son.  Even if  it did  fit my changing station,  I wouldn't recommend it either.  The monkey is kinda scary looking and may be even offensive for some.
