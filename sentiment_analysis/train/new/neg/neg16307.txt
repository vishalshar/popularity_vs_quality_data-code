This is a waste of money.  The bedding is going to fall apart, especially the ribbons, during the first (and only) wash.  The mattress is thinner than 150 sheets of paper.  The "wood" is cheap and parts are either cracked, bowed out, or both.  Even the hard ware like the screws aren't even usable.  The bumper falls apart, and the ribbons will have to be cut off if you try to wash it due to them getting destroyed.  I can't believe I spent the money on this, let alone $150! I am more that disappointed!
