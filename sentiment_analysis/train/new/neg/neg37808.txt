I got this stroller to go with the infant car seat, so I made the mistake of not looking at the stroller in the store. I would strongly encourage you to go someplace to try it out, along with several other strollers. It is not very well-designed, and I had the following issues: 1. the main problem is that it does not turn well at all. We tried letting the front weheels turn vs. having them fixed, and either way the stroller was hard to turn/maneuver, especially with one hand (which happens when you are carrying packages in he other!). 2. The storage underneath is too small and hard to access. 3. There is no tray accessory for when your child gets older and you want to put a sippy cup or snack out. 4. Every time you open it when you attach the infant carrier, you have to put the seat down, which takes TWO HANDS - meaning, you have to remember to do this BEFORE you take the carrier out of the car, and if you forget and it's wet or raining hope that you can set it on the seat of the car! 5. It's difficult to open and close, compared with other strollers I've seen - you have to find a small latch on the side of the stroller in order to latch it shut.Overall, I have friends with other strollers that are much better designed and I wish I'd tried some out before registering for this one.
