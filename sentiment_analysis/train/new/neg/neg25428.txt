I cant seem to get mine to work...no matter how I put my hand under it, the only way the soap comes out is if I put my hand around the girafs face (like Im grabbing his head).  If it wont work for me there is no way it will work for my 3 year old!  I turned on the song and the soap pumps several times while the song is playing no matter if your hand is there or not, but when the song is off, it does not pump unless I grab the giraf head...I wanted to like this so much!  too bad It looks like Ill have to send it back ) :
