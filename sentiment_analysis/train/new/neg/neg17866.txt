I bought this for my wife as we were expecting twins, who are now 7-weeks old.  She has used it only 4 or 5 times and doesn't even try to use it anymore.  It just doesn't work for her.  All the product photos show mothers sitting on beds nursing.  My wife prefers to sit in a chair or on the sofa.  It just doesn't work there.  She said it would be very awkward to try to use it sitting on the bed, so she didn't even try that.  Now it just takes up space (and it's huge!)  She really wanted it to work, but it just doesn't.  She just sits in a recliner with arms and uses a couple of small regular pillow.Imagine trying, with a baby in each hand, to sit down in a recliner while simultaniously trying to manipulate a 4 foot wide pillow - bending the center part upward behind your back as you sit.  Really, you have to have somebody to help you do that.
