We had a plastic mat underneath our high chair for the first two years for our daughter... It was very useful, the only downside being that it wasn't that attractive and things sometimes got under it. All in all it was fine and we replaced it because it was getting worn out, and we thought we would get something more attractive and fun.Enter the Splashmat - we put it under the high chair and gave it a go - but we expected it to be a little tougher and thicker so that we could move a chair on it without it bunching up, and that it would stay flat. It does not stay flat - Every time we pull the chair in and out it bunches up and wrinkles. Though we can straighten it out, it requires constant attention and re-laying. Not what we needed, and we have stopped using it and folded it away to use for picnics or as a beach throw, we guess. It's pretty and probably would be good for that, but fails as a under table mat to keep things clean.
