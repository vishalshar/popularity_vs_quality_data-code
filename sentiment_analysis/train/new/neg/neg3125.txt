This booster is OK I guess...but only if you have kids big enough to stay still!!! Got it for my 3yrs old son and more than a safety tool it was a hazard. The locking mechanism is pretty poor and the recline arrangement is not enough for when kids are sleeping/resting. Ended up buying a Britax 6 months after...so, go figure!...
