I was so excited to open this up when the UPS guy delivered the box a few moments ago...but when I opened it my first thought was, "is that it?"  I guess I didn't read the dimensions of the product before purchasing it because it is incredibly small for a burp cloth.  It is cute, but the pro's end there.  It's more of a hassle to use as a shoulder burp cloth because it slides off (if you leave the terry side facing up against your babies face the pattern side is on your shoulder/shirt and that is just a slippery cotton material).  It is soft on the terry side, but not plush like they claim.  I have wash cloths from the dollar store that are more plush than this.  Save your $14 and buy something else.  I'll stick with using a flannel receiving blanket folded in 1/2.
