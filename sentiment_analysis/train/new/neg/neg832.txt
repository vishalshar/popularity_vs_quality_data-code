This bouncer was great for the fact that it entertained my babies.  I think I used it as much with the aquarium part as I did without.  And if they started to fuss I'd turn on the massage feature and that would give me a bit more time to finish whatever it was I was doing before picking them up.  The bad things about this bouncer were that I ended up putting rolled up blankets on either side of them because I found that both babies had a tendency to fall to one side or the other and if left I'm sure they would have ended up hanging off the bouncer altogether.  Another bad thing was that I had to stop using it with both babies around 5 months because they started using their stomach muscles to pull themselves forwards and without a five point harness they managed to get forward and totally fell off to one side.  No injuries occurred because they were strapped at the waist but I don't think I've moved so fast to get the poor darlings out of their predicament.  If looking for bouncers I would suggest something with a 5-point harness because though this one has a great entertainment feature in my opinion the usable life span for each child isn't long enough.  I've now borrowed a bouncer/rocker with a 5-point harness from my friend for my 5month old son and I think he'll safely be in that up until he is sitting consistently by himself.
