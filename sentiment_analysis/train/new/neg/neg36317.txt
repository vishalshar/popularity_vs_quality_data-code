I saw several negative reviews, but there were many more that were good so I decided to try this mat....boy am I sorry that I didn't listen to the customers that were not happy! Some happy customers said that it was perfect for their 4 year old (the age of my grandson) but the size is better for a 2-3 year old and the "pillow" (I use that term loosely) is lumpy and poorly filled. The "mat" is not much more than a double layer of fabric with binding along the edge. Very disappointed!
