It's a great idea, I wish it had worked better for us.  My son was just too curious though and kept pulling up the placemat.  The suction cups seem to work best on non-wooden table surfaces, but it was still pretty easy for my son to break the suction and pull up the placemat regardless of the table surface (we used it strictly for restaurant dining).  I do really like the sturdiness of the material and the little tray pocket that catches a lot of food that would normally end up in the child's lap.  The placemat is also easy to rinse off in a restaurant bathroom.
