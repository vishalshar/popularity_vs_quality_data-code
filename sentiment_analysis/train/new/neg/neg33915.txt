I really liked this highchair when my girls were infants. I have 2 of these highchairs for my twins. But when they got bigger and they started using the big tray everyday then I found a lot more issues.Cons:The fabric is very hard to clean so I have to take the fabric and straps off about every other day and wash in machines. The plastic parts and on the highchair itself are hard to clean as well. There is a lot of small cracks and screw holes that baby food gets in. I have to try and steam it out. Also, the food trap underneath the high chair needs to be removed with a screwdriver, which is annoying.The biggest issue is the large tray!!!There is a release button on the underside of the tray. The babies quickly figure out where this latch is with their foot. They simply push the latch with their foot and the tray falls on the ground and the food goes flying. I always strap the babies in the highchair but forbid that someone forgot to strap a baby in. Then the tray, the food, and the child would go flying.
