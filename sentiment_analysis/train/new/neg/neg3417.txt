The adapters work, but not as well as we expected. They click into the stroller (city mini single) very easily. And then our carseat (britax b-safe) does click into the adapters, but it's not the simple and immediate click-in that we expected. We have to push the carseat down pretty hard, and maybe even manually click the little levers on the adapters, to get it to click in all the way.We thought this might be a defect, so we took our set-up to the store and tried the adapters with a different carseat. Same problem, so we figured it's not our carseat's issue.  Then we ordered a replacement set of adapters, thinking we'd just received a bogus set.  But we have the same issue with the replacement set.So we'll use them, and will probably get used to the extra effort to make sure it's all clicked in correctly. But we were really expecting it to be more of a smooth process. We have a 2014 stroller and 2014 carseat - I think I've read from some other reviews that the adapters don't work as well with the 2014 carseat? Maybe we need to keep an eye out for an updated set of adapters.  Because we do love the stroller and we do love the carseat...and once we've correctly clicked everything together, it seems snug and secure and everything.  Just more of a pain than I expected.
