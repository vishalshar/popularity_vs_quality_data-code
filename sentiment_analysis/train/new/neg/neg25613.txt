The bag arrived within the time frame the seller advertised, however it wasn't quite what I was expecting.  The bag is very big and roomy and it looks nice, but the material is stiff (possibly because its water proof?) and doesn't give at all with its shape.  That could be a desired effect, but it felt and looked like luggage to me, especially when draped across my back.  Additionally, more importantly, I felt like it was hard to close.  The snaps weren't where they'd be if the top closed down all the way.  It's an inch or so higher, so I had to fumble a bit to get it closed, which I didn't look forward to doing with one hand.  I tried to fill it with t-shirts to see if it was the same with stuff in it, and it was.Positive things, the cross body strap was nice and felt sturdy and the print is exactly as described.  It's big and doesn't feel cheap.  You can see on one of the photos the lining is purple, I thought the color was nice.One other thing, regarding this seller, in returning the item the seller wants a 15% restocking fee. I didn't see this in their return policy, in fact even now it says they have Amazon's return policy.  I also had to pay ~10 dollars for return shipping.  Something to consider before purchasing this bag here.
