We have two of these. The first came with dead batteries which was a bit annoying. We used it and it seemed like the battery door wasn't water tight. The temperature also seemed way off! The water felt very warm to me and yet the temp read 91-92 degrees. We double checked with a second thermometer which said it was 10 degrees warmer (which judging by feel, was more accurate). Would have sent back but tossed the package, so sent an email to Amazon and we received a replacement. The second one read about 2 degrees different from the first and also was several degrees off from what seemed too warm and read warmer on another thermometer. I purposely filled the sink with water that was borderline too hot for me as an adult that loves hot baths and showers and the thermometers read the temp at 95 degrees (definitely wrong!) if I trusted these devices I probably would have scalded my daughter. Now she has some cute bath toys though :-/
