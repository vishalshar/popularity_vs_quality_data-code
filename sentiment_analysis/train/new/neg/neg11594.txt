My eight month old has a few electronic noisy larger toys that were given to us (I dislike these noisy things) and I thought maybe a smaller handheld noise toy might interest him for car rides and boring trips. This toy is not xylophone sounding tones but odd random noises like bubbling, etc. He has never attempted to play with it on his own and the toy is too large for his hands and awkward to grasp. Maybe he'll grow into it?
