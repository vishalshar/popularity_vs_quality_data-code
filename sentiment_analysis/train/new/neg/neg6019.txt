The size and weight of this product made it very portable which is important when you have multiple grandparent sleep overs.  This allows for the product to move with baby from house to house and gives our little one something that is familiar at each bedtime.  I love the sweet classical music, and the sound level is just right, unlike many products we've tried lately that are extremely loud.  I was a little disappointed in the light show part of the product because the room must be dark for the lights to show up, and the images are out of focus unless you have the product at just the right height in the room.  Overall we are enjoying the product for nighttime and portability.
