I have been using this caddy for ages now and find it totally a must have and indispensable even now that my daughter is 3. I bought it as a baby shower gift and was so upset and dissapointed that it came totally damaged as it was packed so poorly. There was no stuffing or anything to protect the item since it is made from really strong cardboard it was all bent and damaged when it arrived... Would cost me more to ship it back so just trashed it... Such a waste considering it's a great item. I should hv ordered it from Target like I did before coz they packaged it well. Anyway all said and done.. It's a great item just make sure you buy it in the store or order it from Target or somewhere else coz amazon/ jj Cole packaging was lousy and u will receive a damaged piece!
