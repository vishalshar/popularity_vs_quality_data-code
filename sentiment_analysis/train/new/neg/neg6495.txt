I bought this rattle for my 7 month old granddaughter, and she loves it. Problem is the three balls on the ends are very hard. I was holding her with the rattle in her, turned around and hit me in the mouth, cracked a crown in my mouth, which cost $1250.00 to replace. Of course that was a freak accident, but I'm thinking of what could happened to her.
