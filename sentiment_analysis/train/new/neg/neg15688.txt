Love Medela products and very happy with my Medela pump, but the separate shields and connectors make it difficult to monitor milk flow when compared with using the one-piece supplies.  This is especially important if you are using compression during pumping to increase your yield -- the seams between the shields and the connectors make it hard to see the flow of milk.  Otherwise, the parts fit together well, clean well, and work great.
