LOVE the trim fit of these diapers and how much softer the cotton is now compared to some older prints I bought in the past.You do however need to watch your dryer abuse.. As despite the dryer being the best way to keep these inners soft, the elastic and multi layers of cotton in the leg gussets are not long lasting with the beating.The do bleach well, though (properly diluted) which is great because they stain easily, if you care. I did not find that they sunned as well as other fabrics.
