I purchased this bedding after researching lots of others and though this one would be the most bang for my buck. You always get what you pay for. The zebra stripes are almost a greenish brown. The rest of the colors are just okay. I was so excited to get this only to open it and be disappointed. The fitted sheet is so thin It looks like it might fall apart when I wash it. Im looking into returning it after the holiday.
