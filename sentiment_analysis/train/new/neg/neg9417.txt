We were very disappointed that this cute stuffed toy arrived smashed into an almost flat box with no plastic wrap. I don't think my 3-year-old grandson quite recognized what is was supposed to be (nor did we) when he first opened the box. Also, the hair pulls out very easily. We have the smaller version of this same toy that arrived in much better condition. I would not risk buying this toy.
