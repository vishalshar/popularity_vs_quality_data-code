Do not buy. This gate fell apart after only about a month. As I opened it one day, the hinge fell apart, with a couple of pieces and a spring falling out. One of the screws had apparently pierced the top plastic part. Very cheap construction. Also, the company seems very sketchy. When I went to their website to register my product, their online registration form did not work. It always fails to submit. The same thing with their contact form when I tried to alert them of the problem. They also had an email address, so I tried to contact them that way, but that email address fails.
