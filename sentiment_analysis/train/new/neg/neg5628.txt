I purchased this item through Amazon to use on seedlings. This LED is made the same as other brands in the 14 watt panel variety. Cheap plastic with a cardboard panel holding the LED's in place. I own a variety of LED grow lights in panel form and UFO configurations upto 300 watts. This particular panel from Sunshine Systems was faulty as the power supply wasn't properly attached and would cause the unit to power on and off by itself. From reading other reviews this is a fairly common problem. Amazon was quick to refund the full price.14 watt panels are fine for seedlings as long as you keep the panel within an inch or two of the leafs. For anything else I highly suggest only using lights that use at least 1 watt per led, ie. 90 watt 90 led UFO light. LED lights are expensive initially but using the high powered LED's correctly offer great results with low maintenance and lowered energy costs. If you have the money I recommend stepping up and purchasing at least a 90 watter from Bloomboss or Sunshine Systems.
