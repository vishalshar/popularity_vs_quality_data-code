Pros- It can be used as a stool, it can be used as a separate potty or it can be used on a regular toilet. Part of the reason I bought this is because of the overall good reviews and multifunction.Cons- I have a little boy and the pee guard isn't big enough. He regularly sprays over the top and then I have to take the many pieces apart to clean it and the floor. Big pain. There are a bunch of grooves under the seat for pee to get caught in and the seat itself is two different pieces. There is the "soft" blue part and then the white plastic part with the handles. There are multiple little tabs that lock the two together that make it difficult to take apart and put back together. I would rather not spend ten minutes cleaning every time he pees. We have also tried the seat on our regular toilet and it moves way too much. Handles aren't any help if the seat is going to move all over the place. We have only been potty training for about a week and I am already looking for a replacement.
