I gave the item a 3 because it looks ok. However, I don't like receiving open and dirty items when I pay full price for a new item. I can't say whether the item shipped open from the company or from Amazon but either way, I'm not impressed. This will be the second time I have received an open/used item from Amazon. The items look as if they will be good quality after washing them. I would have done that anyway, it's the principle of it all.
