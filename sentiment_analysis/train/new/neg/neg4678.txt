Maybe I'm the only idiot that just assumed these were bigger than they are without really looking closely at the measurements, but they are not big at all.  The largest "cup" is about the size of a laundry detergent lid.  The smallest... a little bigger than a soda bottle lid.  The stickers are also very cheap looking and most have "bubbles" in them; just cheap graphics. I have seen some really awesome stacking "cup" sets but this doesn't compare.  Definitely a disappointment to receive in the mail.  If you're looking for a small set, however, these might work for you.  I just was hoping for a set that my little one could build as tall as she is (or close).  But, at least we have great circle cutters of all sizes for Play-Doh =)
