Not a huge fan of these placemats.  I bought them to replace another brand that we ran out of (placed an order for them today).There is only adhesive on the top and bottom, not on the sides. Once my 15 mos old figured that out, RIIIIIP off they come!They tear very easily when trying to cut up food, even with the side of a fork, and just are not very sturdy.I prefer the Classy Kids Germ Free coloring sheets...much more sturdy, and interesting.
