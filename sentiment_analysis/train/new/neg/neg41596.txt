Although this product is good for my son's sensory-seeking behavior (chewing), it was way overpriced at $9.99. The picture shows 5 charms; you only receive 1 along with your simple keychain-style "necklace." After receiving it, I looked in the listing to see if it mentioned this and couldn't find it so if it's there, it's well-hidden. I'm a bit disappointed but the product does serve its purpose.
