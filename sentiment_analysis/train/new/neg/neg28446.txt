Okay I absolutely love this diaper bag. I bought it for a friend and she hasn't seen it yet but when i did open the package the bottom already had a tear in the seam which was pretty big... luckily my mom is going to be able to stitch it back together but I wasn't really happy when I seen that. Other than that it is perfect. and looks just like picture.
