This is a decent brush. It has soft bristles but still cleans the inside of bottles pretty well. The rubber nipple cleaner is useless, and I had to buy separate small brushes in order to properly clean the nipples. The bristles do warp and separate pretty quickly, as you can see in my photos. I've been using this brush everyday for about 2 weeks. It is nice and cleans well, but it doesn't seem like it will last for very long. The stand is nice and big, but still pretty easy for the brush to tip over.
