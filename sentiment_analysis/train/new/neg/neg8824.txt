The potty bucket is very small and is very hard for a little one to go poop in.  I thought I would use the part that clips on the toilet and it would be better....not the case, the opening is not long enough.  It is a circle, so it makes things very difficult.  He can sit easily on it, that is the only good thing.  It has made his potty training fun for him, and a disinfecting nightmare for me.
