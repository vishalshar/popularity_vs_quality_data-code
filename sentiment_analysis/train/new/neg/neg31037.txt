One of the reasons I picked this particular bassinet sheet (besides the rave reviews) was the color. I wanted something pink. Really pink. In the image the sheet is very, very pink. I got the item and opened it and thought they had sent me the wrong product. It was cream color with black polka dots. I immediately asked for a replacement, because, as I said, I wanted PINK sheets. The second order came in and it was EXACTLY the same as the first. I looked closer (in a very bright light) and realized that they were indeed pink...the palest pink I have ever seen. They almost don't qualify as a color at all. Love the texture, good quality fabric, nice and thick. Disappointed though, that the color of the item pictured was way WAY off from what I received.
