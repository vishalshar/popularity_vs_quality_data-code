I bought this product mainly because I just got a car that does not have a cup holder. I use this car mostly by myself, so it seats in the passenger seat.The overall functionality is good, however the cup holders are VERY small! I can't fit my travel coffee cup in there, which was the main reason I bought it. I don't think you can even fit a can of soda in there. I bought a small soda from a fast food place, and even it would not fit.If you only need an organizer for things, this will work well for you, but not if you need a cup holder for anything other than really small cups.
