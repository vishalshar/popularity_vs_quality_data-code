We've had this chair for about 9 months now.  If I had known how high maintenance it would be, I would not have bought it.  For many months it sat unused by our 1 year-old and so the cat staked his claim.  I noticed how dirty it had become and thought it was pretty gross, but didn't understand why it had gotten that way from just our clean, indoor cat laying on it. I had tried to clean it with a few different products and wasn't able to find anything that worked on the gross looking brown stains.  Before throwing it away, I finally decided to try scrubbing it down one last time with color safe bleach and warm water, followed by warm soapy water to get the bleach off.  That worked like a charm, but the chair still needs to be cleaned several times a week if we want it to stay spot-free.  I don't know what it is about the fabric on this chair, but I hate it.  If you buy this chair, I hope you have the skill to sew a slipcover for it or something.  One drop of water, and it dries with a brown ring around it. Our daughters drink from leaky sippy cups and before you know it, two days have gone by since I last scrubbed it and there are disgusting brown stains all over it. Something for kids should not be so delicate and I'm very disappointed in the fabric for a $50 chair.
