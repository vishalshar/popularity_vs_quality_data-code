I bought this bag to use as a travel wet bag for cloth diapers and as a backup when my other pail liner is in the laundry.  I wanted a zippered wet bag that didn't cost a ton beacuse I don't usually travel with my cloth diapers, I use biofriendly disposables and flush away the contents of the diaper.  Works great for that purpose.  It is on the small size so it can really only hold about 4 toddler size cloth diapers, and I have twins so that's not a bunch. It would work better for smaller babies as you could get more in the bag.  I've also put damp (not soaking)bathing suits in it, and it worked fine.  But as a backup to my pail liner I'm happy with it, and I'm not disapointed for the price I paid.  I'll keep it for the uses I have mentioned and will probably just sew my own slightly larger zippered wet bag.
