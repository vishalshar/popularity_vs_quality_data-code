When I bought this in late Sept 2011, the picture above is of a relatively tall, narrow stainless thermos, pink base, all-pink lid with purple button.  Same size as "fun-tainers" sold at Target and the like, which I think are 12 oz.  What I received was a shorter, pudgier cup, wider at the bottom than the top, pink base, pink lid, purple button, but purple plastic stripe at the base of the lid.  It's smaller (10 oz) than a fun-tainer.  I wanted what is pictured (a "fun-tainer" without the "fun"), as I bought one 5 years ago and we have loved it all that time, but the lid just broke when my daughter dropped it on a cement floor at school.  They don't make the plain stainless straw cup with pink lid anymore, as I called Thermos customer service (who are great, by the way) for a replacement lid and could only get a non-matching lid.  So I was hoping this was a small store with extra old inventory left.  But alas.  This is the little kid, little cup with the curvy silouette and smaller capacity.  Thermos, if you're listening, please make a "fun-tainer" sized cup without a character on it.  We're Hello Kittied out, we're not into iCarly, etc, etc, etc.  We will keep this cup, as my Kindergartener still wants to take this to school instead of her Hello Kitty Funtainer cup, I'm just afraid it won't hold enough liquid to get her through the day, especially as she gets bigger.  As for quality, we are sold -- these things do keep things cold for a long time and my daughter prefers the straw to other "sports-bottle" style spouts.  And we didn't have a breaking issue for several years.  We DID have to buy replacement straws a while back, as my daughter tends to chew on them.  But they were cheap and arrived fast.
