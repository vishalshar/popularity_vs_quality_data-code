One big problem, the liquids will spill. My son, can drink from a regular cup without making any spills, of course with my supervision. He is 14 months and unfortunately, the fact that is meant to be use like a regular cup, but it has a lid is misleading. It will make your child tilt this cup all the way, making the liquids spills because he will not know when to stop once his mouth is full. I think if your child can differentiate, when he has tilted a cup too much to cause water to spill, or set it back to normal that it wont spill once the flow gets too much for him to handle, then this wont help.Honestly, this is a great idea, but it needs more work.  I think the flow of liquids is too fluid for a child.
