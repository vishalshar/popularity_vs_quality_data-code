This product is a bit flimsy.  It hung off the back of the seat and hit the back seat passengers in the legs.  I tried several times to affix the bottom of it to the seat with velcro, but nothing would stick to it for more than a day or so.  I also found the pockets to be too small to be useful.  I'll keep looking for an organizer that works for us.
