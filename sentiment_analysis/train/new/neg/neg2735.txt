When using our Quinny Moodd, and Zapp, I discovered quite quickly that storage is not the first consideration in the stroller business, but adding bulky storage onto the back end of the stroller seems as tho they would become tippy and unsafe as well.  Very happy to have found this product as it doesn't compromise the safety of either model, yet will at least allow me to throw my keys, and a small toy or possibly two in it.  It works for small added storage, it definitely is not going to hold any purse, or anything of significant size, but really if you had something bigger on the side, you wouldn't fit in most places you could previously.  Being able to access the few extra things I needed w/out having to remove the baby or reclining the seat is exactly what I needed.
