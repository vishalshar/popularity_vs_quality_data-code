As you can see from the reviews, everyone received the PINK combo and was the same what I got. I was really hoping that there would be a neutral color, since the ad stated "Color May Vary", but the color does not change and I ended up not giving importance to the reviews.So I wanted to leave here the warning: they do not send another color other than PINK. So if you have a boy and do not want PINK, look for another product where you can choose the color.The product appears OK (I didn't open the package - I will give away to someone who has girl), but I am disappointed that between three colors, they only send one to everyone!
