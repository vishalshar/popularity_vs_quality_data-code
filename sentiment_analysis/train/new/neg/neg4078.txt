It works ok.  I used it with a safety 1st guide 65.  As other reviews mentioned, it is not ideal on a soft side rolley suitcase.  It would slip down a bit as I pulled.  It was hard to pull it tight enough not to slip at all as it would just compress the suitcase more.  It was fairly easy to get on and off quickly
