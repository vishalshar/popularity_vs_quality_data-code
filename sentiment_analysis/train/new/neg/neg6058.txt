Not really what I had hoped for. We went with it because it was gender neutral but had I seen the pages inside I would have picked something else. It has a lot of lines for you to fill in that I find just bizarre like "how much weight mommy gained" or "my social security number and home address" -- sorry I don't think those things belong in a baby book. I've instead had to improvise with adding lots more random photos to cover things up. I was expecting more pages dedicated to baby's 1st's and less dedicated to my pregnancy weight and cravings.
