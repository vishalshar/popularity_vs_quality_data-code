These pillows were ok for a while but flattened too much and became very lumpy over time (seems to happen with most toddler pillows).So far we've tried this brand, "A Little Pillow Company" (the worst of the three), and "Little One's Pillow".  Our boys are now four so we've had a good amount of time to test and see how they hold up and we definitely have found the "Little One's Pillow" to be the best quality:http://www.amazon.com/Toddler-Pillow-Delicate-Supportive-Hand-Crafted/dp/B00PWKC32G?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
