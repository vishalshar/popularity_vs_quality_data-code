My 3-year old meets the minimum height and weight requirements for this car seat. I think the picture says it all. He fell asleep on the way home and I'm pretty sure that can't be safe. I will save these seats until he is older, but I think Graco needs to consider changing the minimum requirements before kids get hurt.
