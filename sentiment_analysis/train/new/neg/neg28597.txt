When we received our order, here are some things to note:1. The play mat is not as pictured on Amazon. Part of the reason I chose this was because of the color scheme in the photo on Amazon and what I received is a multitude of colors that isn't as appealing.2. The pieces of the mat are a bit jumbled. All of the letters are there, but some are paired in order, and others are in backwards order. Just creates extra work when piecing this together.3. Although I did see on Amazon that this is a 26-piece set, I didn't realize how inefficient that is - you can't make a square or rectangle mat with it, using all of the pieces and now I have a mat with one letter sticking out that we cannot put a border piece on, so odd shape. Perhaps consider that in future sales of this and add a few pieces to ensure all can be used at once to make a 4x6 mat, for example.4.One other thing - the reviews for this item on Amazon do not make sense. Most of them are talking about other play mats, not the alphabet one. It's very hard to get an idea of what others think of this when the reviews and Q&A don't match the product.
