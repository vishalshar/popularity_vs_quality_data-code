Though we don't ever have blowouts while my daughter sleeps (did I get lucky or is it too early at 8 months?), I bought these sheets as they were supposed to be the best out there for convenience and safety. Unfortunately they are as soft as a paper sack. Upon receiving these I couldn't believe how hard and crunchy they felt, really, just like a paper sack! I couldn't bring myself to remove the super soft jersey cotton sheet my daughter currently has on her crib to replace it with these sheets. So, unless or until I have a true need for them (midnight blowouts, or something) I'm going to put my daughter's comfort first and send these suckers back. QuickZip, you have an amazing idea! Please follow it up with some modern comfort and offer these sheets in jersey cotton! I'd gladly buy them in a heartbeat. For now, I'm sticking with her super soft sheets over a waterproof mattress cover.UPDATE: QuickZip's amazing team reached out to me immediately upon leaving this review and wanted to create a better experience for me. They sent out another set of these sheets and I returned my original ones to them. I also tried their "mink" ones at the same time (spoiler: the mink ones are fabulous). I'm sad to say the replacement of these wasn't much softer. I washed and dried them and still a bit rough feeling. They wash and dry well (cold water, dried on low) and fit the crib great. They aren't terribly uncomfortable, but I preferred my jersey cotton to the material on these.However the HEAVENLY MINK ones are AMAZING! They are so very soft, and plush. I should have gotten them to begin with but I didn't see that they were available. I love the concept, I love the Heavenly Mink sheets, and the customer service this company provides is second to none.
