Not long lasting, but they work for an occasional addition to an outfit. A couple of them started unraveling after one wear/wash, and the elastic is not consistent between pairs. There is supposed to be a tight end and a loose end, and some of them were much looser than others and would not stay up on my baby's thighs.
