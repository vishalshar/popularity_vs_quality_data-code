I purchased these particular storage cups for their size, interchangeable lids, and their eco-friendly/human-friendly construction material. I intended to use them to store homemade baby food for daycare, but unfortunately, they are not air tight. They leak anything liquid or pureed - applesauce, pureed pears, rice cereal, etc. I tried different cups and switching the lids, but had the same results with all. Also, I just purchased these so this was the first time using them (it's not like I've been using them for a while and they were worn out).I'm sure they make great snack containers for dry items (Cheerios, Goldfish), but they are not as functional as I expected and needed. Also, note that these cannot be microwaved. I could not find this information anywhere online, but it's stated on the packaging.
