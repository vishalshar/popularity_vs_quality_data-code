The seat part of this is great - fits our chairs and is easy to clean. I was not very impressed with the activity tray part. The little piece that slides across it to clear the design is cheaply made and flimsy - it broke within 24 hours of being unpacked. However, my son does still enjoy playing with it and usually just shakes the whole tray a bit to get the design to clear so he can draw again.
