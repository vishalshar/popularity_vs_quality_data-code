I returned a Summer Infant Day & Night Handheld b/c it was very static-y in our apartment. I then returned a Summer Infant Sleek & Secure b/c I could not see ANYTHING in the night vision mode. Terrible product. So the Home Sentry was the third video monitor I've tried in the last month. It works well -- the night vision is clear, and though there is a slight delay, I think it is far superior than the other two monitors I've tried. The sound is fine, and there is no static. You can change the sensitivity so that the sound only comes on when the baby really starts to get noisy. My main issue is that the product does seem kind of cheap-made-in-China (you know what I mean), so paying $160 for it kind of hurts. The plastic was also scratched right out of the box, and I've emailed the company but have not heard anything back. The "Safe Baby" logo on the monitor is super cheesy. If I could do it over again, I would order this same monitor, but from a different company and without the logo (it is available like this -- just search on Amazon and you'll find it).
