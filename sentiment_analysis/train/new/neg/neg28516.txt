I was super excited about this nipple but it ended up not working for us at all. There are so many pieces to this nipple and it's hard to assemble let alone clean. Once it's on the bottle and we start feeding our baby it leaks and he ends up drenched. More ends up on his clothes than in his tummy and he doesn't like it either
