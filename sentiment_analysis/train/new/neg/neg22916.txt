This backpack carrier looks amazing, and the padding for the child being carried seems adequate. My 1 year old was able to fall asleep in it today, so that's pretty good. I also like the two different harness options for the added safety of the child inside, and the rain cover/sun shade is fantastic. The stand is very easy to fold and unfold even while wearing the carrier. My one complaint about this carrier is that it's extremely uncomfortable to wear. I wore it for 4 hours today while sightseeing and felt like my skeleton was crumbling in on itself, bones snapping and cracking all through my shoulders, neck, and lower back. This isn't the first backpack carrier I've owned, so it's not like I don't know what I'm doing. I've adjusted the straps countless times and cannot get the weight distributed to my waist, supported by the flimsy waistband that seems to serve only to hold the carrier closer to the body. So the full weight of the pack and my baby hangs from my shoulders and it's really uncomfortable, especially since the shoulder straps have only thin, hard padding. It doesn't bother my husband as much as it bothers me, though, so we'll keep it...but if I did this over again I'd pick a carrier that didn't make me feel like it enjoys torturing me.
