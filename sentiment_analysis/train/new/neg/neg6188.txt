It's a little crooked/uneven at the bottom and the stitching is a LITTLE undone in the back, but otherwise it's a good quality pacifier pod. I would recommend it (hopefully yours doesn't come out crooked though, kind of bothers me). I can fit 3 pacifiers (size 0-3 months). I could probably fit a fourth if I really tried to smush it in together.
