I purchased this high chair because of the strong recommendation of the sales person.Pros:1. large tray catches messes2. extra tray cover is helpful3. easy to wash all piecesCons:1. the leg divider attaches to the tray (the salesperson sold me on this as being a good thing because toddlers can get in and out of the chair on their own, but my baby gets joy out of pushing her feet against the middle part while I'm trying to get it on the chair.2. it seems so big for my baby (the tray comes up to her chest)3. it is big - I live in a small condo and this takes a lot of spaceThe other thing the salesperson sold me on was how adjustable it is (though I haven't used any of those features).  Maybe I'll like it better when my daughter gets older, but right now I'm chalking this up to a new mom error and wouldn't recommend it to others.
