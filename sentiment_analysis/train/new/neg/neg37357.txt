I will start off by saying I'm a first time mom and my son is 10 months old now. I'm ashamed to say when I was in search of a carseat while pregnant I only cared about getting something cute and not something that was safe. I hate that the base of the carseat does not recline so you have to stack up blankets underneath so your baby's head doesn't flop down while sleeping. Also the straps are really hard to adjust. You have to go in the back and adjust it by threading it through a metal piece. I once didn't do it correctly and it came completely undone while driving!!! I can't tell you how upset and scared I was when that happened. I feel like hours of my life has been wasted trying to adjust the straps! I gave this product two stars because the print is cute and I did get a lot of compliments for that. Also want to say the stroller is huge. I don't normally write reviews especially bad ones but I have had such a horrible time with this travel system I didn't want another first time mom to make the same mistake I did.
