Thought I would love this product but seems VERY faulty! After testing my milk and waiting, I fed it to my baby. After feeding him for a few minutes I look back over at the strip and it's dark purple!! This has happened on a few different occassuons. Let it sit for a minute past the "2 minute recommendation" and it turns positive for alcohol. My piece of mind is gone because of this product I never know when it's true or false. On other occasions I've used 2 strips to test the same milk to ensure that the results were good and both tests came up with something different. Very sad to see this
