until it quit working!  I am really disappointed.  I have bought and returned about 4 of these bouncers within 2 months time.  Each one started out working great.  My son absolutely LOVED this bouncer!  He would smile and "talk" to the little characters on the toy bar.  He would kick his feet and make the chair bounce and the characters move around on the toy bar.  Then the music on the toy bar started malfunctioning.  It would stop all together, the volume would go from soft to loud on its own, the music would start a song and then stop and start an entirely different song.....  I returned each bouncer each time it would do this and buy another one of the same, as my son REALLY enjoyed this particular bouncer.  I am returning my 5th Bobblin Band Bouncer tomorrow and unfortunately will have to try and find a whole different bouncer that hopefully my son will enjoy just as much.
