I guess I didn't read the description closely enough to realize that these weren't in fact wicker baskets. I was just surprised because they don't hold their shape as well. The bottoms were rounded out, and I guess I'd prefer something that didn't sag as I'm using them in my kitchen for storage on my new island. Depending on what I store I'll have to be careful when pulling the baskets out. They'll do, they are the closest I could get to a size fit. Just wish the bottoms were sturdier.
