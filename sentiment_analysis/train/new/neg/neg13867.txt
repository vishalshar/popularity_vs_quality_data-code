I purchased two of these cloth diapers about 2 weeks ago. When I got them in the mail and opened the packaging I was super excited, I felt like I finally found a cheaper version of a Bum Genius. These GoGrean cloth diapers feel extremely durable, have sturdy colorful snaps, an extra protective barrier to keep everything inside the diaper, and were insanely cute! However, none of that matters because as soon as my son urinates, it leaks out through the leg part of the diaper EVERY SINGLE TIME! I've tried everything to keep his pee from escaping the cloth diaper but nothing works. I've verified that the diaper is fitted properly, that none of the cloth is hanging outside of the diaper and that his private part is pointed straight down (as i've learned ya gotta do with the boys!). Nothing that I do will keep his pee from escaping, so then I realized that I can't do anything about it; GoGreen should have created a better diaper that actually does its job!No matter what I do, this diaper immediately LEAKS!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I will NEVER purchase this product ever again!!For the record, my son is 3 months old and of average size; about 12-13 lbs. Also, my son has never gone poo in this diaper so I'm unsure of how it will hold up against that movement.
