Con: It's almost impossible to drink out of this cup! You'd have to screw the lid on dangerously loose, stick your fingers in both lid holes to open them up, and suck til you turn blue in the face. The result is a tiny tiny stream of liquid. Both me and my 2 year old tried it and had a hard time drinking from it. Occassionally the lid holes would open up just the right way to make sucking easier, but it's not worth the effort if the cup will only work 20% of the time.Con: Damages easily. The spout is hard plastic which dings easily when dropped or chewed. I already have these rough plastic bite ridges on the spout after just 2 days of use at daycare.Pro: Somewhat spill proof. A little bit of milk will come out of the air intake hole on top if you shake it upside down.Conclusion: I wouldn't buy this cup again. I'd buy the Playtex Insulator (9 oz) instead, which I tried and was super easy to drink out of, and seemed extremely spill proof.
