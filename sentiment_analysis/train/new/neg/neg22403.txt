This is one of the best mats that I've seen. I love the Sassy products - the colors and patterns are developmentally appropriate for infants. And the materials are clearly quality. My daughter absolutely LOVES the bugs that hang down - they each make a different sound. And the crinkly leaves are her favorite. Plus, when she's on her stomach, the bugs can be reattached to the pillow so she can continue to play with them. From the standpoint of entertaining and engaging her, this is amazing.The negatives though have to do with the construction. There is nothing weighting the mat down, so she is constantly pulling it up and around and getting it all twisted. And because the overhead bar just velcroes to the edge of the mat, it's very easy for her to yank and take it apart. We constantly look down to see her with the bar in her hands like a baseball bat just swinging it around. And just so you understand, my daughter is 4 months old and while a little bit on the big side, not to the point that it should be so easy for her to do this. The saving grace is that even dismantled, there is nothing she can hurt herself with.So she loves the mat, but my husband and I have some concerns about how easily it can be dismantled by the baby.
