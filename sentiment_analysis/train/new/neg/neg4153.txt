I did a lot of research before finally deciding to buy the Joovy play yard and bassinet. First the positives...the only thing so far that I really liked about that it is the changing pad. It is extremely sturdy and well-made. The parent organizer is nice but unnecessary. It is easy to put together and take apart and everything fits in the carrying case.. My major concern is the bassinet. It doesn't stay completely flat. It bows in the middle and creates a dip. I contacted customer service and they sent me a new bassinet insert and mattress. They were very easy to work with an extremely helpful. However, getting the new insert and mattress did not help. We used to this as our child's bassinet until he was about three months old so it was a major disappointment that it wasn't well-made. I can't speak to the quality when it's made into a crib/playyard as we haven't used it that way yet. Also the electronic unit with the light and sounds has a loud beep to turn on, it's weird since this is an item where kids sleep, there is no need for additional noise!  My parents have a much less expensive portable crib and that bassinet feels much sturdier. If we ever have another child I think I would probably buy a new portable crib. I would not recommend buying this and I would return it if I could.
