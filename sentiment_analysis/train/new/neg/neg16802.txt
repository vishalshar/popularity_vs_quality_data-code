I was looking for a Thomas sippy cup for a friend's son. He's too old for a bottle and is having a really hard time switching over to a cup. He loves Thomas so I looked everywhere for a Thomas cup for him. I finally found this one and he was so excited he couldn't wait for it to arrive.  So when it finally did come, it came with both the cup and lid unwrapped,  just tumbling around in the shipping box. I took it out and tried to put the dusty lid on the dusty cup and surprise surprise. ..The two pieces don't fit together at all. Even the picture on the cup is a little unclear and faded looking. For a $6 cup u would think u would at least be able to use it. .... so disappointed and not worth 1 penny
