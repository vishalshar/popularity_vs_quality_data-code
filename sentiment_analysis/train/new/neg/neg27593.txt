Does it work? It's the sole reason why you're reading this, so let me say emphatically, definitively that it just might. Possibly.Bleary-eyed and desperate I came across this necklace during a 2 a.m. 'research project.' Why not try it? I said to myself, wailing 4 month old son teetering on my sodden shoulder. A day or two later the necklace arrives and we place it expectantly around his neck and stand back near-silently, reverent to the legendary and ancient powers of amber. My son's reaction? His 'don't just stand there, pick me up' face. That is to say his normal expression.Several months into this and I'm going to say it's worth it, as to opinions whether or not it helps our boy alleviate the agony of incoming teeth depends on the previous night's sleep (all of us).The Looking Hip & Cool factor is real, that's for sure. And that goes a long way here in Portlandia, Oregon.
