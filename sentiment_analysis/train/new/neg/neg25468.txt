• I was really disappointed that it does not light up. There is no way baby can see the fish bowl. Not satisfied with that feature at all.• The strap to attach around the crib does not fit. I had to buy more and make my own. Good thing I know how to sew and have the equipment to do that. Very poor planning on your behalf. All new cribs have the same framing. Cribs are just bigger nowadays.
