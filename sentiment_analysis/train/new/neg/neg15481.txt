Good high Chair. Stable with adjustable height positions. The only problem with this high chair is that shoulder straps keep getting loose when my son wiggles. So when he was 6 months old and still not able to sit completely straight by himself I had to use the food tray so that he doesn't fall to the front. Now that he can sit straight by himself, I don't worry too much, but I would have liked it if the straps remained tight once I pull them (like a car seet shoulder strap).
