The photo and description both depict an organizer with magnetic closure for the main compartment.  However, the console I received was zipper closure.  Not a huge deal but I liked the quiet and easy access that a magnet provides if my LO is napping while I'm pushing her in her stroller, unlike what a zipper would provide.  I returned it.
