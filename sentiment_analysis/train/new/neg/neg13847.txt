I was given the Kiinde storage system as a gift, and I really, really, really wanted to fall in love with it. I may come back and edit this review over time, but for my 7 month old, using this system to store food is harder. I have to put everything in the Vitamix, then transfer to the Kiinde tub that works to fill the pouches. As you squeeze, they mostly just fill with air and you lose some of the physics behind getting the food to go into the tube, aka, you make a mess. By the time, they are finally loaded, you feel like you've wasted so much of the food due to the residual in the blender and the residual in the Kiinde transfer tub. It's enough for 2 or 3 meals!When it gets to be mealtime, I do love that I can easily use the spoon attachment to feed, disconnect, and put the cap back on. That is really nice. The pouches are very convenient for storage and use, but getting the food in is such a pain. The funnel option is certainly the route I may be going. I have seen that product online, and I'm wondering if it makes loading easier compared with the current method I'm using. I may try it out and update the review, as my issue is more with the system than the pouches themselves.For now, I'm underwhelmed.
