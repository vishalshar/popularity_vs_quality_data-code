This is the second of this model we've had in 4 years, and while we generally love it, they have both had the same flaw: the jack for the parent unit's charger eventually stops charging. This comes from normal everyday wear and tear. The only way to keep the parent unit charged at this point is to bend and twist the cord in such awkward angles in order for the charge to connect it's comical. In our previous unit we had to wrap the cord around the unit and tape it into place - just to make sure it charged. For our current unit, we have to make sure it stands upright in order to connect - which is not the end of the world, but is annoying.Also, unless you turn off and on the other unit (in your child's room) every day, the volume on the parent unit becomes deafening. Such an odd flaw.
