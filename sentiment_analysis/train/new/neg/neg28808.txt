This arrived and did not fit a normal iPhone. We then requested to return it, and the item does not break down once it is assembled. We tried everything and then also reached out to contact the manufacturer, and not one person bothered to return our emails. We threw this in the trash, what a waste of our time and money. Very disappointed.
