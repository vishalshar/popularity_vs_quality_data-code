While they are flexible etc they do still come apart in the hands of a kid. We had these about 15 minutes and our 2yo simply twisted and the arm came off. It looks like the screw for the arm was too short so when she twisted the flex in the frame part of the hinge allowed the screw to come free from the arm part of the hinge and it came right out. I wasn't able to fix them by reattaching the arm and screwing the screw back in. The screw wouldn't grab the hinge at the far and any longer since there was barely a little bit of screw extending far enough to the other side of the hinge. I think their design could improve with a change the method used for fastening the hinge. Rather than send them back to Amazon like I probably should have I decided to try the guarantee they offer for lost or broken frames. They charge 6 bucks for shipping. I went this route because I want to give them a chance and I also bought 2 pair. If I'm not happy I'll send the other pair back.The other thing I don't like is the logo on the side. We're just not logo people. It would be nice if it were a sticker (so it could be removed) or we could buy less logo dominate designs. Yes, I bought them knowing it was there. I just wish for more designs. Its massive on a small face.3 stars because they didn't live up to the quality promise and I've spent an hour dealing with the issue.
