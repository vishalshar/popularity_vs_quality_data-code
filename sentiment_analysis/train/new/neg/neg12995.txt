This is a nice feeling set as far as the quality of the material.  The images are sewn into the material, embrodired looking.  So IF you had to wash it I would do it with care for that reason.  It doesn't really look that way from the pictures.  All of the 13 PCS came in good condition on the day it was supposed to, but I think it is the color of the wall in the picture that makes it so you DON"T realize how much yellow is in this set.  It doesn't seem like it online, but up close and in my hands it's allot of yellow!  If it were not for the "firetruck" theme this could easily pass as a gender neutral crib set, and that's not was I was going for.  I was going, personally for something that said more "boy" in my son's nursery.  It is a good feeling set, not cheap feeling, yet I'm returning it simply because I can't do that much yellow and the blue in the design is very light.  So if you don't mind yellow it's a good set for the price, but I do mind the color.  I thought I would share this because why should someone else have to wait to get this home to see the picture really didn't do it justice color wise.  The rest of it was quite cute just not for me.
