This pillow kind of does the job, but I really wish I had bought something else. I'm making it work for the last trimester because I don't want to spend money on another pregnancy body pillow. When I say it kind of works, I mean it does help me stay in a good side-lying position all night. I think. Mostly it gets in the way of me moving into another position, which can be annoying for getting out of bed with a big belly. The two major problems I have are with the quality of the stuffing and the fabric of the cover. I noticed the fabric as soon as it arrived, as it is not at all soft and it feels scratchy against my skin. If you usually buy 100% cotton, soft sheets, then you will not like the feel of the fabric against your skin. I dealt with this by putting a regular pillow case around that part of the pillow that was near my face.The other, more pressing problem is that the stuffing has migrated within the pillow. The part that I need it most for -- to support my knees so that they aren't as close together -- is basically empty now, with stuffing on either side of it. I've tried manipulating the stuffing to move back into that spot, but I can't get it to shift. I've tried sleeping with my legs in a slightly different position, but inevitably I wake up with my legs around the spot that has no stuffing. While I stay asleep, this means that my spine is not getting the support it was supposed to get from the Preggle.
