Pros:Made in USABPA-free, pvc-free, phthalate-freeCons:Not microwave safeThey are solid plastic bowls.  I bought them for my baby as he likes throwing his bowls onto the floor.  These work fine for baby/kids bowls, but I am not sure I would have bought them if I knew they weren't microwave safe though.  Not a big deal for baby food as you aren't supposed to microwave baby food/milk anyways, but it would have been convenient to have all our bowls be microwave safe.
