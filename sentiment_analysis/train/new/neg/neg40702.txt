At first, I was delighted with this kit.  But then reality set it.1) The feeding dish warped in the dishwasher and no longer closes (it was on the top shelf of the dishwasher).  It is now worthless.  This did not happen to the freezer trays.  DO NOT PUT THE FEEDING DISH IN THE DISHWASHER!2) I frequently had problems opening the electronic mill after processing food (the lid would get jammed, and I would have to rely on my husband's strength to force open).  Also, the second time I washed it in the dishwasher, I noticed a hairline crack in the plastic.  It does not affect its performance, but I worry that it is going to completely break anyday.3) The food mill is very difficult, if not impossible, to take apart to clean.The electronic and manual food mill are both very effective, so no complaints on the performance front, but I wish I had invested in a regular food processor and plain ice cube trays instead of purchasing this kit.
