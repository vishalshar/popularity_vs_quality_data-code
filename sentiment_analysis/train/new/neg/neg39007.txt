I bought this for my 3 month old in hopes that if would help the swaddle weaning process. Unfortunately he didn't take to it well. With both arms inside, there's enough space for him to pull his arms up to his chest. Aka just enough movement to get his hopes up and then tick him off once he realizes he can't break free. So, like some other reviews mentioned, if your kid needs their arms strapped to their sides, this is not the product for you.Also I was surprised at how high up and snug the neckline was. At three months my son was probably roughly 10.5-11 pounds (he's a little guy) and it seemed to rub on his neck and irritate his skin.
