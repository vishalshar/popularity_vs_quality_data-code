You can believe what you want. I need a scientific study. I'm a nerd.  I put this on my child (a boy, at that. people thought he was a girl b/c i had him wearing this necklace). You can't put it on them at night-the time you need it the most. And honestly, give your child some tylenol for pain and call it a day. Holistic properties were not evident to me. But to each his own...try it out and see if you disagree  with me (but i need proof !)  good luck.
