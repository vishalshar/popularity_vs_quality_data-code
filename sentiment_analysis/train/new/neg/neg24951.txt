I used it for the first time today and it did not hold up against the wind. The velcro stickers that came with it came right off. They should be stitched on, or better yet, have velcro straps that are more secure.  It did keep the water out when it wasn't flying up, making my baby cold.  The sun shade part is good and water resistant too but since it is a flap that snaps on, it doesn't stay closed at the seams all the time and wind gets in through there.  Basically, it is not good for windy days unless you alter it yourself by adding your own straps.  I'd rather use it in the warmer months when it is not so windy for the rain and sun shade as well as the neat flying insect net that is under the sun shade.  I'll see how it holds up then.
