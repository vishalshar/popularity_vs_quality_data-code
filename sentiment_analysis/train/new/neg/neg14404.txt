This chair is a fabulous idea.  We've been using it for almost a year probably.  My son is now 15 months old.  I love that he can sit with us at the table and I love that it has a tray.  However, it makes me so angry that it is so difficult to clean.  We use it three times a day so you can imagine how much food gets dropped and wiped on it as my son loves to feed himself.  But it has two huge problems that make it impossible to wash regularly and keep clean.  First is the fabric seat itself.  Once you figure out how to remove it, it's fairly easy - not super easy, but fairly easy.  I wash it on a gentle cycle and let it air dry and it comes out very clean.  The impossible part is putting the fabric back on the chair.  It has the most ridiculous system with these three metal hooks sewed on with fabric tabs.  The tabs are super short and made of unstretchable material that make it almost impossible to thread them through the tiny space allotted and secure the seat.  There is no way the genius who came up with this design ever used this in a home.  Because it is so difficult to secure, you tend to wash it much less than it should be washed.  Right now, I can't even get the seat back on.  I'm not sure if the super short tabs shrunk in the wash or what.  It's super frustrating.  My other complaint about cleaning is all the crevices that are impossible to get clean.  I've used ear swabs, knives, toothpicks and wet wipes but it's impossible to get into the crevices to clean.  It's disgusting.  I will post photos of the gunk in the crevices and the ridiculous strap system.  Do not buy this item if you want your child to eat in a clean environment as there is no way to keep it clean.
