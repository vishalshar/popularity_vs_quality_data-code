These breast pads are so bad, I am already repressing the memory. I bought these because the reviews were mostly positive, and the price was very reasonable. I like that they are individually wrapped, but that is just about where it ends for me. I leak a lot, and while these pads seem to hold a decent amount of liquid, they were rendered useless because they ALWAYS moved around. I had to constantly readjust them because the so called "glue" used on the back was basically non adhesive. They moved around so much and the collected milk was so badly distributed around the pad, that I had to routinely turn them because the over saturation of one corner would cause me to leak. This caused the pads to quickly become lumpy and frumpy, leading to weird bumps that showed through clothing, then eventually breaking . Even though these situations were completely terrible, they do not compare to my main reason for absolutely hating these pads... They SMELL. And mean STINK, literally. I'd have to change out barely used every 2-5 hours because of that nauseating odor. These pads offer absolutely no breath ability and will make your ladies stinky, and sweaty. I cannot discourage anyone enough from buying these.
