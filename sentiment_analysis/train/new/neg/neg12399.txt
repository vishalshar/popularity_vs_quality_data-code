We bought the Fascination Station for our six-month-old for Christmas.  First and most importantly, her fingers got stuck in the toy!!!  It took us a few minutes to get them out while she screamed!  After this, I threw it in the trash.  Second, it does not stay suctioned to her plastic high chair top.  Overall, we were NOT impressed with this purchase.
