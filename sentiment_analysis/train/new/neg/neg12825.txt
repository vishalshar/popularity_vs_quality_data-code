We bought this when my baby was starting solids at 6 months. I was so excited when it arrived. While it did help during the first month that was pretty much it.The "scissor" thing broke a few days after it arrived, we didn't even started using it yet! The grinder doesn't grind much things unless they are very mushy things like very ripe avocado. Don't even think about making your own applesauce with it... I steamed the apple for 2 hours (!) and it still couldn't be grinded. The functional parts (ie. parts that touches the food) is made of plastic, and after less than 1-2 month of using, the plastic parts are peeling off, and it can get into the food. The spoon is also pretty filmsy... after 1-2 months of use it is covered with bite marks made by my baby.The 2 feeders are pretty nice... but we only get to use it a handful of times, then my baby already outgrew it pretty quickly.Overall, the set is of pretty bad quality, and you can probably only use it between 6-9 months (because beyond 9 months, you'd start offering more "solid" food on trays for your baby to pick up and eat anyway rather than mashing and putting them into the feeder). That was just my experience.
