My husband picked this for our son, and we had a different fisher price one for our daughter.  There was a reviewer talking about their kid getting stuck in the net...you have the net attached backwards.  It will "lean out" if you put it on correctly.  The pieces are entertaining, but I feel like it's actually not a lot for a kid between 5-8 months (when you'd use it the most) to really play with.  My son doesn't love it. Also, I feel like, for the one we had for my daughter, it bounced, and this one doesn't.  I'd say, go with one that bounces and maybe actually has less to look at and more to actually play with.
