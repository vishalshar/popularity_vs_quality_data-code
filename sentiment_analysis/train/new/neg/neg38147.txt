Toddler bedding... so it would be useful to have a TODDLER sized pillowcase.  It comes with a standard size.  So useless for us.  The fabric for the bedspread and pillowcase is so soft.  We love it.  However, the sheet set is scratchy and while it might soften over time, I don't understand why it is of different quality than the rest of the set.  The pattern is adorable and put a smile on my child's face instantly.  Considerably more bold than the picture.  I thought the green would be an apple shade to match her existing bed room but it is neon green.Not bad for the price, but basically, all we will be using is the bedspread.
