The top doorstop is an important piece of the gate since it prevents the door from swinging all the way through to the other side.  For instance, if this piece is broken, the gate door can swing all the way through, and if your kid is at the top of the stairs, your kid can rattle the door and accidentally fall down the stairs (*shudder*).  Called the company.  Talked to a first line CS agent, completely professionally cold, not seeming to really care (you would think they would have a somewhat nicer attitude concerning infants/toddlers safety), but very willing to try and charge me $10 for a little plastic piece that is integral to the safety of their product.  Told her I'd like to talk to a supervisor - but you know what - not available.  Just so other parents are aware of this company's "customer care" support of their product.UPDATE 5/20/13:  I took the initiative and called their CS back myself and got a completely different kind of response (positive).  A new part is being sent to me courtesy of Summer.As for the other details of the gate:1.  Make sure that the protective back rubber pad is in place to provide friction and to protect the surface of your paint/banister.2.  We used ours both on painted surface and wood banister, the pressure mount system actually works pretty well.3.  Despite lots of use and pushing by the kids, the glossy wood finish on the banister is decently intact.
