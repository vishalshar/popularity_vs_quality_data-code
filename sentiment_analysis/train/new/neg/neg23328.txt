We have the full sized Fisher Price My Little Lamb Cradle Swing and Baby B loves it.  It is the only way to guarantee uninterupted sleep! Fisher Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lamb If you have the space and aren't looking for a travel swing, the Cradle Swing is definitely the way to go.  It also has a mirrored dome that Baby B finds quite entertaining, it swings both side to side and head to toe, and adjusts from a reclining position to a seated position.  Per the instructions, it will last through 25 lbs.But on to the FP Travel Swing.  We also needed a travel swing to take to Grandma's house and on trips, so thought another Fisher Price product would be the way to go given our experience with the first one.  Like other reviewers, we're not so pleased.  The Travel Swing worked okay when Baby B weighed about 15 lbs, but it has to be level with it's legs exactly squared off.  Baby B is a healthy hearty boy.  He weighed 17 lbs 1 oz at his 4 month check up and already the Travel Swing would not swing.  And I have to agree with another reviewer on the Fisher Price musical selection... It's not at all pleasant or calming and is entirely to techo-modern. Again, the Cradle Swing wins out with a much more appealing selection of nature-related melodies.  If you really need a travel swing, a friend highly recommends her Boppy travel swing that has seen her through 2 babies.  Alas, when Baby B needed the travel swing, I could only find Bobby brand swings in pink - not Baby B's color.  One pro of the FP Travel Swing is that it swings until you turn it off, unlike some of the other brands that only swing for 45 minutes.
