I was soooo excited to get this in the mail!! I JUST opened it about 5minutes ago and it's already been packaged back up to return!!! I've never written a review on anything before, but this product disappointed me so bad I had to let others know NOT TO WASTE UR MONEY!!!!!! The "mattress" is literally as hard as concrete!!!! Your baby would be just as comfortable laying on a hardwood floor or a coffee table, it is that hard!!! Second, the cover is very overwhelming for the baby... The star is right in their face!! It made me feel uncomfortable and I wasn't the one laying in it!!! And third, it's VERY small!!!! My baby is still a newborn (not even 8pounds) and she looks like she is too big for it!!! I had to double check I didn't but a baby doll bassinet by accident!!! The ONLY good thing I have to say about this is that it's cute.. THATS IT!!!! DO NOT BUY, unless ur buying it for a babydoll!!!!!!!
