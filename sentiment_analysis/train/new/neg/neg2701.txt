I ordered this chair 3 times and each time it arrived damaged.  The plastic bag that the chair comes in keeps melting onto the chair.  The great suggestion by the manufactuer was to remove it with rubbing alcohol.  No, for this price I want an undamaged product.  Also, when I opened each of the bags, there was an overwhelming chemical smell coming from the chair.  I am leary of putting my child into anything with such a strong chemical smell.  I sent them all back and ordered the Prince Lionheart chair.  Smell and damage free upon arrival.
