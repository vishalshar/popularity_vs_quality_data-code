I can't really evaluate the mattress accurately as I have ordered twice and on both occasions received the L A Baby Organic Cotton 2 in One Orthopedic Crib Mattress model number 5260-ORGJL A Baby Organic Cotton 2 in One Orthopedic Crib Mattress, White - the lower quality product in the range.  On the pro side - I have not encountered the smell issue with either.Reading the reviews AFTER I placed my order I notice that I am not the first to encounter a mix up of these mattresses - though Amazon customer service addressed this as a 'once-only' issue.  Apart from the model number there are two other key differences that distinguish the lower price/quality product - color and lack of waterproof pad.  Hmm that seems to cover a lot of the comments on other reviews!?! I'd like to know if everyone checked the model number.Overall very disappointing as the additional $100 cost relates to the stuffing (coconut) which is not obvious unless you destroy the mattress!  And while Amazon describe this mattress as '2 in One', baby and toddler, LA Baby do not indicate that this, Model Number: MT 4900 COCO BN WPC, is  '2 in One'.  I won't be attempting to place a 3rd order in the hope of finally receiving the desired product!
