this cup is excellent especially because it has the unit of measurements on the side, ml and oz. What I didn't like was the nipple, my daughter is 12 months and bites the nipple, which is causing me to have to replace the nipple since shes bitting off the silicone pieces, the replacements are not cheap. I fear she will choke on them if I dont watch her. Other than that they are easy to wash but I think I might try another brand.
