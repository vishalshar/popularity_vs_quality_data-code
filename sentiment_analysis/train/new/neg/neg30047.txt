The image shown of this makes it look like a dense yoga block foam, but it's really more like the stuff you cover pipes with. If you have leather seats it slips a bit which isn't so great. However, it does push the carseat up and away from front seats a bit which helps a little. I have a 2003 Honda CRV and the carseat still interferes with the front passenger seat a bit to where it really can't recline much. (I have carseat in center backseat position, rear-facing.) Bottom line, without this foam block my front passenger seat would be so upright it would be uncomfortable for the passenger.
