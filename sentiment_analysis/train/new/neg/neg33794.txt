I purchased these added having great luck with other similar Playtex sippy cups. Cups were super cute and my boys loved them. Problem? The valves leak horribly! We never had that issue with our original Playtex sippy cups. I contacted Playtex and they did send coupons so that I could purchase replacement cups. Sadly, no local stores carry these cute Cars cups.
