Well the crib looks nice but I have a coupe of issues with it. First issue when I received it it was broken. Nothing major but there is a piece of decorative wood on the bottom that had fell off we were able to just put it right back on. But the nails had scratched the stain all up. Second an probably more importantly I wish I would have know how the mattress moves up and down. With my last crib you could just pop the piece out andover it up and down. Fairly easy. With this one you have to unscrew all the bolts then move it and screw it back in. Just takes a lot more time.
