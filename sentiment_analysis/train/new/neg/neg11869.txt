I was looking for a gender neutral bag that my husband and I could both carry (something plain colored that didn't scream BABY GIRL).  After it arrived I decided it's too manly.  My husband even said it looks like a tool bag.  I think it looks appropriate for a tactical mission of some sort.  The looks aside, its very well made and sturdy.  It is also quite heavy - when empty!  Perhaps if a dad were going to be the only one carrying it, it would be fine, but it's just too utilitarian for me.  Back it goes!
