We bought this two-piece combo for Christmas.  The turtle worked fine, but the ladybug stopped working almost immediately.  I tried new batteries, but the nightlight worked only for about a day.  I tried to return the ladybug to Amazon, but was directed to the manufacturer/distributer; BabyHaven.  They will not take the item back since it has been more than 30 days since being purchased, which we bought before Christmas.  So much for buying Christmas gifts early.  Very disappointed that the seller would not just replace the item, which is all we wanted.  I would not purchase this item again.
