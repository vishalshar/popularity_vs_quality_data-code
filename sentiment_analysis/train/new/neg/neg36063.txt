Okay, so I previously bought several of these cups and loved them, so I bought another...and now I'm not so thrilled.  The good news is that thy are round and wobbly- which make children very interested in them!  The bad news is that they are ROUND which means that I can't get my permanent labels to stick well (the sticker part has lumps/creases around the edge).  Also, and perhaps most annoying, is that these must be turned perfectly upside down to fully dry (read: still have liquid in them in the dishwasher...ewww...).  Now because the bottom is weighted, this means that they must be completely turned over so the mouth is fully on the bottom...better have an elevated surface to dry them.  If they are slightly at an angle, they will flip, and even ifyou keep them balanced, they take longer than any other components I have (bottles, etc.) to dry.  Kind of annoying.  Also, my son bites on the sippy part, which I've noticed lets little particles of food get inside.  Icky.We've moved on to rim-less (or gravity) cups (Munchkin brand has worked well for us).  I was surprised at how easy they are for a baby to navigate.  We'll stick with those, as they are next-step to real cups anyway.
