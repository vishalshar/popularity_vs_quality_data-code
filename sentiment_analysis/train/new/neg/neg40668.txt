I watch my niece a few times a week and wanted to purchase a stroller of my own for convenience.  I typically just take her for a stroll around the neighborhood, so I thought that this would suffice. It is extremely cheap and frustrating! The wheels turn in wonky ways and wobble. I recently used it for a short trip into a mall and ended up allowing my niece to walk with me as I drug this behind. Even maneuvering this stroller through the aislesâ€‹ of a store in the mall was difficult with the cheaply made wheels. I would not recommend.
