It's okay.  The amber on this wasn't very good.  The pieces weren't very round and we had multiple spots were there wasn't a knot between each bead.  We had two in a row before a new knot.  It isn't worth the money for a sup par necklace.  I'd stick with a bigger company like Inspired by Finn.  Theirs was of a much better quality.
