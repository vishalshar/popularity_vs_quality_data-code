It is attractive, as far as a potty can be. It hold a lot of weight and is nice and sturdy, I also like that it doubles as a stool for hand washing, teeth brushing...etc. I like the little compartments on the side although the kids have never noticed them. The problem is really with the orange shield when it comes to use for boys. It just not positioned correctly to help with boys. Perhaps if it was just a large version of itself, it would work better. I would imagine this would be fantastic for girls, but unfortunately for boys... I'd pass and opt for something else.
