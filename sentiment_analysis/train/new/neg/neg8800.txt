While this chair is aesthetically pleasing and doesn't take up a whole lot of room, it definitely has some flaws. We have used this chair for 3 kids now, so we have had plenty of time with it to review it.1) it is really hard to clean. Metal screw heads are exposed everywhere and food loves to get stick in the holes of the screw heads. Once it dries, you pretty much have to remove the screws and soak them. Food also gets into crevices in the wood and well, all in all, it's a nightmare to keep clean.2) the tray will slant down if the seat position is not all the way to the top. But then why. Make the seat height adjustable?  Doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So if you don't want drink cups sliding off the tray, make sure the seat is as high as possible. Oh, and if baby is too heave, the seat will slowly be pushed down from its weight and you'll keep having to take an Allan key to it to adjust it back to top height...unless of course you don't mind food slipping off tray.3) my son caught his sleeve on a small nick in the wood of the tray and as he pulled his arm up, he pulled a huge wood sliver up at the same time that almost went into his arm as he put his arm back down. This sliver was literally 5 inches long. And sharp! I immediately contacted Svan who sent out a new tray, but really, that shouldn't happen. Safety hazard.I would not purchase this chair again because of its major downfalls.
