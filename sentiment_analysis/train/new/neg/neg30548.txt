I honestly wish it were also sold in pieces. I purchased this for my baby boy. It was quite the trial picking one out. Every time I chose a set for a boy it would be discontinued. I actually had this problem a lot for everything just about that I picked out for a boy. The sheet is as soft as some of the others that I have purchased, also it doesn't fit my mattress very well. It is a bit too tight, and it can't be my mattress, because the others fit perfectly. The bumper doesn't fit perfectly, I would have liked it if there more than just the end ties on the side panels. Also, I have never used the diaper holder, not even as decoration. I did purchase several of the accompanying pieces, such as the lamp, border, decals and mobile. I do not recommend the mobile. I ended up ordering another that was battery operated and plays for twenty minutes. The reason I give it 3 stars is I don't use all of the bag set and would have preferred to purchase the items I wanted/ needed separately. Value wise it wasn't the best for me, but the quality, with exception to the sheet, is 5 stars.
