I bought this carrier when my daughter was born, and she was swimming in it for the first 6 months. For reference I bought a size SMALL, I am 5'2" and 132lbs - my daughter was born 6lbs 11oz. I followed the sizing suggestion on the K'tan website, and they suggested a SMALL. After struggling with it being too large, I went back to the site and tried again - I found that if I put in 130lbs that it suggests a size XS, which would have likely fit better.I used the cradle/kangaroo positioning for a few times when she was between 1-4 months while doing household chores, but always had to keep one hand on her when bending over to make sure she didn't fall out of the top opening (see picture wher she looks like ET). So, I didn't really use it much since I didn't feel that she was very secure.Now that she's 7 months and bigger (16lbs), I feel much more comfortable carrying her in this seated/hug position. It's still not tight enough for her to feel completely secure if I bend over to pick something off the ground (I still hold her back/head with one hand). But now that she's teething, this seems to sooth her by being close to me while I walk around the house.Bottom line - I would recommend you size down if you are deciding between two different sizes, and make sure to play around with the K'tan sizing suggestions before ordering!
