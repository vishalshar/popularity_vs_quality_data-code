Cute set for a boys nursery. My only complaint is that the mobile that is included doesn't fit a larger framed crib and the "music" from the mobile isn't soothing at all, I ended up not being able to use the mobile.Overall the set is cute and a good deal, but the included mobile is pretty much worthless.
