I have this mat and the Tiny Love that's the same size. They both are very cute and have similar features, but unfortunately this one doesn't stay in place as well as the other one does. The Tiny Love mat has blocks stitched into it that seem to keep it flat, this one doesn't so when my 7 mo old crawls on it the mat comes with him. This mat is fine for an infant who isn't moving very much, but if you have a crawler I'd go with the Tiny Love.
