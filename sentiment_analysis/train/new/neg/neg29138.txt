It is a pretty mobile at a good price.  It works well  and is easy to put together.  The colors were not what I was expecting. The green is much lighter than it appeared online and the butterflies and flowers are primarily light pink, not a darker purple. The butterflies and flowers face down, not to the side as displayed online.
