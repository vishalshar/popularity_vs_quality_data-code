Disappointed, I bought these for my sons diaper pale. I have used other Arm and Hammer products before and they always worked well. These were packaged poorly, once you open the package they are all exposed and there is no way to save the scent. Also there is no adhesive to make them stick to the pail so it does not work in the pail. I tried packing tape to make it stay but it just kept falling into the pail, what a waste!
