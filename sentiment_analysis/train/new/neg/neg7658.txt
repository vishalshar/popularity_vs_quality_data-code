Good size for a young toddler ie 2-yo for daycare. Love the easy access pocket in the front. Seems pretty sturdy, however has stiff shoulder straps thus unless you have weighted things in the bag, the bag will not lie down properly on your child's back. It's all hiked up even with straps lengthened.
