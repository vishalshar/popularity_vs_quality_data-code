I bought this crib in December 2010.  i was very excited because i got it at a good price.  The shipment came on time and i couldn't wait to get it set up.  it took me and my husband hours to get it together because the pieces were not marked, it's a good thing that my husband has experience doing these things or it would have taken us half a day. But little did i know this was just the start.  My baby is just 5 weeks old and the crib is already falling apart.  The top drawer is broken, and the changing table is falling apart and so is the entire right side of the crib.  I would not recommend this to my enemy, just spend the extra dollars on something better.
