This is a great idea if you have a baby plus a toddler who refuses to get in a stroller, but occasionally gets too tired to walk.  The Buggy Board is very sturdy, easy to install, and easy to remove.  My only complaint is that the spacing between the wheels is not very wide.  Unless I take little mincing steps, I end up kicking the wheels with every step.  Also, measure the height of your little one.  Mine is right at the height of the stroller handle.  He has to lean back to keep from hitting the handle and then you have to walk completely straightarmed.
