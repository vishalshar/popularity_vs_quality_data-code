Wish I could have got free shipping to Hawaii but still cheaper than ordering direct.  I have had for a few months now.  The wheels are starting to do funky things as most umbrella strollers do but its easy to fix.  My husband wishes it was a little taller.  He is 6'3" so he has to slouch a little.  Overall its an okay twin umbrella stroller, lightweight and portable.  Not gonna find much better if you want portability.
