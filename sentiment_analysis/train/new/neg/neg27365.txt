Disappointment number 1:  We received our Zigo and it was damaged.  We contacted customer service who blamed UPS, but the packaging really wasn't up to par either.  After communication back and forth and ensuring the company had everything they needed to replace the damaged part, we waited a week and had to contact them for a follow up instead of the other way around.Disappointment number 2:  The jogger attachment is TERRIBLE!  It is so hard to jog with this stroller.  The wheel is fixed (which I understand is pretty typical for jogging strollers and recommended for them), but it is so far in front of the stroller that it makes it difficult to turn at any degree.  I am an avid runner and I refuse to jog with this.  It also pulls to one side, which I understand can be fixed, but I won't even bother because it's worthless as a jogger.Disappointment number 3:  The attachment for the bike seems very sturdy.  No worries there, so it's great as a bike trailer and the stroller wheels are handy for trips in to town.  But it makes for a very EXPENSIVE bike trailer.Disappointment number 4:  It does not fit two children very well.  We have a 29 lb child and a 23 lb child (not big by any scale) and I don't anticipate this trailer to last too long before it gets too cramped.Unfortunately, I think you're better off looking on Craigslist for a high quality jogger and a high quality bike trailer for the same combined price of the Zigo.
