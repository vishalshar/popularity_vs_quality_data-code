A previous reviewer asks, "what's not to love?"Well, while I've selected the Snappi over pins, I've torn my finger open on the Snappi; it's hard to get it attached fast on a squirming toodler; it doesn't always work on flannel diapers (weave is too tight for the large, sharp, plastic teeth to grip); acidic poo will stain lighter-colored Snappis; shipping is expensive; they're hard to find anywhere except on-line.There you go!But, I will say that I worry more about accidentally stabbing my squirmy baby with a diaper pin, and I can always just leave off the Snappi if the kid decides to move around too much (I use my mama powers of lightning-speed to quickly wrap and velcro a diaper cover).
