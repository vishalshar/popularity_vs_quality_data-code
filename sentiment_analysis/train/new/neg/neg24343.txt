In the end it serves its purpose, but not worse the full 5 stars. The included mounting hardware is a joke (as reported elsewhere), 1 set of screws is so long they will come out on the other side of the screen door and the second set is so short, it doesn't even stick out of the holes of the screen protector. Also, there are only 2 mounting holes in each corner and not 4 as shown in the picture, which may cause an issue for some applications (not for mine). The screws was an easy fix and wouldn't bother me much. However, the screen protector is not flat. It is curved and presses against the screen. In order to protect the screen properly it needs to have more space in between.
