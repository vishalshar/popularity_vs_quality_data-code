Great for use. I wish the material was removable. Have to cover it with a sheet to reduce the amount of stains. Also wish there were more than 2 settings on the tray. My daughter is tall/bigger and the second setting is almost too small. Used for while and works just fine. Folding it up is a little tricky though.
