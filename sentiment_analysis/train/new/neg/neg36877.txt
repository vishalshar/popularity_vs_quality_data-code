First let me say that if this hamper worked perfectly, we would love it and give it 5 stars. But the sharp wiring that helps the frog hold its shape started to come out at the mouth opening. We were worried that our 2 year old would get injured. I fixed it by wrapping electrical tape over and around the sharp edge, feeding it back in, and then sewing the hole closed and reinforcing it. I'm crafty, so this took me about 10 minutes, and seemed less of a hassle than returning it. And my kid LOVES feeding the froggy his dirty clothes, so we kept it. But buyers should be aware of this potential hazard.
