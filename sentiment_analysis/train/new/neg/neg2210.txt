The bag itself is great. A little deeper red than in the picture, more like crimson. The size is great.... it looks like the same size as every diaper bag I have seen thus far in my life. I really didn't expect something this big because of all the reviews complaining that it's so small. I think these people are looking for suitcases, not diaper bags. This thing is big!  I think the fabric is nice; it feels like the inner shell of some performance winter coats.  I wouldn't want a shirt or pants made out of it but it's great for the bag. It feels like other water resistant materials. I thought the bottom would be black but it's actually a very dark chocolate brown. I still agree with other users that it would have looked better if they had just used one color for the straps and the bottom, but it doesn't really bother me this way either. It's patent leather sort of material. Not my favorite but it will keep the bag dry on a wet surface. The insulated bottle bag seems really nice and will probably work great with a little ice pack. The stroller straps are a plus too!BUT it did not come with the wipes case or wet bag. The diaper changing mat that did arrive with this bag is different than the one pictured. It rolls up rather than lies flat which takes up a lot more space. It is also small and looks like it will not be very useful. Not one of these three things were major selling points for me, but they were handy extras that I wouldn't have to go buy or register for. I think if something is marketed/advertised as coming with certain extras AND THOSE EXTRAS ARE IN THE PICTURES then buyers should receive those items as well.The bottom line was the bag and I LOVE it but you can earn more stars back by doing a better job of quality control to make sure everything that should be shipped is shipped.
