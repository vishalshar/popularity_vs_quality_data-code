I would've given this a five star for the softness, colors and size but after only a few washes one of the white squares tore down the middle of the seam and I had to hand-stitch it shut. Be aware that you'll have to either hand wash this item or wash it on a very delicate cycle in your washing machine because the white material doesn't like the washing machine on normal cycle.
