The Munchkin Wide Spaces Expanding Gate is one of the few gates that stretches out to 65 inches, making it tempting to get at this price.  Installation wasn't bad, but the directions are very vague.  I like the concept and it will do for a season while our baby needs to be corralled until she can be trained to stay out of the dining room.But pressing in on the buttons to release it and move it to pass to the other room is a pain AND even if you press it in with no problems it doesn't always like to release.  Also, when trying to contract the gate to it's shortest length for when we don't need it expanded, it USUALLY doesn't contract like it should.I have been fighting with it since installation to get it to work right and the gate is winning so far.  I am frustrated with it and wish I would have spent another ten or twenty bucks to get a metal gate and an expansion piece to make it fit the opening we needed this for.Oh well, you live and you get burned.
