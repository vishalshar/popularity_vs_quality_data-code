I used to really love (love!) these nail clippers. Cutting a baby's nails is no easy task! The first pair of Safety 1st lighted nail clippers we owned lasted over 4 years!! The 2nd pair I bought lasted less than 2 months before the pin on the handle broke, rendering them useless. Thinking it was a fluke, I ordered another. That time a 2 pack. The pins on both of those subsequent ones broke as well. Each within 2-4 months. Obviously the build quality has changed. Either that or the 1st pair I had really deviated from the standard bell curve.  The convenience of lighted nail cutters that contain the clippings is terrific, but I'm afraid to buy another pair. They just don't make them the same. Luckily my kids were old enough that the pin wasn't a choking hazard, but for parents of infants/ toddlers who cut nails of sleeping ones in the dark, beware!
