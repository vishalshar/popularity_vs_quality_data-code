These were purchased to replace one that we had 5 years ago.  They are for our 5.5 month old girl who is beginning to eat pureed foods.  The original spoon had a very thin layer of soft rubber over the metal inner spoon.  These have a nice curved ergonomic handle but the rubber coating is very thick and has a not so smooth, almost sharp edges over the metal spoon.  Almost twice as thick as the original.  It's a little bit hard for my baby to handle the sort of "chunky" rubber covered spoon, thus 3 stars. They should be smoothed out and thinned out a bit and they would have 5 stars.
