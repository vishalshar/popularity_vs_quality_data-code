This is the first time i have ever written an online review, but i feel so strongly that this product SUCKS that I felt the need to warn the world. I wish I could give negative stars. I bought this, baby loved it and then within 6 weeks it stopped working. Stupid me thought it was just a "fluke" and bought another one and the SAME THING happened. It just stopped working. I cannot return it and now it is useless. What a rip off!!! I ended up downloading a free white noise app and it has been a life saver. Should have done this from the beginning. Save yourself the money unless you like collecting useless cheaply made junk.
