The activities on top of this saucer are good. I bought this when I was a newer mother and thought it looked fun and cute for my 1st girl. Nope. The concept of just their feet moving while their body stays still is not entertaining or anything. The regular saucers that they can move their whole body in I think also teaches them to support their own weight better. Sold this product at a garage sale and went back to the old basic saucer.
