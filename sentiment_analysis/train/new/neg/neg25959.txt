I purchased the Baby Snug because our daughter is not quite 4 months old and already trying to pull herself up out of her bouncer or attempting to roll over in it. She also has silent reflux so she enjoys sitting straight up instead of at a recline. I love that this seat has an extra wide base and is fairly heavier than the Bumbo brand. I also love that its made to accomodate a child longer than just a few months. The colored insert is easy to remove and clean. The color is fairly true to life as well. The major issues I have with this product is that the insert makes my little one sit with her bum further back than her top half so she leans forward. The well in the insert where the baby sits is slightly pear shaped so the top props the baby up under their armpits, but that makes an awkward space next to their legs and bum where their arms can get stuck. I also hate the tray. The tray itself comes in three pieces that snap together securely. However, the connection between the seat and tray is like that of a shape sorter toy. There is no clicking or wedging to keep it secure--it just plugs into the hole and can come out easily. They tray has a cone shaped impression for the crotch horn to nestle in, but that's all it does is nestle.  Again, there is no secure clicking or wedging--it's there simply to rest the tray on. You can bend the tray over this horn. What is more, there are sharp corners on the under side of the tray. This plastic is to give rigidity to the round contours of the tray, but it's still possible to scrape yourself on these. I think its safe to say we will be sending this back.
