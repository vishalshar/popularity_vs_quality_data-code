I bought this stroller in August for my newborn grandson; sight unseen and learned a very valuable lesson. Lesson: if possible find someone who owns the item or a brick and mortar store to actually eyeball the item if you don't want to regret your purchase. First of all as a grandmother who has not purchased a stroller in many years, I was surprised that the back did not let all the way down for a baby and/or toddler to actually fully recline and nap. Additionally, who ever thought to use "parachute" fabric; for the baby and/or toddler to slide down and not be able to really sit stable; that person should be made to put the same fabric on their car seats. Lastly, the steering is anything but effortless. I am now going to Babies R Us and purchase a stroller that can really be used and enjoyed by baby and mother.
