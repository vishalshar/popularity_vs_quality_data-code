[Good]The Lansinoh's nipple shape is the closest we've seen to mimicking the shape of a breast. Consequently, after using this bottle our child is better to latch on better for nursing.This bottle is very inexpensive for a specialty bottle.[Bad]Even after numerous washes and the initial five minute boiling water soak, the nipples still smell really toxic compared to other nipples.The bottle design is terrible. I feel that the designers purposely sacrificed functionality in favor of looks, specifically attempting to make the whole bottle more in the shape of a breast.  While this worked for the nipple itself, it's horrible for the bottle. It doesn't dry well and it's also really hard to feed the last two ounces since due to the bottle's shape, you have to make your baby lie down in order to finish everything. They had to have realized these problems during testing.Not truly slow flow: While it is rated as slow flow for the Lansinoh product line, in my opinion the nipple's flow rate is closer to medium when you compare it to nipples from other companies. It's no where near as bad as Medela's Calma nipples, but our newborn routinely chokes on milk while using these nipples. He doesn't choke on competing low flow nipples (which themselves have their own set of issues).[Verdict]While not absolutely terrible, I still can't recommend these bottles or nipples, but at least it's cheap.
