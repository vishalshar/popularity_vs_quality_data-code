I got these specifically to use on a long flight to Europe (so that we wouldn't have to wash bottles) - but my baby is having trouble transitioning to them. She is 10 months old and already is using fast nipples - but with the Playtex system, she can't seem to have a good seal around the nipple and the formula leaks. I'll try a few more times to see if she can get used to it. If not, I'll toss them (too bad because I have to get rid of the bottles, liners and the nipples). I hope it works eventually, though.
