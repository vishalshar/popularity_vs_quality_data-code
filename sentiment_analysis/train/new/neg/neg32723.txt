I purchased this looking for a swaddle solution after my 12-week-old grew out of the Miracle Blanket.  (We really loved that product, but it was just too short and she started kicking her feet out of it, and from there could undo the whole thing.)  I hoped this would be the swaddle product that we could use until we no longer needed to swaddle our daughter any longer.  Unfortunately, there seem to be a few design flaws with this.I had seen an older version of the Newborn size HALO swaddle, and it had velcro holding the wings on the back of the sleep sack.  There were also velcro tabs to hold the wings down in the front.  This has neither of those features, but instead, the wings are sewn onto the back of the bag and tacked down on the sides.  Even when I try to get the sleep sack to be as low as possible onto our daughter's shoulders, the wings end up being too high on her.  I have varied the angle of the wings to point down, but that hasn't helped.  Her hands end up poking out below both wings, and with that leverage, she can lift up the wings and free her arms (with the fabric bunching up around her shoulders.)  If not that, she wriggles her arms up under the wings and pokes them out of the top.  I wish I could adjust these wings down about an inch in the back, but that is not possible unless I rip out the stitching and resew it myself.  We have tried leaving one or both arms out to transition away from the swaddle, but she is not yet ready for that freedom.The one benefit of this is that the sleep sack itself is long enough to keep her legs from straining against it.  (She is 25" long.)  We've been using it for the past two weeks, but she seems to hate it more and more with each passing day.  I have a Zipadee Zip arriving Saturday and really hope she'll be happy in that and that we can transition her out of a swaddle!
