I use these for our church's nursery and young children's classrooms. I put them on Sunday mornings, and take them off Sunday afternoon. I've only put them on and taken them off three times and already one of the guards has broken. They're not incredibly sturdy, and they do have some give to them, so they're probably not the best door guards out there, but for the price, they're better than nothing. Actually, because they're brightly colored and cute, the kids want to see them, which means if they ever do manage to get their hands on them, they'll tear them apart.
