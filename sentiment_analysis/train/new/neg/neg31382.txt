Never had colic - big pro! Not sure if it was bc of the bottle but let's assume correlation equals causation in this case.  The big con for function is that this bottle leaks.  It just does.  With the white screw on bottle cap.  With the assembled bottle with nipple cover even with the white disk inserted (sorry, don't remember all the names of the little parts).  Let's not even talk about the number of parts to each bottle, which I happily overlook bc of the benefit for preventing colic.  But the leaking has been a disaster.  I basically stopped transporting any liquid in the bottle, which meant an extra container for water or breastmilk.  Avent bottles are more expensive but they don't leak.  Picked up two when my son was a bit older and out of colic danger zone.  We use these exclusively now.  I'll prob use the dr Browns for a new baby for the first months and then switch to avent.
