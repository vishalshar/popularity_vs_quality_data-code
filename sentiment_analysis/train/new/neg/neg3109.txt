I ordered this item thinking it's by Medela but apparently it is from a different vendor. Now, I am  not too sure about its authenticity. The package arrived in a damaged envelope. The package cover had a big hole right in the center which went through the plastic bag in which the tubing is placed. I am not at all happy with how this item was shipped and am not comfortable to use it. I was wary of cleaning my original tubes and so ordered a replacement which again concerns me with the safety aspect. I am returning this and ordering it directly from Medela website. I have not checked the free option as some customers have mentioned.
