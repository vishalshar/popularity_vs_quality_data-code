I was super excited about this toy as I was looking for items to place on the high chair tray for my baby while I'm preparing meals in the kitchen. The toy is super cute and the ladybug has a switch on it to turn on/off music that is activated by rotating the bug. The only reason I'm giving it the stars is because of the fact that it is not very secure while in the suction cup. At first I was excited about it being able to detach, thinking it could have multiple uses. But it takes no time for my baby to rip it right out of the holder, thus ruining the whole reason I bought it in the first place. I haven't even bothered using the suction cup after a few days, and now it is simply a handheld to we use when we're on the go.
