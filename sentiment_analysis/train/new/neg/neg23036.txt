Ordered this for my teething grandson for Christmas. It arrived with 2 wooden pieces broken(shattered) in bag. My guess is that instead of using a strong break resistant wood, money was saved by using a cheaper weaker wood. Removed all broken pieces, and because it arrived late , in a shipment of its own, had to wrap it and give it as is.  My grown children had teethers like this long ago and used them happily for years, with never a break, split or shatter. Not thrilled with this product. Would not recommend to anyone.
