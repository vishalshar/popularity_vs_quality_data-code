Ok, so this is our first double stroller and my experience with double strollers is very limited. I don't really like it. I have the baby trend single jogger with the big wheels and love it! However, this one is not what I was hoping for. We have only used it a very small amount because I just don't care for it. There's nothing terribly wrong with it, just not what I was hoping for. We have a 2.5 year old and a newborn. Put our older son in the front so the baby can be in the back where the seat reclines almost flat. (I like how it reclines). However with all of the weight of a 2.5 year old directly above the front wheels it is VERY difficult to steer. Also, the foot rest in front is very short and his feet hang over and drag on the wheels. I love to walk and generally walk 2 to 3 miles a day. The first time we used this stroller was about 3 weeks after our baby was born and we walked on asphalt. The wheels are already showing a significant sign of wear. As in, the tread is completely worn off! We only walked about about 20 minutes. Also, this sucker is HUGE!! Does not fit in my Chevy Impala trunk without a lot of maneuvering. It is also very heavy! NOT CONVENIENT! It is well made and works fine for the mall, but not for the serious outdoor walker. If I had to do it over I would definitely get the side by side jogger with better wheels.
