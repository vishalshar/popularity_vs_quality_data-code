I don't even know how many start to leave for this diaper so I'm going with 3 I guess. The diaper is very cute! but it's so small my 7 month old weighs 21lbs will not fit in the diaper the rise is way to small I don't know why it says that it's going to fit all the way to toddler age I've never seen a toddler weighing under 20lbs. I don't recommend the diaper to anyone with even an average size baby. so when I go the diaper I squished my son in to it and he only peed once and the diaper leaked obviously it was the fit but I don't think the diaper can hold that much even with the right fit and I don't think you can put both inserts at the same time since that makes it look like a balloon and very uncomfortable.
