Let me start by saying, I LOVE my Britax Car Seats and I suppose this cup holder is better than nothing.  However, I think it has several design flaws.  We have two Britax Marathon car seats side by side in the back seat of our Yukon.  The cup holder will not fit on the forward facing car seat by the door, or the door would not close.  So we had to put it on the side that is next to her sisters rear facing car seat.  It is literally wedged in there and leans forward.  Therefore half the time, my daughter cannot get her drink out b/c the cup holder is leaning too far forward out of her reach.  On the rear facing seat it works ok, but is still too far out of reach in my opinion.  It is more there for my convenience than hers.  My husband wants to know why in the world a car seat that is so expensive does not come with some sort of cup holder built in.  It seems like they could do a little better with theit cup holder design.
