These bags do their job on the road, when you have to dispose of diapers in public restrooms. I like the flat packaging, as they fit in my portable diaper changing clutch-bag, but it's hard to get just one bag out at a time when wrangling a squirming baby. I really don't have a preference, but I am inclined to order these again, as the bags smell less offensively of artificial fragrance than some of the bigger brand names out there.
