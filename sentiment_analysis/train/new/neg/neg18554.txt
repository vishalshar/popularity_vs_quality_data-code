Horrible. Just got mine today, haven't even used and one already came with a hole in the seam.  I didn't even put any wipes in it, I tried the butibag too, same issue. It's not even worth a return because I'm not wasting my time anymore with this product.  I had hoped this was of better quality. Don't get me wrong the concept is great but do these people really have their own children....? If they did it would not be so cheaply and carelessly made. Dried wipees are a NO GO! It's tacky but I'm going back to ziplock bags. They have never let me down. They may not be fashionable but they are way more convenient. How hard can it be to make this product like a ziplock????????? Not just looking like it but fix the seams!  Truly don't buy this in any form. I know it looks like a great idea but it's poorly made so it just won't work. I won't even use the other one for my diaper bag, I don't want to be so delicate with it out of fear it might come apart and my wipes dry out. Just not worth it. I hope the company fixes this problem and betters their quality control.
