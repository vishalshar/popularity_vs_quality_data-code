These absorb just as well as our other prefolds. But, both my partner and I dreaded every time these were the only ones left clean. They are really short and wide and annoying to put on our baby. Our baby is thin with very chubby legs, so that may be why they didn't work well for us. We also were able to use our other prefolds for a longer amount of time. I recommend osocozy.
