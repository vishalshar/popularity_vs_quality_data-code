I know this is for a newborn, but it still seem a bit too small.  It is just slightly larger than a regular Boppy (when you allow the ends of the Boppy to touch) - it has approximately a 20" diameter. I bought it for my 3 week old, and when her bum is in the depression her head is starting to arch backward off the pillow. My baby isn't a particularly large baby either (9 lbs, 21"), but I fear she will dangle off the edge soon - the baby pictured must be quite small. It works for now, but I fear that I will not be able to use this product for hardly any time at all.  She does fine in it, but I actually think that it worked just as well to let her sit with her bum in the hole of the regular Boppy with a pillow under it, and curl the Boppy around her.  She was able to sit up and see more.  This one is almost flat except for the bum area - maybe a 3" depression which leaves her head, chest and knees on the same plane, so she isn't able to see any more of what is going on around her than if I have her laying down next to me on the couch. Also, the description says that it has a fleece fabric cover, but it doesn't - it is just a cheap, stiff cotton cover that isn't even as soft a cotton as is found on a typical Boppy. Again, it isn't bad, but it isn't as described.
