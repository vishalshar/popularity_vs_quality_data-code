First of all, I have to say that we have been using this swing with our infant daughter since her birth almost 9 weeks ago and she loves it. It is her favorite place to sleep during the day (it's the only thing she's happy in for long periods of time).  It is well padded all around and the pad comes off for easy washing.The swing is relatively quiet although there is a constant clicking sound.  It doesn't bother us and seems to soothe our daughter to sleep. The sounds are pleasant and the mobile has become a point of interest for her at this age.  My only gripe about the mobile and sounds are that they stop on their own. I'd rather be the one choosing how long I want it to run.  It gets to be a pain to have to constantly go back and turn it on again.My biggest gripe about this swing and the reason I can only give it three stars is that the swing stops swinging on it's own, even though the motor is still running.  Also, I have to swing it manually to get it to start swinging.  I can't tell you how many times my sleeping and happy baby wakes up crying because the swing has stopped swinging.  It's not a battery problem because it happens even when I have brand new batteries in the swing.  Even as I write this review I've had to restart the swing twice.  I don't know if mine is defective or if other people have had this issue as well, but it's incredibly frustrating for a swing that I've paid good money for.I still recommend this swing, however I would save the packaging for a month or two (unfortunately I didn't) in case you have the same issues and need to make a return or exchange.
