It's not that I am unhappy with this purchase, and I know it is for their safety... but, both sides are hard! I was just at a friend's house, and they bought a mattress from pottery barn, and it looked like the kid was on a pillow. My 11 month old doesn't sleep well in her crib ( but, fine in our bed), so, I am thinking about getting a mattress pad for this mattress...
