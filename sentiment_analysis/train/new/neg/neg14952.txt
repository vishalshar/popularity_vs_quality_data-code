We are a family of seven, and our kitchen sustains a lot of wear and tear because of that. But I expected the locks to stand up to us. They did not. Three of the locks broke within 24 hours of installing them. And since they were a pain in the ass to install in the first place, that makes it suck even more. Over the next week or two, the locks continued to break, one by one. we now have a couple working locks left, and one still hanging on by a desperate thread. The locks work, but the cheap, flimsy plastic snaps easily, causing the main piece of the lock(the piece that you'd push down to open the drawer or cabinet) to fly off when you close it if it isn't perfectly lined up. In my opinion, not worth it at all.
