My grandson is outgrowing his carseat/stroller combination and now wants to sit up when going for walks or shopping so I bought his the Contours Lite Stroller.  It is a very nice stroller that you can put together easily (I am not very good at putting things together and this one was very easy)  and doesn't have a lot of loose parts. (thank goodness!!)The basket below the seat is very large and roomy and you can fit a diaper bag and a few other items in there with no problem.  The sunshade has several different positions that you can use as well as the seat itself.  The only thing that I had any kind of difficulty with is setting up of the seat.  It adjusts in the back and it is better done without baby in the seat.The tray and cup holder come out easily to put baby into the seat and the straps are sufficient and strong enough to hold baby in place.  There is even a convenient cup holder at the top of the push bar for big people.  It folds together easily for storage and it fits nicely in the trunk of my car and the stroller is very light in weight but built sturdy.UPDATE:  The more I use this stroller, the more I dislike the straps that secure the child to the seat and the straps to hold the seat into position.  The straps on both keep pulling apart leaving it loose which is not a good thing. My 1 year old grandson can easily slip off the straps that keep him in the seat even though when I start out on a walk, it loosens up.Also too, I can't keep the seat from leaning back even though I would like it to be more upright position.  Again, I start out in the upright position and soon it starts slipping back no matter how much adjusting I do.  Very frustrating!!
