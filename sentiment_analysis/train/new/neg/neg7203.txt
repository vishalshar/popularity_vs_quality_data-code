When the seat cover arrived, I opened up the package, and the the seat cover has a different design then what is pictured on the box. It is also very cheaply made, and you can see through it. The fabric was very thin, I was afraid I was going to rip it while putting it on my car seat. When I got the seat cover on, it didn't fit properly. None of the holes lined up with the straps, which affected the way the straps buckled, which affected the safety of my car seat. This is a VERY dangerous product. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
