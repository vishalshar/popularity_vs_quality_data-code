I bought this after we wore out the Carter's Mattress pads because I have this brand on my older son's twin bed.  I was happy with that fit and so I bought this one.  Its a good product but it is too small and we have to struggle to put it on the bed and I am always afraid of ripping the side elastic.  Fortunately, my son has moved to a toddler bed so we just take the whole mattress off the bed.  I am much happier with the Target brand mattress we bought at the same time and it has held up just as well.
