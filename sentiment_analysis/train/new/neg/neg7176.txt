UGH!  I have the Medela Pump In Style Advanced (On the Go Tote) pump and while these tubes still "worked" with my pump... the fit (on the tubes' adaptor to the connectors) was not tight like they should be.  This in turn I believe decreased the suction from the pump.  Have you ever noticed that if the membrane wasn't pressed onto the valve all the way, it wasn't air tight and hence very low or no suction at all?  This is how it felt with these tubes.  Of course I didn't realize they were not made by Medela... had I known, I wouldn't have bought them.  Now I am stuck with 2 sets of tubing that are going in the garbage!  Sorry for the venting... yes they worked but not efficiently like they should.
