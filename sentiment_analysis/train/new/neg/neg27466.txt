We had a MacLaren for my son that served us well for four years and finally died after a long trip to NYC.  When my daughter graduated from her "bucket" we had to get another lightweight umbrella stroller to cover her baby years.  I had been happy with the MacClaren except for three things:  It didnt' recline very far, the basket was ridiculously small and it was forever tipping over when I hung something from the handles and pulled the baby out prior to removing that bag.  Comments online led me to believe the Mia Moda had solved those problems.  It did!  It was a little heavier, but I liked the footrest for a baby, the basket was nice sized and I hung a heavy backpack on it, pulled me daughter out, and had no tipping.  It also had a much better sun shade.  HOWEVER.  We've  used it for a little less than a year and it started to not collapse well and not latch when collapsed.  My husband tried to force it shut and broke the top piece.  So I'm back to MacClaren.  It's not worth having to replace that many times.
