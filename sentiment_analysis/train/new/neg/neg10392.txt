I had been looking forward to ordering this for a long time for my daughter and I finally pulled the trigger...but was beyond disappointed that it arrived with only 2 pieces of fruit (the watermelon and banana). We are missing the pear and grapes. It's quite disappointing that no one noticed this, and now I guess I must go through the hassle of returning and possibly re-ordering. As cute as the complete set would be, not sure if it's worth the hassle.
