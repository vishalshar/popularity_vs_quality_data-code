The idea of tugging my daughter's car seat through an airport, especially with one stop along the way, led me to buy the Pac Back.  I was truly excited about the product and on our trip out, had decided that it was well worth the money.  However, at the beginning of our trip back, when I initially strapped the car seat back in, one of the waist straps wripped from the seam.  I was able to fix the problem temporarily so that it still served its purpose.  However, toward the end of our trip, the nylon shoulder straps literally ripped apart at the seams, and another waist strap ripped out making it unusable -- and this was from just picking it up to put it on my back (it's a very average-sized car seat.)  Not only did we have to tote around the car seat, but we now had to carry with us the ripped pac back too.I returned the item to Amazon without any problems, but was truly diappointed with the product.  I probably would have tried to return it for a new one but my husband insisted on the refund.  The concept really is a great one and hopefully I just received a defective product.
