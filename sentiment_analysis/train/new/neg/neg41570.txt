i reveiwed this product before purchasing it, i read both good an bad reveiws, i of corse chose to trust the good ones. once i received it an set it up, turns out that all the bad reveiws were true!!! this baby monitor is horrible!!! i cant go any further than 15 feet without the dang thing beeping all crazy saying im outa range! i needed a baby monitor because my daughters room is upstairs and i would like to roam an clean freely around the house during my 1 year olds many naps while being able to hear if shes ok upstairs and i cant even hit 10 steps from her room before this monitor says its outa range! WASTE OF MONEY! really angry that i have to repurchas another one.
