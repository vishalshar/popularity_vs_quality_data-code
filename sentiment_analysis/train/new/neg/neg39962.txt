I have two large, young dogs who love to play with cats, and a mother cat with four young kittens.  I bought this gate to use across the hallway that leads to the cats' bedroom so they'd have a place of refuge.  It didn't look too sturdy even in the store, but my criteria was that it needed to be a swinging gate so I can open it and roll my laundry cart into the laundry room down the same hall, and it needed to be cheap.  We've had trouble with it pulling out of the wall when the dogs try to stand up on it to peer at the cats.  It worked fine as a pressure gate until we could get to the store to purchase wall anchors instead of the worthless screws that came with the gate.  But now there's four huge holes in the wall, which will someday need patching.  And because we missed slightly on the measurements, we need to purchase washers or something to get the gate to fit more tightly in the brackets, so that it will swing without wobbling.  The latch on the gate has also been a bit of a problem, requiring a little time and patience to latch it each time it's opened.  I would NOT use this gate for kids of any age, but despite the problems I've had, I have been able to figure out a solution to each problem the gate has presented.  I'm relatively happy with its performance in protecting my cats' area from dog invasion.
