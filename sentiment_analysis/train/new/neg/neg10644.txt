We bought two of these gates because we thought they looked nice. It has so many design problems, I'm not sure I'll be able to remember them all. In short:* Screws are really cheap, even after pre-drilling holes per the instructions, they almost all stripped clean when just trying to install them.* The opening mechanism is difficult to operate and because the opening action is in the same direction as locking the bracket into place, in one move you can practically take the door off.* The hinge covers have no way to lock in place, so anyone (or anybaby or anydog) can also rip the door off its hinges with minimal effort.* The screws that hold the adjustable section seem to be impossible to tighten correctly, which is bad because staying at the appropriate position is key to the door staying shut.* It is designed to be able to throw the door closed, but it almost always needs your attention when trying to make it stay closed, which half the time will cause the door to come off its hinges.We returned this gate and bought the Safety 1st Everywhere Safety Gate aka "All Clear Safety Gate", and it is better in every way.
