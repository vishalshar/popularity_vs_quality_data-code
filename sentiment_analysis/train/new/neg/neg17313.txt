The best thing about this gate is seeing my baby sisters' faces pressed up against the mesh like they are pod people. The worst part about it is that because it's fabric it catches on other fabric, so if you are climbing over and your sock touches it, it will grab it and you will fall. So it's probably better you only use this gate in areas that you don't need to get in or out of.
