We had loved this play yard until my baby was 8 months old.  We like the way that the company made 2 sizes (6 panels & 8 panels) and 2 colors (Grey has never been available for 8 panels).  We're glad to have 8 panel playyard which is still stable and therefore gives more space for my little one.  The hinges are a bit difficult to use when trying rearranging the shape, but we managed somehow.When my LO reached 9 months, he started climbing up by putting his feet onto the fence!Ah.....babies are a lot smarter than we may think!  :(Now, this company sells metal play yard with vertical slats, and they offer extension panels.  Although this metal/vertical play yard costs more than this plastic yard, I wish I had purchased the metal/ vertical one instead of this product... because my LO's arms are getting stronger and stronger to climb over the fence!!
