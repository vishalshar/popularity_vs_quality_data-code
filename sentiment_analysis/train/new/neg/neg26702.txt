It's nice to have one kit that has so many different types of safety items included, so that you don't have to make multiple purchases. The door knob covers are the 'hard' plastic and are difficult to open the doors for the adults too, especially if you have any type of lotion on your hands. The softer rubber ones are better, where you can just 'squeeze' the handle cover to grip the knob under it. These are hard plastic and you have to put your fingers through the holes provided, to grip the knob. This is not as easy to do as it would seem, especially if you have a knob that is harder to turn. I've actually found myself 'locked out' too and have had to remove the cover to get the door open.
