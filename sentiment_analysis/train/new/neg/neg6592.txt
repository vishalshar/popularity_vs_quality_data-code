This is a cute bed no dought but putting it together is something else the instructions are horrible. Also the drawer part of this bed is so flimsy feels like anything you put in it might fall through;very cheap wood. And the side rail doesn't have much support tends so to wobble. I was also missing some screws had to go buy some of my own. But it's a decent bed and hasn't fell apart in me yet so it's ok.HELLO THIS IS AN UPDATE***I haven't even had this bed for a year and screws keep falling out, definitely not made for a toddler. I ended up receiving a refund, but impossible to get in contact someone for spare parts. Will never buy something like this again.
