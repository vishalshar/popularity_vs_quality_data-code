This looked like a pretty cool idea, I like the fact that the towel straps around your neck to stay in place when your taking the baby out of the bath.  I used this on my 10 month old, he's about 30in long, not sure if it's because my son is kind of tall for his age, but the length of the towel wasn't long enough to fold up over his legs at the bottom, definitely didn't cover him like the picture on the package.
