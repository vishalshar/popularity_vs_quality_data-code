We received this yesterday and I put it together (easy) for my 5 month old. I bought it so we could use it outside. It definitely works for that purpose. With the bottom plastic piece, baby isn't dragging his feet on the ground and getting dirty (which was a concern when we took the jumperoo outside). It's easy to carry (lightweight) and fits through the door with no problem. Baby likes it - he immediately started playing when I put him in the seat. So for all that it's great.But...It doesn't have any music. Which I find strange for the expense of the toy. His jumperoo has music and he loves it! I'm not sure why this exersaucer wouldn't have music. And, if I had thought of that when buying it, I probably would have skipped it.Also, I have to put him in the seat backwards - so that the seat back is holding him up a bit. Because if I put him in it forward facing, he's tipped over a bit too much. I'm sure he'll grow into more but since it says 4 months on the packaging, I expected that he would do just fine in it. I don't find that the case. I guess the seat opening is too big for him maybe (although he's in the 97th percentile for growth).But for the reason we bought it - outside use - this will be great. If we didn't have the jumperoo though, for an inside toy - I'd return this exersaucer - for the lack of music alone.
