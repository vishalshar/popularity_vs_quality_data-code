The material is nice, the "coordinating zipper" is just off-white on an orange bag and the loop is white - sloppy color coordination. The zipper is the cheapest of cheap zippers with a metal pull; however the teeth seem tight so they'll probably keep odors in the bag. The stitching quality is not commercial or quality handmade; it is homemade in a hurry. The tension is looser than it should be and already unravelling as I unpacked it. The seams at each end of the zipper were not reinforced (or even finished, as the threads are still loose), and the zipper is longer underneath, so you start pulling those threads out even more when the zipper is used. The stitching used to attach the zipper isn't parallel to the top edge on one side of my bag, and the reinforcing (going back and forth a couple of times) is really sloppily done; the zipper wasn't even attached with a "zipper foot." At least that thread matches the bag fabric; the seams are just done in white so all the loosening stitches show.It's a nice size, the material feels good (though it seems like it will snag a lot). Would not buy again though isn't worth the bother of returning. And now I'm inspired to make my own for a buck since I didn't realize zippers could be attached as such without a zipper foot!Mommy's Touch offered to replace it -- but only if I pay return post.
