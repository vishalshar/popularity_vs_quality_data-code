While I want my child to be comfortable while changing his crappy diaper I also do not want to wash the cover every time. If this is your first child as when i purchased this DON"T it is just wasted money. The first time your bundle of joy sprays pee or poo everywhere and you realize you have to not only scrub the wall and changing table and carpet along with this pad you will take the pad put it in the closet and never use it again. Just buy the https://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Secure-Grip-Changing-Pad/dp/B00O64QJOC/ref=pd_sim_75_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=H1WSA00VSG479H50WQGC and skip the cover. That changing pad is awesome but the cover is useless. Your baby does not care if it is on plastic or micro fiber. But i can promise when you need to clean up you will care!
