The pillow itself is the best size I could find for my daughter, who just turned two, although I would have preferred it to be a little flatter.  The pillowcase, however, is much bigger than the pillow and just slides off all the time!  It's especially bad because the fabric is satin and therefore is very slippery.  Since they don't tell you, here are the dimensions: Pillow is 10x14, Pillowcase is 12x16.  I still think it's worth buying it for the price, but I just ordered a smaller pillowcase in cotton and am hoping that works better!  The two brands that I found that actually have a suitably-sized pillowcase are Bucky and Cocoon.  UPDATE: The "Bucky Small Duo Pillow Case" found on Amazon is perfect for this pillow.  It's zippered, so it stays put, and the zipper is on the inside, so I don't have to worry about it scratching my daughter.  Also, it would be very difficult for her to unzip it.  Plus, it's super soft and cozy!  I highly recommend buying this pillow and the separate Bucky pillowcase for your toddler.
