SO disappointed! There were several options for a toy remote, but I chose this one because the description said it came with a link, so it could be attached to a stroller handle. There was NO link, and no place to attach any kind of strap of my own to the toy. Even better, after my son played with it for LITERALLY 3 minutes, the sound stopped working. What a piece of garbage!!!
