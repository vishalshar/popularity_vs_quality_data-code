I had a couple of these that I purchased about 7 years ago, and I liked them a lot, they were very effective for keeping our toddler out of cabinets, and they held up well.  Unfortunately they got lost when we moved, so I was happy to see these available from Amazon.  However the design on these has changed (why do they do that?), now they are much more difficult to open and close - by me!  I have a welt on my hand from trying to open the darn thing...I did see a review suggesting the use of cooking oil on the little teeth, and I tried that, which helped.  I have placed it on a cabinet that doesn't get opened very often, fortunately that was where I needed it, because it's still awkward and not easy to use.  Boo on Kidco for wrecking what was once a good product.
