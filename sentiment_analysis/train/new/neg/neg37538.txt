The fork and spoon are the EXACT same as the Sugar Booger fork and spoon. They are pretty good (more the fork - the spoon is quite big), but the sugar booger ones come in way cuter designs and come with a case for travel. This set comes with a knife, but I'm pretty sure my 1yo can live without a knife. I'd much rather have the travel case. It's so handy when we go out to eat or go on vacation. I definitely recommend sugar booger's set over this one.
