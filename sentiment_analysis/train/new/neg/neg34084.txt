I bought this after hearing rave reviews from a friend. She said that she could put three day old crusty pump parts in a basin with this and voila...they were clean. Mine...not so much. I tried hot water, I tried cold water, I tried in between lukewarm water...nothing. I tried the recommended 3 pumps, I did 5 pumps and more. Still nothing. I'd pull the bottle out, it'd look clean but the inside still had the greasy residue. My pump flanges still had residue on them. The only way I can see this working is if you ran your bottle/flanged under extremely hot water then put it in the basin. But that kind of defeats the purpose of the product. I was hoping for a miracle "saves me 30 minutes a night on dishes" soap and it just didn't deliver. I'm back to hand washing then sterilizing!
