First of all, I gave it one star because it's cute...the picture that is.  I literally had to super glue the tree to my daughter's bedroom wall!  I've done vinyls before, so I'm not a newbie, and no matter what I did, it wouldn't stick. If I had the time, I'd have just painted a mural on my daughter's wall, but because this is a new construction, I'm working on 4 kids' bedrooms (and the entire house) at the same time, and I don't have time to.  I'm so disappointed that I used her Christmas/Birthday money on this!  What a waste.  I haven't even attempted the leaves yet...
