I bought these for my 1 year old twin girls. They love sqeezies (and it saves me loads of time when they can feed themselves) but at $1.50 a piece in the grocery store I thought I'd start filling my own to save money. I first bought EZ Squeezees but didn't like the dangerously small cap or that they fill from the side and have creases that are bit hard to clean. Next I tried the Sqooshies. They are cute and easy to fill, easy to clean and have a safer cap. The problem with them is that they are made from a soft plastic and are not rigid at all. If filled with a baby food consistency they flop in half and spill all over. My girls do great with the grocery store brands because they hold their shape. These do not and therefore less useful to me. They might work better for older kids or thicker food.  They're also fine if I am holding them instead of letting the girls do it themselves.
