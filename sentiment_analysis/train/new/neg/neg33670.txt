In the begining I liked it. It is ease to use and clean. However, the pieces inside are easy to fall apart and break. Once my 1 year old baby almost ate the broken placstic and metal pieces with the puree that I made with the machine. It is really dangerous. I didn't know the inside plastic and metal pieces are falling apartment when I used the machne. I pulled them to my baby's bowl from the machine after the use. Luckily I used to have the spoon to swirl the puree and make sure no big pieces left from the machine before I feed her. Then I found a big broken plastic and metal stick inside the puree. I'd recommend anyone who had this machine and please do the same thing like I did before you feed the baby. Otherwise, it is really dangerous!
