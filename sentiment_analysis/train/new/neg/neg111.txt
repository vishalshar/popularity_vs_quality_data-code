Got two of the Britax Boulevard Convertible car seats; one for my ten months old and one for my three year old. I have used Takata seats in the past so I know that child seats can be bulky but these seats where just massive. Especially when in the rear-facing position. When I drive; the seat is up against my headrest actually forcing me to sit in a more upright position than I would normally do. (And this is in a van.)In terms of usability I do appreciate the adjustable back harness but the crotch strap is positioned so that the kids end up sitting on it in 90%+ of cases making it a hassle to get the kids seated.In sum, the safety that this product provides is probably good but I am sure that there are better alternatives out there.  For rear-facing I have yet not tried anything else but for forward-facing I would definitely recommend the Graco Nautilus product Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat in Matrix, which I have recently switched to for my older kid.
