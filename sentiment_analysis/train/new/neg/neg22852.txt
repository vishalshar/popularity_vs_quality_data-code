This says it is an Evenflo clip from Evenflo. The one I got was sent from Hungary (NOT USA as stated). It is also silver and says "Seat Belt Extender Pros" on it. It is clearly not an Evenflo clip and seeing as you are supposed to use original parts with these car seats to be safe, it is not what I was looking for. The one in the photo looks like the original clip (has the burnished bronze/gold color). Mine is silver and even feels different - not the same at all and I am worried about using it now as I wanted the original EVENFLO one (which is what this product is described as in the title and the photo). I am very disappointed with the mis-representation. I wouldn't have wasted my money if I thought it was a replacement one from Europe and not the original from Evenflo in the USA.
