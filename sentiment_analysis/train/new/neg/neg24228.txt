I was under the impression these cream polka dot transfers were identical or at least similar to the colored extra large dot transfers.  The extra large stick on dots can be placed, removed and placed numerous times.  However when I read the directions for attachment and removal I learned these cream polka dots did not have the peel off method (as the colored larger dots), rather to remove these dots you would have to PAINT OVER YOUR ROOM.  In addition these dots did not lift off the paper backing rather you have to cut them out.  For anyone that would like to avoid any permanent decals or future painting, I would try a different product.  This is not to say that the company Wall Decor is at fault I believe they carry this product which is manufactured by instant murals  Wall Decor has many other products that are simple and non-permanent.
