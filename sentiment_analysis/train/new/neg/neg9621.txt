Looks nice in the photos, but the toy I received had a tear in the fabric (before my son ever touched it).  I don't want my son to eat the stuffing, even if it is organic... I contacted Olives and Pickles (via their web support form) more than two weeks ago, and no response.  I'm disappointed with their product and their customer service.  Not recommended.
