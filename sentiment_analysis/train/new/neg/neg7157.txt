We bought this seat almost a year ago for our toddler, and have been quite happy with it... until tonight.  I did a lot of shopping around for a convertible booster, and one of the features I liked about this seat is that the cover removes for washing (the booklet says so!).  After almost a year of sippy cup spills, ours really needed it.  And when I began to remove the cover, that's when the love turned into hate.The design of this seat makes the removal of the cover a nightmare of monstrous proportions.  Every tiny little piece has to be removed.  The straps have to come out, the buckles come out, the little plastic clips in the back and bottom that you have to pry out with a screwdriver- everything.  By the time I got the cover off the seat (again, the booklet says this is something I'm supposed to be able to do), I was ready to round up the designers of the seat with cattleprods and herd them into a canyon.After washing (which was the easy part, the seat cushion/material DOES hold up very well), I went through the same ordeal in reverse getting the cover back on.  This time I didn't want to do bodily harm to the designers- I was too tired.  I think it sucked out my will to live.As far as the structure and functionality of the seat goes, we've never had an issue.  But even with a second baby on the way, I've vowed there is no way on this planet I will ever try to take this cover off and wash it again.  I'd rather get a second job and buy a new seat altogether.
