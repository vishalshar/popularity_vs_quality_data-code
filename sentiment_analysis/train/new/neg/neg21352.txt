I have purchased one of these grocery cart covers before and was pleased - that was 5 years ago - now this one was very disappointing!! It only covers where the baby sits and behind her.. it is not big enough to reach all of the handle in front and has absolutely NO coverage on the sides!!  I was very disappointed but had to keep it as it came just a day before my daughter and her baby came to visit us in Florida.  We ended up using purel all over the rest of the chair!!
