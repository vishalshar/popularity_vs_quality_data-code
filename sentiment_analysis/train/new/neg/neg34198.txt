The product is meant for 2 different age groups.  The stacking cups are good for a 6 month old and up, but the packing on the foam  'sea friends' clearly states '3 years and up'!  I can understand why.  The foam 'sea friends' are made of a sturdy material, but little baby teeth could chew through it and create pieces that would be a choking hazard.  I like the product over all but the foam  'sea friends' are being put into the closet for 2.5 years in the future...I hope I remember I still have them
