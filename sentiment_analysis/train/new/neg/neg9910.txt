I bought this toy for my 4 month old son, who is still in the "supported sitter" stage and therefore loves to sit in his stroller.  He still doesn't reach the tray so I use toys that fit between him and the tray, this toy is the perfect size for that (he also has the vTech steering wheel, and vTech Baby's Laptop for this purpose and they are great if you are looking for the same size of toys#.After seeing my son play with the piano a few times this is what I have to say:PROS:1- As with most Baby Einstein toys and videos, classical music is the main feature and I like that.2- Different settings provide a wide range of sounds and therefore I don't think this toy will drive me crazy too soon.3- Different languages set ups helps me expose my son to several languages which is great and I big factor in my decision when I buy a toy #we live in a bilingual home as it is, and the more languages the better as far as I know#4- Perfect size for my son to play with it in his stroller #as I mentioned before that was my main goal#CONS1- The speaker is on the bottom of the toy. When playing with it in his stroller this is not too big of a problem #since it's on his lap -an irregular surface- but when we lay the toy on his "tummy time" blanket it's really hard to hear the sounds.2- When you have it in the "number" set up and you press a key, it plays music, then if you press it the second time it says the number. I know that the musical aspect of this toy is the main feature, but in my opinion it'd be better for "cause-and-effect" purposes if the toy would always say the number (and maybe after that play some music) when you press the keys while in the "numbers" set up.3- I wish it had all the musical notes. The toy only has 5 keys and therefore only 5 notes, but looking around I found that most piano toys for this age range only have 5 keys so this may just be a standard thing.All together it's a very nice toy, as far as I can tell it's safe for my son (nothing can come off of it or anything like that) and my son is interesting in it enough to keep him occupied for a little while which is all I asked for.
