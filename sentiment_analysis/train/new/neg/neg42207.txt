I EP and ordered these because they were a much better value.  The batch I received are terrible and have effected my milk supply due to lack of suction.  Even thought it says "free returns" when I attempted to start the return process only three days after buying them it said "ineligible for returns".  I have only maymom products that are wonderful, but I would definitely avoid these because they seem inconsistent.  Its not worth effecting your milk supply for a few dollars savings.
