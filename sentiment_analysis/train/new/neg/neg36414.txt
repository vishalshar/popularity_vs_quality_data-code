Not my daughters favorite but she does use it. When it arrived it did have a very strong chemical smell to it as other reviewers have mentioned. I washed it with soap and hot water and let is sit on my counter for a few days until the smell was almost all gone. I think the only real issue my daughter has with it is that it's easy for her to drop it.
