Love! love! love NUK pacifiers! This is the only brand and style we used for our boys (& they would take!) Then this past Sept I got my girl! ðŸ’• and have been having so much fun (especially after all things boy) buying pretty girl things!! But to my complete frustration I have NOT been happy with the selection of NUK girl pacifier designs lately ðŸ˜• I saw this one however and was instantly smiling!! Love it! Soo pretty!! and I must have been soooo excited that I failed to see until I opened it that there is ZERO WAY to attach a pacifier leash!!!! Ugh!!!ðŸ‘Ž MAJOR CON for me! Even if they don't use the commonly found loop, a simple hole would've been fine.Soo looks like the pretty NUK pacifier I finally found is either going to be confined to the crib and home, or I'm thinking about maybe trying to drill a little hole in it (which I shouldn't have to do :/ sigh)
