Works well,  I read the reviews that state that they use these and put the dirty diapers in their kitchen cans and don't smell them for days.  I don't really believe that.  Yes, it does keep some of the smell at bay, but not all.  I do like them since they do mask the smell for a little bit of time, but find myself emptying the can just as often.  I like to carry these in the diaper bag too to put any clothes that may be leaked on or have been destroyed by my toddler and needs a change of clothes. Makes for a great little  bag to keep those things nice till you get home.
