I am not the type of person who writes reviews very often, but this product definitely deserved a review. First of all I order this product on July 16, 2015 and as of today Sept, 28 2015 I have not received all the parts to assemble it. In the first box, I got the ottoman and the cushion for the armrest  and back. I had to call storkcraft directly to request the rest of the parts (in the box there is a paper that I am attaching in the picture where they advice you not to return the product or to call the store where you purchase it but to call them directly. Anyways, I got a second box and in that one I got the back frame and the armrest frame. I had to call and request a the base for the actual chair and the cushion. I got the base with another ottoman and another back frame but no cushion for the seatand another set of armrest frame. So I had to call again and request the cushion pad for the main chair. Getting all the parts has been a nightmare. it takes them forever to ship them. they have not charged any extra money but it is a pain. not to mention that it has been more than two months of phone calls. shipments, rude people on the phone, etc, So if you have a lot of patience and time, order it. The product itself looks like the picture. it is not the best quality but it is ok for the money you pay.
