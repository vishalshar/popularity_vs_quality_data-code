Cons:  Poor construction - Wood was splintered and legs uneven so it wobbles consistently.  Tray is not easily put on and removed  straps are very thin and would not remain tightly secure around my son, they had to be retightened every few minutes.Pros:  Looks nice (aside from splintered wood around the screw holes)  Seat seemed nice quality and comfy - looked to be easily cleaned  Easy to assembleThis High Chair arrived quickly and I put it right together fairly easily...  unfortunately it's quality was very disappointing.  While putting it together, most of the pre-drilled holes used to house the screws for assembly were splintered and shred so bits of wood flaked off around them.  After completing the assembly, the legs were totally uneven and it wobbled back and forth.  I attempted to adjust the very cheap bases to the legs, but nothing helped.  I considered adding a small base to one leg to fix the issue, but decided for the money we spent, we should have a quality product.  My 9 month old son tried it for a day with napkins folded under one leg and seemed comfortable enough.  The straps were extremely thin and quickly loosened.  The cushion was nice and seemed easy to clean.  The tray surface was very nice also, but difficult to remove from the chair.We were very excited about this product based on other reviews and because we liked the design.  I am unfortunately returning this product after a few days to purchase another brand.
