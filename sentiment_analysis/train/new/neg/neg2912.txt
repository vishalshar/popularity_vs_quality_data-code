I really wanted to like these. The alternative Muslim swaddling blankets are quite pricey and the reviews were so good. However, I own a SwaddleDesign and an Aden and Anais classic swaddle blanket and there really is no comparison.  These blankets are too puffy; yes they're thin but the weave makes it much thicker to work with. Baby doesn't look comfortable at all after I swaddle unlike using the other swaddle blanket. When I wrap my baby using HB, then the other blankets I own, there is a VERY noticeable difference in her size. She is literally higher off the crib mattress. I don't think the material is as breathable.If you're not sure which one to get, I would recommend you get the SwaddleDesign or A&A. Instead of buying multiples of the HB, get the quality brand because you might need fewer. Due to the quality and thinness, I find them easier to wash. I even handwash my SD blanket and hung dry; it was fine to use again by nighttime.
