I normally never leave reviews but felt it necessary to warn others about my experience with this product. I'm the father of a 3 month old baby. A couple weeks ago I put him down for a nap in his swing, with his head resting in this pillow. I was on the computer and noticed his arms flailing really fast, he didn't make any noise whatsoever. I ran over to him and his mouth was completely full of saliva, veins were bulging out of his forhead, his eyes were swollen and watering and he the most horrifying look on his face I have ever seen, he was drowning in his saliva and obviously in a lot of pain. I was able to grab him, pat his back, and get the saliva out of his mouth. Of course as a new born he has spit up many times, but he has never had anything like this happen before.  He has never choked on his own saliva like this for that long. And I have never seen him look like he was in that much pain.I began to brain storm of why this would happen now, and the only thing I can think could have caused this is the fact that he can't move his head to the side in this pillow. Before using this, if he had spit up in his mouth he could move his head to the side and let it drain out. This pillow prevents him from doing that, it props the babies head so his face is straight up and makes it really difficult for him to move it to the sides.I just thought I would let others know of my experience. I wish I would have known about this before buying this product.
