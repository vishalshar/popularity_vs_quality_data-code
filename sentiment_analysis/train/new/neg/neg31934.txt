I was looking for a power strip protector that could both accommodate a long plug at the end and a plug that is long but sideways (for our wireless router). This one works, HOWEVER, that is only because we used string in order to tie it shut. Honestly, the three main options out there do not do both things I was looking for so this was a compromise after seeing that one of the three has gaps so big that my son's hand could go in easily. I wish someone would make one of these a little bit wider so the sideways plug would fit.
