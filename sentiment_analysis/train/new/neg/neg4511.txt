After deciding that we DIDNT want a huge tandem for our twins, we realized this was the only reasonable option while we used the infant seats... I agree with the last review, its great because its the only one of its kind, but it could be better, much better...First of all, what I DO like... I love that its pretty much lightweight, you wont find another tandem like it. Both of my SnugRides fit inside beautifully, and they are safely anchored. They do provide you with cupholders, and a small tray. Folds to a pretty decent size, great for minivan owners. LOVE the large basket, I can go groccery shopping with it!What I DONT like... Great once folded, but folding could be easier with a one-hand mechanism. The wheels wobble a bit, I dont trust it on anything more than a cracked sidewalk or the street, no, not even grass. Large basket, HORRIBLE design, there is no way I can get anything larger than a notebook out of that basket without removing a carseat. It doest turn as well as it should, I REALLY wish I turned well. AND we were having a hard time assembling it, Baby trend was very rude and unwilling to help... it took 5 grown men and 2.5 hours to finally put it together, with ZIP help from the company...I dont know, maybe I just dont like BabyTrend, but this product could use a lot of work. I would probably purchase it again, unless a better option was made. BabyTrend could do MUCH better.
