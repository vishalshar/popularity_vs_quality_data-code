Here's the pro: way more affordable than most cribs on the market, and once built it is sturdy. Instructions are no more confusing than other similar furniture that requires assembly.Here's the con: they have an entire web interface for ordering replacement parts that have been damaged in the shipping process. We used it when the back rail (the highest part in the image) arrived in two pieces instead of one.We used it again when the first replacement arrived horrifically scratched up.When the next replacement arrived, we gave up and installed it since it was still dinged in shipping but not as obvious as the first two.I wish they would spend a little extra time in designing packaging rather than mailing out replacement parts so frequently. Also worth noting: I reached out to Graco to let them know about my experience over a month ago and haven't heard back.Here's the best advice I can give: if you want this because of price, order in advance so you aren't waiting on replacement parts AND dealing with a newborn.
