I was all set to use this with my newborn but then when the time came I chickened out.  I just wasn't comfortable squeezing it into my sink or putting it in the tub to bathe him.  Just something seemed awkward about it, plus tiny newborns are so hard to bathe anyway, as a first time mom I was just too nervous.  I ended up running out and getting the big plastic tub that I was desperately trying to avoid.  We got the fisher price whale tub, and love it!!!! Now, with that being said. . . we still use the tuckie duckie too.  It sits next to the whale tub on the bathroom floor and we let baby hang out on it before he goes in the tub, when we undress him, and right out of the tub when we wrap him in the towel to dry him off.  It works great for us as a staging area before we actually get him in the tub.  I am really glad we have it.  I can't speak to how it dries/or any mildew smells because it never gets submerged in water.
