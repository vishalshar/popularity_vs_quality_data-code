I bought these bottles to test before an upcoming trip and they were terrible! They leak everywhere and the flow is way too fast for my 7 month old. There is no way these are for babies 0-3 months. Don't waste your money or time on these. Im going to be bringing our regular bottles on our upcoming trip. Is there another disposable bottle option???
