The material feels nice and the color/quality are great... for wearing as a shawl or scarf.However, trying to nurse in this thing was awful. I used it outdoors, and I always had to try and lift up the fabric, so I could see my baby. The very worst experience was trying to use this in an airplane: It heats up fast under this cover and my poor baby was sweating buckets. Also, since this cover is black, I could barely see his little mouth to try and guide the latch. This made my trip super tough. Luckily, I had an extra cotton cover with the rigid neckline for the return flight.I'm keeping this as a shawl with a hole, but definitely won't be nursing with this ever again.
