Seems sturdy and the wings hold their shape fine. My only complaints would be that the chest strap is not attached. It buttons around the shoulder strapps and is not connected upon arrival so it took me a moment to figure out how it went together. And its size is so much smaller than the other backpack harnesses out there by the same company. I ordered the pink angel one for my daughter and this one for my son as it was more his style than the baby blue angel one. This one is more of a poch than a backpack. My daughters pink one can fit her PJ's sippy cup, pull ups and a small toy and not be over packed. But this one may fit a small toy if you are lucky or a pacifire. It works as a harness but not as a backpack by any means.
