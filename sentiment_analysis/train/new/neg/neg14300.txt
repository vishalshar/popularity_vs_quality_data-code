I had a previous model of the Brica mirror that was the best thing ever..  I was trying to get an identical replacement because the suction cup broke... This one is not identical at all.  I knew it looked different, but figured the quality would be at least similar.  This one vibrates on the smoothest of roads (old one did not).  This one only lets me see one (maybe two) of the back seats at a time (I could see all three seats with the old one.)  I've only had it installed for about a week and it hasn't fallen off YET.  (My old one fell off with the change of seasons.)  While that was annoying, it took a whole 5 seconds to put it back up.  I imagine this one will eventually fall off, too... Just won't be keeping it installed long enough to find out because I do not find it useful at all with the vibration.  I gave it a chance, but I find myself stretching up to look through the vehicle's rear view mirror to get a clear view.
