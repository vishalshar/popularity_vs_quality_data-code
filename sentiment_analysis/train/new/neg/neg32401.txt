My grand-daughter ( 16 months) loves to put the beads in and out of the bucket, open and close the bucket, carry the bucket around and  she tries to toot in the holes. She knows which ends belong together to pop them in place.  But they are impossible for her to actually pop them together.  The holes and pegs are too tight.  She can't even pull them apart when I put them together.I thought that with use they would get easier, but they haven't in 6 months with us playing with them at least 3 times a week.
