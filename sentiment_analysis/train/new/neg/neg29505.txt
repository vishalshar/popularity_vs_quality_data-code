Unfortunately, these diapers have a awful fit! They are super duper tight on my son's legs, but if you loosen the velcro to give the legs room, it gapes at the stomach. The diapers are also very poorly made. I decided to try and salvage them by pulling out the elastic and putting in looser elastic. These diapers don't even have elastic. They have a weird stretchy plastic thing that acts as elastic that is sewn all the way down, so I can't just remove it and put in new. Basically, unless I'm willing to cut off the circulation on my son's legs on a regular basis, these diapers are junk. :(
