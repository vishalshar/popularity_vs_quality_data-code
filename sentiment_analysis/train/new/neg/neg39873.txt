Terrible quality! Not cotton, not soft. I would not have my baby sleep on this. The return policy of the seller SoHo is horrible. They charged about $12 for shipping which is non refundable (unlike most products in this price range which have free shipping). Then, I had to pay another $15 or so for shipping it back. Then, they took a cut of 15% restocking fee. I initially paid about $78 and all said and done, got back $40.
