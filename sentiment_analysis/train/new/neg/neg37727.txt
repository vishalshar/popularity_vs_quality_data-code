Purchased this for a bargain price on Amazon to give to a friend who recently had a baby.  My baby has slept in Halo sleep sacks since birth and we love them.  Upon getting the package I was a little suspicious that this might be a counterfeit.  The car applique on the chest looked like a cheap t-shirt material and was pulled up a bit on the bottom wheel.  After reading the back of the package I noticed a spelling mistake.It's possible that this is a real Halo and every package has the same spelling mistake.  To be honest, I never looked at our other packages closely since I was never suspicious of the quality.  Maybe the cheaper price was because Halo knows this particular sleep sack isn't up to par?  Either way, I still gave the gift to my friend and I hope she (and her baby boy) happy with it.
