I am a late bloomer with cloth diapering. Some stats that may aid you in comparing: My little one is 15 months old, is 25 lbs (98% height/50% weight). These diapers seem to be a perfect fit. I use the "Loveybums wool pull ups" covers.Pros-Like the additional pad which is sewn on one side (keeps it in place & ease in laundering)-variety of colors (although the cover hides them)-soft-easy to cleanCons-wetness seeps through fairly quickly. In the last 3 weeks, this has occurred more than 50% of the time. I change her typically at 1 1/2 hours** (track record worse with containing poo; however, I will tack that up to it being too... "liquidy"...)Needless to say, we use disposable diapers still for outings/nighttime and these cloth diapers with the wool diaper covers for around the house.**These are better than plain old prefold diapers I had begun to use with the pull ups (which would soak through with one "go"). Perhaps the wool, lanolized diaper cover should keep out the additional wetness or my little one drinks more water than the normal toddler. Either way, the combo of these cloth diapers & the Loveybums are not containing it. Will edit more information in the future if I identify any additional information.
