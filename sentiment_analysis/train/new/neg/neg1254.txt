Used this for the first few months of breastfeeding.  Helped a ton with putting baby in correct nursing position.  It's just a little tough trying to put around the waist and buckle belt with a squirmy sometimes very hungry baby in your arms.  You do have to put baby down to arrange it around waist.  It does provide good back support and to keep the foam clean, I just zipped it back in plastic it came in and put the pillow cover on top of that.  That way any milk would not ruin the foam, and I could just wash the cover.  We are at the stage that the baby is sitting up and it doesn't really work too great to help with that.  But for nursing and helping with positioning, I would definitely recommend this over the Boppy.  The baby stays in place at a good height and does not start to fall in the area between the stomach and pillow like with the Boppy.  I just couldn't use it that much for tummy time or to help give support while sitting like with a Boppy.
