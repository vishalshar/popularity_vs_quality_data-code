Was perfect for Disney!**NOTE: do not keep over stroller in heat. We left this over our stroller at Disney and it wasn't horribly hot, just low 80's. It was raining when we went into a show and the sun had come out while we were away from the stroller. The heat warped the flexible bar in our canopy and now the canopy touches my 2 year old's head. I'm so upset because this is our favorite stroller of 5! Now I feel like the part I love most about it, (the large canopy) is useless.
