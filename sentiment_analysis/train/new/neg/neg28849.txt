I've been searching and searching for a reasonably priced piece of furniture like this. I was "gaurenteed" delivery by a Friday only for it to still be at least 12 hours away the morning it was supposed to be out for delivery. Making my family members, l who drove over 4 hours to my house to help me put it together since the pckage is 123 pounds and I am 7 months pregnant, time completely wasted. The package FINALLY showed up at almost 6 pm THREE DAYS later the Box was soaked and ripped really bad. Almost impossible to open without tearing the entire box up making returns in same box impossible. Individual pieces of the furniture were wrapped so they weren't wet, but it didn't protect them from getting beat up, scratched and broken.I have numerous pieces that are nicked and splintered making them not fit too great together.Although it took my husband 3-5 hours to put together it is well thought out and the instructions are easy-ish to understand but the pictures aren't the best quality.Honestly, I can't even stand to look at this piece of furniture right now because the overall experience has been a nightmare and if it wasn't so difficult to return I would get my money back.The piece looks cheap with all the broken & scratched pieces. I can't even explain the disappointment and disgust I have for it.Requesting replacement pieces is pointless because they would be sending me the entire dresser over again besides the bottom of the drawers and the backing to the dresser since those were the only pieces that weren't damaged. Wasted over $247 dollars. Hopefully, others experience is Better than mine. Pictures attached are just a few of the problems.
