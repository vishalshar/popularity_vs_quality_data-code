We normally use Dr. Browns. I got one of these and could not believe how incredibly horrible it was.  The nipple kept collapsing, making it so my baby had a hard time to eat.  Design of the bottle causes baby to swallow a lot of gas.  If you want a gassy, upset baby, use this bottle.  I threw it out after using it once.
