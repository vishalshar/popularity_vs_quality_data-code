This is the worst monitor I think they could make. It barely picks up a signal one room away. There is a bunch of static so it's hard to hear my daughter wake up or move around. It also loses its signal all the time, which is frustrating. I originally had a Fisher Price one that we just wore out over time because we used it so much. I could get a half mile away from the house and still hear things crystal clear. I am throwing this one in the trash and going back to Fisher Price.
