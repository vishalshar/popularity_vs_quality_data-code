This serves it's purpose.The quality of the plastic is questionable though.  Just tightening it around my cabinet knobs, the plastic turned white like it was getting ready to snap.  I doubt we will be able to take these with us when we move - I have a feeling they'll break when I try to resize them again.As for how it does keeping baby out, she grabs onto the long ends or our cabinet knobs and tries to open them, (which she can an inch or two), but she can't get past them.  It's sometimes difficult for me to get in them, but I've used them enough to be used to the odd open/close mechanism.For the price, and the fact that finding something for our small cabinet knobs was proving to be difficult, I am happy with the purchase.
