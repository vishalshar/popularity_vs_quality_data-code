I tried this new version for my daughter since they are a new bottle and I used the classic version for my son 9 years ago and he loved it. The airflow system doesn't work I have to take the bottle out of my daughter's mouth to move the nipple around so she can keep drinking because if the nipples move no milk will come out. I switched it for the classic version and she prefers the classic version rather than these ones. Won't used these again
