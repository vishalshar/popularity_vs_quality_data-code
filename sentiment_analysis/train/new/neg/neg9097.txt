I originally ordered the stroller in tangerine - it was way too bright so returned it and ordered the navy one. I noticed on the tangerine one that the hood/cover doesn't stay put so you can only put it on one position. i called the manufacturer and they said there were velcro tabs to attach to the stroller. The velcro tabs do not reach each other. they said they were going to send me another hood and I have yet to receive it. The same issue with the navy stroller and hood. It just falls forward or you have to hook it at the top to get it to stay put. Super frustrating. Also, it's not the easiest to fold up.  The only reason we kept the stroller is that we needed it for a trip so we've already used it. The one feature I do like is the footrest can be adjusted. Otherwise very disappointed in this stroller.
