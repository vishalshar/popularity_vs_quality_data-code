I was researching bibs for my 8 month twin girls. Specifically, I was looking for something that I can wash in the sink and won't get moldy and gross because I don't have a washing machine at home. I was debating between this one and the Bumkins bib. I ended up getting both and I am somewhat disappointed with this one. Here are a few pros and cons.pros:-I can throw it into the sink and it gets nice and clean-Collects fallen food nicely-doesn't leak through to their clothesCons:-The babies always get nervous when I put it on them because it pulls their hair, skin etc...-Because it pulls at them, I make the bib looser and the food dribbles under their chin and gets onto their clothes (this happens even when I make the bib tighter) losing the point of having the bib-The closure is bulky in the back making it uncomfortable for them to lean back- they play with the bib and bounce it around (because it is so bulky) and they end up spilling all the contents of the pocket on themselves... again getting themselves dirty.- it's to bulky to put in their diaper bag and travel with.For me, the cons definitely outweigh the pros
