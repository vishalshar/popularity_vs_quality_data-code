I was really excited to buy this despite the hefty price tag because I didn't have a body pillow during my first pregnancy and really regretted it. In retrospect I wish I had purchased a snoogie or perhaps just a wedge because the support that I'm really looking for is under my belly, exactly where there is no padding in the boppy body pillow. It gives good leg support and is okay to cuddle with, but I find myself needing a small pillow under my belly to feel really comfortable. I'm 29 weeks now, and I'm definitely starting to feel uncomfortable at night.
