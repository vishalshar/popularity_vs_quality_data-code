I wish I had read other reviews before buying these! I just assumed all Nuby cups are the same. The shape of these replacements do not fit the cups I have. The cups I have bought at Target, Babies R Us, AND the grocery store ALL have round spouts. These have a weird figure 8 spout. Hopefully other people will be smarter than I was and read the reviews first. :-/
