I got this stroller when my son was seven months old. I love the green bubble design. I loved that it is lightweight for a full size stroller. However for $200, I expected better quality.  The plastic just feel so cheap.  The foot rest does not left up like some other strollers.  The basket doesn't hold much at all and it is difficult to get to when the seat is fully reclined.  It dragged on the ground so there are holes all over the basket. I think the Maclaren makes better quality for the money.  Get last year's model for half the price.
