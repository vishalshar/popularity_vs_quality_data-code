I knew that these would be fairly cheaply made when I purchased them, however, I'm amazed that even with low expectations I was still disappointed.  We got them for travel bibs to stay in the diaper bag and a few to keep at Grandmas house.  They don't wipe clean very easily.  One of the bibs has ripped along the stitching where the velcro is, and another doesn't even stay fastened any more with only several uses. The tomato and yummy print have been used much more (as travel bibs in the diaper bag) and have held up much better.  No rips, but difficult to wipe clean even immediately after using it.
