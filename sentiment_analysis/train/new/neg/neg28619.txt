This high chair is fantastic, the pad highly functional, but this is not the same color as it looks in the pics.Color: We bought the "Chocolate".  Our looks more like an Army Green color.  It's hard to explain, but whatever it is, it's not brown. Very light brown with a green tint maybe?  Almost looks camoflage.  Guess it still beats the orange.Functionality: As has been mentioned, this pad is highly functional, very cool design, and the "chocolate" color is very good at hiding stains, washable, wipable etc.
