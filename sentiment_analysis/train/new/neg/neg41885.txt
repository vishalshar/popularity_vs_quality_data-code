If your doors are hung properly this works amazingly. Unfortunately my right side door is badly hung but my left side works perfectly. Check before buying that your doors align cleanly into a single straight line, there won't be room for give of even a fraction of misalignment on the hinge on a standard folding pantry or closet door.
