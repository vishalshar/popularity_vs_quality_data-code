We were really excited to see such a great jumper and complete with a music mat that would respond to our daughter's touch.All babies are different - and this just didn't work that well for our daughter.She would sit in it quite happily for some time and play with the dangling toys but just did not want to bounce in it!She was happy with us bouncing her but would not bounce by herself.Pros- great accessories - we still use the music mat for dancing even though she has outgrown the jumper, and she loves teething on the musical attachments.- safe, fun place for you to put your baby whilst washing up or cooking or sorting something out!- Nice and wide so makes you feel your baby is secure and cannot easily tip out (although also a con if you have narrow doorways!)- Fun for a bouncing baby - mine would just not bounce!Cons- Too short / tall, even at an early age and at the maximum shortening, my daughter was too tall for this. We have the right height door for the specifications but needed to be able to make it shorter for my daughter to be comfortable in it for bouncing.- Does sway a lot - we had a wide doorway but I can see that in a narrower doorway this might cause problems.- A pain to clean if you give her a snack whilst in it!Overall - a good purchase and I think bouncing babies will get tonnes out of it - but just wasn't as great as I had hoped for my daughter!
