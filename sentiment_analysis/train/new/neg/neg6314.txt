Twice now my baby has had a fever of 103 and this thermometer only showed 98 or 99. Luckily, I took him to the doctor both times because I knew something was wrong. He had ear infections both times. I was finally fed up and threw this one out and bought something accurate. So important to have an accurate thermometer with little ones. Just pay the extra 10 or 15 dollars and get one that is accurate.
