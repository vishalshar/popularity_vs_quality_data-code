The first valance I got was a gift from my baby shower to go along with the Lambs & Ivy 5 Piece Bedding Set, Enchanted Forest. I needed two valances because my window is pretty long. The valance that comes with the 5 piece bedding set has a totally different pattern than this individual one! I thought it was just a mistake and returned it for a new one, explaining how they didn't match. The new valance arrived yesterday...same problem. Once again I have two different patterns for a valance that is supposed to match the bedding set...
