I ordered this for our son's nursery because I liked the animals and the bright colors. Also this is one of the few bedding sets that has animals and a brighter blue color in it. Most sets with jungle animals are green or have a very light blue. When I received this set I noticed the brown border is really a leopard print border. I am not a fan of putting leopard print in my baby's room so I returned it. Also the bed skirt is a weird green color that I wouldn't have used anyway.
