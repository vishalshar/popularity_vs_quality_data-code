This bungee is awesome because you can wash it in the sink with soap and water and it doesn't absorb all of the food and liquids that seem to be constantly falling from my babies mouth.  It  feels/seems much more hygienic then the standard cloth straps.  My two issues are 1. The strap is too long... It's constantly getting in the way and dragging on the floor whenever my babe bends down or climbs something. 2. I have had this problem with all pacifier clips so it probably  isn't product specific, but the clips always seem to loose their ability to grip very quickly. I will attach it, but it has no clench and quickly falls off.
