Okay, so at first this blanket seems perfect. It's a great size, lovely fabric ... and just about suffocated my 5 month old baby. Thankfully I was just on the other side of the room. He had pulled it over his mouth and apparently breathed in and because this is backed in the silky fabric -- it's not breathable and just sucked further into his mouth. I heard his gasping and rushed over to pull it off.I can't in good conscience leave his with it anymore. The silk should only be put on the edging -- not the backing. Kids put things in their mouth and over their heads. It's what they do. The fabric needs to be breathable.
