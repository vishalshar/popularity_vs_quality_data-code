I researched for a long time prior to purchasing this bag.  Here are my thoughts...Pros: This bag has a cute pattern and numerous pockets. I liked how the bag unzipped in the front.Cons: This bag wasn't made of the material I expected.  It seemed easy to wipe clean but it seemed cheaply made. The bag is huge. I knew it would be large, but this is a enormous bag. Unless you are packing for newborn twins, or want to take everything with you,  this bag is far too large. Also, when the bag came,  it was obvious it had been returned by someone else. It did not have a tag and also had a leftover pencil from someone else.Overall: This bag wasn't what  I  expected. I would have preferred a stronger material, like canvas for the outside. Ultimately I returned the bag.  The return process was easy.
