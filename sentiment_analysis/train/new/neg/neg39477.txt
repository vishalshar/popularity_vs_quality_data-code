Some of the negative reviews complain that their kids are too heavy for this - it says right on the package it's not for kids over 40lbs. My daughter is around 25lbs. She can step up easily and turn around so she can sit.The handles are too low, in my opinion, so she ends up using the wall next to her for balance. When she is sitting on the toilet, her feet dangle over the step (she's 21 months and in 86th% for height), the only problem I have with this is that she pulls on the handles and the seat swings upward. I have to tell her it's not to play with. This is due to the light weight quality of the plastic that this is made out of. I have the Primo travel folded toilet seat (which is not structurally sturdy and folds a little while she is sitting on it) and the seat on this one is sturdy.You are supposed to set it right on the bowl, not on top of the adult seat. It fits my toilet fine, we tried both settings and the 2nd one worked.She can fold it herself and its light enough for her to set on the side of the toilet. She isn't quite coordinated at her age to set it the perfect position. And I help scoot her bottom on the right spot once she sits. I think this will be fine to use now and as she gets older. It doesn't fold as flat as you hope, but collapses enough to set to the side.I like that the seat is connected to the step. I wonder if the more expensive brands would be sturdier, but quite honestly I like the neutral all white color of the Primo, as opposed to another primary colored children's item that will clash with my bathroom Decore. The screws aren't red, as shown in the manufacturer's photo. It was easy to put together. No tools required. Took me 5 minutes.Overall I think this is fine and does the trick. Just be smart and don't buy it if your kid is over 40lbs.
