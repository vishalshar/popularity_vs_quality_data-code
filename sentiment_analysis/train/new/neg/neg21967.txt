Decent for having disposable nipples around to use with the Similac ready to feed, since they only include 1 disposable nipple in a box of 8 ready to feeds. Our infant can sometimes suck so hard she breaks the seal between the nipple and ring and makes a mess. But it gets the job done most of the time.
