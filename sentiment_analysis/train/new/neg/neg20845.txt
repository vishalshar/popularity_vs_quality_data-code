I would love to give this a 5 star, but the sticky tabs on the bottom of the protector comes off the protector and sticks on the toilet seat.  The stickies need to stay on the protector when we remove the protector off the toilet seat.  I feel bad leaving the stickies on the toilet seat for the next person or the cleaning person, so I usually try to peel it off with my fingers/nails - and they don't come off easily.  Me (or anyone else after me) having to peel it off the public toilet seat defeats the purpose of not having to touch the toilet seat.Also would be convenient (and environmentally-friendly) if these could be flushed down the toilet, like the disposable ones that are provided in some public bathrooms.  Unfortunately, the free ones in the public bathrooms are smaller and do not provide the same coverage for toddlers who like (or need) to hold onto the sides of the toilet seat.If not for these design issues, I would have given the potty protector 5 stars - it still does protect my toddler from having to touch the toilet seat directly.
