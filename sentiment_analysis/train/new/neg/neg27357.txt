It is really not worth the price, can't use it around the child's waist, it comes right off, and if you pull on it it will hurt the child because it doesn't attach to anything and is basically  like having a cord circling around their waist. The wrist attachment is also very easy for a child to unstrap. I was very disappointed with this buy, would not recommend.
