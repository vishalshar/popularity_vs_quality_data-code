When I ordered this,  it said one size fits all with no mention of what it now says "...up to DD cup". Since I'm a DDD it obviously doesn't fit snug so it defeats the purpose of being hands free.  Unfortunately I just started pumping and tried it out and it's too late to return.  Wish they would have updated their description last month.  If you're under DD,  it will definitely serve its purpose.
