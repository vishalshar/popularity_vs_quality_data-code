I'm sure this is a fine product, but we had to get a refund because it didn't fit our toilet seat.  In hopes that others can avoid the same situation, here are the dimensions of the inside plastic tabs that keep the seat in place in the center of the toilet: 10" long-ways, 8" side-ways.  The hole in your toilet seat needs to be at least this big.  This information should really be in the product description!
