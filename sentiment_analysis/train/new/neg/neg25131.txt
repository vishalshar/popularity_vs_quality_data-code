Overall, this car seat does it's job. BUT there's some things you should know before buying. The canopy has a "window" in it, which lets the sun shine in... right on baby's face. Kind of defeats the purpose. And the base seems off because I never had this issue with my other daughters Graco seat, but we latch it in per directions (really only one way to do it.) And snap in the seat, but on the first turn we made the thing went swinging because there's nothing to hold the back of it in place, even after adjusting the front seat and moving the handle back, so even with the base latched in, we still need to use the seat belt to really hold it. Plus it's super heavy, but I think most of them are.
