We bought this for a few trips we had coming up where we knew we would want to bring our car seat. We just got back from our third trip and this carrier is destroyed. It just doesn't hold up. The wheels fell off, there are holes everywhere. It's very disappointing. Hoping to get a refund or exchange it for a product that will hold up.
