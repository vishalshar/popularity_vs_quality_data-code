This Snap n Go is a great system, but I would not purchase the Baby Trend Infant Car Seat that is recommended for the stroller.  It is not soft and cushiony and it doesn't recline enough for a newborn.  It took our daughter 2 months to get to where she was comfortable in it and that was with some modification on our part.  Her head would bob and she got terribly fussy every time we put her in it.  We had to put a fleece blanket underneath her (this means that there won't be enough room for her once she is about 15 pounds) and we have modified the carrier so that she sits back further in it.  If I were to do it again, I would purchase a Graco seat to snap into it.
