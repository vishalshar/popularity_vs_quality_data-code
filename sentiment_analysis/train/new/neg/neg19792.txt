I am so fed up with products like this. It is missing one part and so cannot complete assembly. This is all because of crummy quality control and because the person who put the parts in the bag can't count. So, now have to figure out  how to either get the missing part or take the stupid thing apart stuff it back in the box and ship it back and return it.
