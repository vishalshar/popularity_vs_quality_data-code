Pro:AffordableEasy to usegood sound volume options for optimal sound decibels for babies (NEVER EXCEED 50 DECIBELS...  IT LEADS TO HEARING LOSS)Good lullaby and white noisesCute and ideal low light displayCON:Heartbeat noise isn't lifelike  (it sounds like a robot)Light display is pink not red (red is optimal for eyesight in the dark without stimulating the brain too much)You can't choose your own combination of light and Sound...  Each sound has one light option for it.I would have given one star, but that is because the only two features I was interested in (red light and heaetbeat)  weren't ideal. I bumped up its rating because the other features are great if it is what you are wanting.
