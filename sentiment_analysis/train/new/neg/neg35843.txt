My grandson played with one of these at the local Children's Museum and loved it,  so his mom decided to buy one through Amazon.  It didn't work, it made no sound at all.  Ok it's just a defective one, I thought. So I ordered another one from Amazon and it didn't work either, and I paid over $8 for it (which I thought I was getting 4 of them, because they showed a picture of 4 on the website, but in reality, I only received 1 - for &8.50!!! and it STILL didn't work!)  So while I was at Buy, Buy Baby, I happened to look over and there were some Wiggly Gigglers on the isle - for $2.99 each!  So I tried out each of them, and some wiggled and some didn't.  What is the deal, manufacturer???  If they're supposed to wiggle and make sounds, make SURE they ALL work, before you sell them.  My grandson loves this toy, but I would not purchase one online anywhere.  You need to actually make sure they work before you buy them.
