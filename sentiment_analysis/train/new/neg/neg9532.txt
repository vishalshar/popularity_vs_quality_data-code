I bought these for my newborn (3 days old) for our trip to go skiing (no I did not ski). The hat was too big and I had a big baby (11 lbs). This would fit maybe a 6mo old better. Never even got to use the mits or booties.I did like how soft it is. I am sure it would be great had I actually been able to use it.
