Does catch spills and crumbs but its short. I purchased two of these. I have a one year old, and three year old. I wanted to protect my leather seats from getting indented from the car seats but this product is to short. I have my car seats front facing and the back of the car seat comes up further than this protector, thus still making an indent from the car seat.
