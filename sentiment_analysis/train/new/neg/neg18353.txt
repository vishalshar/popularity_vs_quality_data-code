I have purchased four or five of these in the last two years because it's very difficult to find bendable/adjustable spoons for left-handed children. These are the best I have found so far, but they're still not great. They break FAR TOO EASILY. We've never used the fork attachment, but if you don't have the spoon end lined up at a 90 degree angle with the tiny arrow on the handle to put on or remove it, it will break. If you turn it too quickly or use too much pressure, it will break. The connector on the spoon is just too flimsy and it takes almost nothing to break it. I don't know how many times the spoons have come home from school broken because the teachers' assistants have turned them too quickly or taken them apart at the wrong angle to rinse them off and they just snapped off. The spoon attachment MUST be put on at a 90 degree angle, lining up with the teeny-tiny arrow on the handle. If I could find any other alternative spoon on the market (especially if it's a one-piece unit), I would not buy this set again. As it is, beggars can't be choosers. I don't recommend them unless you don't mind replacing them two or three times a year :O/
