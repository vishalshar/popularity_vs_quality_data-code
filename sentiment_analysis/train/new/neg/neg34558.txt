Beware - this is really close to the ground - I read that in other reviews, but until I got it set up, I didn't understand how low it really is. It clears maybe 5" off the ground. Baby seems to like it ok, she's still getting used to new things. She can only tolerate the swinging for a few minutes right now, but I'm hoping as she gets older (she is 5 weeks old) she'll be more comfortable. As a 39 year old first time mom, had I known that this swing is so close to the floor, I probably would not have bought it.UPDATE: 2/18/15 - baby is now about 10 lbs and 12 weeks. She will sit in the swing with no protest and fall asleep for up to a half hour. Based on my experience, the swing is appropriate for larger, older babies with some neck control. My opinion on this swing has definitely changed and I'm glad I bought it. It has allowed me to get a few things done (dishes, shower, etc) while baby chills out in the swing. It didn't break the bank and it gets the job done.
