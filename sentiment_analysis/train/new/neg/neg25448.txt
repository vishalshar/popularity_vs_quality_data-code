I had used an Evenflo pump before so I thought I would give this one a try. It literally doesn't work. It provides no suction and therefore will not produce milk. I have a very good supply and never have issues. I tried to use this several times. I took it apart, put it back together, tried different positions and still got nothing. Don't waste your money!
