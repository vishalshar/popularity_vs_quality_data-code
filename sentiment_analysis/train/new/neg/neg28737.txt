This is a JD Licensed product, but the quality of the pictures is terrible. The fork and spoon's picture is so faded, you can barely tell what it is, and the picture on the cup has several tears in it, but they plastered it to the cup anyway. The edges on the fork and spoon are pretty rough cut. It's like they cut it out, and then forgot to sand it smooth.I haven't used them yet, as my son is only 7 months old, and I'm sure they will function, but I bought them for the JD pictures.... I could have easily spent less money on any Melamine dishes... actually I did go to Walmart and bought some...I just don't think the quality is worth the price.  It was very disappointing.
