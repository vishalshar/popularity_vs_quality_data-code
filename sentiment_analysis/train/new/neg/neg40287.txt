Never used it!!!! In fact, its still in the box!!!! I didn't want to put it on the changing pad cause then that meant it was just another thing for me to clean! When my son had any kind of dirty diaper and decided to get into a playful mood while getting his pants changed there were times when he would smear his "duty" on the changing pad. After changing him I would just wipe down the changing pad to disinfect it and I was done! If I had the Pad cover on...once "duty" would get smeared on it...boom I would have had to take it off to get it cleaned. So...needless to say I had enough to clean...I can't believe I bought another one thinking it was a good idea!!!! Waist of money if your planning on being a busy mom.
