I liked these bibs at first because of their vibrant colors for boys. I have found that the backing is good plastic, and the stitching is still great. I read some reviews about the stitching coming loose. I haven't seen that happen. What is a bigturn-off is that the adherence is extremely poor and none of the bibs stay on. At first they were great, but soon, after just a couple of washes, they do not stick anymore. I have to now buy new bibs altogether. Do not buy these bibs. I care about the money you'll waste if you buy these.
