My son is 2 months and maybe just too little for this so far, but I can see how in a month or so, it'll work much easier.Really my only complaint is that it's impossible to click in the buckle across your back by yourself once you've got the baby in the carrier. And it's nearly impossible to unclick it later to take it off, with baby in the carrier.UPDATE: This carrier broke today, with my six month old son on my back! There was a loud pop when a strap busted out of a seam and my oldest daughter and I grabbed the baby before he could fall!! This should not happen!!
