long review but worth reading!Attached are photos of the older model i bought first (blue bottle/green top) compared to the newer model (light green bottle/ red top).Looking at the photos provided in the link for the product, it was difficult to see if the spout i was buying would fit the bottle i had at home.The picture of the bottles on the label are not the older model. I learned this after seeing that the spout wouldn't fit.In my photos I attempt to show the major differences with each bottle. The lids are not interchangeable and neither are the silicon spouts. They take a whole new shape and even the bottles have a different size opening which makes the lids non-interchangeable. I later went back into Amazon and saw that there was a set that included both spouts and bottles and decided i would buy it to see if the bottles were different from the ones i had at home (being that there weren't any signs of new models in stores). Once i bought the new set i was able to see the differences i show in my photos attached to my review. They are both considered to be NUBY brand click-it close bottles but clearly they are not the same. Hope this helps.
