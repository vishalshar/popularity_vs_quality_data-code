I was very excited about this product.  I thought the extra storage area would be great for traveling with my little one as we wouldn't need to use a separate suitcase, but it ended up not being too great for us, and yet we continue to use it, so it gets 2 stars.  My little one is 18 months.  We have only used it for car travel, and not on a daily basis.Pros:- Seems sturdy to us. I haven't worried about it collapsing or anything.- My daughter doesn't have any problem sleeping in it.- Rolls around fine. We haven't had any problems with the handles.Cons:- Is very bulky and heavy.  Doesn't fit in my trunk.  We have to use my husband's hatchback when we travel with this. (A separate suitcase would have been easier overall.) And little else fits.- Does take a bit of muscle to open and close. It's also kind of awkward, since you have to tip it sideways or upside down to zipper stuff closed. Make sure you have things secured inside before you do that obviously.- The sleep area is an odd size and regular pack and play sheets don't work.  I've taken to pinning them underneath the pad.- Zippers on the storage area easily catch and break. So far I've been able to fix them, but it's really annoying.
