I was trying to find some re-usable organic cotton nursing pads that actually had something of a shape to them. I had some others that were just round flat discs, and for someone with a pretty small chest they would end up bunching up all around the edges. I tried these ones - they do fit a little better because of the slightly contoured shape and they are soft and absorbant. However, they come through the wash horribly - they are always all wrinkly and folded up after coming out of the dryer, and it's really hard to smooth them out. It's like they shrink all over again with each wash and get all scrunched up. I tried not drying them but then they are stiff and scratchy. I mainly just used them at night until I got over the first few months of spontaneous leakage and no longer need pads.
