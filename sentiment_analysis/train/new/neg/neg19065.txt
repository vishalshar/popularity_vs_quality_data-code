This is different than the regular/original boppy pillow. I had no idea when I bought it at the time. It's way more round so the baby kept slipping and get wedged between the pillow and my stomach. Forget about tummy time, it was too tall to place the baby comfortably as advertised on the tag. Also, pillow is wider, and bc I'm not a large person, it tends to sag on the sides when the baby is placed in a football hold position- he kept slipping behind me. This pillow is basically useless.Buy the regular boppy. My lactation consultant let me us one and it was smaller, flatter, and firmer so that the baby was more stable.
