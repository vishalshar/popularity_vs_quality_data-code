Wanted to love this, but was just okay with it. Lots of cute ready-to-go pages with baby's firsts to put in, but the pages are thin so using a heavier duty pen meant bleed-through to the other side. Also seems like if you actually putting in pictures (with glue or tape) is going to further impact the pages on the other side. Overall, cute design and cover, pages are thin though and I can't imagine being able to fit all the photos you'd want in a baby book and still be able to close this.
