We received this product on Friday & by Saturday it was struggling.  This was very disappointing because we really liked the design of the swing, the folding aspect is great, the overall construction & seat construction is nice.  The choice of white noise versus songs, and volume control is a great feature.The "mobile" is a joke however, it mostly just stays stationary & rocks forward & back.  Nothing powers it and it doesn't rotate as you might expect a mobile to do.  Regardless the mobile isn't that important.  Here is what we experienced.  We put it together easily, then put in batteries.  The batteries are in a compartment that can only be access with a screwdriver.  Friday it was great, my daughter enjoyed it and fell asleep in it.  Saturday morning I put her in it, gave a push to get it started and it swung a few times and slowed to a weak crawling speed and made a clicking/grinding noise that I would say = motor struggling.  Our first thought was that we'd put in batteries we had on hand, maybe they were old and had gone dead already.  So we got brand new batteries, installed them and same thing.  My husband took the new batteries out, and tested them, they were just fine.  Back in they went and it seemed to work better, and she swung for about 10 minutes before the swing slowed & started to struggle again.  The music always worked, so I think it was just the motor not working.  I called Fisher Price and they sent postage paid return mail label, we returned the product and they are sending a new one.  Hopefully it will work better.  I wish the battery compartment was easier to access, but if it works as reviewed by others that shouldn't be a big issue.
