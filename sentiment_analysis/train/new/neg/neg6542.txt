I debated giving this three stars, since it DOES say in the product description that this warmer takes 30 minutes to make a cold bottle lukewarm, but in the end I just really don't like it.  The whole inner and outer sleeve system is more complicated than I thought it would be, and my husband and I are usually pretty savvy.  After 30 minutes a two ounce bottle (4 oz size Avent classic) is not even room temp, and 30 minutes is an eternity.  It's faster to dunk it in hot tap water, and you get better results.  I was hoping to use this on a flight, but it just isn't worth it, especially since we use formula, which is only good for an hour.  If it worked as advertised (maybe I got a dud?), it MIGHT be worth it for breastmilk, since it supposedly keeps the bottle warm for a long time, but we were unable to test that with formula.  It did keep the bottle less-than-lukewarm for an hour, which our baby would drink - but she was not happy about it.I knew I was taking a risk on this since there were no reviews, but I would skip this.
