The product arrived on time and the packaging was perfect. The piggy bank is a great item and is as described in the product description. The only problem with the piggy bank was the black on the nose was scratched off. I didn't have time to return the product so I had to fix the nose so both sides matched. Was an easy fix, but for what I paid..I wish I could have returned it for another one.
