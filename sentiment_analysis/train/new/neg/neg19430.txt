This car seat is the heaviest thing ever. I've tried a Britax and my daugther hates it, so we went back to the peg perego and she is OK once we are moving in the car. For me is a nightmare, it's so heavy I can barely lift it in the car. Even worse during winter when you have to almost run from the car to the nearest door with this EXTRA heavy seat. My husband says is sturdy and well made, and I don't doubt it but the best car seat is the one you can easily use and this is literally a pain in the back.
