I am sorry to say that we found a similar problem that others here have mentioned.  After about 8 months of use, the monitor crackles and you can no longer hear the baby.  It happens worst of all when you are trying to adjust the volume.  Obviously, if you can't hear the baby, and the monitor is nothing but crackles (I'm not talking about your run-of-the-mill static, I am talking about deafening crackling!) it's worthless.  Quite a shame, because I really, really loved this monitor for the first 8 months or so.  The good things were: it's small, you can stick it in your pocket, it had an INCREDIBLE range compared to the Sony I bought to replace it, and I loved the rechargeable battery.  The negatives were: It did NOT have a warning when the battery was running low, so it would just stop picking up the baby sounds without my knowing.  Also, even if you DID want to risk buying it, they no longer make the rechargeable battery.As I mentioned, I bought a Sony to replace it, and I can't say I like it nearly as much as I liked this one in the beginning (it's clunky and has a range of about 2 feet!) but who wants to buy a monitor that's gonna start screeching and crackling after 6-8 months of use?!?!?
