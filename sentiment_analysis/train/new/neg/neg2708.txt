I think I purchased this too late.  My baby at the time was bigger (she has always been a big baby), and has always been slower to learn things.  Got this in hopes she would start to enjoy tummy time and learn to roll, but I think because she was so big, it didn't really work for us.  I understand the concept of it, and I was a first time mom at the time, so I thought I needed everything on the market for her development.  If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't have gotten this, or the other gazillion million things I got for her that we used maybe 2 weeks tops, before moving on to the next stage.  I could see this being helpful for a reflux baby though, to proper them up on, but on the same token, a hoppy would work just as well, and have many more uses.  We STILL at 14 months use our hoppy (as a proper to lean on when watching movies)
