FYI: this lock attaches on to both toilet seat hinge bolts.  I have a new standard size (not elongated) Bemis/Mayfair white wood core toilet lid with chromed metal hinges.  The hinges were incompatible with this device (the lock would not allow proper attachment of the toilet seat to the bowl).  To resolve this, I drilled out both holes slightly on the Safety 1st Lock (from about 7/16" to 1/2").  Although the lock would now allow the lid to properly attach to the bowl, the lock would not allow the lid to be tilted up far enough to prevent it from falling down again when released (the body of the lock is too thick).  If the device is compatible to your toilet and seat, it will probably function well (I like the design).  However, I suspect that the lock is not compatible to many standard sized toilet seats... perhaps a little bit more refining of the design is necessary. Not one, but TWO design issues prevented this lock from working on my toilet.08 December 2009: I just attempted to install this lock in another bathroom of ours.  This toilet is also a standard size (the toilet manufacturer is different than the one mentioned above.  This toilet is also not elongated.) with the same new seat.  Once installed, as with the other toilet, the thickness of lock prevents the toilet seat from staying in the up position (It will fall down unless it is held in place).Because the lock is incompatible to two different toilets manufactured by different companies, I suspect that there are MANY more standard toilets that the lock will not work with.  Again, I like the design.  Please keep in mind before you purchase it that it may not work with your toilet.  I am hopeful that my review will also be seen by the manufacturer (and that they will redesign it so that it will be compatible with more toilets).
