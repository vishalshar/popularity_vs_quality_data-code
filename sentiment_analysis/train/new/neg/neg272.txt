The Boppy slipcovered pillow is something I have wanted for a very long time. I have dreamed of owning this, however never wanted to pay this much for a pillow. It is the PERFECT shape for how I love to sleep. however when I got It I was extremely disappointed. it has very light stuffing. so it is VERY thin. I like my pillows OVER stuffed and fluffy. I don't wantto have the pillow between my legs and feel like there is not a pillow there. That is the entire point of forking out all this cash on a pillow! to have a PILLOW! but that is also a personal preference so If you prefer your pillows thin. this is perfect!
