I thought they would be larger, since they are advertised as large. However, they are TINY! Compared to other brands (alva) for example, they are of inferior quality. The fabric is made of vinyl, not PUL and has a very thin polyurethane lining. The drawstring that closes the bag looks really cheap as well. I have not used them yet so this review is solely based on the look and feel of the bags, not their performance. They are "just okay" because for the price, of 6$ per bag they are much cheaper than other options on amazon. Right now, I'm just hoping they will hold up well. I plan to update this review once I know..
