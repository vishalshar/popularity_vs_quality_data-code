I've been using this product for about a year in my 18-month-old's bedroom. It would have gotten a much better review from me if it wasn't for one seriously major design flaw. It loses signal occasionally, which wouldn't be a big deal except there's no beep or alarm or anything to tell me that it has lost signal. The screen just goes white with a "no signal" symbol. And the signal doesn't come back unless I go into his room and turn the camera off and back on again. It has happened a few times now that everything is working fine when I go to bed, and I wake up to just a white screen. When I rush out to check on my son and find he is crying, I have no idea how long he has been crying. I will have to replace it because of this problem.
