This is a great lock, and actually works. It keeps the seat and the lid down and, unlike the other style of toilet lock that just clips the lid to the seat but still allows for a child to pick up both pieces together, this one actually does what it is supposed to do. That being said, when we first installed this we thought it seemed pretty flimsy and were expecting it to break. It did not, however, and we were pleasantly surprised by that.But... another thing that we noticed when it was installed is that it raised up the back of the seat a bit. This made the front and the back of the seat uneven relative to each other, which disrupted the seat's ability to distribute weight like it was designed to. We figured the plastic would "give" just enough to help even the load when the seat was in use, but it didn't, and we now have a broken toilet seat.I do not think that this is a problem that everbody would necessarily run into, but it is one that everybody should be aware of. We will be replacing our seat, and will not be putting this lock on the new one. I wish now that I had kept the receipt so that I could return it.
