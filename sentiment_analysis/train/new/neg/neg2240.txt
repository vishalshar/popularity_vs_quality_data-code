Haven't totally given up yet but this thing is awkward as heck to use! Feels like too much padded material may be the issue. The "Asy Wash Harness & Reins" is simpler and smaller. Fits into my bag whereas this baby Trooper is like folding a small baby blanket! I'm going to try it again in the Fall. May work better over a jacket/coat?One PRO = It does give you more control if you have a headstrong toddler who is determined to go their own way in a busy public place.
