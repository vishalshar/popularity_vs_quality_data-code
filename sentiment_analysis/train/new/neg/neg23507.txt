This item only lasted two months.  Even with us being as careful as we could not to fatigue it, it fatigued and snapped in half only a short two months after ordering it.  Does not last.  Not worth the money.  I had wondered if we had gotten a brittle or defective one, but after reading other reviews on Amazon, it sounds like others had this problem too.  It is just too fragile and not well-made.
