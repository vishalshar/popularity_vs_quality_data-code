Like the reviewer mentioned above, this chair in fact does not glide.  Thus the name "Rockabye Glider" is misleading. It does "rock" in a rocking chair-kind of way, but I was hoping for a gliding motion.  Other than that, I would say it is a rather comfortable rocking chair. My baby falls asleep in it - and so do I (if I am really tired).  If you are okay with just a rocking chair, then this is a good deal for you. But if you want a gliding motion, then you'd be disappointed with this chair.Update: I have had this rocking chair for over two years now.  My feelings about this chair has changed. I initially thought it was comfortable, but over time... I don't feel the same way anymore. It hurt my back. Whenever I sit in the chair, the chair "tips" forward instead of backwards -- unless I really lean backwards (the chair relies on your weight to tilt backwards/forwards, etc). My husband agrees with me -- he says he would not buy this chair in the future. We are looking to get replace it since we just had a second baby.
