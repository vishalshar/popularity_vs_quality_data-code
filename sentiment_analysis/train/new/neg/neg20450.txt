We've had this car seat for a number of months.  Even though my daughter is older, she is small, so we still have her rear facing.  She finds the seat comfortable enough and initially the only real issue we had was with how the seat belt gets twisted easily.  Now that she is older (22 months), though, she has figured out how to push the chest clasp down (pretty easy to do since the seat belt is kind of slick) and she can wriggle her arms out of the straps.  We have the belt as tight as it can go without restricting her breathing. So tight that it is actually difficult for us to get it buckled, and yet, she is still able to get out of it.  We do not have this issue with our other car seat made by a different company.  I would never recommend this seat to anyone; especially with older children who can manipulate the seat belt.  No matter how much less expensive it is, it saves no money if it is not safe and you have to get a different seat.
