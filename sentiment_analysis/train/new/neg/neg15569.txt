I already have an Avent Isis manual pump, which I LOVE. I used it to pump everyday when I returned to work, and I pumped for more than 6 months. I got more milk using it than the Medela Pump In Style and even the Medela Symphony.I bought the Isis iQ Uno, thinking that it would be just like the manual but my hand did not have to work so hard. Unfortunately, t doesn't pump nearly as effectively as the hand pump version. The suction is not as strong, and the memory feature does not pump exactly as you set it. The battery pack burned out after just 10 minutes with fresh batteries. If you accidentally break the suction, the memory feature reverts back to the default setting.The only reason I think you should buy this product is because it can convert completely into the hand pump version. The Uno comes with a "duck bill" valve instead of the "star" valve in the manual pump. The duck bill valve is better because it doesn't dislodge when the suction is strong. So I think this product is worth it just for the better valve and option of electric or manual. Now I just use this as a manual pump along with my original one.
