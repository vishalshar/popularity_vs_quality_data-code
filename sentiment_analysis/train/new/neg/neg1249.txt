I had really high hopes for this.  It works great around the house.  I use it with my 10 month old.  However taking it for outings isn't all that practical.  I still use the ergo.  It's bulky to take with when I know my daughter will be in and out of it.  The last thing I want is to lug it around when she is in the stroller or decides she wants to crawl around.  The ergo is perfect for that.  I haven't had her in it for longer than 30 minutes.
