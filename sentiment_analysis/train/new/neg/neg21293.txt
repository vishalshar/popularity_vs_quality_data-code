I love using these on my LO's bottom, because they are softer and more gentle on his skin than traditional disposable wipes. I use more of the tea tree oil, lavender, and Vitamin E than is suggested on the insert, but the cloths still smell slightly musty sometimes. I have to make sure to go through the whole box of cloths quite regularly and wash the pad at the bottom of the warmer (and change it out) quite often (more often than is recommended in the insert) in order to avoid mustiness. In addition, the side-seaming on the cloths fell apart with the first or second wash in a traditional washing machine, so I had to zig-zag the edges to prevent further fraying. They hold up better in my new front-loader washer (which doesn't have an agitator.) If I had more time, I would look for some organic terry cloth and just make my own, rather than purchasing these.
