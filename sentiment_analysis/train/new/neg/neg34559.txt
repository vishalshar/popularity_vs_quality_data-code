I purchased Thirsties fitted, Thirsties Duo, Flip, and Imagine diaper covers. My son wore the Blueberry Diaper covers from about 12 lbs to 25 lbs -- about a year. I never loved the way they fit my son. Even at 25 lbs, they seemed really bulky on him. I thought I would love the double gussets, but I didn't. It was kind of hard to get poop out of the area between the two gussets. They never really leaked or stained until they started to wear out, though. The Blueberry diaper covers were the first of the bunch to wear out. However, I have to admit that I was also really hard on the diapers. They got worn and washed 3 times a week (I didn't ever use bleach or put them in the dryer), so I guess I can't complain too much about a year of constant wear. But they got the same exact treatment as the other diaper brands, and the others are holding up better (some a lot better, some only a tiny bit better). As an FYI, the Imagine and Blueberry diaper covers are very similar in design and fit.
