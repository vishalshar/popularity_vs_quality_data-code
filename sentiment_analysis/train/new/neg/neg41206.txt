I purchased this bag because I'm cloth diapering my son, and I needed a bag to carry dirty diapers and clothes in. This bag seemed like a great choice because it matches my Skip Hop chevron diaper bag, and it's a good portable size. I was immediately disappointed that the color of the bag is actually different than that of the diaper bag, even though they seem like they should be matching. This was not a deal breaker, though, because the size of the bag is great for a day out with my cloth diapered son. However, even though I've always followed the care instructions, the waterproof lining of the bag began tearing from the top of the bag almost immediately (maybe after 2-3 weeks of moderate use). I've been using the bag for 6 months since it began to tear even though there have been occasional leaks, because I didn't want to spend money on another one, but I've reached the point that I can no longer pretend it works as a wet bag. I'm going to cut the rest of the lining out (it's basically shredded, and almost completely detached from the bag itself) and just use it as a dry bag. I'm very disappointed that I have to replace this bag, as I'm very happy with my Skip Hop diaper bag and hoped that this wet/dry bag would prove to be worth the money I spent on it. I wouldn't recommend this bag to anyone who needs to use it for holding wet items.
