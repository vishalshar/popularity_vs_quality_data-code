My husband and I have been looking for a "cool" daddy diaperbag and he really loved this one.  We tried it on in the store and were extremely upset because this diaper bag fit me, but didn't fit my husband.  My husband has very broad shoulders and a large chest (linebacker in football) and he laughed when he tried to put it on.  We did end up buying it for the neat pockets and the look, but now I have to go to the fabric store and buy a piece of fabric to extend the strap so it fits him better.  I don't reccomend this product for daddies with a bigger upper body or larger women.
