It took me a bit of digging to find a mirror that didn't need headrests and this was the most highly reviewed one that I found, but in the end it didn't work. I assumed that it was made tall enough to fit most seats/ceilings, but it wasn't for my car. When I came to write the review I looked at the specs again and the dimensions are listed, but in the scurry to get a mirror that worked for my baby (after shopping around town and failing to find one that worked with no head rests) I didn't read them nor go out to my car with a tape measure. I waited what seemed like a long delivery time for this mirror only to find out it's about 4 inches too short for me to use. (I have an old Volvo). But because I didn't want to order another mirror, and I shopped around so much for this one, I tried to rig it up with a towel shoved in the space between the stem and the ceiling, which I wouldn't advise if you don't want the thing falling on your baby.  My advise: take the time to measure your car and don't assume this mirror will work.
