I loved the "safety feature" these spoons offered by turning white when the baby food is too hot.  Like most moms, I microwave the baby's frozen foods to warm them up and want to be careful about getting things the right temperature.Unfortunately, the spoons stained after only one use with a colored food.  I used a spoon to serve my baby carrots -- plain mashed carrots -- and the spoon was permanently stained orange after that.  It doesn't detract from the spoons' heat safety feature, of course, but it does make the spoons look kind of cheap and gross.Also, it might be my imagination, but it seems like the spoons are not equally sensitive to heat.  Some of the spoons seemed to turn white when the food is just a little too warm and others seemed to turn white only when the food was scorching hot.  I still find myself touching each spoonful of food to my own lip before giving it to the baby.
