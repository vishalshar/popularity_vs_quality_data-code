i ordered two snack traps and two munchkin snack catchers.  the snack catchers win hands down - better quality, lid stay power, rubber base and rubber on the handles.  the snack traps work ok if you want to use them as cups, but the lids get a C-.  my 18 month old daughter had the lid off and cheerios were flying in less than 2 minutes.  she still has trouble getting the munchkin snack catcher lids off.  as for "gender neutral" selection on the snack trap?  pfffft.  a blue cup with a racecar on it ain't gender neutral.
