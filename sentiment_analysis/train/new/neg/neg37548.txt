I am going to make this a short review because there is not much to review about this productDoes it work?Yes it does fit and work as a protective sleeveIs it hard to use?No once you get it on you are good to go just don't expect to take it on and off easily repeated timesBIG QUESTION NOW (DO YOU NEED IT IS IT USEFUL)ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS SLEEVE DOES NOTHING1. the glass is thick and does not shatter easily you would have to purposefully and forcefully drop on tiles or concrete to break. so no way a drop from toddler to floor will break the glass. 2. what if the bottle too warm(if the bottle too hot that means the milk too hot which means you would not give to child either way so you have to wait until bottle cools off.This product does nothing and you are better off spending your money on diapers or a pair of shoes for your child.Final comment: Before buying this just think am I buying it because I am afraid glass too hot( if so remember if you can not hold glass with bear hands you can in way give that bottle to your baby. If you buying thinking glass going to break ( then just buy plastic bottles because lets say your toddler is even 4feet tall these glass bottles will not break for such a fall and a baby should have someone observing them at all times. so this may make some people feel more comfortable but unless its a free gift you cant return put the money somewhere else I'm just being honest.hope this is helpful if so click the helpful link at the bottom and let me know from one parent to another
