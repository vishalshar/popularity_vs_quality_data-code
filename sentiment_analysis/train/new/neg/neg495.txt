I love swaddling with the traditional Aden+Anais Muslin Blankets, but it was getting cumbersome during nighttime diaper changes because having to fully unwrap the swaddle woke my sleeping baby up every single time. I wanted something that would make the process easier, especially at night. After purchasing and LOVING a HALO SleepSack Swaddle from Target, I purchased this one online to supplement my collection. I didn't realize at the time that a difference in material would make a difference in function. The one I got at Target was micro-fleece and did a great job at holding my baby's arms in place. This material has a little more give and no matter how tightly I wrap it with his arms at his sides, my son manages to worm his hands out near his neck, resulting in waking himself up. This color (blue) and material was beautiful, but it unfortunately did not work as well for us as the micro fleece sleep sack did. If you don't have an overly strong baby, this should work perfectly for you!
