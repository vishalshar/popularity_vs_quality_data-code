Got this because my last two kids wore out the older version.  This version is much harder to latch the tray on the back leg bar.  Where the old one easily done one handed and just knew where to go, this one has to be done with two hands and some frustration.Also like the last one the locks are always getting locked.  Just look at the wheel locks it seems and the lock.  This makes it difficult to move baby and chair around the dinner table.Seat belt works great and clean up is easy.  never use the folding feeature.  Except a few occasions when we packed it up for a trip.  Worked great.
