I wish I could leave a better rating for this product.  The only reason for not leaving 5 stars is because the product is nearly impossible to wring out and smells of mildew after less than a handful of baths.  It just retains way too much water and takes a long time to dry out.  I'm scared to put it in the washing machine out of fear of breaking my machine due to the heaviness of the pillow when full; it would just throw my machine off balance and never complete the spin cycle.  Great while it lasted, but for the price paid, it should have lasted through more than 4 baths.
