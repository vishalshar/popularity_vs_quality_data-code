These bibs would be great if they were identical to the green sprouts bibs that are all solid colors.  These are about 1/2"-3/4" shorter (but not any less wide) so I imagine they'd still be too big for a 0-3mo and by the time the baby starts drooling a lot (5-6mo) then you are better off with the slightly longer length...Otherwise, even though they say lay flat to dry, since they appear to be the same a material as the solid set, they can be tumble dried on low.
