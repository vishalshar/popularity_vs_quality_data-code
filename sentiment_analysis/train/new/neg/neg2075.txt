For the money this is a great little toy piano for very young kids, but I was totally shocked to find out the BLACK KEYS DON'T WORK! They are just hard plastic and make no sound- are only for show. Total consternation. Who would dream of making an 8 key piano without the black keys making sound?  There are very few songs to be played without minor notes. My twins don't use this toy very much, and they love music.  How disappointing.
