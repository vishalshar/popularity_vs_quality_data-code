My MIL was very concerned about my little 6 month old in her Ergo, primarily due to the amount of time she spent chewing on the sides.  So when I saw these available, I bought them in a heartbeat...not thinking it all the way through.  For starters, since she's chewing on it non-stop, it's usually soggy.  Soaked.  For that reason alone I've been washing them frequently.  But heaven forbid if she's has a bite of ANYTHING, then they're instantly colored to match (or not - once dried!) her snack that day.  And more frequently than not, we're eating on the run, or she's begging for a small bite of whatever I've lucked into finding the time to eat.  These spend more time being washed and dried than they actually do on the Ergo with the 2 of us.  So yeah, another color, and I'd easily give 5 stars....but, white???
