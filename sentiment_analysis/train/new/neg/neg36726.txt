These pacifiers have a "straight nipple"  I thought my son would like them because he likes the Avent bottle nipple, but they aren't his favorite.  The plastic outside doesn't "cup the face" and I think comes out of his mouth easier than his other ones.  I also don't like that the attachable strap only fits this pacifier.  I got "the strap" as a shower gift and if I would have realized that I would have returned them before opening them. So I bought these pacifiers to go w/ the straps.  I didn't not have the problem w/ Amazon that the other reviewers did.  Maybe they fixed the issue.  I ordered the "rock n roll" pacifiers because I thought they were cute and they matched the straps that I had.  I got what I ordered.My son prefers the the NUK pacifier.  They curve upwards to the roof of the mouth, and he seems to like them better.
