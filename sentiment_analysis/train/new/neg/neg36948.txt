We have a few things from this collection and this is my least favorite. The Velcro does not hold what so ever and my son ends up ripping it off of his sippy cup and throws it anyways. If I hadn't thrown the packaging away I would have returned it. Save your money and go but the $3 one from walmart that actually grips the sippy cup. There are some major flaws in the design of this item.
