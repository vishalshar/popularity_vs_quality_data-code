I really wanted to love this pillow. I researched body pillows for days before finally deciding on this one when I was 4 months pregnant. I chose this one because I had tried another style with a prior pregnancy, one that was shaped like a J rather than a U, and found that I still had to prop pillows up behind me to support my back and make sure I didn't roll over in the middle of the night. I figured that this one would solve that problem so I gave it a shot in spite of the mixed reviews.First, I didn't have the same problem with the seam that everyone else did. I could see what they were referencing, and that is the fact that the inside seam, the one that runs along the inner curve of the U, seems to cut the corners and stretch into the inner opening where you lay. This was causing some reviewers to have discomfort because it cut into their shoulders when they laid their head at the top of the curve in the U and hugged one side of the body pillow because the fabric cuts across instead of following the curve of the pillow. Like I said, it never bothered me, but I also used a regular pillow on top of the body pillow at the curve where my head rested.The reason I rated this pillow the way I did, was that it was just too big and bulky. I thought it would cradle my aching body, instead it was just one more thing making me uncomfortable. And it is hot to sleep with... No good when you're pregnant!
