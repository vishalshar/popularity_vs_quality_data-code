This is a great seat when baby is learning to sit up. You can conveniently bring baby and set them with you without having to hold them constantly. It's especially great around 4 months when you start feeding them baby food with the tray. It snaps on and off easily, taking care not to pinch baby's legs in the process. The only downside is the leg holes are way too small. I couldn't use mine very long before my baby didn't fit in it and cried when I tried pushing his legs into it.
