I bought this to replace a Dr. Brown's bottle brush that the foam head had deteriorated on.  I liked that the foam was in the middle.  I find that the length is a little short as the suction cup remains attached, or you can unscrew it, but that is not practical every time you want to use it.  SO better with foam in the middle, worse for ease of use.
