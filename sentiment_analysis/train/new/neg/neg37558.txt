I got these for my wife because she lost the Medela nipple shield she got from the hospital. I got this one because of the reviews and the price. But for the cheap price, its exactly what you get, a cheap thing piece of silicone.My wife has tried to use it several times and it wont stay on her nipple. The slightest movement from our baby makes the nipple shield fold and bunch up. Which is dangerous because it can cause a sore on the nipple which can turn into an infection (we know thats what happend to my wife). THERE IS JUST NO STRUCTURE TO IT! It will actually fold in the babys mouth which causes confusion and discomfort for the baby.We finally just paid the money and bought another medela nipple shield which is the best. It has structure and the half moon shape allows skin contact with  the baby's mouth, which is important in breast feeding.
