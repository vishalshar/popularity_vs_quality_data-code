I am not the type to write reviews but I really did not like this stroller.  I would struggle quite a bit to unlatch the stroller. When I managed to get the stroller completely open (which I never could do with one hand) something would be hung up.  For example,  the foot rest would be sticking straight up and would not go back down except in an unfolded position.  I found this out after I had already put in the baby and had to take her out, hold her with one hand and try to unlatch the stroller. Another example would be the front swivel wheels would randomly lock up. Some other things I was disappointed in was that the canopy is attached and does not go down far enough to block the sun. The comfort shoulder pads on the 5 point harness strap would not stay in place and fine strings of the material from the straps were unraveling. The foam on the handle bar was already starting to split. The back wheel is very wide and was hard to get in and out of doors.  When I folded up the stroller I could not get it to click shut.  It was bulky, heavy and hard to navigate. I used this stroller maybe 6 times and kept thinking I just needed to keep giving it a try. I really looked long and hard for a stroller in my price range and thought I had found it. Maybe I just got the "lemon" stroller. But, I really cannot recomend this stroller. I returned the stroller and went with a Graco Quatro Tour and have been very happy.  The Graco maneuvers so much more smoother and I can even unlatch and  navigate with one hand. Luckily BRU has a great return policy.
