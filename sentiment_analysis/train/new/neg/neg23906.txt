I bought this booster seat about 7 months ago.  It has served us pretty well, we use it almost constantly and it's still fully functional.What I like about it:1. It's portable-I would rather my kiddo eat on this at restaurants than sit on those nasty sticky highchairs.  Plus she's little for her age so she fits in this thing better than restaurant highchairs.2. You can easily get the tray off and throw it in the dishwasher.  We have been using it as a plate because baby throws actual plates.  This way she gets to self feed and we don't get flying plates during dinner.3. Extremely easy to clean-we have a fabric covered high chair and this thing.  I can get this booster cleaned off in seconds whereas the highchair requires disassembly and a trip for the cover through the washer.4. It was CHEAP!  I really didn't want to spend 30 or 40 bucks on a booster seat and the price of this one was perfect.What I don't like:1. It was not immediately obvious how to put the safety straps on the thing.  The picture and crummy instructions were not helpful.2. You gotta WATCH little fingers with the swinging tray.  I accidentally smashed my baby's fingers when locking the tray one time.  I think this could happen with anything where you have a tray that you attach to something, but another time when the tray was not locked closed, baby started swinging it open and shut and smashed her other finger in the hinge where the tray is set into the seat.3. The back has popped off of it a couple of times.  Didn't hurt anybody but it was annoying.So you can see why I am on the fence.  We are using it daily and it's still fully functional, but we have had some incidences...I think it would be a good product for someone who is aware going in that they need to watch the fingers at all times!  The fact that baby got hurt in it and the crummy assembly instructions is why I am taking away two stars.
