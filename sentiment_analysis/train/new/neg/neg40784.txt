I like the fact that this cover opens in the middle so I can sneak a peak at the baby without flipping up the entire cover, but it never really fit that great on the car seat itself. It was also a bit of a pain to put it on and I don't know if it's just my husband and I not thinking ahead, but we would usually be trying to put it on after baby fell asleep so there was a good amount of quietly fumbling around with the cover. We probably woke him up 50% of the time.
