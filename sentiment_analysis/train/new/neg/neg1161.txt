I purchased these based on the great reviews, as well as reviews and ratings elsewhere. Everyone praised these bottles but I found them to be problematic.  First, the design of the bottle makes it prone to tipping; it doesn't stand as easily as others with a proper base.  When balancing a newborn and having to quickly put down the bottle, you want to be sure it'll stand upright.  This one failed. Second, while I didn't think it'd be that big of a deal, the silicone outside leads to lint and hairs being attracted and sticking to the outside of the bottle.  When you're feeding a newborn, the last thing you want to worry about is them swallowing lint too.  It just made the bottles seem unclean because of everything sticking to the bottle's outside. Not the redeeming side, the nipple design did seem to fit well in my little one's mouth, with minimal spit up/overflow.  However, she worked hard to get the milk out of it and tired herself out before drinking much.  Personally, this bottle just isn't for me - or my little one.
