We received this item and immediately noticed a couple of chipped off pieces on it. We returned it and ordered a new one thinking it might have happened during shipping. However, the new bassinet we received had the same exact defect. This is definitely a manufacture defect because there is no way this happened during shipping to the exact same spot on the bassinet. It looks like a piece of furniture in our room which is nice but it is a little big. We're keeping it though because it is a hassle to return it again.
