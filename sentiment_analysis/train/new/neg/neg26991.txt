I'm not an expert of child latches, but I find that these saftey latches work fairly well.  Also the fact that you can "disable" them is a nice feature when the kids are away at the grandparents'.I bought 3 packets of these latches, and installing them was fairly easy once you figure out the instructions + sticky guide. In the package there are these stick on templates which are confusing at first, but really smart. Basically you stick on a template to the cabinet frame where you can mark the holes for drilling. Then you remove the otherside of the doublesided sticky, and then you close the cabinet door on the sticky. Since it's doublesided, it sticks to the cabinet door, and the other side of the template shows you were to drill the holes on the cabinet door. I know ... confusing, but it works.I did have 2 gripes about the latches that made me give it 3 stars.1. There weren't enough screws. There should be 16 screws total, for the 8 pieces that come in the package. Out of the 3 packages, only 1 set had a full 16 screws. The others had 15 and 14 screws. It's extremely frustrating to have to stop in the middle and run out to the local HomeDepot to get 3 small wood screws. If they're going to mess up on the screw count, at least give me more ... not less :P2. The cabinet pre-drill template is slightly too wide. If you've done any kind of drilling in the past, you'll know that pilot holes are pretty important to get the width right. If you follow the templates, the holes will be too far apart. This can be extremely problematic, because if you try to put in the screws at an angle, you can easily splinter the wood and the screw may not take. This was what happened to me on my first go. Luckily I hadn't pre-drill all the holes first.This is definitely a solid latch to keep the kids out, but there are some definite product refinements that they need to address.
