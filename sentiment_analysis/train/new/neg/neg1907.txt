I like that it folds up for easy storage but it is not for newborns. Older babys that can hold there head and up. It is not heavy enough if you feel the sink or tub up enough to cover baby, 5-10 lb baby, Iit will start to float/slide. It has no good head support so baby is slumped over (chin to chest). Will put this away for now until my baby gets a little older but will definitely use in the future.
