I am not sure that this product is designed for continuous use.  I've seen a few reviews here from others that stated that it worked okay for a few months and then died.  This seems to have been my case as well.My miniFridge, while it was working, could cool to about 50 degrees.  But it would vary greatly depending on the temperature around it.  I would be careful keeping something perishable in here.  But for keeping soda cool on a trip(they include a car adapter), its probably fine, and takes up much less space than a packed ice chest.I had high hopes for it.  But for 3 months, it kept the contents mostly cool(50-60 deg), which I was only mildly happy with, and now its dead.
