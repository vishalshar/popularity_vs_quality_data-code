I have twins therefore I ordered two taggies monkeys for Christmas. While the monkeys are adorable, on one of the monkeys, at least two of the tags were coming off and the stitching was loose, which required that I hand sew 30% of the monkey to prevent it from falling apart before gifting it to my daughter.
