I bought this so that I could warm bottles for the baby and because it came recommended from another mom.  I like it at first, sure it was a pain to have to boil after each use to reset the heating mechanism but for the convenience, I didn't think it was too bad.  I've had it for a few months now and I really dislike it and am going to return it if I can.Problem #1--You need to plan to use it because it will take up to 20 min to warm a bottle fresh from the fridge and a little less if it's at room temp.  If you baby likes a warmer bottle, then it can take longer.  So, if you baby isn't on a really predictable schedule, this isn't the warmer for you.Problem #2--I packed it in the diaper bag and then went to go use it only to find out it had been activated.  The activation disk is very sensitive to being bumped or rubbed and will activate the heating crystals easily.  So I was scrambling to find away to heat the bottle at the mall with a screaming/hungry baby.  I ended up having to find a place to breastfeed which isn't easy if you have a baby that is a messy/distractable nurser, there is not a private enough place for these kiddos!Problem #2--It's heavy.  It will definitely add weight to your diaper bag that is noticeable and it's not petite in size.Problem #3--the annoying problem of boiling it after each use takes on a whole different level of annoying when you have to spend 20 min boiling it when you haven't even used it because it was activated by accident....stupid sensitive activation disk!Problem #4--Not a big deal, but if you have older children this becomes a cool toy.  They get amazed to see liquid turning to crystal and getting hot...this is just as annoying as it getting accidentally activated!So for the amount of times I have actually used the item (twice) v. the times I've had to boil this item to use it (at least 10!) I wouldn't buy this or recommend it to anyone.
