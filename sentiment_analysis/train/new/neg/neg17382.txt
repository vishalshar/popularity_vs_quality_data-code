We loved these at first but now DS figured out he can press the spout down on something to get it to spill all over.  Had he not figured that out I'd have rated them a 4 or 5, but that just tells me they need to perfect the concept of these cups so that even mischievous little ones can use them w/out making a huge mess.I think the cups probably would have been fantastic for my girls who never did half of the naughty/messy things my son does... we used various cups, sippies, snack cups, etc. for the girls & NEVER had an issue... along comes the boy & he manages to make the biggest mess possible... I am told it is a boy thing, which I tend to believe after never having these situations w/girls, but whatever the situation is I'd say these cups are not friendly for adventurous children who make messes any chance they get.Also, if the cup is tilted in any way where there is pressure on the spout (like in a diaper bag, left in a car seat, on furniture, etc.) they will also leak ALL OVER... & that has nothing to do w/being a mischief maker or not... it happens no matter who uses them.  The small slit openings inside the spout get ripped too after having pressure applied to them which eliminates the no leak factor, but that was not an issue until wild child started pressing the spout down, so perhaps under "normal" usage it wouldn't be an issue.That said, they really should be more durable being a sippy cup that will no doubt be chucked off the high chair tray 10 times per meal.  If using them as just drinking sippies & not for every meal, they should hold up better.  We pretty much use ours for water when we leave the house every 1-3 days & smoothies for breakfast (which must be given to DS in the highchair or else he presses the spout onto the couch & the nice green smoothie ends up on the couches too).Overall they are decent cups, but not THE cup IMO.  I still haven't found a favorite yet for a messy boy.
