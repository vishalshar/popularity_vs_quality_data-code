I'm not entirely sure what age group these blocks are for.  Most of the panels have colors that are too busy for a small baby and the teething parts are frustrating for a little one to figure out how to get in the mouth, but they're not exciting enough for an older baby.  They seem a little too hit-and-miss; while some panels are attractive to littler ones and other to almost-toddlers, there's not enough of either to hold interest in this toy for very long.These blocks have had their moments with my daughter throughout her development from 4 months to 14 months -- at the latter pointing to the panels and naming the things on them -- but they are too expensive for the limited overall use I experienced with them and my child especially in comparison to similar toys.If I could give this 2.5, I would.  I round down due to the cost and difficulty in cleaning the rope border on an allegedly "wipe clean" product.
