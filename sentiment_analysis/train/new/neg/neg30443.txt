The bunny did not have the same sound options (heartbeat, wave sounds, and whale songs) as advertised for all of  the other animals and no description was listed for the bunny so I mistakenly assumed it was the same.  It was not.. When I contacted the supplier to arrange an exchange I was told there would be additional shipping charges for the return of the purchased bunny and then again for purchasing the animal with the desired sound options.I instead bought another one of the animals with the sound option I wanted for my grandbaby at Nordstrom for  less money and put that sound box in the bunny.  I will save the other animal with the unwanted  giggly baby sounds as a present for an older child.
