this mattress cover has a net material for the sides that hug around the mattress.  the first one I bought got torn after being washed and wouldn't stay on the mattress anymore.  I thought it was a laundering mistake and bought a second one because I like soft cushion of the top part of this cover.  the second cover I bought made it to the second washings before the netting got torn.  this time I was careful washing it and it was in a brand new washer and dryer as well, so now I am convinced that it is not a laundering mistake and just a bad product.
