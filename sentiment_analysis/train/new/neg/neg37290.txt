Although we love our new Phil&Teds Navigator (v2), this cup holder is not useful to us.  It attached very easily to a knob on the side of the stroller, and is designed to be self-leveling by swinging in this knob as you walk.  Great idea in theory, but unless the cup or bottle we are using fits the angled sides of the cup holder absolutely perfectly the drink will tip back and forth repeatedly, never finding level.  I tried every water bottle we own, a few travel mugs, and a takeout coffee cup.  None fit in such a way as to level the cup holder.  My son lightly bumped into the stroller as he walked by, and my water bottle tumbled right out and knocked him on the shoulder.  Time to re-think this feature, Phil&Teds!
