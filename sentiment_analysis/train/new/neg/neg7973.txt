For the price, this really doesn't really offer a ton of value for us.  It doesn't seem to have much glide, so I'm actually taking a scissor to it since the fabric underneath seems to slightly block the glide.  Even though, Ive figured it may help a tiny bit, but still there just isn't that much glide to it that would seemingly better match the glide of the glider chair we have better.Honestly, if it wasn't such a hassle, we'd have returned it and spent our money elsewhere.  But, it's ok and at least the cat seems to love it, so I presume it will soon be hers to own haha.
