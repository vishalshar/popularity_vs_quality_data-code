I have a full line of Orbit Baby products including stroller, infant car seat and toddler car seat. This particular item is the one I regret the most that I purchased. Yes it is sturdy and most probably will protect your kid well in case of an accident. However, forget about all the flexibility and convenience they advertise. Unless you match the very narrow window of height, weight and child's appetite to sit rear-facing, you WON'T be able to use this thing on the fancy car seat base. That means no turning right or left to put your child in or remove your child out of it. Let alone being convenient, due to the height of the seat, you will hit your kid's head to the ceiling of the car every time you try putting him in or taking him/her off the seat. The fabric of the seat is also not good. Your kid will sweat like crazy after seating in this seat for a while. Don't even imagine that you will remove it from your car and place it on a stroller base. It is heavy like stone and you will not try it again after your first trial. the moment you are not able to use car seat base, say good bye to isofix connections. You have to fix it with a seat belt which is never as comfortable and easy as isofix. So overall, a terrible choice I made. The only reason I gave it 2 stars (rather than one) is the potential ability to do its job which is protecting the kid in case of an impact.
