We bought this for a summer vacation with our one-year-old. We knew we'd need the stroller in the airport and planned to gate check the umbrella stroller. I was primarily interested in something that would protect the stroller (which was brand new) from dirt, grease and potential rough handling. It did it's job, but it came back with some tears in it. (I have no idea what the baggage handlers did with it, because I'm not sure how you damage something in the few minutes it takes to get the bag w/stroller to the cargo area and and back up again. It only went through two gate checks, too.) I think the bag should be of a stronger material, but at least my stroller came back to me safe and sound.The carrying strap was great, and there is ample room in the bag (we have a First Years stroller that is a little bigger than very basic umbrella strollers). But I would buy something more durable if we flew more frequently or had a trip with layovers/connecting flights that necessitated more gate checking. As is, I will probably patch the holes or cover then with duck tape for our next trip--using the bag until it totally wears out.
