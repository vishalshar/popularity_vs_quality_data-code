This is the first electric swing out on the market so my expectations should not have been high but for $80 I thought it might be ok.  1. This swing should have been a manual swing because the 6 speeds claim is really just one speed - too fast and too high.  2. The reclining seat is also problematic - it doesn't recline nearly enough for an infant to use comfortably.  So the speed of the swing coupled with the seat angle would make my baby's head loll back and forth.  I still use this swing but without plugging it in.  I just push it gently myself and I keep a snuzzler headrest to keep my baby's head steady.  3. Finally, one minor complaint.  The animal mobile is cute - my baby loves to stare at the animals but she has to crane her head up to look at them.  The mobile arm is right above the seat and needs to be out further in front.  I tried to contact Amazon and Fisher Price regarding these issues but with little luck.  I hope the next generation of electric swings will consider these issues.
