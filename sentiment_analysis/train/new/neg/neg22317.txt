I could have purchased this product locally for $.99 instead of $8.99.  The description made it sound like it was the more old-fashioned tinsel with a heavier thread weight.  The picture makes it look like a super shiny, heavy-weight tinsel.  Instead, it is the run-of-the-mill, plastic-y tinsel that you can find at any big box store, except that it costs $9 dollars more per unit.  Please don't buy this product.  It is a total waste of your money.
