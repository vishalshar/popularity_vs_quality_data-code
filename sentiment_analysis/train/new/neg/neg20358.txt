My wife didn't like the Leachco Snoogle as much as some of the other reviews. There is a great review here about how hard the cover is to put on with the zipper. The one I got did NOT have a zipper. Instead it is two cases and you wiggle it on from either end and it overlaps in the middle. This is probably a better design than a long zipper which I can CERTAINLY see being a pain. That said it is still kind of a pain to put on.
