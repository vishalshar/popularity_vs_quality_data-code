I was disappointed only in that it uses a snap on both ends to secure the toy.  It works well with objects having a handle or a narrow spot that is surrounded by larger areas, but it won't work with everything.  It would help if one end were adjustable (such as velcro) so that it could be more snugly sized to the object being secured.
