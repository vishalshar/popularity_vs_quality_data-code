This mat is extremely small. To my own fault, I did not read the product dimensions before purchasing. I purchased it for my infant son to safely sit on while taking baths. My son barely fits on top of this mat, rendering it nearly useless in the bathtub. I cannot return this product so I will be keeping it for travel and will be purchasing another, larger mat for home.
