I have a black coffee table from ikea and when my now 11 month old son started to walk against it, it was time to baby proof. This color matched really well and I've actually received comments on how nice the table looks. The padding is sufficient that if he falls near a corner or side, he is not going to get cut. The installation tape it comes with has worked well. I dusted with Pledge then let the table dry before applying. So far, only one corner has come off and that is my fault for not using the tape to the edge of the whole corner. It was easy enough to remedy. The only down side for me on this product, is I had to buy two because it did not go the whole way around my table. Make sure and measure. Overall, better than anything I've found at Baby's R US or Target even after four months of use.
