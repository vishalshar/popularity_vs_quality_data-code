NOT RECOMMENDED by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.Upon opening the box I discovered some of the stitching on the seat had already come undone and a plastic piece was coming out.  I thought I could deal with that so I went ahead and tried to install the seat in my Chevy Uplander.  I had to stack three towels on the seat just to get the right angle, and the way that the latch belt works it is impossible to pull the seat tight.  I am not a weak person and even when I tried my hardest to pull the seat tight there is still tons of room for the seat to rock side to side and it just is not secure at all.  I have used a Britax Roundabout for my 2.5 yr old since he was born and it has been great and always feels secure.  I thought I got a great deal for this one at Costco but it really is a piece of garbage.  I'll be taking it back for sure.
