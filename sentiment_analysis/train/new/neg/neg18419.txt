I really wanted to like this thing. I'm always looking for ways to save space in my diaper bag so I can use my smaller bags. First of all, I think its way to small. It should be bigger all the way around. Second, as another person mentioned, I cannot pull a wipe out. I use huggies wipes which are pretty thick. The wipes tear as I'm pulling them out. I even tried it with no diapers at all in the bag and just 3 wiped and they still tore. As great of an idea it is it does not work. You need two hands to get a wipe out then it tears. Useless. save your money and buy a juju bequick. its the perfect size.
