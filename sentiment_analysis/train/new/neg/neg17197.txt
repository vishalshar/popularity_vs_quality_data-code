First off, I must introduce myself as the male of the household and I am writing this review from the perspective of one who disposes of the full bags and also one who uses it when I change my daughter's diapers.  I have been using the Diaper Decor for the last 20+ months.When my daughter was still pooping "baby poop" there really was no problem because baby poop doesn't smell too bad.  However, once she graduated to "normal poop" the smell has become absolutely unbearable!  This has literally made me label the Diaper Decor as the absolute worst invention ever!  The intent of the Decor is very good and makes absolute sense.  However, actual day to day usage builds up a nasty odor as you can imagine.  Worst yet, the built-in fragrance of the bags is supposed to neutralize the poopy smell, but somehow chemically the 2 odors together have literally joined forces into a diabolical, disgusting Smell.  I exaggerate not!  Therefore, I have learned to not change out the bags in the house because the Smell lingers in the air and makes anyone near it gag.  I now bring the Decor outside of the house to change so I can have the advantage of fresh air to blow away the Smell.  Unfortunately, this is still not too effective as I often feel like I can cut the thick disgusting Smell with a knife.  I kid you not, the Smell manages to get stuck in my nose hairs, so that I must blow my nose after changing the Decor to completely eliminate It from my system.I highly recommend that if you can, just use a plain garbage can with a drawstring garbage bag with a cover and leave it outside the house as your diaper disposal.  I have seriously done this last summer and have not gagged while changing it out, surprisingly.  The only reason why I'm still using the Decor is because my wife unknowingly (or knowingly) bought a new box of Decor bags and insists on using it.  Maybe all I have to do is let her change it once in awhile so she knows what kind of torture it is to change the Decor.
