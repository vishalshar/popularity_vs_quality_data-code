This bag is a nightmare. I ended up just using the free one they give to you in the hospital after your child is born. This bad is big with small storage capacity, the straps consistantly fall of your shoulder which is annoying when you have an infant seat you are trying to carry. I tried using if for the first couple of weeks and wish I kept the receipt to return it. Still haven't bought a replacement mainly because I haven't looked for one since the free one is working just fine for not having to carry along too many items. Don't waste you money.
