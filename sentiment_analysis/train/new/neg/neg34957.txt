I read the mixed reviews before I bought this thing and chose to believe (because of the few good reviews) that the manufacturer had fixed the issue that caused water to get inside the battery compartment. I was wrong. Immediately upon receiving the item I could see that the piece of plastic that forms the cover to the battery compartment is actually not even the same shape as the opening for the compartment (see photo). I'm no engineer, but that seems like a poor design. After using the thermometer normally (no submerging, just setting it in the bath water) 4 times, the display ceased to function. Yes, it's not particularly expensive, but I still feel annoyed that I spent any money at all on such a poorly made piece of junk.
