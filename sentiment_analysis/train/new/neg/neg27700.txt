I was beyond thrilled when i received this bed set.  It so plush and sweet for my little one, but after one wash the comforter fabric became stiff in one area and the dots all faded out - I don't know what happened, i followed instructions as directed, and it just doesn't look the same.  I'm so sad cause i really loved it - but it didn't hold up and that is after only one wash.
