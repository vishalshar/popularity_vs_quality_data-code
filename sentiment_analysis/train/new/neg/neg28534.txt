We love how easy these are to use and how wonderful they work. They haven't stained or leaked and helped us switch from disposables to cloth alot easier. Even my husband loves them. We just ordered more but of a different design to help build our stash.Update: I ordered a second set of these diapers and received the wrong designs. I tried being polite to the company by just asking if i could send them back and get the correct ones. Well the company not only wouldn't exchange them for the ones i ordered but then tried to make me look like a fool by saying they are the ones i ordered and even cjanging the photo on their amazon acct. Luckily i saved a photo of the designs because i wanted to show my husband. So I will be going through amazons a-z guarantee but beware customer service is not go with this company.
