IMPORTANT NOTE: The instructions are incorrect.  If you follow them step-by-step and put the D1 piece on the left and D2 piece on the right during steps 1-4, you're going to have to take the whole thing apart and start over when you get to step 7 and realize the vertical anchor holes for the railings are on the opposite side of where you need them to be.  Or maybe someone just put the stickers on the wrong pieces in my set--would fit with the overall attention to detail I bring up in my review.  In any case, look carefully where the anchor holes are on D1 and D2 in step 1 and ensure they're facing up before proceeding.  Onto the review...You get what you pay for.  It's cheap wood that doesn't fit together at all the junctions, only two dowels on each side for guiding things in place, a screw or two hadn't been machined correctly and couldn't be driven in with the supplied Allen wrench (seems everything is put together with those stupid little things these days) and those same metal screws drive right into the wood in a few places with no buffering anywhere.That said, it seems sturdy enough and looks nice when all is said and done.  A standard children's mattress wedges in perfectly with no sliding around.  My kid really liked it and climbed right in to go to bed the first night I put it together, and that's what counts.
