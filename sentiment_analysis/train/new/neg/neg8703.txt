We purchased this wet/dry bag to hold bathing suits after swim practice. I was excited to have an exterior pocket that would hold dry clothing while still containing the wet garments. Unfortunately, after one use, I could tell this was not our solution. Even though I had squeezed as much water as I could out of the suits, I ended up with the clothes in the "dry" pouch wet as well as my car seat. I will be using a zip loc bag until I'm able to order a different brand of dry bag. This might be good for soiled diapers, but nothing more than that.
