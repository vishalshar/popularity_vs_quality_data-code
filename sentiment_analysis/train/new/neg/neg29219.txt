I got one with a relatively low price 40usd... thats the 3 stars reason... quality is poor. Is nothing that I thing can last more than 2 months. Looks and feels cheap and weak, like when you buy a recognized brand cheap copy.Space is not enough for a baby that already starts with solids. My daugther now is just breastfedding so I don't need bottles or formula but if needed I will needed another backpack. I seriusly thinking in get a regular hiking backpack (more resistant, better quality, more compartiments) than something like this. If you will used just to move your stuff from your car to your house is ok but if you are planning go to disneyland (or someplace that requires an allday long walks like a zoo) is not the option.I can't recomend the product. Spae is an issue but quality is the key factor. This can not survive 6 months of regular use (normal use, not abuse).
