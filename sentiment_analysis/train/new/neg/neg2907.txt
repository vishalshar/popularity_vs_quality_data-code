Bought this after spending hours searching on the internet for a white crib. This isfor my grandson nursery I made for him in my home .The crib was not what I expected. Hard to put together,looked "cheap", the mattress is very loweven on the highest setting and I would have sent it back but I really needed itASAP so I kept it.I had bought another one for my daughters home from DaVinci and there is such a difference in thequality and it has a higher setting for the mattress. I should have stuck with DaVinci but I wantedto save a few dollarsI got what I payed for.
