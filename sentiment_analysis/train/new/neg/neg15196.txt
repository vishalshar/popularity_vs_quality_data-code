After a play date at a friends house I came home and ordered these cups immediately. They are smaller and easy to hold for a 3 yr old. They also are a thicker plastic so the edge isn't as sharp as the larger bigger character cups you tend to find. My friend found these at Walmart for a better price, but I was content to order as an add on item and skip testing my need for anger management classes, which is unavoidable at our local Wally World. My only gripe is that they are supposed to be dishwasher safe and I suppose they are. However, a few were wedged in the dishwasher and between the heat and water are now more of an oval shape opening, than a circle. We are still using them, and they have been fine. A good buy for the little person in your life.
