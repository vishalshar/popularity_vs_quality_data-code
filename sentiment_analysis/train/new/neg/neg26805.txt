it's cute and my under 2 yo loves it because she's in a cow phase.  we saw it at a store (thought it was awesome), but it was out of stock there, so bought it on amazon.  it's incredibly difficult to inflate it "just right".  the way the air hole is designed is like a cheap air mattress/raft (you take your finger off and the air whooshes out...no backstop mechanism), so you basically have to overfill it in order to get the desired firmness because air will leak before you can stick the plug in.  pumping it up with a manual/hand/bike pump is nearly impossible to get the right firmness (if you don't, then it's too soft and collapses easily, which is dangerous).  i was about to return it, when i saw that other reviews suggested going to a gas station.  so we took it to a gas station pump as other reviews suggested.  that worked.  overall the air hole should be better designed with an air stop, and instructions on best ways to pump would have been helpful.
