I had high hopes for these hampers.  I thought it would become our organizational dream come true.  They are somewhat attractive and light weight.  However, the first time I knocked it over, the side broke open on the edge of my son's bed.  When he went to pick it up, he ended up putting a hole in the opposite side.So if you're super gentle on this item or don't use it often, it's nice enough looking.  If you have kids or an overly zealous mother who likes to slam dunk dirty garments into it, you'd best keep looking something sturdier.  I bought 2 of them in white and so far the second one is holding strong with only minimal damage.
