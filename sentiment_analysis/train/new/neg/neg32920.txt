I decided to try this mobile because it seemed to get some positive reviews.  What I didn't pay enough attention to was the few complaints about how loud the motor is!  When we first attached it to the crib it sounded like a small tractor but now seems to be more broken in and is not nearly as distracting. The music is nice and does help to disguise the motor.  Our baby really enjoys the lights and like other reviews mention they can pretty much be seen all day as long as the room isn't too bright.  She can look at the mobile for at least the 10 minutes it runs and sometimes longer if we restart it. Overall, we decided to live with the noisy motor because she likes it and with the music the motor isn't really THAT loud.
