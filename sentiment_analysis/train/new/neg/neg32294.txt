I have several of these, as my baby is a "happy spitter" with frequent spit up episodes. We go through 6-10 bibs a day.  We own the first generation of these, where the Velcro was abrasive,they stayed on better but left friction marks on my babies neck, then we bought these, the second generation and the Velcro is much softer but stops sticking /working after a few washes, now I can't keep the bibs on her during the feeds, she's just tugs them off at 5 months.Bottom line, I would buys dozens of these if they snapped. The thick rim around neck is super helpful in keeping sneaky spit up off the clothes, but with the Velcro issues, they are worthless. I will be buy the Aden and anis snap bibs instead going forward.
