I don't really like this high chair because the holes are small, the belt isn't really adjustable and my baby was able to just crawl out of the seat so easily it's dangerous. I thought I would just need something like this to take around and use at home but it didn't work out. I needed to buy another high chair and I don't know what I will do with this one.  I feel I paid way too much for a chair like this. I expected a lot more out of it. I have a big baby and he's really strong so he can easily just crawl out and fall on the floor.
