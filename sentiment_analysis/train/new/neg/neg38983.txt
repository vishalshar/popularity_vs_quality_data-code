I bought this pump to have a 2nd one at work. This pump was initially ok, but shortly thereafter it started misfiring and switching the pumping rhythm all by itself. I dealt with this for a few days until I could contact Philips Avent, who of course can do nothing about it. They tried to have me reset the pump handle, but it turns out that wasn't the problem, but the pump itself. After a few weeks, I heard an odd noise while pumping and the pump died. Some part came loose on the inside because I could hear it moving as I shook the pump. At least it was my 2nd pump. The 1st one was bought brand new and still works great on the 2nd child.
