We got this camera in addition to our motion sensor monitor. The motion sensor we initially used when our child was a baby. Now that we have an active toddler the camera helps us to monitor her activity just before she falls asleep at night and during her nap.We don't keep it on all the time. I don't feel the need to watch her sleep through the night - just make sure she falls asleep ok and amuse myself (and my husband) with her bedtime play.Having said that, the battery life is a bit dismal if you want to keep the video and sound on full time. I think I gave it a full test run and it lasted maybe 2 hours.It would get 5 starts if it had a sensitivity trigger like our motion sensor monitor which we still rely on more heavily.
