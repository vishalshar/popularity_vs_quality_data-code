Complete junk. This was a gift and im actually ashamed to even give it. The pictures make it look nice and sturdy. But in reality its very flimsy and the padding is a poor quality to lay a baby in. This will be donated to goodwill in the morning. I am appalled that Amazon would sell suck junk. By the way i only put one star because it wouldnt let us put zero.
