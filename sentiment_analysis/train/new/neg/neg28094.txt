This teether was the right shape so I took a chance and purchased it. My son likes it well enough but it's nothing special for the high price point. A good point about this teether is that it is just the right size for smaller mouths (babies under 10 months), and lightweight as well. The criss-cross style prevents the teether from going too far into baby's mouth. Again, I think the teether is okay but I would not purchase it again at this price point.
