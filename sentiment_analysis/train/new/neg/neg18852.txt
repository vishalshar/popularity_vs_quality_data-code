These did help ease the discomfort of my original trial at breastfeeding.  However if you have a fuller breast - these may be too small for you.  Also I would heat as directed - but the "pillows" would not stay very warm for long - and if you overheat them you can smell the inside cooking.  I also used these after putting them in the freezer - very nice - not too cold very comfortable and did not need an extra layer in-between the product and my skin.  Would recommend these for chilling purposes - but would stick with a heating pad for times when heat would be best.
