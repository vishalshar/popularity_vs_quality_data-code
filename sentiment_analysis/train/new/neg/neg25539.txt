PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS ITEM---IT ALMOST CUT OFF MY 2 YEAR-OLD'S FINGER.  I had read reviews that the potty hinge would buckle occasionally and didn't think much of it.  "Those moms must have been careless..." I thought.  Well it happened to me--- and I was sitting with my daughter with my hands holder her body.  Her two hands were grabbing both sides of the seat, but there is a plastic hingle where the seat legs fold out.  These are not stable.  She moved and went off-balance and the seat leg folded under her cutting the meaty part of her forefinger.  Fortunately it cut right where the meatiest part is and it was a flap.  We saw a nurse right away (we were at WDW) and she said it was not stitchable -- came home and went to the Ped who told us we were lucky she didn't amputate her finger.  PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS ITEM.  I wrote an email to the company and they never wrote back.
