The description of the item is not up to date.  I didnt realize it has a foam mattress covered in non-breathable vinyl and made of plastic everywhere. Overall it is a good product, fits in a queen size bed with 2 adults and keeps baby safe in the bed but like another reviewer said, we went to a lot of trouble to find chemical free crib/mettress for our son so it doesnt make sense to let him sleep in this for several months. I will return the item!
