I love the fit on these and they are very cute, but I dislike how the fleece lining has held up.  It's pretty disappointing in that regard, actually.  They start out nice and soft but within a few washes the lining feels rough and crumbly (it is pilling up.)  There really are better options for a pocket diaper with a stay-dry feeling.
