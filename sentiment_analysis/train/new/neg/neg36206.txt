To understand why I hate this monitor, you have to understand how digital works.  With digital, the signal quality is perfectly clear until the signal reaches a certain level of weakness, at which point you receive no signal at all.  Unfortunately, the signal often gets too weak at a distance of only 25 feet.  We sleep in the room adjacent to our baby's room, and the signal still cuts out an average of once every hour, lasting for several minutes at a time.  When the signal is insufficient, the receiver beeps loudly and repeatedly.  So, we are awakened about once an hour to an angry baby monitor.  As new parents, we are already sleep-deprived, and we feel like this monitor hurts more than it helps.Also, after six months, the life of the battery after being fully charged has dropped to less than two minutes before it dies.  Thus, we cannot move this receiver from room to room without transporting the charging station and plugging it in wherever we go.  It might as well have no battery at all.My advice: get an analog (non-digital) baby monitor with a reputation for good batteries.  Your signal will be slightly fuzzier, but you won't experience the signal "total shut-down" that we have experienced with this monitor.
