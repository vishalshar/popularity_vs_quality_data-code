I purchased these along with the front rail cover.  The front one actually was too small to fit on the front of our crib, and it seems strange that the side ones would be larger than the front since most cribs seem to have a wider fancier rail in the front.  I used these side rails on the front of the crib and they just barely made it to the bottom of the rail (2 of them covered it horizontally).  The velcro that wraps around is helpful (unfortunately the "front" rail covers don't have this so they won't stay on... ??) although my baby was able to rip one of them off and I had to sew it back on.  The velcro that runs horizontally doesn't stay attached (it falls just barely under the rail and there isn't much space for it to close between the wide posts).  I'm planning to sew on a nice fabric cover since the cotton is plain and not very high-quality, and some additional velcro strips to wrap around to hold it on in the center.  Disappointed at the cost of the side and front together, since I am having to do a lot of manual work to make these fit.  If I had it to do over I'd probably just get something custom-made on Etsy for around the same cost without all my own manual labor.  But it is a good start and I was able to prevent baby from chewing the rails in the meantime until I can rig up something a bit better and more aesthetically pleasing.
