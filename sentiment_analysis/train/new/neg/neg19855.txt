My 1 yo daughter had a fever few days ago. Before that, when the child was healthy, the readings range from 97.6 to 99 - an acceptable range. But then, in the middle of the night, the child was very hot and I was getting readings ranging from 100 to 104. I did not know what to do - go back to bed or take her to emergency. Yes, I was very careful to position the thermometer 1.5 inches and point to the center of the forehead and I was trying it many times but getting a different reading every time. I am very frustrated with this purchase and throwing it away as it let me down when I needed it the most. I am buying a Braun Ear thermometer that served me great for 5 years before.Dec 03, 2012 update: Added a star for a very nice customer support reply - offered a replacement at no charge. I will test to see if a new unit is any better.
