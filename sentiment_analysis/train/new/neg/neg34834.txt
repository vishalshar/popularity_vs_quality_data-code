I bought this for when my grandchildren come to visit.  It does not adhere to the high chair nor the table.  The grandchildren can readily pull them up without exerting even the slightest pressure.  This was a very disappointing product and should not be advertised as a 'suction plate'  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SUCTION TO KEEP IT ADHERED TO THE HIGH CHAIR OR TABLE.  We've tried putting some moisture on the ring, but that didn't help either.  Another drawback is that the suction ring must be removed from the plat and hand-washed.
