The thermometer is a great idea and all, but unless my daughter actually has a temperature of 93.4, and I have one of 97.3 I wouldn't recommend buying this thermometer. I even ran it under hot water because normal thermometers would max out, this one told me the scalding hot water was 98 degrees.... Doubtful
