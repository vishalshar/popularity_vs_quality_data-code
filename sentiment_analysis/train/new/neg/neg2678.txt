I love these spoons (and forks). They are much more usable than lots of kid utensils. The spoon is big enough to be easily functional, the handle is short and fat and easy to hold. But beware - Assorted colors means YOU WILL NOT GET THE COLOR YOU CHOOSE. My daughter loves blue and reeeeeeeally wanted blue, so I ordered the blue spoons (we already have the green/yellow ones but needed extra spoons). Pink showed up. She wanted to use them now (of course) so we're going to keep them but she keeps asking why they are not blue. Boooooo Amazon. Love the product though.
