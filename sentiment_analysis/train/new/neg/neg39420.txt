Gerber cups are my favorite.  For some reason, it has been very difficult to find them at the stores lately.  I was very glad to see Amazon has them.  However, what I received was not what I thought I bought!  The picture shows 2 sippy cups with handles.  What I received had no handles.Here's the worse part - the lid where the valve fits in has already cracked with only a few uses.  The problem is the valve fits in tightly (which is normally a good thing so there's no leakage).  But the tight fit feels like it doesn't fit right.  I think it cracked from being pushed too far in.  But how are you supposed to know how far to push in??Based on my experience, the straight spout Gerber/Nuk cups aren't as good as the angled spout ones.
