This is a well-made product, but make sure you pay attention to the different positions. Unlike Ergobaby's more recent carriers, you can't wear the baby facing forward in this one. As you know if your baby is six months or older, babies want to see the world at a certain point, and the only option for that with this one is to wear the baby at the hip, which isn't all that comfortable and isn't full view. If you're already springing for an Ergo, I'd pay a little more and get one with all the positions.
