I bought the Britax Companion after I was convinced my son hated his peg perego.  I, too, was impressed with the safety ratings, and I thought compared to my peg, it's not as heavy or bulky.Pros-Very safe, like the anti rebound bar, sturdy, good coverage from canopy, easier to carry then my peg, fits into pliko p3 and baby trend snap and go, can wash cover and order covers from Britax direct (to solve heat issue).Cons-Not easy to get in and out of base (be careful that it is locked, have to check and check), hard to get baby in and out of (the TSIP is not secured by velcro or anything and tends to flop around), the straps to not stay aside to place baby in seat, harness does not click to let one know it is secure, have to feed straps through the back in order to adjust height (this is just a slide up and down feature in my peg), carrier handle also difficult and noisy (wakes sleeping baby). Also, the TSIP seems like it over-confines my baby (3 mos) even completely deflated. I want to remove it, but then I'm removing the SIP.  Not a worry in the peg since the SIP is built in and adjusts with the seat belt positioning.All in all, I like the Britax line and will likely return to it for the next seat up (decathlon or marathon) but I think this seat has too many quirks as pp said.  Also, my son no longer constantly screams in his peg, so it must have be a developmental thing.
