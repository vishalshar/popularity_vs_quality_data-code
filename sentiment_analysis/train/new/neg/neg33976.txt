I did not care for this product. I bought these cups because I had an issue with leaking through my nursing pads. The cups are very hard so it is impractical to use in a public setting. They also leaked quite a bit which, in my mind, defeated the purpose of wearing them. There was also an issue with opening the cups. When I went to open them milk would spill out make a mess. All in all, I would not recommend this product to others.
