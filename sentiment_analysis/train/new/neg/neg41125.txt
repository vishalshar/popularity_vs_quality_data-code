It's alright, but baby was never too crazy about this one. She started out in a much plainer bouncer with a couple of rattle toys dangling, and she prefers that one over this anyway. Perhaps if she had this one first it would be a different story. But don't buy this in the hopes it's some kind of magic seat that will occupy baby as long as you need it to.Also the vibrate feature was messed up on my model, it sounded like a lawn mower with something loose rattling around in there, so we never used that. Everything else worked great though. As for the reviews saying the parrot/monkey hangs too low, they are supposed to so that baby can hit them with their legs and set the music/lights off. They were never low enough that they bothered my chunky-legged babe.All in all a nice bouncer, but a cheaper one will probably do just as good a job. Just my experience though.
