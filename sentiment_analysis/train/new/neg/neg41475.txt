First of all, this item looks really easy to fold.  However, you have to take the stroller essentially apart to fold it (remove the seat first, then fold).  Also, the weight was calculated without all of the attachments so, with the seat and the frame together, it is a lot heavier than advertised.When we went to return it to Baby Supermarket, they charged us an extra $50.  So, we paid $50 for something we didn't even want as it was labeled incorrectly.  The folks at BabySupermarket were very rude and basically blamed Amazon for 'poor advertising'.  When we contacted Amazon, they said they would investigate and we never heard back from them.Bottom line, great concept though needs a lot of work first.  And, DON'T buy from Baby Supermarket!
