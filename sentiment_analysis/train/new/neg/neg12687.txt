I knew this assembly was going to be fun when I counted out the 154 fasteners of various types and sizes.  An then when I saw that the "multi-language" instructions were just pictures - no words, I definetly had some concerns.  But I have put together lots of furniture over the years.  I am an engineer with 40 years experience, a parent (2 children) and grandparent (3 grandchildren).  So in a little under 2 hours, I had the chest of drawers successfully assembled.  While the wood is particle board, the laminate is a nice color and the finished product is good.  The major reason I rated this a 3 is the fastener system used was of fairly low quality - compared to, for example, the baby changing table I also just bought and assembled: Badger Basket Cherry Sleigh Style Baby Changing TableTo help others who tackle this item, here are some thoughts:1) the A & B fasteners should be connected fairly tightly to insure they do not come loose.  But not too tight or the wood might split.2) Side panels 1 and 5 did not have their numbers on the part.  Instead "Side panel Left" (part #1) had numbers 2 and 3 on it.  The 2 and 3 turn out to be the numbers of parts that connect to this left side panel.  Similarly for "Side panel right" (part #5) have numbers 6 and 7 on it.3) Step 15 incorrectly references piece 6.  It should be part 9 - as that is the part with the groove for the rear panel.4) Be carefully attaching the drawer knobs.  The wood is not too strong so it is easy to overtighten.  I ended up using a dab of wood glue to help hold the knobs firmly in place.
