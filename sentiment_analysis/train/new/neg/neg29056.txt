I am completely irritated.  The package came missing 2 washers (which I was willing to ignore and find at a local shop - because hey this stuff happens).  In addition, I got the whole set un-packed and ready to assemble and when I took out the last part - the top to the table - one of the mounting sides (which attaches to the legs - which comes usually assembled to the table) totally popped off and the there were two bent screws floating separate in the box - which means - whoever packed this box knew the table was defective and left the screws not attached.  The screws didn't just come off during shipping!?!?.  Now I am stuck looking for two screws - two washers - or the choice of having to repack the table back into the box - which is difficult - seeing that I am not sure I can get it all back inside the way it was sent to me.  This is completely frustrating and unnecessary - a waste of my time - your time and shipping charges.  What can you do to help this situation?
