The description says its a kids medium size costume…and also when clicked on the kids size link…it says the followingM 8 (waist)23-23.5 (height)52-53which means size medium is size 8but then I receive toddler size 4T by mail.I call up the customer service the lady who answered the phone has no clue what to say except…"pls follow the return policy" and kept cutting the phone call.Now I have to go thru all the trouble of returning by paying from my own pocket. again not sure if I will ever get a refund.
