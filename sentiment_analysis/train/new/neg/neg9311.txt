This tray is obnoxious to use! The Bumbo was not a winner for our son, but that is for a different review. You finally wrangle your little one into the seat and strap them in, then you have to attach the tray. Seems easy, right? Wrong!You have to get the bit that goes between their legs into a hard plastic cup underneath the tray, all while avoiding little fingers that are not well controlled at the stage you use this for. Then, you have to tilt the seat back without dislodging the tray from the leg piece, to shove the bottom lip over the bottom of the seat. All this, again while avoiding fingers. Easy in theory except you are using one hand to tilt the seat back and the other to maneuver the tray. There is no hand left to move little fingers from being pinched. I found this to be an incredible hassle. If you need a tray for something, just use a high chair. This is a complete waste of time and money, especially when it only fits your baby for such a short time. I don't really see the purpose of it.
