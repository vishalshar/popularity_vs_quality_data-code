These are pretty basic - fork, knife, spoon. My problem with "preschool" cutlery is that the forks are never sharp enough. That sounds bizarre that I would want something sharp, but these barely pick things up. We end up using the spoon more than the fork because it has a nice oval surface and it's bigger than toddler utensils. The fork, however, needs a lot of force to poke something and pick it up.
