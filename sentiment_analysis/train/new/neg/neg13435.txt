I'm surprised this toy arrived in such bad shape, since my son loves the O Ball cars we bought him. This came wrapped in cheap plastic and the ball had actually melted into the plastic! That can't be good, considering this is a baby toy that is supposed to get chewed on. Maybe something happened at the factory where the plastic hadn't hardened all the way before the plastic wrapping was attached. Bad batch perhaps? Made me feel like it was either a knockoff or had melted on the way in the box..either way. Gross.
