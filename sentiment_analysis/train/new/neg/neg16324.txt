Unfortunately did NOT neither worked on my 4"x 4" shiny white plain (no texture) porcelain tiles in one bathroom.  And only the Shower Arm worked on the 8"x 8" slightly textured tiles of the other bathroom, probably because the shower head is not that heavy.  (The Shower Handle would fall off if you put weight on it.)  Otherwise seems solidly built.
