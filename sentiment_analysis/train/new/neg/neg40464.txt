I have generally liked using this wet bag for dirty cloth diapers. However, there are a few drawbacks.  After six washes, there is a hole developing near one of the corners because the thread is unraveling. Very poor construction. The bag is also much smaller than I expected it to be.  Even with just two diapers + inserts inside, it feels very full.  When you're changing your baby inside a public bathroom, you don't want to feel like you're struggling to stuff a dirty diaper into a too-small space.  For short outings, the bag is fine; it's not big enough for a long day away from home.
