This toddler bed has been perfect!! Until it's been 1.5 years and I'm now converting to a toddler bed. I purchased the suggested conversation rails from divinci. I have it all set up. Until I realized, there's no slats or anything for one, so I'll need to purchase a box spring. Ok no big deal right? Wrong. The width of this bed is 52.5 inches. A traditional box spring is 54 inches wide. So now my father needs to make some sort of make shift platform box spring so I can put the mattress on. Which the mattress will hang off some bc it is also 54 inches wide.If you're buying for just a toddler bed, fine. But this conversation which is the purpose I bought the bed, has become a major headache.
