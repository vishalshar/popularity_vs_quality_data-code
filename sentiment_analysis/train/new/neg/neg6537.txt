First off I love the color of my new business card holder, but I don't like the bungee part of it.  Yes, I should have been smart enough to realize what I was getting myself into, but just reading the description of the product, but it seems cumbersome to use bungee on something like this.  Maybe if the case split in the middle and used bungee it would be better, but an inch off the top...not a great idea.
