I am not sure if the other reviews are genuine. I am an amazon lover, and will order most of my stuff from amazon, reading the reviews. This purchase taught me a lesson not to trust these kind of reviews any more. I have ordered this for my twin girls' crib sets, and they are horrible. They look like they are made out of very cheap quality material, and the bumper never held on to the crib, and its not soft at all. It always used to hang to the crib and was not protecting my babies from bumping their heads to the crib at all.One more down side of ordering this crib bedding set was, they charged me 33.49$ for shipping two sets, and I never got that money refunded. On top of it, there was a 15% restocking fee, and there was no return label available for me to return the items. I had to  pay 20$ to ship the items back to them. So in total, I paid 53$ for shipping for the product I hated.I would never recommend this to my family/friends. I have ordered "Alphabet Soup 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set by Cocalo" which was way better.
