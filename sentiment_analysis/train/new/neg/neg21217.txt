It carries weight good, but I do not like the fit.  It's too bulky on my arms and rubs under my arms with front carry.  Also almost impossible to buckle the back with front carry.  I have used an Ergo before as well and it's buckles were easier to me.  I plan to sell this.  I can't return it because I bought it a couple years ago to back carry my first son, but we inky did a few times.  I saved it for next baby and here I am regretting that decision because front carry is not comfortable or easy. Maybe it's because I'm small.  It does carry weight good but just don't like the fit!!!
