Just purchased this item along with another seemingly identical product Kidsme Food Feeder Essential Set (2 Food Feeders and Replace Sacs of Small and Large Size, 1 Ribbon Clip Holder) because it was an "add on" for about $5, so I thought, "Why not?"Perhaps if I'd not had them to compare side-by-side, I would not feel as I do about this particular design - although I'm pretty sure I would regardless...This thing popped open within the first minute that my six month old had it!  The "catch" on it is NOT secure, and is just a mess waiting to happen.  The Kidsme brand has an actual locking tab, which makes it WAY worth the price difference, in my opinion.  Who wants to buy a product that inevitably will make a huge mess and frustrate their baby?!  This was an "add on" for a reason...Because of the inability to get a solid closure on this product, I would NEVER recommend this it to anyone - but will recommend Kidsme to everyone (and already have)!  In this case, you truly get what you pay for...
