I bought this because my niece loved hers 9 years ago. My daughter would love it as well, if she were able to use it. It's not that she doesn't have the strength for it... The seat, the crotch area, is too wide for her to be able to bring her legs close enough together to use it, and the top area is too wide to provide the support that she needs to sit up in it--she slumps over in it. She is large for her age, so it's not that she is too small for it, and I'm afraid that by the time she gets big enough to sit comfortably in it, she will be walking on her own. I hope I'm wrong, but I'm disheartened at my purchase, because the product is so much different in fit than I was expecting.
