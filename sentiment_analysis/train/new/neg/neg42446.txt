The concept of this product is really great and I was way excited to use it. The chopping part was kind of disappointing. As I chopped food, the blades got pushed and bent so eventually the plastic part that pushes in between the steel grate would get stuck and not go down all the way. Occasionally it would even shave off flecks of the plastic into the food. I don't know about you, but I would rather not feed plastic to my baby!!Even though the chopping part disappointed me, it works really great as a steamer and I will continue to use it! Overall it was an okay product, I just wish the steel grate wouldn't slide over when I chop.
