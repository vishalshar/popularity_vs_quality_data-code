The curtain construction itself is great but if you look closely at the print, this is not correct.  The curtains I received had the print sideways.  This I'm not happy with.  I now have two sets of these curtains one with the print side-to-side and the other with the print up-and down.  Though I like the curtains and my 3yr old grandson doesn't care that the print of the curtains don't match, he's happy and really that's all that matters.--Grandma
