The drink holders on this thing are pathetic unless you have a little tiny water bottle.  Forget about putting a paper coffee cup in them because first of all it takes 2 hands to squeeze it in the holder and who has 2 free hands with a baby?  Secondly, due to the soft design the cup tips over so unless your beverage has a lid that closes you end up with half the beverage all over the place.The only good thing about this overpriced bag is that it provides a little more space to carry stuff since the basket under my Maclaren stroller is quite small.
