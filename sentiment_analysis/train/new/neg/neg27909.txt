When I bought this, I didn't read other reviews too closely, so I'm not sure if anyone else indicated that the icons on the "screen" are just pictures. I thought they were buttons that made noise. The green star button makes noise, but the toy doesn't light up. The orange edge is teething-friendly, and overall, this was a cute stocking stuffer and something nice to keep in my diaper bag.
