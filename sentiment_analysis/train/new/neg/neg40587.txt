My daughter is almost a month old now and we've used the seat several times while I've been working on the computer (like now!) and doing things needing done around the house. Some days she likes it, some days she doesn't, but that's pretty much the same with everything around here.I agree with those who say the auto shut-off time is too short -- I wish I had the option of turning off the sounds/action when it's convenient for ME, not when the machine preset tells it to shut off. Sometimes I need half an hour to do something like scrub the tub, and I don't want to have to keep running back to turn it back on. As for the baby-induced features, my daughter is still too small to make any of it "go" by herself.I'm not sure whether this would be an improvement, but it seems to me it would be more advantageous were the lights behind/inside the little "aquarium" where the fish are. My daughter tracks lights a lot better than the movements of small things like those fish; if the lights were in the same area as the fish, she might notice both.Anyway, it's better than nothing, and I hope she doesn't outgrow it too quickly!
