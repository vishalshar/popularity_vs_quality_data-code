This crib only gets 3 stars for 2 reasons.... While it is sturdy, beautiful and matches my other daughter's toddler bed perfectly, when put together, not all the pieces lined up flush making it look a little cheap.  Also, I suppose I might not have read everything thoroughly but I was assuming (bad idea, I know) that the crib had everything included in order to convert to a toddler bed etc.  That is not the case.  Yes, it is a 4 in one crib, but only if you purchase an additional conversation kit.  So... Essentially when you purchase this, you do not get a 4 in one crib.  The pictures and name are misleading.  This is JUST A CRIB.
