This is NOT a monthly calendar as stated clearly in the first line of the description.  It goes by weeks in the pregnancy, not months.  The first page of the calendar is week 1-4 and the next page is weeks 5-8.  It can not be filled in with April as the first month and the May as the second because each page has only 28 days.  April/May would actually be the first page and May/June would be the second.  If you want a calendar organized by weeks this is actually a pretty nice calendar with great stickers.  I did received the calendar very quickly, this company ships fast!  I think I received it within two days of ordering it (my husband actually ordered it so I'm not exactly sure when he placed the order.)  Despite being well packaged my mail carrier was able to bend it to put it in my mailbox.  Wish that the package had said "Do Not Bend."  I also wish I had known this calendar went by the weeks of pregnancy and not by months.  If I had known it was organized by weeks of pregnancy from the beginning I would not have ordered.  In the end just a big waste of my time.  Hope this info helps someone else and saves them the time and hassle of ordering something they don't want because the description is wrong.  I wasn't able to find any contact info on this company but if you read this I would start writing DO NOT BEND  on the package so that it is delivered in good condition.  Even if I loved this calendar it is ruined because of my mail carrier bending it to put it in my mailbox.  Hope this info helps!!
