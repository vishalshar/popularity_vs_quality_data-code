I purchased this bike for my two-year-old. His knees are already higher than the seat. He is 36.5" tall, so the bike is shorter than I expected. The photos are deceptive in the ad. Also, I folded it to take it to the park. It folded fine the first time, but when we were leaving the park and I tried to fold it again, one of the back legs wouldn't fold in. The plastic part that holds the leg in place has a burr on it so it won't go into the groove to close.I do not feel like I got my money's worth with this item.
