We got this mobile along with a Sesame Street one from the same maker; one for the crib and one for the changing table. This Looney tunes one is just too pastel and boring looking in comparison to the other. Also, the plushies aren't the same weight; I was kind of annoyed that I had to put one of the characters in the middle position, because the sun and star have to go opposite each other on one of the arms.It's not a bad mobile, just boring color wise in comparison to others. My son ignored this almost completely, but loved the brightly colored Sesame Street one.
