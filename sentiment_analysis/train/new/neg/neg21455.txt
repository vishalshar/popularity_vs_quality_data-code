Believe the reviews, this comforter is NOT wool, the product description is completely wrong. If you're looking for organic batting, then this will work just fine, but if you specifically wanted wool, this is not it. Even on the Natura website, they do not have a wool crib comforter listed as one of their products, only cotton, so it's surprising that this mislabeled comforter is all over the internet.
