This is a good looking mobile, and the reversible wings are nice.  It's easy to put together and to attach to the crib.  But the motion just wasn't enough to entertain or calm my son.  The volume selection for the music is nice, but I wanted a mute button sometimes too -- you can't have the motion without the music.  I wonder too if the motion just wasn't *enough* motion either: the flapping is slow and I think something that was light enough to be swayed by air flow or that more actively turned on its own might have been a better choice. I kept it for several weeks and tried it at all times of day and night - for entertaining downtime in the crib, at nap time, at just-waking-up time.... but ultimately it was just the wrong mobile for him.  I wound up returning it.
