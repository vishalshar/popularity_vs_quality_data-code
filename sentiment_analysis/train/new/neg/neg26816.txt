I purchased this lunch tote at the beginning of the school year last year. I really love the designs and my 6 year old son thought it was really cool also. Within a month of using it however the handle started to rip from the bag itself. I contacted the company thinking maybe it was just a manufacturing flaw. The company had wonderful prompt customer service and replaced the bag quickly. Much to my disappointment the second bag also tore in the same places after some use. My son has had several lunch boxes and has never had any problems other than normal wear and tear. (Always after a full school year's use) I will not purchase anymore of this company's products. I was very surprised that some of the other reviews called it "durable".....I will give the company credit for cool designs and fabulous customer service but in my opinion they should work on construction. :(
