One of them worked wonderfully and is still being used more than a year later. I believe it claimed it would come with some free songs, but they weren't there.  I like that it plays the songs in an album in sequence instead of the crazy randomization that some MP3 players inflict on their owners.  The second one I ordered was a piece of junk, and I managed to lose the materials needed for returning it.
