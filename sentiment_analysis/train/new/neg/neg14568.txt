We needed a 2nd bouncy seat and went down the line several stores waiting for our daughter to light up when she sat in the right chair.  This was the one.  As soon as I sat her in it, her little face lit up and she giggled.  However, since buying it, she gets bored and frustrated with it very quickly.  I think she gets tired of hearing the songs.  She likes to watch the dog shake and the lights blink but I think she gets aggitated after listing to the sounds over and over.  The cat and the bunny are still out of her reach.  I also use it as a feeding chair by taking the toy bar off and laying a towel over it.  She seems to like it just as much without the toy bar on too.  It reclines her just enough but not too much.  I gave it 3 stars because I think it's overpriced and it needs a mute switch so the lights can still work without the songs...it's not a good sign when the baby gets annoyed by the sounds too.
