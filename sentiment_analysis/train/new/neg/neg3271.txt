We like these glass Born Free bottles, but 2 out of the 3 cracked during heating (using the Born Free Tru-Temp Bottle Warmer) during the first week of use. My original ones (that didn't crack) don't have any imprint on the bottom. These new bottles say "Made in China". Not sure if that correlates to them breaking or not.
