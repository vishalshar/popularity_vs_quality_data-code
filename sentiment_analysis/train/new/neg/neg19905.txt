This feels too heavy when you have a carrier attached on top and a toddler in the front seat. It hasn't tipped but definitely feels like it could on unleval ground. The front toddler seat is also very short. My little guy has a hard time not sliding off of it while in attempting to strap him in. On the plus side, it is very easy to fold. The under storage is very easy to access and spacious.
