This monitor is TERRIBLE!!!  The only thing I can hear is this loud, obnoxious whirring / clicking sound, and it didn't pick up my son's cries at ALL!  He was in his room screaming, and all I heard was that clicking.  The light show is neat, but we didn't even use it before taking this monitor back.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
