I got this border as a gift to go with the barnyard bedding we also registered for.  While the border is cute, and is a WONDERFUL addition to our nursery, it was very difficult to put up.  We followed the directions to a "t", but for some reason, the top edge was not sticking.  It looked like there was no glue on this part of the border.  So, we figured out a trick...wet the border, and put on the wall where you want it.  Wait for about 10 minutes and start pushing the glue FROM THE BOTTOM.  With glue at the top (glopping out of the top), wait for another 10 minutes or so.  THEN push out the rest of the glue.  We still needed to work the top edge with a damp cloth for a good while, but it did eventually stick.So, while the border is cute, be ready to spend an entire afternoon putting it up.
