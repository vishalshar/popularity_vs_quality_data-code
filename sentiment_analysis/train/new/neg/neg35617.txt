Grrr! Okay, this is a great set in concept. The sterilizer is great and everything is very top quality. However I am beginning to hate these bottles. I breastfeed so I need these to store my precious breastmilk! Getting the tops on these things just right is a big pain in the butt. All the different bottles have tops that I think are interchangeable, but I can never seem to guess what goes with what, some require these rings, but even when I pair everything up with the correct counterpart, I might still get a leak. I could probably separate everything once I figure out for sure what belongs with what, but that would be very difficult as I usually pump at 4am and just grab the first thing I can find, and I don't have a big house with a lot of storage space or anything so the easiest thing for me is to keep them all together on the drying rack.Basically it's just a pretty set, but I'm wasting a lot of my milk on it. I'd get a new one but $50 is a lot to me. Also the bottle brush is a poor design. Again, pretty & sturdy, but it's difficult making sure the bottom of the bottles are getting cleaned.
