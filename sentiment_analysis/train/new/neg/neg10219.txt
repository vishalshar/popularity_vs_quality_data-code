Well, I tried to use this on my flailing two year old, and as I was sitting on top of her, attempting to restrain her arms with my legs, while holding the sucker to her nose with one hand and the tube to my mouth with the other hand, I happened to catch a glimpse of the artwork on the product's box. "What a pleasant depiction of a mother slurping snot out of her happy baby's nose," I thought to myself, and then began laughing at the irony of my slurping situation. I laughed so hard I couldn't slurp, and my daughter wriggled free and ran away to hide. I'd say using this is a two-parent job if you have older kids or you haven't pre-sedated them.Also, only use each filter once!! My neighbor told me her husband gets sick every time he uses this on their son, but then she said they reuse their filters. I think there may be some sort of causation there.When you can actually successfully hold your child still long enough to use this, it is rather easy to slurp the mucus, and kind of thrilling because you'll always wonder if the filter will work *this* time. It's stopped the glob from reaching me every time so far, so that's a plus.It also doesn't have to be inserted into the nostril as far as a bulb syringe, so apparently that's more comfortable for the sniffly child.It may or may not slurp more than a bulb syringe; I got it with the hopes that it would, but I think the syringe is easier to use, because it can be a one-handed endeavor, leaving the other hand free to restrain the child's head.
