I love the Burt's Bees Baby Bee products.  We use the shampoo, multi-purpose ointment and diaper cream.  I realize not every baby's skin is created equally but I highly recommend the diaper cream!  We've never had to use anything else and rashes seem to clear within 24 hours if I catch them at the onset, change diapers more frequently (e.g. every 2 hours) and watch the intake of acidity while healing.  The reason I'm only giving three stars is because of the pricing.  I paid around $11.50 on Amazon and then saw a similar set at Target for $20 that includes an 8 oz. shampoo, 6 oz. lotion, 2 oz. diaper ointment and 1 oz. oil.  That is a MUCH better value and I wish I had seen that first.
