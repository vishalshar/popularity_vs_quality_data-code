My husband thought these would be a great idea for formula and when using them specifically for dumping formula into a bottle it works fine. What I don't like is the rest of it:1. The lid threading is just terrible. I actually have to line up the lid and the container in order to secure them together.  I think it should work like any other screw on cap and I should be able to start the lid anywhere and the threading should catch.  Even when I do line them up, the threading doesn't always catch and it can get frustrating.2. I don't really like the concept of them stacking for storage because then there's no place for the lids. The lids stack ok by themselves but not great since they have a rounded top. Stacking a container/lid combo doesn't work well either since the bottom of the container is a bit rounded as well making for balancing issues.  I would have preferred some sort of nesting storage for these containers and lids.3. The side spout works fine. I haven't had any problems with it or it's lid. (It's a pop-off lid)
