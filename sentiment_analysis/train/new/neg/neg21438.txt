I wanted to love this, but we still have trouble fitting the pacifiers into the compartments. We use the Tommee Tippee pacifiers so not sure if others fit better, but I still haven't found a way to get them in there without bending the nipple of the pacifier. The shape is great, and I love that it can attach to a handle or diaper bag. I also didn't realize until recently the handle will fold over the ball so it's out of the way if you don't need it too.We still use it because it's better than a loose paci floating around the diaper bag, but it would be better if it were just a bit bigger.
