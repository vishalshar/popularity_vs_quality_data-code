I purchased this for my 5 month old daughter thinking she would love it, but the toys on there are out of reach for her and the 'arms' do not bend so she can't pull them toward her to chew on them.  So she gets frustrated and cries, so this does not keep her entertained at all.  Basically when we do put her in this, we give her other toys to play with since none of the ones on this are very practical at all.  I would not recommend this one.
