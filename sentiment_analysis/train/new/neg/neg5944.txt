We lost our summer infant comb so I looked to replace it.  BabyHaven sent a completely different product (the cheaper white/teal version).  It works but it is much cheaper quality and different design--comb has no handle and is thinner/flimsier plastic.  I am very disappointed and will not purchase from BabyHaven ever again in the future.  This is the only time I have had a bad experience on Amazon.
