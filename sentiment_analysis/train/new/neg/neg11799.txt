For an inexpensive bowl and spoon set, they get the job done.  The bowls are very lightweight and the perfect size for small appetites.  My 2.5-year-old loves choosing which color she wants to use, and I feed my 8-month-old from these as well.  We bought them for using during travel, so I do like that they nest and are so lightweight.  The spoons handles are easy to grip for my toddler as she feeds herself, and for my husband and me as we feed the baby.  The shape of the end of the spoon that holds food is nice--it's not too shallow, so I can serve thin purees or soups, and it's not so deep that my kids can't get their food out of the bottom.  The one drawback about the spoons is that the end that holds the food has melted on three of them!  The only thing we can figure is that the water in the dishwasher gets too hot.  We can't come up with any other option, but our water heater isn't even set very high, so it is surprising to us.  We have tossed the three spoons with the melted tips.
