This toy says that it lights up and plays music. However, it does no such thing. My daughter bats it around, and it can hang with the rest of the toys... but it's definitely not a favorite. Her favorite toys light up and/or make sound. Which is why I bought this. Which is why you shouldn't, unless you just want a stuffed Eeyore.
