These aren't bad.  I bought them as a less expensive alternative to the A&A blankets.  They aren't as soft or as large, but they get the job done.  Work well for a small newborn, but I missed the larger size of the A&A blankets for swaddling as my little guy got a bit bigger.  These are very useful for covering the stroller while the baby sleeps.
