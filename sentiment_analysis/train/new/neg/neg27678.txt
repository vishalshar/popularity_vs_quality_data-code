I ordered this so my son would have something to keep him occupied during mass. It's a good thing I ordered it well in advance of when I needed it because it positively stunk when it arrived. I understand it is made of rubber but it should not reek, particularly since this is designed to be in the mouth of a baby. I tried washing it with Palmolive and warm water dozens of times. Finally, I gave up and just let it air out. The smell finally dissipated. I have worn the necklace a few times but my son would rather chew on his Sophie the giraffe. I'd say save your money and just get a Sophie instead.
