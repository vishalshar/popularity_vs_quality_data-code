What I don't like:The size is on the small side. The bib itself as well as the opening for the neck.The size of the velcro and the part that attaches to the velcro do not match, so the extra velcro scratched my son's face when he moved his bead in that direction.The appliques that are attached to the closure part are so hard and rough. It also scratched my son's face when he moved, so I went ahead and cut them off each one with a scissor.The material is on the thin side. There are times where it would literally be soaked after a feeding.After a few washes, the material shriveled up and started to fuzz.I do not see myself reaching for these bibs at all. I only use them when I need to do laundry and have nothing else to use.
