(Please read follow up at bottom before you purchase)The Pro's:1) Its fun2) Its Green3) Its a frog4) Its reasonably secure5) Its cushion is comfortable and easy to clean.6) Its collapsible7) Its business area is wide enough to assure all goes where it should.....in most cases.The Con's1) While I did state it was sturdy you should not let your child climb on it unassisted (You think that would be a no Brainer)2) The plastic screws that assembles the product will not survive long if you plan on disassembling it (Head will strip) due to soft plastic (Inspect daily)3) Step could/should be a little more beefy; this is where this product could improve and why its 4 out of 5.Follow up on safety:We had this product for several months now and up until last week it has worked as one would expect. As I had mentioned in my review under Cons: "Plastic Screws" could prove to be an issue - well they are. I can not stress enough how important it is to do daily inspections on this companies poor choice of material for establishing connections - especially the upper most points; and please never let your child climb on this product unassisted as I had mentioned in my original review. To reflect on my original line of thinking, I could not give this product a 5th star; but having seen those assumptions manifest into a true safety issue I must reduce my rating of this product to a 2 out of 5.Hope this helps,Sounds
