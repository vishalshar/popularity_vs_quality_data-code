In the picture it looks so much nicer! It just looked like a messy roll of fabric when I wore it at home. Got first the medium & then the small (I'm 5'6", 160ish lbs & normally about a size 10) but they both seemed to me to be too big to do the job. The small was closer to right but the area along the top of the pouch (where the label is in the picture) stretched out too far for me to be comfortable not still supporting my son's back/head with my hand. He was just over the 8 lb weight limit at the time & around 1 1/2 months; I tried the newborn position with him, but he seemed too tightly bunched in the bottom while too floppy in the top half & neither of us found it comfortable - he fussed in no time & I hadn't had any success having 2 hands free in that span anyway. I wanted to be able to do housework even if nothing else, but just didn't work out for us & I definitely wouldn't have taken it out on the road feeling as precarious as he did. Maybe it was operator error, but I've given up on wraps at this point. We were given a Baby Bjorn I'm hoping he takes to later on... in the meantime I cook while he swings in the kitchen.
