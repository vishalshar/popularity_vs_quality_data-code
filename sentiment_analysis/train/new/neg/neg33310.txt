The toy that arrived from this seller was not the one pictured. The only reason I paid more for this one than the same exact toy that Amazon had for a little cheaper was that this picture contained a toy with a pull string- IT DOES NOT HAVE A PULL STRING. It is the toy that is pictured under the cheaper amazon price with the single colored wheels and no pull string. My son loves to pull toys behind him, so that is why I purchased this and I am very disappointed that it doesn't have the feature I paid more for. My son still loves his "choo-choo" and taking the blocks on and off, I just wish I paid the lesser price.
