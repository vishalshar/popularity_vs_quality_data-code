My son has used the Fisher-Price Rainforest Waterfall Peek-a-Boo Soother for 2 years. We got this for our daughter when she was 4 months old and ready to transition to her crib.The music and sounds that it plays are nice, but it turned out to be a little too stimulating and not very soothing. I would attribute this to the lights that turn on and off - they are just a bit too bright. The lights on the Waterfall Soother are much more subtle and calming. The Moonbeam Soother, in comparison, also has a louder motor. The buttons on the front are too high for an infant who is not able to get to a sitting position by herself yet. Our 2.5 year old son was interested in this one so we ended up switching them.The on/off button on the Waterfall Soother is on the lower right so our now 6-month-old is able to turn it on by herself. She still wouldn't be able to do that with the Moonbeam Soother. In retrospect, I definitely would've purchased another Waterfall Soother, but luckily my son has been okay with the trade.
