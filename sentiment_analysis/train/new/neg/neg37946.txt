The size of the nipples change and are not consistent. I tried to get help from customer service because when I ordered a replacement pacifier the new one was longer and wider and gagged by baby, and customer service wouldn't help me. I was very disappointed. Cute pacifiers but not all the same and since they only last 6 months it's hard in babies to not have he same type of nipple with each pacifier.
