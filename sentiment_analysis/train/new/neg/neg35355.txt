The mat is super cute and has a good weight so it doesn't move around much on its own.  We have wood floors in our kitchen (I know, weird!), so we wanted this to protect the floors from our food-flinging toddler.The care instructions say you can wash it in a washing machine and hang to dry, but DON'T do it!  The coating and the cloth backing have separated in places all over the mat, so the coating appears to be all bubbly, and it looks really cheap.  The mat won't lay flat anymore, and has a tendency to curl along the edges.  I was hoping this would be with us for years and we'd use it under a craft table down the road, but I doubt it will last that long.It's also not especially "jumbo."
