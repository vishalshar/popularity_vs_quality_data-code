I was recommended these cups by a friend who swore they were the only cups that didn't leak. I excitedly bought them right away. They are adorable cups, and my daughter loved drinking out of them, but I found after only a few short months that they started to leak. My daughter would set the cup down on the table and water would just just pumping from the spout all over the place. I have no idea what the problem was, but they went right into the garbage after spending months trying to figure out the issue.
