The ones I bought for my first child are lovely.  I reordered them recently, as we are babyproofing even more for an incoming new baby, and the ones I received this time are... different.  They're square.  I guess they will work?  Our outlets are round.  It is strange that the ones I ordered previously are round, as are the ones in the pictures, but the ones that I received are square.  They fit in the plugs but I'm not sure how actually safe/baby proof they are since they aren't the correct shape.  My toddler son has not messed with them- partly because he knows not to, but mostly because he doesn't spend a lot of time in the new nursery- so I'm unaware so far as to the effectiveness of this new/different/fluke design.
