In my country the law does not require car seats so I did not have a variety to choose from. We got this one a few weeks ago for our 11mth old son and so far so good. I had the time of my life trying to install this thing in my car - I gave up on the first night. I was ready to return it to the store but decided to give it another go. Pull, Tug, Twist, Turn - I swear I lost all the weight I gained during pregnancy trying to get this thing installed. Eventually I got it in a comfortable and safe rear facing position. My vehicle is not LATCH equiped so I did not have to go through the stress of attaching another belt.Once you understand how to adjust the straps (practice with a stuff toy in my case my daughter's cabbage patch 8)) it is easy to secure your baby. I removed the head rest and put the pillow from our Kiddopotamus snuzzler - I know you are not supposed to use products that are not apart of the seat but the included pillow would have given my son a stiff neck.The padding on this seat is comfy - my son took his first long nap in it a few days after we got it and his head was not all over and we have some bumpy roads to deal with here.My wedding ring has a few raised areas and it has caught a few times on the brown cloth, so all over the seat there are little pulls in the material - it is quite annoying. I have to turn my ring around before I put my son the seat.I would recommend this car seat if you are on a budget - the Britax are way too expensive here - over two thousand trinidadian dollars, this was just over seven hundred ( about $120US dollars) at a local bulk food store .
