Yes, it says in the description that they are anatomic nipples but I didn't compute that when ordering. My son did not like these nipples. He ate slower and seemed to get more air. I already had 6 of these bottles with the regular silicone nipples and those are great for a newborn. I just used these bottles with the nipples I already had.
