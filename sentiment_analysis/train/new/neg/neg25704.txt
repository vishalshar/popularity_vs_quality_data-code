We purchase the Terrain because: 1) we are highly active runners on and off road, 2) it has a newborn feature (smart running surface choice is still essential. ie shaking baby), 3) the design features are smart, clean, minimalistic and functional ( adjustable bar is awesome, storage is smart, its narrow, folding is easy and compact, etc...). Again, on paper the Terrain ruled our shopping search, and quite honestly we liked that we'd be different than all the Bob's in the crowd. All the reviews were strong. Sold. After 10+ months of using the Terrain at least once a week on average from street, fire road, to trails we can say that we are looking to sell this and get something else. Why? Many of the design features don't outweigh construction that is loose. The joints and axels for the folding are getting increasingly sloppy. Theres is more play and wiggle in the frame than we feel comfortable with (at least 2 inches), especially for the premium price tag. But the biggest issue is the front wheel. The locking feature for the fixed wheel is terrible. Its never fully locked. That plus the alignment mechanism on the the axel does not hold well regardless of how tight I make it. As a result I am forever fighting to keep a straight line. More and more, I raise the front wheel and run using the back two wheels. This alone is a deal breaker for us. I've emailed with Mountainbuggy and they even sent us a new frame which is great, but the design flaw is still the same. We really want to like this product given that it is smartly designed in so many ways, but as the saying goes, " the devil is in the details." After getting to know the Terrain, we are moving on to something else.
