I bought this dresser super excited to have it in my nursery matching my changing table and crib. Took over half a day to assemble correctly and the drawers did not line up so when you look at it there are no straight lines. Looks cheap and even though the drawers are all supposed to be the same size they are not and you have to figure out which one goes where and then the drawers hit the side of the dresser causing scratches everytime you open and close it. For the money it costs to purchase it not worth the risk. You would be better off going to a furniture store with guaranteed service. Not to mention for the money this piece cost you can get higher quality. I tried to go through the company to have them take care of me because I am so unhappy and out tons of money and still have to buy another dresser. They say once you put together they can not give you a refund. Okay well they did not specify this online but put a paper in the box. Well do you know there is something wrong with it before you put it together? No. So does that make any sense. Than they proceed to email me that it is mass produced and the drawers are probably not going to be perfect. Does it say that online to warn people? No. I know you may have to make your own decision. I just want to say that I never rate anything and I am easy to please. I took time out of my day because I can not express enough the disappointment this dresser and company has brought me. If you could zero star and item, this would have been it. Not Amazons fault but I will not be purchasing from TargetedDecor online ever again.
