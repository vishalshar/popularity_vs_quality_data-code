I almost feel like I did not receive the same sheet as the people who have reviewed this product.  These are extremely thin and rather scratchy.  Thinking a wash with fabric softener will do them good, I threw them into the machine.  They came out a wrinkled and even scratchier mess. I have never seen sheets behave this way in all my life - they folded in on themselves like origami with tiny tiny very hard wrinkles.  Of course I cannot return them now that I've washed them.  I would not purchase anything made by this company.  In fact, I think I will stay away from bed linens on amazon all together.
