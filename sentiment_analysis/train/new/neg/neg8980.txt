Out of the package, I really liked this pail liner. Solid material, really strong elastic. It's definitely waterproof, too. BUT after only 3 weeks of use and probably 4 washes (air dry/tumble dry low), the seams are unraveling in 2 different places: along the elastic and along the reinforced side seam. It will not be long before it's totally unusable. Really disappointed.
