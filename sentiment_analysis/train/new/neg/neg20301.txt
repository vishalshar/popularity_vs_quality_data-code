This product is very cute and a very good option if you don't want to spend a fortune on baby bedding. However, the set that I received was made pretty poorly. There were a lot of loose threads and sloppy stiches but I was able to fix a lot of them on my own. I love the look of the set but the quality is very disappointing.
