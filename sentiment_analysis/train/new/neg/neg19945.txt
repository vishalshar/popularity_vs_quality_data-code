It broke within weeks of receiving it. It would randomly go off on its own. It scared the heck out of me when it first did this and I was home alone. Then I could not get it to stop. Every couple of minutes it was going off on its own. I had to put it outside just so that I didn't have to hear it. I sent it back. Also, if it had worked properly, it would only have worked until the battery died, as you can not change the battery...what genius designed this product?
