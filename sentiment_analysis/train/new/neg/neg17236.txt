Used to use these 4 years ago when I had my daughter and they were great, had no issues. I liked they have less parts to wash versus Born Free which I also used. Bought these again when I had my baby boy and noticed they leak if you don't tighten them correctly. I think they updated the bottles also because the caps are also a bit tough to take off. I find myself having to yank them off. The combination of a leaky bottle and a hard -to-remove cap is no bueno when you have a starving baby screaming at the top of their lungs to hurry up with the milk!
