I love these stickers, exactly what I was looking for. Except that I just took the picture of my daughter at three months and realized there are two stickers for 3 months, and the sticker for 4 months is missing. I guess I should have checked when I received them, I just had more important things to do at the time with a newborn than to go through all 13 stickers! I'm trying to figure out how to contact them to have them send me the sticker for 4 months, other than that they are great!
