I purchased this product in early May, and by the end of July I noticed that the paint on several of the activities has started to chip.  This is disturbing as my child is teething and has been chewing on everything.  One area in particular has paint loss that matches the size of her teeth (!).  We are removing these activities and keeping a close eye on the others.  It's really too bad because she enjoys this so much.  We only let her play in it about 15 - 20 minutes a day so I feel like the paint should have held up better over the course of 3 months.In terms of set up, the Exersaucer took my husband and I about 45 minutes to put together.  There were a lot of parts and you have to read the directions closely.
