I have a house full of cabinet doors without handles and a baby who keeps getting into things.  Although I mainly use the typical inside spring action latches, my kitchen sink cabinet (where I keep cleaning supplies) needs extra security.  This lock is actually a very clever design and looks good too.  Someone needs to push a small front button and squeeze a side button at the same time to unlock the switch, which then pops open to the left.  It's made from plastic and metal, with a cushion on the metal to protect your cabinetry.  As I finally got around to installing this thing, I was impressed with the simplicity of installation...lining the two sides up looked like it was going to be the most difficult step, and the only tools I needed were a screwdriver and a pencil.  Good to go!  Unfortunately, and the reason I cannot recommend this product for everyone, is that the packaging says it "fits most cabinets", but what they should actually say is "only fits the cheapest cabinetry".  The way this is designed, the metal piece wraps around from the front of the cabinet to the back in one solid piece, with the thickness of the plastic locking mechanism on the front side, limiting the thickness of an accommodating cabinet door to about 3/4" or less.  My cabinet doors are about an inch thick and although it really looked like I might be able to squeeze it on, there was just no give in this thing.  Tried everything, but Defeat.  I'm super disappointed to not be able to use this.  I fully expected a cabinet door lock at this price to fit a wider range of cabinets...of course maybe I just have the thickest cabinet doors imaginable and these will work great for everyone else.  My advice: measure the thickness of your cabinet doors BEFORE purchasing this item.
