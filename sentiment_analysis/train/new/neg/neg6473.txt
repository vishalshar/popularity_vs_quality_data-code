Nice idea, but the age group suggested is way lower than it should be. Suggested starting 9M, but at 12M my baby still can;t figure out the magnetic part, esp given that, as with any magnet, if you put them wrong side they push away, and there is no way to see which it the right side even for an adult, except trial and error of course. Probably better for older kids, or maybe just targeted at overexcited adults...
