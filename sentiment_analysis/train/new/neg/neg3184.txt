Ok, I don't want to be rude, but the voice that sings 'old macdonald' is horrible. It sounds like a cross of a tone-deaf grandma meets tone-deaf hippy who thinks they can sing. I cannot get why the manufacturer would choose such a non-pleasant voice. My 2 year old loves the song 'old macdonald' however was scared of this stuffed animal singing the song. Since this order says 'vary' we didn't get what was pictured, we got the pig. The pig was silly looking, but a nice bright color; the tail didn't stay curled up and the press box that holds the song is too hard for any toddler to push to play the button that plays the song. As a parent, you will need to play the button for young children. After a few days of playing the song every once in a while, our toddler is starting to enjoy the toy, slowly but surely.
