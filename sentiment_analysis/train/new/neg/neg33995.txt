This tub was advertised to be the cadillac of baby tubs. It has great features but it doesn't fit into my sink or tub very well. The water has to run the entire time the baby is in the tub and our kitchen sink has a divider in it which made that weird and awkward. I love that it tells the temperature and that the dirty water runs out. It's so cheaply build and had dings and I just wasn't pleased.
