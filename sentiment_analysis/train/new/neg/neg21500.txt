My daughter is 5 months old and can barely reach the ground with her tippy toes on the lowest setting. I saw that this is height adjustable, but little did I know it only has two settings and both of them are extremely tall. It says 4months and above so I figured that it would be talking about average babies but its definitely too tall and Mylinn is a little longer than normal. The toys are simple but thats fine especially for the cheap price we paid, but what good is it if she can't reach the ground to walk in it. The product itself is great I think, exactly as described, but they need to include a height minimum for this or more adjustable settings.
