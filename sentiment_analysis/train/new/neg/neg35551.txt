After researching the benefits of amber I was thoroughly excited to purchase and receive the necklace for my 4 month old daughter. She wore the necklace for a few days and I found it not to work at all. She was the same if not worse than before wearing the necklace. I didn't want to admit that it didn't work because I was so excited about having a natural teething remedy. I did some more research and found that there are a lot of fakes out there and there are a few simple ways to test if your amber is real or not. I tested it and found that it is not real amber. I'm still hopeful that once I find a genuinely authentic amber necklace, it will help my daughter. I am a firm believer in natures cures. Good luck and do your research before buying this!
