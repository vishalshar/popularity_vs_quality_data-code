I got this one to replace one that was broken in a humpty dumpty accident, and the build quality just wasn't the same as to one I got as gift for my twin girls baby shower 2 years ago. This one came in a recangular box, and the original one came in like a hat box with a silky inner lining over a foam padding. There is a hole in the top where the tiara sits that just gives off a raddle like the screw is lose but isn't any time you pick the bank up. i thought the bank was broken and have a pieces of ceramic chip on the inside of the bank when I first opened the box. This hole for the tiara to sit in was not on the original one. The painted on bows on the body of the piggy bank is sloppy, and the bank  is slightly bigger but weighs about 30% less than the original. I loved the original mud Pie Little Princess Piggy bank but this is a cheap knock off of the original one. Or maybe it's because this one cost $22 while all the others I have found cost in the $50 range.
