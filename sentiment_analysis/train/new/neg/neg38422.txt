We purchased this product to control temperature in bathtub, as manufacturer advertised. It worked fine just once for about 5 minutes. Product designed to inform a user that temperature is either too hot or too cold by producing beeping sound. Five minutes later product made a beeping sound, and stopped working. At first we thought there was low battery. We decided to change it. Opened battery cover and there was a problem. Not only the battery cover didn't have any seal, to protect water from coming in, but all inside electrical components were soaked in water. Battery was all wet. No other comments about the product. Engineer who designed this product definitely didn't think through about safety precautions and testing. This product MUST be recalled for redesign. One more note, this product is a toy for children to play with in the bathtub so it must be safe and water resistant. There are many other products that are much more safe for children. Never buy this product!
