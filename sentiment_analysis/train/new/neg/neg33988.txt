We ordered this and have used it maybe 5 times in the last month or so, and the music box has completely tweaked out, and hits these really awful notes, that make it unusable. It's a disappointment, because my son really likes to look at it, and he liked the music the first couple times, but then it went haywire. We even tried to open it up to see if we could fix it, but the metal parts inside seem to be bent or misshapen. I threw away the box, or I would have tried to return it.
