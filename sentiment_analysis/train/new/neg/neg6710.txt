Get ready to receive the cutest, non-functional mobile on the web.  This day and age, I'm not sure why wind up music boxes are still used.  It comes with an on/off switch but it only lasts a minute at the longest.  Then, the cute little birds stop on the pole if you put the pole covers on.  My music box actually just died after 3 uses.  I bought a battery operated one instead.  Let's hope it works better.
