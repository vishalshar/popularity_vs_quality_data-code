This might be a good product for a kid who doesn't try to pull it off their own head. Unfortunately, we'll never know, because my daughter figured out how to undo the velcro strap in about 5 seconds. I put it back on her head, and then she found yet another way to slide it off, this time without even undoing the strap. Five seconds or less each time. She does seem to enjoy playing with it and carrying it around, though. Me putting it back on her, and her finding different ways to pull it off was a fun game for a few minutes. Not really worth the money just for that, though! If your kid likes to wear hats and doesn't try to pull them off, this might work for you.
