Some of the rubber duckys (approximately 3-4) arrived with smeared black ink on them. Because we used them as part of gift bags for a birthday party, this rendered those items useless, as I would not want my infant/ toddler playing with a toy with smeared ink on it. Really cute product but I was disappointed with it.
