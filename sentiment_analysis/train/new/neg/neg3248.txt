I always loved the brand Carter's. From clothes to crib bumpers they have the best quality from any other brand.So, when i saw that they have a shopping cart cover i did not doubt for a second to get it.We didnt like it at all not because of its looks, let me say that it is cute but it's pretty small. The "seat belt" does not do anything to secure the baby, wearing it is like having nothing at all and is quite easy to get dirt on it.It's a good product but not made for my daughter, you have to try it to see if it works for you.
