I ordered this turtle nightlight to replace the one I already had after I unfortunately dropped it and broke it. This is NOT the same thing as the nice turtle twilight nightlight that I had. This is the bare bones basic version and is not worth saving the money. Pay more and get the nicer version that has the timer shutoff and has the option for the colors to slowly fade in and out putting baby to sleep. Also this seller shipped my turtle in an envelope from overseas, not a box. Arrived in really poor shape.
