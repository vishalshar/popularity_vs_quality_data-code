My son like playing with The Nubbinz kushie. I think it is a fun toy, but I did not expect such expensive toy to be so easily damaged. My son is only 5 months and has been playing with it for about a month only on weekends and the elastic in one of the legs is already torn. I expected for that price the quality and durability will be a little bit better than a regular cheap toy. I wanted to get him few of the other Kushies, but now I am not sure if I will spend that money for them if they are so easily damaged.
