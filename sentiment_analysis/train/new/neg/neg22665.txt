I have ordered the blankies several times between 2012 and 2015, and have noticed that the recent one which was ordered in 2015 had declined in quality.  The earlier ones were made of the fabric that felt more like a soft and smooth towel, but the fabric of the new one had more of a synthetic-like quality (slippery and more shiny material).  Also, the stitchings of the new one seemed sloppy and not precise (the fabric overlapping a little bit and stitched where it shouldn't be overlapping).  It feels like it was made in a hurry with cheaper material.  I liked the old ones that were available until last year, and am very disappointed with the new one I received this year.
