Overall this toy is super cute and I love that the monkey can hug my son.The downfall is in the recording device. My son hits the record button and this causes upset when he can't hear the voice anymore. Also the voice recorder is picky. If you are not right up on the microphone it is so quiet you can barely hear the message. Then when you get super close it causes your voice to crack. The message also replays over and over again every few minutes which wakes my son up. So I have to go in and switch the monkey over once he falls asleep so that the voice over does not continue.I am going to try removing the recording device and leaving it on his nightstand and let him just cuddle with the monkey.
