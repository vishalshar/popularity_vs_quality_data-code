The plate/bowl is great.  A lot wider than I expected, but has a nice no slip grip on the bottom.  The spoon handles are a great size and very easy to hold, but the actual spoon part was a little bit too wide for our 15 mth old to fit in her mouth.  The spoons had a good depth to scoop up food, but our daughter couldn't fit her mouth around the spoon without opening it really wide, so she ended up "sipping" out of the spoon instead.  Otherwise, the set is well made and easy to clean.  Will probably work best for an older child with a wider mouth than our little girls.  But, then again, if the kid was older, then the spoon handles would be too short, 'cause right now they fit her hands perfectly.
