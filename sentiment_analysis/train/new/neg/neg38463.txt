I bought this product to replace a worn out bouncer. The chair is quality made, doesn't feel cheap, and my little guy is quite comfortable in it. The vibrations are nice for him, not too strong. The swing out toy bar is wonderful and is the reason I chose this bouncer over the other bouncers.The only negative I have to say about this bouncer is that it doesn't bounce... And it takes the full weight of my adult hand to make it rock, and when I do rock it, its not the smooth fluid motion you get with most bouncers. It's kind of jerky, it's only as smooth as my hand motion can make it.It's a good chair. When he starts solids, I'll use it to feed him. It's a comfortable chair, I let him nap in it sometimes... But this product should not be considered a bouncer; it does not bounce.
