My 6 month old daughter loved this lovie blanket.  Today I found the little pink bow in her swing after she napped.  This is a choking hazard for any baby who loves to put stuff in their mouth like my daughter does.  I am so glad I saw it before she decided to try and eat the little bow.  Please do not buy or remove the bow if you do!
