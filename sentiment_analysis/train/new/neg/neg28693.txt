I received an envelope with three small disks in it just as another reviewer did. There was nothing else in the envelope just the three disks. I was also surprised how lacking they were, they really do look like the free disks you get from some places. However, the smell is good but I am not sure how they will work in the nursery for our daughters diaper pail since she is not here yet. They are not very strong so I hope they will be able to mask the odor from her diapers. I am glad they were so inexpensive so I don't really feel like I wasted much money if they don't work.
