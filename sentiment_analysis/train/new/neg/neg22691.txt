I'm kind of disappointed with this item ... We put it together & as soon as we put my 6 1/2 month old son into it, he immediately grabbed on to one of the side mirrors and just ripped it right out.  I guess it's design flaw, because it's not broken, but not very sturdy.  We threw out the box, and honestly it would be too much of a hassle to return, so we're just dealing with the problem.  Also, it doesn't really roll side to side very easily.  However, the horn & sounds are pretty cool, and my son loves holding on to the steering wheel & seems to enjoy the walker.  So all in all, I gave it 3 stars.
