I have an eight month old daughter and my biggest concern with this stroller was the "freedom of movement" harness. This is a 5 point harness that DOES NOT attach to the seat back, in order to allow the child to move around freely. There is a small tab on the back of the harness that you insert into a slit in the seat back in order to strap the child into the stroller and once you've adjusted and secured the "5 points" of the harness, you un-insert the tab to allow free movement. I discovered that the harness automatically detaches itself when the child moves slightly. This is where I really became concerned. There is nothing to secure the back of the harness to the seat. The child can lean ALL the way forward. This is very dangerous and if I had known about this, I would never have purchased this stroller.
