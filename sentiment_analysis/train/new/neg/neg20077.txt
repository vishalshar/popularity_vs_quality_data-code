I really really really wanted to love this bag.  The color and size is great and the concept of having a built in carrier is super cool!  BUT, there are some design flaws that will keep me from using it.  First of all; the flap that covers the bag itself is super bulky and gets in the way, I wished it faced the other side.  Secondly; the small piece of Velcro used to hold the pocket closed, is exposed and snags all of my shirts and sweaters (this could have been avoided if they had swapped the aggressive side of the Velcro for the soft side).  And lastly, the zipper that you use to convert from bag to carrier always comes open and does not lock closed.  I found myself constantly trying to zip it up (my OCD could not handle the unzipped zipper all day long.).  Anyway, "A" for effort but back to production to fix the details.
