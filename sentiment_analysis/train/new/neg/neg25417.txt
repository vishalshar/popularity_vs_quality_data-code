So I will start with the fact that I have purchased 4 different monitors :1) 2.4GHz DIGITAL WIRELESS BABY VIDEO MONITOR SYSTEM WITH NIGHT VISION -- 2.4" Color LCD Screen (Two-way Radio communication) by Smart AV ,2) MOBICAM DXR DIGITAL MONITORING SYSTEM,3) SAMSUNG WIRELESS VIDEO SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM w/ 3.5" LCD,4) SUMMER BABY TOUCH COLOR VIDEO MONITOR by Summer infant. I have a 3yr. old and I was still using my Sony baby call monitor which I still love, but now I need to see when she gets out of her bed and I wanted the two way feature "talk to the baby feature" so I could talk to her and tell her to get back in her bed. I should also say that I want to see as much of her room around her bed as I could her room is 11 ft. by 12ft I put the camera in the corner on a shelf six feet off the ground about 10 and Â½ ft away from her bed, so if she got out of her bed I could see where she was. I could also see her during the day playing in her room. Well, let me say that they at least now don't make a monitor with a "clear" picture.So I bought the 2.4 GHz MONITOR by SMART AV: It was good I could see her ok during the day, and at night with the night vision and I could hear her and she could hear me when I talked on it.CONS: Not the best picture but it was good enough. The camera did not adjust down far enough I had to put a coaster under the back half to get it to angle down some more. The big problem was it did not have the rechargeable batteries the other reviewers said it had. (Amazon told me it was probably because they bought it from a different seller not DBroth.) You can put regular batteries in it but if you want to plug it in you have to remove the batteries first. I tried to purchase the rechargeable batteries from them it has been a week and a half they still have not answered my emails. I returned it. Update: I never received a response.Next up the MOBICAM DXR DIGITAL MONITORING SYSTEM: it had a ok picture during the day a little grainy but you could see. Night vision was grainy but ok. CONS: grainy day and night vision, when you touch the talk button to speak to the child it did not always work I would have to let it go and press it again to get it to work. I had it replaced with a new one thinking it might have been that one and the new one did the same thing. I called Amazon and they said they are not selling these directly anymore because of that happening to the batch of these they had maybe a bad batch they are investigating it, but you can still buy it from third party sellers on Amazon. UPDATE: Amazon is now selling them again.Next up, was the SAMSUNG WIRELESS VIDEO SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM w/ 3.5" LCD: this one had the best picture of them all but only for during the day (although it had a yellow glow at the top of the screen from the light in the room but the light was not in the cameras view I adjusted the camera down even further and it still remained. It has a nice night light and music that you can turn on and off from the monitor. I really, really wanted to like it.CONS: The camera did not adjust down far enough for me, so I put a coaster under the back half to angle it down some more, There were also some "delays" (like when walking or just moving fast the screen would "miss some frames/some of the movement" in the picture.) The temperature gauge was not correct, the alarm for detection of sound in the room  was a pain to adjust, the zoom function was a BIG pain you have to go into the menu out of the "picture screen" and put it on zoom then go back to the "picture screen", the volume was not very loud at all my husband was like it doesn`t turn up louder than that?  The "talk to the baby" function was "choppy"(not as clear as the summer infant baby touch) and my absolute deal breaker was, I would think the MAIN REASON you would purchase a monitor like this the night vision: at night with and without a night light on in the room I could barely see anything much less my daughter in her bed you would really have to stare and look good to make any thing out, the infrared led's must not be strong at all. (If you want it for close up it might work I don't know never tested close up tested all of them in the same place about 10 and 1/2 feet away from her bed up on a shelf I need to see at least part of the room around her bed.)I was so aggravated by this search, I printed out a twenty percent off coupon from the internet for Babies R Us and went and bought the SUMMER INFANT BABY TOUCH MONITOR,  the new one they have with the touch screen monitor and pan and zoom camera. I put it to the test compared it to the SAMSUNG and MOBI. My two most important things were the night vision to see her at night and the "talk to the baby" function so I could talk to her. This summer infant model has a secure private connection unlike the other summer infant monitors. Its picture is ok (not HD but none of them are) slightly, slightly, slightly grainy during the day but still really good, and its night vision although a little grainy was the best out of all of them for the distance, (again I did not test close up) plus I can move the camera around remotely from the monitor to see where she's at in the room and I can zoom in easily the functions appear below and to the right of the picture when you touch the screen although the closer you zoom in the grainier it got but that was with ALL of the models I tested.AFTER A LOT OF TESTING AND DEBATE, I RETURNED THEM ALL EXCEPT FOR THE SUMMER INFANT BABY TOUCH MONITOR. I really like it. I am glad I just went ahead and spent a little more money and bought it. The pan and zoom features work great. (THIS IS THE ONLY MONITOR OUT OF THE ONES I TESTED THAT HAS THE ACTUAL PAN FEATURE. THE ABILITY TO MOVE THE CAMERA AROUND THE ROOM REMOTELY FROM THE CONTROLS ON THE MONITOR. The Samsung does not have the pan feature.) I can see her WHOLE room day or night. After a certain amount of time it goes into power save mode when it is not on the charger and turns off the picture but you can still hear the sound and if you want to see the picture again just press the button on the top. If it is on the charger the picture will stay on unless you press the button on the top to turn the screen back off. The monitor has a lithium-ion battery and the camera has the option to put regular batteries in it if you can not plug it in a outlet. The monitor also has a belt clip that doubles as the stand for it when the monitor is not on the charger. I called summer infant to ask about recommendations for the rechargeable battery for the monitor the company says not to charge the battery more than eight hours and let it run down before you put it back on the charger for maximum battery life.UPDATE: IT HAS BEEN TWO YEARS WITH MY SUMMER INFANT.I have since purchased a second extra camera so I can watch her in the play room too I love it.I STILL USE IT EVERYNIGHT. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT AT ALL. I THINK I SHOULD JUST MENTION. I ALSO HAVE NOT DROPPED OR POSSIBLY DAMAGED MINE IN ANYWAY.
