So I recently received the maxboost. Off first impressions I thought man what would happen if I were to drop my phone. Afterusing it for a few days overall it isn't bad. I do prefer the lightweight feel it has as oppose to the otter box case that I'm accustomed to. Also due to not having all the padding and covering, in comparison to a case I like otter box, I notice my cell reception as well as volume and speaker showed more clarity. All in all not bad. Would recommended to others.
