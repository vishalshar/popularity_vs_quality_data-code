I normally am an avid researcher before I purchase these kind of products that I am very umfamiliar with.  When we had to begin the potty training journey for our 2 1/2 year old son, I went to a BBRU and stood for quite some time staring at the different potty chair options.  I finally went with the Royal Potty because I thought the music would be a good incentive for him to want to use the chair.  Great concept in theory, but this particular product needs refining because there were too many negatives and I inevitably purchased a different potty seat.Some of the problems I faced were:1-The music kept going off at random times.  He'd be sitting on it and the fanfare would play when my son wasn't actually "going".  It gave the little guy such false hope!2-The bowl is pretty small and difficult to remove.  You have to give it a little tug to get it to come out.  My son would always want to "help" and really created more of a mess than it was worth.3-The seat has so many cracks and crevices that it was difficult to clean and sanitize.  Also, it would leak a bit here and there.4-My son is on the little side for his age- he's a skinny little thing.  And bless his heart for sitting on that potty trying so hard, but when he got up his bottom was redder than a cherry.  I felt so bad for him and can't imagine that it could have been comfortable for him.The crown stickers, chart and book were cool and he enjoyed that aspect but I knew that for my own piece of mind that we needed a different potty.  We ended up with the Training Rewards Soft Seat Potty & Stepstool by Graco and are thrilled with it.  Soft cushiony seat for his behind, bigger bowl, much easier to clean, and overall just a better product.  Good luck!
