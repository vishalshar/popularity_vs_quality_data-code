***this review have been updated****01/2015 - I love this bag!  The pockets are nice and roomy and I like that the changing table cover is in a zipper underneath the bag. Much easier than having one rolled up and attached.04/2016 update - the stitching at the bottom of the bag is ripped along the inside all the way across and the Velcro on the back pocket has stitching that's almost completely undone. This is very disappointing as we only use the bag ONCE A WEEK on average (the sitter has supplies on hand). The bag is falling apart after 14 uses essentially. Cheap cheap cheap crap.
