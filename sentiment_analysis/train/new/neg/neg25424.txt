Originally had the fleece sack in the new born size and it was AMAZING! My son grew out of it so I purchased this one in a small with the idea that I wouldn't have to worry about him getting too warm. There is way to much stretch in the cotton and no matter how tight I get my son swaddled he can wiggle his arms out, which makes this useless for us. Buy the fleece one!!
