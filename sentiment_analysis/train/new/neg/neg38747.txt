You get what you pay for. These "washcloths" have one side lightweight terry, the other side like a cotton jersey. Super cheesy quality. Edges are loosely surged. I ordered to use as per catchers for our newborn boy to help avoid him spraying the changing area. For that purpose they are great. Just absorbent enough for one use and affordably priced. Got another set for feeding wipes. For that purpose not so great...too thin to effectively wipe up spit up...only good for one use, then have to clean. I will be purchasing something different for feed wipes, but will keep both sets to use as sprinkler covers.
