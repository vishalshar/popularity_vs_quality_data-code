This mirror has a large enough clip to clip on to my window shade and tilts well enough to get a good view of my forward-facing toddler in her car seat.  It some with a suction cup that is really worthless.  The disadvantage of the shade clip is that if I want to flip the shade down, the mirror needs to be removed.  It is the most functional thing I could find thus far, but there has got to be room for design improvement.
