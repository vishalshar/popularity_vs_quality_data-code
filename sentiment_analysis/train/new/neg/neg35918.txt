These are wide enough but not long enough to drape over the front to keep the pants from touch the front of the toilet.  the two tiny peel and stick are placed too close together so only one piece would stick to a toilet seat cover that has a cutout on the front, which most public/commercial toilets have, so this thing does not stay in place when I try to lift a toddler/preschooler onto it always move out of place.  They are not individually wrapped for sanitary portability.
