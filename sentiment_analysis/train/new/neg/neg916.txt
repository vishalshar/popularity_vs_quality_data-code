I purchased these to replace the hot pack from my pyrex portable.  You get two packs in a set that can either be frozen or heated.  I heated both to replace one pyrex portable hot pack.I returned these to Amazon because they leaked.  When I heated them in the microwave (following the instructions) they expanded and the plastic seam separated allowing the gel to leak out the side.
