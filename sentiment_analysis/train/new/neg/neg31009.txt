Holds the diapers and wipes, but not excited about the Velcro attaching to the table with sticky tabs. Wish it had a different way to attach to the table. It is a little difficult to get the diapers out of the diaper pouch so we ended up using the side pouches for newborn diapers. I suppose that won't work when we get to the larger sizes.
