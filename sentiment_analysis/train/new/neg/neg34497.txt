I was pissed when I received the collar. I searched high and low trying to determine how many collars I would be getting in my purchase and I was never able to find that information. Once I received my package I was pissed to find only one collar when the picture showed multiple collars. I was even more upset with the fact that I payed 5 bucks for one collar when I could have bought 5 collars for 6 bucks at the local babies r us. I will never purchase anything from this vendor again, and I strongly recommend to them that they list how many collars you will be receiving or change the picture so it is not misleading.
