I'm very disappointed, because I really wanted this product to work.  I needed something that would keep our cats from trying to jump up into our play yard and/or crib.  To be fair, I can tell that the quality of the fabric is very nice... breathable, and durable feeling. The assembly was not difficult.  However, as of the time of my purchase (and my writing this review), the description on the product page is incorrect.  It states "Fits on all standard cribs, 4 in 1 cribs and play yards...", however when I opened the product and began reading through the manual, it clearly states "Do NOT use this product in conjunction with: a crib or cradle, a carry cot, a playpen, or any nursery product other than a cot or travel cot."  I went ahead and tried to set it up with our play yard, but unfortunately it did not work out.  It was way too big for the play yard (a larger sized Graco playpen), and the tent would droop down, with plenty of extra fabric on each side of the play yard.  Again, I'm disappointed because I really wanted it to work out.  I'm giving it 3 starts for the product description being incorrect as of the time of my buying/writing this review.  I have reported this description error to Amazon, in hopes that future buyers are not misled.
