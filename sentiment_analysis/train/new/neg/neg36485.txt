It's cute and all--the little wagon makes the gift, but none of the items were coordinated or of the quality shown in the picture.  Purple bottle, yellow bib, cheap plastic "key" rattle (the kind you get at the 99Â¢ store).  Flimsy little bear that wasn't wearing anything and random print romper, not matching appliqued items as described.  Not the class A gift we were hoping to give.  No scratch mitts, although the description mentions it in one place but not the other, so I'm not sure that I should have expected them.  See picture.UPDATE -- I can't see the picture I uploaded.  Makes my review seems dubious now, and I deleted the image from my camera already or I'd upload again.  As a result I removed one star.
