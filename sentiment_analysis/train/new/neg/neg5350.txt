This monitor is decent for the price, I guess. But I think I would have rather spent a little extra to get something a little better. The pro to the monitor is that it picks up the smallest sounds. But the problem is that there's so much static that you can barely hear the sounds that it picks up. There's so much static that it almost completely drowns out my crying baby!  If you run the monitor on just the batteries alone ( and unplug the AC adapter), then the monitor is pretty crystal clear. The only problem with that is that the battery life in that monitor is only like 1-2 nights (tops!). So, if you have the money to spend on a new 9V battery every night, or every other night, then I guess this monitor would be okay. But if you have that kind of money, I would suggest that you invest in a monitor that is better quality than this one. I think I am going to return this for something a little better.  I'm very disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually have such great quality products. I can't believe they would come out with something this poor of quality.  My suggestion: don't [spend] your money on this monitor.
