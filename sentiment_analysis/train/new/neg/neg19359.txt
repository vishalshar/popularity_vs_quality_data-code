Well, despite the fact that this toy has one a few national awards, it was a total flop in our house.  The suction cup is completly non-functional (it sticks for maybe 10 seconds before popping off whatever surface you stick it to, even after wetting the bottom) and the rattle is too heavy for most babies.  By the time they are big enough to hold the rattle, they are too old for it.  It is a pretty cool looking toy, and has a great design, I just wish it worked like it is supposed to.  My daughter did have some fun batting at it as I held the black and white "handle" (the part that sticks in the base). A much better toy is made by Early Years (or maybe The First Years - I can't remember) - it has a suction cup that actually works and a spinning disk with a clicking knob, clear plastic ball with mirror inside that spins, and a squeaker.  We have attached this to our infant swing tray, highchair, and table, and it stays put until we (or our 17 month old) pry it off.  I found it at Babies R Us (looked but didn't see it at amazon).
