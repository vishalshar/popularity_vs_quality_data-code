Not a fan of these; I originally had The First Years Take & Toss Snack Cups and needed a few more for feeding baby, and those were discontinued so I decided to try these. I rarely use them; the two smaller sizes are way too small to be useful. The plastic is thin and flimsy, and the lids are not easy to store neatly in the cabinet. They can click onto the container but they don't stack as a lid stack, which makes it impossible to stack the cups together to save space and then the lids together. I will say that the lids do snap on nice and tight for a secure seal, which is good, but overall I'm not impressed with this product after using The First Years' version.
