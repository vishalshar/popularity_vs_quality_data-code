We read a lot of reviews on kid's beds before we finally settled on this one.  As many others have said before, its very important to read the instructions all the way through before you begin.  My husband worked on it for over an hour, only to discover that he'd put one of the major panels on upside down because there was no mention of where the predrilled holes needed to be. The holes needed to be pointed upwards so the side railings could be attached.  Now he has to take apart nearly the entire bed and redo it, before we finish the two sliding drawers. That's not the bed's fault, obviously, but it is a pain in the butt to spend so much time putting the thing together.Its a decent bed, but it isnt the sturdiest thing in the world. I have bad knees, and tend to lean on things when I bend or kneel next to my kid to say goodnight.  Im very cautious to put any real weight on the side railings, even though it's screwed into the base/headboard in three places.  I'd take the 50 pound weight limit seriously on this bed. Its kind of wobbly and feels like it will break if someone other than a toddler rested on it.My younger daughter (18 months) LOVES her big brother's bed because its the perfect size for her to crawl into and out of.  Its nice and low to the ground, so when my son falls or climbs out in the middle of the night (which he's done already in the three days since we got it), he wont hurt himself.I wish it were stronger and easier to assemble for the money we paid for it, but like I said, it's fine for now.
