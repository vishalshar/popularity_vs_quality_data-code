My daughter (8 months) has used the Halo sleeps sacks for a while now and we love them.  I wanted something long sleeves for her in the winter.  She is tall for her age (90% percentile)and the length of the sack (6-18 months) fits ok for now but the sleeves are very long.  She is a thumb sucker and no amount of rolling the sleeves up will fix the problem.  They keep tumblig down and cover her hands plus for 2-3 inches.  So sad, back to our Halo sleeveless sacks.  This would probably work nicely if your baby has long arms or is not a thumb sucker.  They are nice and cozy.
