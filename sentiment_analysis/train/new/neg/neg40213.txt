Pros - easy to hold onto, great size (8 oz, not too big, not too small), and I love that it transitions to a big kid cup.Cons - at least when my little one drinks from it, she sucks so hard that she deflates the soft top and I'm always squeezing the spout for her to let air back in so she can drink from it again.  Not a great design.We only use this sippy cup as a back up for at home on the weekends.  I wouldn't buy it again.
