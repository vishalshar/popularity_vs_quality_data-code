Well, we bought this crib aboutt 10 months ago when we started trying to conceive. We finally got the opportunity to put the crib together and found ourselves to be a little disappointed.First, the color we purchased said Espresso. Not sure who dubbed a lighter brown as Espresso but this color definitely didn't match any of the espresso furniture we buy, which is everything wood in my home because it's my favorite wood color. Second, the crib has several nicks, scratches, and markings from what I can assume was poor handling to get into the package. Finally, the weight capacity was no place to be seen but I placed my hand on the mattress as I was placing the sheets on it and heard a lot if cracking sounds. I quickly removed my hand and looked for damage, I saw none, but definitely made me nervous. A friend placed her 25 lb toddler in the crib and it seemed to be fine but I'm not sure that it would hold much more weight.I'm not able to return the crib set at this point because it's been so long but I just wanted to let anyone else who purchases this crib to know... Put it together ASAP and make sure it's what you want and is in good condition. I'd hate for you to have the same issues I'm having.
