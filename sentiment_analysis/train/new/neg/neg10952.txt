It broke in four months and they have nothing comparable to replace it with. Love the recline and the big basket and the feature to push down the basket (though basket is where the frame broke). Hate the opening and closing mechanisms, especially because of the side latch makes it so hard to open with one hand and the opening position means resting it on the basket, such that the cloth there gets scraped.
