I have jersey sheets which are amazingly soft, so I thought this fitted sheet would be cozy for my baby.  Not at all. Fabric felt surprisingly coarse and did not get better even after several washes.  I ended up buying the American Baby Company heavenly soft fitted crib sheets and they are amazing.  Skip buying Carters and choose something else.  (I'd recommend American Baby Company but it is pricier.  Worth it!)
