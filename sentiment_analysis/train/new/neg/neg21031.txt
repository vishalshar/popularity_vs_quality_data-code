This is actually a great idea, but the idiots who packaged it created a ton of creases that are obvious once applied to the window and make it look like old window tinting that's coming off.  If they simply rolled the sheet up and sold it in a tube, we would not have this problem.Aside from this major negative, this is a great solution if you want to be able to roll the window down with the shade on it.  You can also cut it up into shapes/sizes to custom fit your window.Based on other reviews, I think a lot of people don't know how to install this correctly (blame it on the vague directions that come in the box).  So I am copying another reviewer's tips on installing from a similar product's page.  If you follow these tips, it should be a breeze (though don't expect the creases to go away):Here's what you do...1. Clean the window to remove any dust and lint.2. Remove the cling from package and avoid too many finger prints on it. Also, try not to place it on your car seats or anywhere that it can pick up dust/lint.3. Spray a light mist of glass cleaner on your window.4. "Float" the cling on the wet surface until you get it where you want it.5. Using an old credit card, work any bubbles/liquid out from the center of the cling towards the edges. Be careful to do this gently and slowly so that the card doesn't catch on the plastic and make a kink.6. Use paper towels to soak up glass cleaner as it seeps out from the edges.7. If you have any stubborn areas, lift the cling away from the glass, spray more cleaner, and repeat steps 5-6.
