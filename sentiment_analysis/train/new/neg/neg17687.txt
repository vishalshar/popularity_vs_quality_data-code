This was a lot thinner than I expected. It feel like a couple layers of material (like tear resistant nylon, thicker weave) that was sewn together. The top elastic clips under the headrest and the bottom barely makes it around the bottom lumbar. I can predict what's going to happen. In another season, the elastic will either break or the uv will disintegrate it leaving you with a limp bottom strap.Will it protect you seat's back? Depends, from dirt and minor scuffs, yes. However, I can't see how it will cushion anything more than that. Hopefully junior won't wing the seat a good one otherwise he'll be riding sneakerless.Meanwhile, I won't return it but I will be keeping an eye out for better. For now I gave it 3 stars, once the elastic pops or limps, I'll change it depending on how bad.
