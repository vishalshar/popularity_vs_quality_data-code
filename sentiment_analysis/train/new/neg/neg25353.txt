I liked the idea of a mirror with the remote and light.  However, I was disappointed to find that the light was not bright enough at nite for me to see my newborn.Due to the plastic shell covering half of the light and the un-bright bulbs, I could only see half of my baby's body AND only dimly so.My husband graciously modified the light by switching the manufacturer's bulb with three led lights.  Oh yeah baby!Now, I can see all of my baby's body and the light is bright enough for me to get enough of a view when safely glancing in the rear view mirror when driving in the dark at nite.The other thing I would change about this product if I could is the 10 second limit on the light.  It automatically turns off after 10 seconds.  Most of the time, this is fine.  However, sometimes my baby is awake at nite and it would be great to have the light stay on longer than 10 seconds (without having to continually press the button on the remote).All in all, okay for $20, but I sure wish I could have been on the product review board when this item was being researched by the manufacturer.
