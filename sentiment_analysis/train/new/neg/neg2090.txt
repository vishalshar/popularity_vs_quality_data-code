This was very easy to set up and I like the look & quality of the gate, and spacing of the bars, small enough that my 5lb and 10lb Maltese pups can't stick their heads through it.The one issue I do have though is that the gate will not stay straight. It tends to buckle in at the joint when using the extension on it, I need it to fit a width of 40", and the extension buckles in right at the connection to the main gate, causing the gate have a weird "V" shape, not very aesthetic looking at all. See attached pic. My guess is if you don't need to use the extension, it will be perfectly fine.
