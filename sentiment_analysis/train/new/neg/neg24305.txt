I originally ordered this item because of reviews where others mentioned that the cotton covers that came with the boppy in the bundles were cheap and rough.  I have very sensitive skin, so I ordered this cover along with the bare naked boppy instead.  A month later, I got a hand me down boppy with the basic cotton cover from my cousin and found that cover, while not as soft as this one, perfect acceptable for general use.  While I like this Organic Cotton Slipcover, and it IS softer than the basic cotton one that came in the bundle, I dont think I would have spent the extra $$ for it had I known ahead of time that the basic cotton one was decent enough.
