I really wanted to love this bedding set.  After all frogs, snails and puppy dog tails; that's what little boys are made of!  There are, however, some major issues with the set.  I have outlined my pros and cons below:Pros:The colors are excellent!The embroidery is very cuteThe comforter is very thick (this is prior to washing)The bumper has the designs on both sidesCons:The embroidery is poorly executedThere are many loose threads that need to be trimmedThe batting in the bumper clumped horribly upon the first wash (I have not tried to wash the comforter yet but I am sure the same will happen to it)The bumper is sewn extremely looseThe bumper does not fit the crib properlyMy greatest concern with this set was the bumper even though I will never use several of the items in the set.  I have bought a new bedding set for each of my 3 kids and this is the only one where the bumper is so poorly made it is actually a suffocation hazard.  The batting should have been tacked in place and it should have been in 4 pieces and not one.  Since the bumper is one piece, there is no good way to compensate for the incorrect size (could have been done if it was in 4 pieces).The price for this set was a deal but that is not why I bought it.  I chose this based on the theme and colors.  I would have gladly paid more for a quality product.I will attempt to straighten and tack these items myself.  I may improve my rating if they are fixable.
