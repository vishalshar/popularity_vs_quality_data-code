The cover in the picture is really cute.  The one I got had a tan background with green/black designs.  Basically, it looks like camouflage. Also, the boning is thin and doesn't hold the material out, so I constantly have to lift it up in order to peek in at my nursing daughter.  I like that it has a lot of material to cover me, I just wish it was more like the picture shown.
