I figured since this dresser was pretty cheap and reading the given info that it couldn't be much but in my opinion the price for this dresser is still way too high.If you are looking into buying this dresser I will give you a fair warning what you might be getting yourself into:Most parts are made of pressed wood with laminate. The back of this dresser is a thin piece of cardboard that you have to attach by hammering a bunch nails into it. The drawer slides are made of plastic and the top board is made of pressed wood.Even the cheapest Ikea product seems like high quality furniture compared to this piece.
