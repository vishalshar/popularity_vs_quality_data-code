I've had this thermometer for less than two years. It was amazing for the first year. Incredibly accurate, as long as the measurement was done properly, which was easy.About six months ago, it started failing. Would consistently give readings in the mid-90s, much too low for a child with a fever (she was at 102°, as I found out with a different thermometer with a confirmation at the doctor's office). I would clean it, ensure it was dry (it always has been), change the battery, etc. Still in the mid-90s. I put it away and tried again today to check. Apparently my temperature is 70.2°, which I'm pretty sure isn't right...
