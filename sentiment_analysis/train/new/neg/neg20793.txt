Not awesome... we used these to connect two First Years Jet umbrella strollers to transport my kids through the airport.  They were essential for the airport because it allowed me to push the kids while my husband handled the car seats.  However, the stroller is hard to push because of the play, the fact that they were very wide together (couldn't fit through doorways), hard to turn, and the weight difference with my kids.  We were using American Airlines which limites stroller size to a 20# umbrella type stroller for gate check... otherwise I definitely would have used my standard double stroller.  The double umbrella strollers on the market that are <20# all have a weight limit of 30# and would be too small for my 4 year old.  I definitely wanted a stroller for transporting a 1 and 4 year old through Chicago airport so my options were very limited.  These were a life saver in our situation but I can't imagine using them in any other situation.
