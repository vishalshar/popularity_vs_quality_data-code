We bought these at the end of December 2015. They started leaking everywhere a few months ago and I just found mold/gunk/mildew in the inner parts of the little white rings that can't be cleaned out. We soak them as soon as our kid is done with his milk or juice and dish wash all the parts. After finding the moldy gunk I tried more soaking, boiling and then scrubbing. Nothing worked. They were all thrown in the recycle bin. So gross. Never again.
