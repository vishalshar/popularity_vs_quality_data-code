In theory, I like the idea of this product. My baby frequently sucks on the carrier straps and it is difficult to wash the straps on the carrier. These handy pads cover the straps and make it easy to keep the area clean that the baby sucks on. It's an added bonus that they are organic so that none of the pesticides used in cotton find their way into my baby's mouth. However, several of the snaps on the pads I received did not fasten properly -- they kept coming undone very easily -- so that the pads don't stay on the carrier. So I'm returning them for a replacement. I don't know if it's a problem in just the set I received or in the product manufacture in general... will soon find out.
