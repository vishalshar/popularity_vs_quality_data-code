We had the motorola baby monitor camera for 2 years now and were pretty happy with it, even though the battery life isn't the longest we didn't really care, as we kept it plugged in for most of the time anyways. Everything else was fine. But recently our monitor broke and i was trying to buy just the monitor directly from motorola and this was the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my entire life. I tried to call the hotline several times and either my call got disconnected before i could reach anybody or while i was talking to somebody, and even though i gave them my number, they never called me back. This time I was able to talk to somebody on the phone again, and first she said i can't buy just the monitor and then, after i gave her my model number, she said its fine and said it costs $69 or something, which was totally fine for me. Then I gave her my credit card details and told her to check if the card is activated as i wasn't sure and then this lady hung up on me. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! I WILL NEVER BUY ANY Motorola product ever again. This was my fourth attempt to try to buy the monitor. Never in my life again. There are also way better cameras out there to begin with.
