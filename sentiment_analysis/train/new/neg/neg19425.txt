This is a single product made of very thin fabric. The size is appropriate so the baby won't strangle herself but if she drools or spits up it is completely soaking wet as the fabric is not water resistant. She ends up with a rash from the wet strap rubbing her chin. also the fabric looks quite dirty even after washing it and air drying frequently I can't seem to make it look clean again. The clip is nothing fancy. I expected better for this price.
