This playard is good like all the Pack and Play basic playards. It folds relatively easily and the wheels are convenient to move it from one room to the other. I really like the attachment that stores diapers,cream, wipes (in a small case) and pacifiers. Some models don't have this attachment which is really useful. But I didn't like the mobile nor the sound device. The bears are too pale and it doesn't have any music or movement. My daughter didn't like it at all. The sounds and light device is another disaster because the light is too low and you almost can't hear the music (I just put it away).  I have the Winnie the Pooh playard and its mobile is much better although it doesn't have a space to store anything.
