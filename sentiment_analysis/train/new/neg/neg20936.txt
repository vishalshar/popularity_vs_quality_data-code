I tried this cup in place of our normal munchkin brand to see if it would hold up to our toddlers' chewing of the no-spill spout any better and was shocked & disappointed to find that the cups leak horribly out of the sides (like where the top screws on to the main body of the cup). These are awful. We will be going back to our normal brand, which at least don't leak right out of the package like these. Very disappointing product.
