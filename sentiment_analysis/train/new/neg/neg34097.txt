I just tried the product today. I am not sure if my 3.5 months old baby has developed strong enough back to sit in it but thought I'd would try. She loves this walker. For now, I set the seat a bit higher than her height to have her legs danglings because she doesnt have strong enough leg muscles yet. She loves to be pulled and pushed and loves the toy part.The added review after a week of use:I see how other cutomers complain about the toy part breaking. I looked closely why baby's drool or spit fall right on to the toy. The design of the seat is made that the seated baby leans toward the toy instead of against the back. This is a bit annoying and thought about returning the product but it just is too muscle hasle. I am trying to add some pads on the seat to see if it works. I hope as the baby grows, she wont lean toward the toy too much. Regardless of the seat design, my baby seems to like it though.
