We've been using this tub for our son for about 6 months (from 18 months old to 2 years old).  My only complaint with it is that it seems to be a breeding ground for mold and mildew.  We empty and dry the tub every night, but it still has mildew and mold growing all over it.  Nothing has helped, not even frequent scrubbing with bleach.  I finally gave up and bought a different model today.If you can get past the material being a great host for mold and mildew, I will say that the size and durability have been good and is why I gave it three stars.  It fits well in a standard sized tub and provides lots of cushioning to protect little ones from careening into the sides of the hard tub.  Yet, there is ample room for bathing and bath play.  Our son is on the small side, but the tub seems like it would easily accommodate up to a three year old.We did not experience any problems with the material ripping or with the drainage valve.  We found it much easier to tilt the tub over when full of water instead of using the valve.  This seems like it would be much harder on the tub, but still like I said we never had a problem with rips or tears.
