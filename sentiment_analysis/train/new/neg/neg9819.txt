This seat would be great for a little girl however, I have a little boy and it is just not practical. It fits the toilet well and is easy to remove but that does not really matter when your child can not use it.  The opening that they sit in is very small and not made for boys.  Even when we sat him all the way at the back of the seat he was still rubbing the front of the seat.  There was no way he could pee and not have it go all over the place.  Again if you have a girl great product but if you have a boy don't waste your money!!
