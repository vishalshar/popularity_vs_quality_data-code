I liked the idea behind this product, preventing tipping forward or backward while allowing angling left or right. All of the other anti-tip devices I found were straps, that would prevent tipping forward, but maybe not tipping backwards. However, I had a similar problem as other reviewers where the product did not fit my TV.I recently bought a VIZIO M551d-A2R 55-Inch. The mounting holes on the back of the TV are spaced 400mm apart. However the stationary mounting holes on this anti-tip product appear to be spaced an even 16", or about 406mm, and I was unable to get the device to attach. The arms of this product extend to accommodate TVs with 600mm or 800mm spacing, so it should work with TVs that meet this standard. I did not check the measurement for the 200mm standard.
