We absolutely loved this bottle. It doesn't have a lot of parts to clean. It's easy to put together. It has a wide neck which makes it easier to get a brush in to clean. It has lids that can hold formula reserves. Basically, it was our perfect bottle.We have hardwood floors, and they're not very forgiving if things are dropped onto them. We liked to keep about 8 bottles, a couple in the diaper bag, maybe one or two upstairs, just leaving enough around so you don't always have to clean them. We've probably bought an additional 6-7 bottles just as replacements to keep us up to 8 in the last 4 1/2 months. The plastic bottle cracks if dropped from just about any distance at all (off the couch, off the bathroom counter into the sink, etc). I dropped one today out of the diaper bag while leaning over, all of about a 1 1/2 foot drop, and it cracked. Usually they cracked along the sides, the one today was the first that cracked on the bottom. This bottle was also full, so it fell harder, but most of the others were empty, so it happens either way.A note, we don't use a bottle warmer, and we don't use a dishwasher. So they're not subject to any abuse (other than baby's), they just aren't durable. Also, these aren't repeat drops. One good drop is all they last.If you've got carpets all throughout the house and never go ANYWHERE that isn't carpeted, this is a perfect bottle! If you want to spend a few bucks a month buying replacements after your baby tosses them onto the ground, this is also a perfect bottle for you. Otherwise, save your money.
