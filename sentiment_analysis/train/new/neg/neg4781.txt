We LOVE these to use for our baby when we go out to eat, however, this specific brand has been trouble for us. I have never been able to get tge strups off of the sides in order for then to stick to the table. The top and bottom come off fine, but the sides are impossible. ..which of course means that our daughter rips it off of the table within minutes after she gets her tiny hand under either side. These were the cheapest, which is wjy I ordered them. We have since run out and I spent a tiny bit more to get a better brand...and those are fantastic.
