I got this because my 2 month old daughter refused to take a bottle (and still does in fact).  And I mean would not even latch onto the bottle.  She could not be fooled between bottle and breast.  I will say this is THE MOST like a breast that I have seen, and trust me, I have tried lots of bottles.  I like how it is so soft and squishy and the nipple is short.  My daughter basically gags on all the other ENORMOUS nipples on most bottles.  After rubbing my smell all over this one she did latch onto it and sucked an ounce down when I tried...the most success by far we've had.There are some definite downsides however to this bottle: it has a twist bottom so you have to turn the bottle over to pour the milk in and therefore a little bit will leak out of the nipple, can be somewhat messy.  I also don't like the cap.  It covers almost the whole bottle instead of just the nipple so it's really big and kind of hard to get on or off.Overall, I would say if you're having issues with your child taking a bottle, this is worth a shot, but if your kiddo will take most anything, go for something more practical and less expensive and something you can buy in the store.
