Some screws were already stripped on arrival.  The threads on the screws were smashed, so we used them on the bottom feet to be less noticeable.  One of the wooden arms didn't have the screw holes drilled properly, and didn't line up enough to get a screw into.  Eats batteries very fast, especially if you use the rocker.  The rocker is jerky and loud.  The music is annoying.  Every time my son rolled over or moved, it thumped and jerked and would wake him up.  I think he also was very uncomfortable in it, and that was why he was tossing and turning so much.  We just moved our son into our bed to sleep with us because this crib wasn't working out for him.  He was sleeping without all the tossing and thrashing after that.  I bought this because I thought it was really pretty, which it's good it is, since I only use it as a storage now.
