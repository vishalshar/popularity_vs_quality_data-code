The seller sent us one that was obviously used already, had perfume in the cloth that stunk up the place, baby hated that. We never really used it since it was a maybe clean, maybe dirty thing and little ones immune systems don't need that kind of doubtful exposure. It's movement was super robotic and the sound it comes programmed with are reedy, tinny, just sharp to the ears.
