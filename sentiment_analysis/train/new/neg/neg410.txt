After reading all the great reviews, I bought this pump as a backup for the electric (Medela Pump In Style Traveler) pump that I keep at work. Well, I've only used the Isis a few times, but so far I don't like it very much. The manufacturer claims it's quiet and discreet, but half way through the first use, the handle started making a loud creaking noise. Also, the tubing is not angled downward, so I have to lean forward while pumping to let the milk run into the bottle. It comes with a fancy looking rubber piece that is supposed to help with let-down, but I had to take it off to get any suction at all! A lot of milk collects in the well of the pump and doesn't drip into the bottle - a real waste since I was only able to get one ounce from one breast in ten minutes with this pump. Overall, the Medela pump is far better. I do like the Avent bottles, but you can use them with the Medela pump if you buy Avent's adapter kit.
