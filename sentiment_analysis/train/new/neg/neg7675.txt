I really wanted to love this, I LOVED my moby wrap.  However, even on the tightest setting, the carrier was still a little too big for me (I'm 5'5", 125lb.).  My little guy just didn't seem comfy in it.  I love that it crosses in the back, a big reason I like the moby wrap, but it was a challenge to get on and off, and difficult to adjust straps once on.  Ordered the lillebaby and very happy so far, it also has the option to cross the straps in the back.
