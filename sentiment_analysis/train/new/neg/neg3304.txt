This is really useful when needing to rinse waste off of our cloth diapers or big messes on our son's clothes. The first one I purchased had the top button break on it when I was trying to unsnap it for storage. I still like this product and ordered another one though. I like the clip that holds diapers or clothes in place as you're spraying them off. It also has a fairly big opening, making it pretty easy to spray off the soiled diaper or clothes. I would recommend keeping it set up if you can, and not unsnapping after every use to prevent wear and tear on the snaps. I think this product could be better if it had stronger snaps; probably not metal but maybe a stronger plastic. I also wish the price were a little lower as well. I would still recommend this to others, but would advise caution with snapping and unsnapping too frequently until the design is improved.
