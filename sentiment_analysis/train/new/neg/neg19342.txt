Before you purchase this, just note that it is made of flimsy paper, and looks like a homemade craft  you could make yourself with less than $5.00 worth of supplies.  I thought it looks very modern, simple and classy, and not so "babyish" which is why I ordered it but when I opened the box, was very surprised that is was just a paper craft.  I would think a baby would tear it apart in a heartbeat if they got their hands on it.  I will be returning the product.  If you just happen to want a paper mobile that is very simple and out of reach of any little hands, I guess it would be okay as it is a very pretty color of grey. However, if you are searching for a true crib mobile, I would not purchase.
