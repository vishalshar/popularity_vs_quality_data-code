This towel is ok.  It a large size which is nice but its not a top quality towel I could buy a larger much softer towel for 20 bucks so I feel like your paying over 20.00 just to have a hood on it.  Don't get me wrong it works but for so much money it could be a softer towel, I have smaller carter's hooded towels that I paid less than 20 bucks for and they are softer
