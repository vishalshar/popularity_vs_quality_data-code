Edited to Add:  After only a few uses with my 6 month old son tugging on it, the strings to tie the bumper to the crib ripped off the bumper.  So now, I just have a bumper that's not fastened to the crib.I am seriously annoyed because I registered (and received) this 13 piece GEENNY Froggy Set because the GEENNY website represented that it was made of 100% cotton (the Amazon page does not state what the material is).  When I received it, I checked the bedding set.  The bedding set instead is made of 65% polyester and the pillow/cushion and other items are made of 100% polyester.  Plus it's really really scratchy and thin.  While the pattern is cute, there is no way I am going to put my newborn on this awful, synthetic bedding.  I plan to return it immediately.
