I was happy these were stickers so I didn't have to use an iron.  However they are smaller than I expected but mostly I was disappointed that the word 'months' is written in white and on most of the stickers---- with the color combination--- you just can't see it in pictures.  I took what seemed like a million pictures and none really came out great-- you have to strain to see--- plus the stickers are kinda shiny and reflect the flash a little.  I bought them because they were the only ones that didn't seem as girlie and they were stickers.  I am only so so (slightly) happy with them.
