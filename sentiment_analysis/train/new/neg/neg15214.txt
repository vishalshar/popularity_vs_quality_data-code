***EDITED AGAIN 5/14/12***And now the chair is kaput. I was rocking my now-almost-2-year-old as part of our bedtime routine and suddenly there was a crashing/cracking noise and we dropped an inch or two. I figured one of the bolts had fallen out (it's happened before) but one of the bearings had been ripped away from the chair, leaving damage to the wood. It might be fixable, but honestly, I'm sick of replacing screws and bolts when they fall out and constantly tightening and WD-40ing this thing to keep it in working order. I really wanted this chair to be a good cheaper alternative to a more expensive rocker and it just didn't work out. :( Probably going to put it out to the curb tomorrow and go buy a recliner. So disappointed to be tossing the chair I've been rocking my little one to sleep in every night for the better part of two years!***EDITED 10/3/11****Well, we've had the glider for the better part of a year now, and sadly, it has not held up. It is now squeaking constantly no matter how much we tighten and WD-40. We still rock our 14-month-old nightly as part of our bedtime routine, and it's now annoying and feels kind of rickety. Unfortunately, the quality has just not stood the test of time. I'm really sorry to say that, because I wanted to love this chair and it is very comfortable to sit in. Our Shermag, which also gets daily use, works as well as it did the day we got it. If anything, I think the rocking motion has gotten smoother on it over time. I mentioned in the original review that I thought the Shermag would outlast the Stork Craft, but I didn't think the SC would poop out THIS soon! The SC would be a great rocker for grandma's house, but if you plan on rocking for more than a few months, this one is a waste of money, sorry to say. You're better off investing in a good one up front.*****We already have a $300 Shermag rocker that we use in our nursery, and we got the Stork Craft Tuscany Glider/Ottoman when we wanted a 2nd chair but had less of a budget. Here are the main differences:--- The Shermag is noticeably "plusher". The cushions are much, much softer. The Stork Craft has a pretty crunchy foam seat that needed to be broken in (not a lengthy process -- I kneeled on the cushion a few times before putting it on the seat). If, like me, you appreciate a firm cushion, you won't think this is a problem. Both chairs are attractive, and the quality of the Stork Craft fabric is nicer than I expected for the price point.--- The Shermag is heavier and sturdier. I would be surprised if it didn't outlast the Stork Craft. (Hey, you get what you pay for!)--- The Stork Craft was MUCH easier to assemble. Many fewer steps as the ottoman and bottom part of the chair (the glider) were fully assembled in box. My only complaint re: the assembly is that a hole was not drilled where it should have been to connect the left arm of the chair to the base. Each arm attaches in three places, and I found it to be sturdy enough without the third bolt that I didn't bother returning it. Next time my dad is over, I'll have him bring his drill and fix it for me ... no biggie. In the meantime, the arm doesn't wiggle with regular use.--- Yes, the Stork Craft squeaks. It squeaks loudly enough to render it completely unusable. My dog actually came running in from the other room the first time I used it and started barking at the chair because she thought it was an animal, ha! The squeaking comes from the bolts on the glider part of the chair. I sprayed some WD-40 on the joints, and voila! No squeaking. If anything, I would say the gliding motion is now smoother than my Shermag.--- The seats are different sizes. Once you have all the cushions and padding on, the Stork Craft seat is 18 inches across at the armrests and 17 inches deep, vs. the Shermag's 20 inches across and 20 inches deep. The back of the seat is longer on the Stork Craft -- 28 inches vs. 26. I am short and slightly overweight (5'4 with a long torso/short legs, size 14) and the Stork Craft fits me much better. However, I am sure the Shermag would be much more comfortable for a tall/long-legged woman, an average man, or someone more heavyset.--- The Shermag has a lever to lock the chair in place, which I need on that chair to stand up smoothly while holding a sleeping baby since I have to scoot forward before I can touch the floor. The Stork Craft doesn't have the locking mechanism, and I thought I would miss it; but since the seat actually fits my legs, I have no problem getting in and out of the chair gracefully. (And believe me, that's a feat!)Overall, yes, the quality is obviously nicer on a more expensive chair. But the only dealbreaker for me was the squeaking, and it was an easy, $5 fix. If you are petite and looking for a nice, inexpensive rocker, this will definitely suit your needs! If you are tall/heavyset, you will definitely need to invest in a different chair.
