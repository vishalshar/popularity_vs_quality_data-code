I know that the review is about the product and not about the service. However, as there is only one vendor selling this item on Amazon (at least when I bought it), in this case I am going to say something regarding the packing quality. I opened the package in front of the UPS carrier and it was completely broken, so I didn't accept the shipment and he took it back with him.It is a pity because the item is beautiful but this seller doesn't have common sense about how to pack fragile objects. Packing was so poor and communication is not easy either because I am still waiting for a response to see if I am going to be refunded.I have read other costumers reviews and they also had the same problem. Then I think that if after so many disappointed costumers this seller still doesn't take care in the packing process it really doesn't worth it to try again, because it will certainly arrive broken again.
