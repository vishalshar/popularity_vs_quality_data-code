First the good- my baby loves his bouncy seat and it can calm him like nothing else.  My major gripe about this product is that the indentation for his bottom seems too high causing him to slump to the bottom unless he is strapped in.  If I just want to put him down while he is sleeping (he sleeps better sitting up) then clasping him in is inconvenient and usually ends up waking him up.  When he is strapped in, he kind of "dangles" from the harness.  He doesn't seem to mind, but there isn't anything outstanding about this product so I would say if you're looking for the cream of the crop, this isn't it, on the other hand it isn't bad for the price.
