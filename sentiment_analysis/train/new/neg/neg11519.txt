Just received the potty for my little guy.  We've tried numerous other potties and he must not be ready.  Forget buying the First Steps multi-function potty that makes into a step stool and can go on top of the toilet seat.  This is a piece of junk that never closes right and is almost impossible to get opened (when you want it to!) to empty the bowl.  Have used the cushioned seat adapter for the toilet seat too.  Out of desperation I ordered this potty because my little boy loved the video.  I'm not sure the description gives you the dimensions so I will.  The teeny tiny one-piece molded plastic potty sits about 4-1/2 inches off the floor from the base of the potty to the top of the seat.  Once straddled, the bowl itself is about 5" across and about 6-1/2" front to back.  I guess this would be a perfect size if you're training a 10 month old.  However, if you have a child who is training at a later age (my guy is 36 months) and is even of average height and weight, this thing is way too tiny.  My guy is 37-1/2" and weighs 31lbs - which is only considered "average" for his age.  Also, for the $20 bucks it costs, it is way over priced.  The box it comes in is really cool and probably cost more to produce than the potty.  So like I said, perhaps if you're lucky enough to get your 12-18 month old interested in sitting on the potty, this might work for you.  Pass on it though if your child is much past 24 months or on the high end of height and weight.
