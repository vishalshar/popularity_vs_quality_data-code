I ordered this pump out of desperation and I loved it when it arrived and for the first few weeks of use...until yesterday.  I was only using 1 of the 2 units and yesterday because I needed to take one with me decided to use the other unit only to find out that it does not work at all...no power is going to the unit whether by battery use or plug in electricity.  Used the other unit.  This morning needed to express milk only to find the unit that I had been using although it comes on has lost some of its suction capacity.  Would like to have it replaced without me sending back the unit that is working because i need to express the excess milk but can't find the proper customer service option....need help and a new pump
