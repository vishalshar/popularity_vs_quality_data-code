I was searching for a tent I could use for my 7 month old to play in on the beach and to also sleep in at night instead of traveling with a pack n play.  We first purchased the KidCo PeaPod that comes with an attached mattress but it seemed to be too hot since there is only mesh around the bottom.  It also didn't sit up very high and the Kilofly is supposed to be taller.  The Kilofly does have more mesh but unfortunately it sags quite a bit on the sides and curves up on the bottom as well so it doesn't seem safe for babies as roomy or as safe for babies.  It is supposed to be 20 inches tall but it measures closer to 14 inches in the middle where the child would be sitting.  We are returning the item.  We found another popup tent that doesn't sag on the sides and sits up higher which is this one, OrangeTag Baby Infant Bed Canopy Mosquito Net http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J4HUAZ0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00.  The OrangeTag one seems to be a pretty cheap one from China but it sits up taller than the other two and is more breathable.  It does come with a cotton mattress you can put in the bottom but it seems too soft to be baby friendly for sleeping.  I've attached some pictures to compare the 3 tents to hopefully help you make a decision for what is best for your needs.  Let me know if you have any questions.  We kept the OrangeTag Baby Infant Bed Canopy.
