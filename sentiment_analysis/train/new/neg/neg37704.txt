The pad is thinner but works for my daughter for when she falls while trying to crawl. My biggest disappointment is there's a big purple stamp on one of the tiles that says "made in China" with other numbers stamped as well. It's on the smooth side and I don't want to turn the tile over. The big ugly stamp on the tile kind of defeats the whole purpose of buying a cute tile design.
