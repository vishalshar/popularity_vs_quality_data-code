I am so sad about this product. I have others from my first child and they were larger sizes so didn't notice this issue. My daughter weighs 12 pounds and this is for babies larger! The neck hole is so tiny that I can't believe it would be safe my my little girl or anyone else. Mine has a head in he 9th percentile and the neck hole was already squeezing at her!!!
