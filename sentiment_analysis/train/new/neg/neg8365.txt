Brilliant idea, my daughter loves it! However, the spring in the coupling adapter on one side broke after only a few months and the one on the other side is now not working either. We only have the board for 8 months. Its unsafe to use it now, since it detaches itself at times. Unfortunately the Englacha customer care was not very friendly about the matter, hence the one star rating.They offered me one new coupling adapter for the right side but told me in a rude manner that its my own fault that the other side is broken since, in their opinion, I didn't use the board correctly. I did however use the velcro straps that are also used to secure the board to the stroller and followed the instructions to attach the board to the stroller. I'm quiet angry about the way I was treated which was also ignored by Englacha Customer Care after I told them I was not happy about the way I was spoken to.As I found out now, its a common problem for the springs of the adapter to break in this older model and there is a newer model with stronger connector springs. I regret that I didn't buy the board elsewhere.
