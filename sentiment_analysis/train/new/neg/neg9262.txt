My 11 month old baby's nursery is on a different level than our bedroom so it is very important that we have eyes in his room.  I purchased this monitor less than a year ago, and from the moment we plugged it in it has been nothing but a hassle.  The monitor would constantly need to be reinstalled and plugged into my router throughout the ten months we used it and now won't work at all.  I have asked for assistance via the ibaby support page with no response back.  I am very disappointed in this product.  As this is outside of the return window for Amazon this review page is my only outlet to provide feedback.
