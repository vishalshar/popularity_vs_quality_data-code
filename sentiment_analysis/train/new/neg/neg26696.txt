Love OXO but we must have gotten a defective cup. We haven't even had it for very long. It is also only hand washed. My daughter uses this for preschool. It travels to and from in a normal cup holder in her Chicco car seat. Bummed, we really wanted to love this since it has a handle. Her other OXO Sippy's are holding strong though!
