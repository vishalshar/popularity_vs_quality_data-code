As OTHERS HAVE STATED:This is made of TWO HALVES GLUED TOGETHER!!What this means is that they come apart (in our case) almost immediately and you come to the realization that your baby has been SUCKING ON GLUE for however long you didn't notice the halves coming apart..We had it for maybe 2 days before this happened. Extremely disappointed.To be fair.. Natursutten makes some soothers that our baby enjoys but this Teether Toy Star is absolutely terrible.Hervana Panda Teether we ordered at the same time is made of a solid molded piece and she enjoys that almost as much.EXTREMELY disappointed with this.
