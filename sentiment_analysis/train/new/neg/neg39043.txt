I read a lot of testimonial before purchasing this stroller, however I convinced myself that only minority will face the problem and I will take good care of the stroller.. No matter how good u handle, how caring u will be, just believe the testimonials of others, the front wheel was poorly designed and is going to break sooner or later, in my case exactly after 20 days. Carried baby about 10kgs and the front wheel is now unable to swivel and take corners like it is supposed to do. The others complained about basket or stroller cover but this doesnt matter to me if the stroller can still move.. However when the front wheel cant be maneuvered like it should? its totally DISASTROUS.TIPS: ONLY BUY THIS STROLLER IF U WILLING TO RETURN IT WITHIN 30 DAYS.
