First off, I am not new to applying vinyl decals as I have done several on walls and 30-40 trucks/cars/vans.  With that being said, this was the worst product I have ever encountered.  As another reviewer said, you must first apply the clear sheet over the top of the lettering.  After I did this and was separating the back 'wax paper' from the backside of the letters, you could see where the machine had cut through the vinyl and into the wax paper as well.  So as I was pulling the back paper off, the letter cutouts wanted to come with it.  Or partial wax paper would stay and I would have to pick it off with my fingers before I could continue.Once I finally got the clear sheet with the letters put on the wall where I wanted it, it got even worse.  Every edge, corner, beginning, end, and side of EVERY letter would pull away from the wall as I tried to remove the clear sheet. I would have to rub over it 5-6 times before it would either finally stick to the wall or I would have to use my fingernail to hold it to the wall.  The font has so many thin sections of words that this led to many of them stretching,thus coming out distorted and/or wrinkled.  Also several of them tore completely and I had to try to line them back up halfway decent.I did finally get this on the wall, although being OCD as I am, I thinks it looks horrible.  I can see all the spots that came out torn or mis-aligned and I have had to go back over it several times in an hour because it keeps coming back off the wall.  I'll never buy from this brand again.
