These towels are not thick enough to be used after a bath.  They get wet so easily -- don't have capacity to absorb water to dry my baby up.  Another thing I don't like is they aren't 100% cotton.  I used one of the three only once and never used them again before giving them away to a charity.  Totally waste of money.
