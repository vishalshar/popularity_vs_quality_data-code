When I received these wipes last night, they seemed a bit small. I double-checked amazon's measurements, and it said they were supposed to be 9*9 inches. Mine measured 8*8. I ordered two packages, and both sets of wipes were double-sided, but one set did have embroidered "FuzziBunz" as in the picture, and the other set didn't. After I washed these for the first time last night, they shrunk to about 7.5*7.5, so quite a bit smaller than they were supposed to be 9*9 (and I washed them in warm water, not hot). Also, different sides of the wipes shrunk differently - cotton shrunk more than fleece, so now the wipes' sides are curling over. I do have to say, these wipes are nice and soft, and feel nice on baby's skin. But I'm pretty disappointed about the sizing, shrinking, and embroidery inconsistencies from package to package.
