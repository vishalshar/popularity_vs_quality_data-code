I really liked the look of this product, online and in person. Unfortunately, it's made with urethane, which smells horrible, and gets worse in the hot weather (the fumes are not that healthy either). I'm more worried about my baby than myself, and I don't want her breathing in anything unhealthy, and I certainly don't want to change her on a pad made of urethane, so I decided to return the bag.I wish there was an indication somewhere of what the bag is made of (so I would not have bought it in the first place). The return shipping should have been refunded to me, but the full amount was not (I lost in this transaction). If you are looking for a diaper bag that is both attractive and safe, look at other brands. It's better to pay $20 more and not worry.
