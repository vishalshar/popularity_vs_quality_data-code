This is a nice pacifier, but unfortunately for me, it is made in China. I really go out of my way to search for infant products, especially toys and things made to go in their mouth, NOT made in China. I read the summary of this product here at Amazon, and it didn't state the country of manufacture. I remember seeing 'Pooh' pacifiers in the store made in Europe, so I just thought these were the same. I was wrong. With all the reports of toxic paints in children's toys coming from China, I refuse to purchase anything made in China for my children. I just threw these away.If you don't have any qualms about China-manufactured products for your kids, then I'm sure it'll be a pretty good pacifier for you. But not for my kids. I will spend double on pacifiers not made in China, because peace of mind has no price to me.
