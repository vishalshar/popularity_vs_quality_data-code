We got this product when our twins were 5 months adjusted age.  They couldn't sit up in it without severely leaning to the side.  Now they're eight months adjusted, and although they sit well, they still lean forward a bit too much for solid feedings and way too much for bottle feedings.The toy is good.  We just took it off of the highchair and use it separetely now.  One of the stickers is starting to come off, but other than that, it seems to entertain them on it's own.The highchairs now stay at grandma and grandpa's house.  We now use the space saver high chairs (also from Fisher-Price)Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair  They cost a bit more, but it is well worth it.
