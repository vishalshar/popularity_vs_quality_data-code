My baby did not like this at all! I think the nipple was way to skinny and oddly shaped , I was pretty bummed out because the concept and idea of this is amazing ! We're out and about a lot when it's time for her to feed and thus could have been so handy maybe it's just my baby? Or maybe it's the weirdly long  thin nipple ? My baby just wouldn't drink out of this :/ for anyone wondering she normally uses and has no problem with her avent brand nipples and latch munchkin nipples she drinks out of those fine but this bottle she kept spitting out
