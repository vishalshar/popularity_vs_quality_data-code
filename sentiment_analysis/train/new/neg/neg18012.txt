This seemed like a great way to keep dirty diapers without having to squish them in to a diaper pail. I loved it at first with the infant age but the older our daughter got, the smellier our house became. I tried baking soda discs, scented bags, and lysol and nothing covers that smell.Pros: Easy to install refills, easy to empty, easy to use. Looks nice as well.Cons: The older the child, the smellier your house becomes. Does not contain the poop smell very well. The smell is the only drawback.
