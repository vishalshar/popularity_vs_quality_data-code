Mattress arrived FAST and looks like pretty good quality. HOWEVER, the title would lead you to believe that it was an organic mattress which it is not. The label says 40% organic cotton, 60% polyester fiber. Made in USA. I called the company and they said that the cover and the cotton batting are organic and they use polyester fill because it's safer that foam. I am going to keep it because in my opinion it's worth $45 and there is no detectable odor coming from the mattress. I'm sensitive to chemical smells and this one made the cut. Fits perfectly in my Chicco Lullaby LX.UPDATE 3 to 4 months later:Mattress is not wearing all that well. I rotate it all the time and there are permanent indents where he sleeps. Wish I would have spent more and bought something that wouldn't have already compressed.
