Neither the shower handle nor shower foot rest worked on the tile or walls.  The shower foot rest did work in the tub and is convenient.  I have not been able to place the bathtub and shower handle any place in the bath tub/shower area where it will stick and stay.  It is useless.  I wish I had purchased them separately so I could send the bathtub/shower handle back.
