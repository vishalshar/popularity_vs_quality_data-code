I purchased this item from Nikki's Gift Baskets and it was delivered quickly, however the delivered product does not look anything like the picture posted on Amazon. There was no greenery, the items included were orange, purple/white stripes. The colors don't even match. I made sure I was ordering it from Nikki's Gift Baskets, just like it says to do. For the money I spent, I am very disappointed.  If I could attach a picture, I would, but that is not an option.
