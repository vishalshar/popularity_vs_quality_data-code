The nipple and the whole system worked for us but I really was happy when I switched over to the nuk bottles and sippy cups.  I only used the playtex system because a sister gave me a bunch of her stuff to get started.  THe playtex drop ins are supposed to reduce gas and I don't know if they did or didn't.  I disliked 2 parts of the system.  #1 It was kind of hard to get formula to mix in the little drop in bags.  #2 Unless you really thought the bags were helping with gas I didn't see the point of paying so much for the little inserts.  On the positive side I did use these for the first 4 months because I liked the idea of the wide nipple better than the small nipples because I was doing formula and nursing.
