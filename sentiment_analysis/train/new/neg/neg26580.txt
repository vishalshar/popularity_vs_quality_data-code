Quite unimpressed. The car seat is fine, this is the 3rd Graco infant seat I've owned. It's heavy and apparently quite uncomfortable (according to my screaming daughter), but it's also safe and can accommodate the higher weight limits. The jogger is smooth, easy to maneuver, but also bulky and heavy! I took the whole system (jogger and car seat) to the county fair and the mall in the same day last week and it was wonderful on the dirt- it DOES feel a little top-heavy-but it was horrible in the mall-it's simply too big to maneuver tight spaces. It has ample storage space for bags and such, and the cup/phone holder is handy. I'm 5'10" and the high handle bar is quite nice compared to strollers I've had in the past. I'm not a little lady...I'm tall and athletic and this thing is HEAVY! It's a chore to get it into the back of my SUV  (2014 pathfinder) and it takes up a LOT of space...enough that I had to change my daughter on the passengers seat rather than in the back. All in all, I wish I had another unit to compare it to because I like that you theoretically can jog with your infant- I haven't tried it-The ride is smooth and it does handle nicely. I've owned this for 6 months and the tires have been filled once- kind of disappointing because I've only used the jogger a handful of times. I say if the cost isn't an issue...buy something better...if this is all you can afford...it works, don't be too surprised with the cons!
