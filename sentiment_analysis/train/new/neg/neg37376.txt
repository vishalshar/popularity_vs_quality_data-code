This item caused injury to my 3 month old granddaughter. She cut the top of her head on what can only be described as an EXTREMELY sharp edge that should have not have been inside any baby's crib. I read the precautions and she CANNOT push herself up and she is, as I stated, only three months old but since she can roll over, she somehow got her head close enough to the base of this item which caused a cut on the top of her head and left blood spots in three different places on the breathable mesh bumper/liner inside the crib.  I am extremely disappointed as I was the one that purchased the item and would like to return the item and will follow up with the company and request that an added precaution be included with any future purchases OR that they insure that sharp objects are not close enough to an infant as to cause this type of harm.
