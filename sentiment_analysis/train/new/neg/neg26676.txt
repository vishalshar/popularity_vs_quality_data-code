I love the look of these sheets.  I like the silky feel of these sheets.  I don't like that they are so slippery that all of my daughter's other bedding (comforter and blanket) slide off the bed in the middle of the night and leave her freezing.  I wish I had known they would be this slippery because I would have found something else.  So, word of caution....buy these knowing that they are super slippery and all your other bedding will fall off your bed.
