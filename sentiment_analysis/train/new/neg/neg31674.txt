I'm giving these bottles 3 stars because they do leak, I thought it was the links ones in particular, so I called customer service and requested replacements. They quickly sent out replacements (the blue ones) but unfortunately the blue ones leaked to, I pulled out my 8oz bottle of the dr. Browns I have that don't leak and discovered that not only was the bottle cap different but the vent was green and not blue. I called the customer service people back and explained that clear and blue replacement bottles also leaked but I discovered it was the cap and the happily agreed to send me the options conversion kits for all six of my bottles. I love the bottle system but the tops that are used for the standard bottles do suck, I wish they would go back to the original bottle caps. I've posted a picture with the options bottle caps (the bottle caps that work).
