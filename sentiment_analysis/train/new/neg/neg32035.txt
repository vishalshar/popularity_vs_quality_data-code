We ordered this crib because we liked the style and color and we still do.  The real headache began when my husband put the crib together.  There were definitely several things that are not right with it.  First, the manual was missing so we had to go the the Delta website and print a 20+ page manual so that we could put the whole thing together. The next being that the back and front of the crib either were missing fitting for the bolts or the fittings were misaligned so the bolts were unable to go into the slots.  The changer railing is cracked as well.  To to finish off this disaster the "hamper" can't even be put together because the holes are not aligned properly. So naturally, I went to the company for help, because as their warranty states, their product is warranted to be free from defects for a period of 1 year from date of  purchase under normal use.  However, the response I get back is that they can only replace ONE large part under the warranty (though I don't know where in the warranty this is written because I have the document in front of me and can find no reference to that) and they told me to return it to the purchase place.  This crib hasn't even been used yet and it really upsets me that despite paying this much for it, they expect me to pay more to return a product that has been defective since it left the factory!Update: After a few more emails to the company, they did replace the parts. Even though, one still arrived scratched, it wasn't a big deal. I still hold that they make it difficult to get the replacement parts should you need them
