The first time it was sent out is was a completely different animal (I think 2 dogs). I wanted these 2 bc it matched my daughter's outfit for pics. Took a long time to get the chicks in the mail. When I did then baby chick came off the mother (and it's sewed in). They are soft and pics looked great.
