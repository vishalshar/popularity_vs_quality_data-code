The bag was ok - not as roomy as I had anticipated, and the diaper changing pad is a joke. Super thin and no padding to speak of - it will do the job in keeping your child's bare skin from another surface. The design is cute and it is easy to carry. As a back-up, this is a good diaper bag - this is what I leave at daycare for changes of clothes, etc. If you need something for everyday use, this may not be sufficient.
