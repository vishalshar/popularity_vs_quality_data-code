The color is deceptive in the photo.  Other reviewers stated it was a light green, and based on the photo, I was expecting a light sage green color but that's not quite the right shade - it's a much brighter "light green" than I expected.  It's fine, and I'll keep them - the designs and tags are cute, but I'm disappointed in the green color.
