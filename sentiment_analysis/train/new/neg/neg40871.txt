These set of utensils are small, really small. My son is 26 months and it's so small he uses it as a toy in his kitchen play set! It's too bad because I do like how everything has a slot for each to fit perfectly in the cute little case. But the spoon is way to small to hold a decent bite, the fork too tiny to stab any morsels of food and the chopstick will likely cramp up them little hands that tries to hold it. I wouldn't recommend this.
