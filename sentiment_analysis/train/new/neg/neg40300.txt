I bought this potty for my grandson, because I used a similar "European" potty chair for my children 20 years ago. This was as close to the one I had that I could find. I love this potty, it is easy for my 2 year old grandson to use. It is extremely easy to clean. It looks nice. Very stable bottom. There is one tiny flaw. The urine guard in front is just a bit short. Nothing more aggravating then getting the kid to the potty and he wets all over his clothes and floor because the guard is too short. If you have a girl this is a fantastic potty and you should have no problems. I would rate it five stars if I had a granddaughter!
