I know that I should have read the dimensions better on the description, but I was disappointed because the frame is larger than I expected and the space for the ultrasound picture is smaller in size than our ultrasound photos.  My wife and I opted not to use this frame once it was received.  The quality of the frame, however, is excellent, and the design is quite nice in the home.
