I fell in love with this at first sight! My baby loves it, he is 4mos old. But I noticed today (a month after buying it) that the stiching that holds each piece in is coming undone. I dont allow my older children to play with it, so I know they haven't been pulling on it. It hasn't been through the washer either. The way it is made I am not sure I can fix it myself. It is such a cute toy, but I dont think I will replace it if it comes completely undone.
