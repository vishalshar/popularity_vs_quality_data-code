Cup is ok . Cant see thru it which I really prefer for mutliple reasons , and its not 100% spill proof like the gerber graduates stages  drinking cups are. Its about 85% spill proff. The other 15% spills from moving and splashing around aggresively withthe cup. SO although the cup doesnt necessarily spill by turning it up side down, it can splash a little heare and there if they aggresively shake it or try to make it come out of which my son does do. So It's ok. Ntot bad or great.  It also does discourage biting as the sipping rim is hard and that seems tto be working bt gerber offers this too withtheir 18+ and 24+ months comparable cups . It also has two stage sbuilt on one on this cup though. It has the 18+ raised  rin on one side and the 24+ regular drinking rim on the other side so its 2 in one. Thats why I say it's ok. It also changes color when cold . No benefit to that. But all in all I prefer gerbers as theirs is 100% spill proof and its translucent.
