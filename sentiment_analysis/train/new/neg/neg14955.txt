There are ok, a little larger than I was anticipating and the lids don't always snap tightly.  They don't stay loose enough that they fall off, but I'd bet that liquid would certainly leak out if they were shifted into a position that wasn't completely flat.For me, they have been most useful for road trips when my son was still primarily eating purees.  Packed completely flat, they can be stacked on top of one another, and I used them to transport premade purees when going to visit my parents for long weekends.  However, even at 16 months, the bowls hold way too much for a single meal - and my boy eats a LOT.  Maybe it would be good for holding larger cuts of fruit, but even that is a large serving.
