My reaction to this seat belt adjuster is mixed. Does it keep the shoulder belt from rubbing my neck? Yes. And extra points for being easy to install. What I don't like so much is that sometimes the adjuster flips a bit upward and digs into my midsection, so really the discomfort has just moved from my neck to my stomach. I find that if I pull the lap belt snug (not uncomfortably snug, by any means) then the adjuster doesn't bother me. I also think it's kind of a pain that you have to re-set the adjuster every time you put the seat belt on. To sum it up, I'm more comfortable with this adjuster than without it now that I know how to set it, but I think there is room for improvement.
