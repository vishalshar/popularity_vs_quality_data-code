I tried using these regularly for a month or two with OsoCozy diapers and Thirsties wraps. They never seemed as easy to get on as others described. They grabbed hold of the diaper OK, but I guess I just wasn't very good at getting them centered right on my first try (especially with a baby who was squirming). Once they were on, the diaper seemed really tight (and my daughter was pretty tiny). I tried to put them on looser, but then they didn't hold right (the tension is what makes them hold).  I knew that these were a better option than diaper pins, but I still wasn't thrilled with them. Finally, I decided to try the wrap over the diaper with no fasteners at all. I expected the diaper to shift and was prepared for a big mess, but to my surprise, the wrap held the diaper in place really well. I haven't gone fastener free since then (my daughter is now 11-months-old). So, bottom line, if you feel you need a fastener for your diaper, these will do the trick and I would recommend them over pins. However, if you have a good wrap, I'd try going without a fastener before spending your money on these.
