I bought this seat based on the excellent user reviews it received and when it arrived, I can see why the reviewers liked it.  The design is simple, easy to use, easy to clean.  However, the seat was actually too SHORT for my taller than average daughter (who is 37").  Her knees were up to her shoulders.  Part of this is no doubt due to the way the splash guard makes the child sit on the seat (legs angled to the side).  This is no way a negative review, just a bit of info to help you make your decision.  By the way, we ended up using the Baby Bjorn potty seat that fits on top of a regular toilet, with a Kids II step stool to help her get up by herself.
