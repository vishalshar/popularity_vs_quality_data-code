I'm surprised this product is still on the market. Not only is it extremely cheaply made, but it is very unsafe. My son was sitting/standing in it and was able to tip it over. He was only 10 months old at the time, and 22 lbs. Fortunately he wasn't hurt, but it was very scary and could have been a lot worse. Kids are typically top heavy and this thing is super lightweight, so it's a bad combination. And the fabric started tearing at all of the seams the first 5 minutes he was in it. You can see in the photos how the fabric was ripping at all 4 connection points on top of the product. Total waste of money. We threw ours in the trash.
