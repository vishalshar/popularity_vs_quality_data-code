i had high hopes for this after i assembled it.  i had an old Baby Trend that i loved but i trusted the Graco brand so i didn't hesitate to buy this.  Its gorgeous to look at but there are design problems.  First, there are no locking mechanisms for the wheels.  If you have your child on a hardwood floor or are on the go and have it outside on cement, the thing will move.  i have it on carpet at one end, not the wheels as that wouldn't do any good,  and my son can still move it.  Granted he is gifted, but if your child plays and walks back and forth it will move.  My son may move more rigorously than other children but my old Baby Trend handled it like a champ.  I only replaced it due to a TINY TINY hole at the mesh seem and that was due to my daughters climbing up a bit to get a toy.  They stick their feet into the mesh to get a boost.  After 6 years of insane abuse this is all that happened.  so i ordered this Graco to replace it. Big mistake. The other HUGE issue with this is that i now have a quarter size hole in the bottom of it.  My husband changed the pad cover and flipped it to re snap the pad back on 3 days ago and it was fine.  He changed the pad again today and there's a hole all of a sudden.  there is also 3 other areas where the fabric is giving out.  Apparently, with my sons movements the pad had been rubbing back and forth and wore a hole through the fabric where it is sandwiched between the pad and the bars underneath it.  The pad itself is made into 4 sections but i found that the fabric on the bottom of the pad isn't thick enough and it is quite hard.  The part that's rubbing is actually the edge of one of the boards so it digs.  Most of the time you don't flip these things over so we got lucky that we caught it in time. Going back to Baby Trend.
