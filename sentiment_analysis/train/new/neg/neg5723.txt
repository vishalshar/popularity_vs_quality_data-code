My husband and I chose this stroller for compact folded size and ease of use.  At first we were quite pleased with it, despite minor inconveniences such as canopies that bent entirely out of shape the first time we folded the stroller.  (Virtually all the other reviewers note the same problem.)  After just one month of ordinary use on city sidewalks, however, the stroller frame became so warped that we had to throw the whole thing out.
