I bought this for my daughter who had an identical doll that she adores, but was old and dingy and falling apart. I was excited to find the same doll, so I didn't mind paying twice what it was worth. Within a week of having this replacement doll, the back seam had come out, making a large hole in the back. Luckily I can hand sew well enough to have fixed it, but I am disappointed that the quality was so poor given the high price.
