I enjoy the absence of the whirring sound that my old humidifier had and the lack of a filter to get moldy is great.  The first two nights I had issues with the area on the table and floor underneath and around the humifier getting completely soaked with water and thought I would have to return it until I realized that the directional nozzle that fits on the top of the tank had fallen on the floor when I opened it.  I decided to try it one more time with the nozzle on the top and that resolved the soaking issue.  If I run it at full blast it doesn't last the whole night but it works just fine at about 60% output.  You can't refill it at a typical bathroom sink because of the height of the tank but I keep a water bottle handy and it does the trick. No real complaints.  Its not fabulous but suits my needs and is offered at a good price.
