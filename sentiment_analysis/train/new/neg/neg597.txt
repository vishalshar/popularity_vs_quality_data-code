I have used avent for close to 14 years. I'm disappointed that they have had to change their bottles so much since the BPA issues. The older models were much better quality and no issues for me. These new milky in appearance BPA bottles are a good fix to the leaky honey colored ones, but I don't like having to deal with the extra ring that gets easily lost. With that said, other bottles on the market have many more annoying parts; this is a good compromise in comparison. We have had no leaks since switching from the honey colored BPA free to this Milky colored one with a ring. This is also my favorite sized Avent bottle as it makes mixing formula directly into the bottle much more feasible. I do wish that Avent could bring back their older shaped bottles though.
