If I could give this product zero stars I would. It does not work at all- the bag literally disintegrates the moment urine hits it. Tried 4 times and every time the bag disintegrated immediately. For the customers who gave this product 5 stars- is there some magic trick that I am missing here?? I have the Bjorn potty seat and it is obviously not complicated to use....not sure why this product is disintegrating for some and not others. Any thought would be helpful, thanks.
