I bought this for my grand-daughter, and here is my daughter's reviews of how this product is working (or not)  "Hmmmmm.... she LOVES the music more than the potty itself.  We listen and dance to the "potty" song everyday- but there has been little progress with the actual potty.  I think the way to go for her may be the attachable seat that goes on top of the real toliet.  Otherwise she carries the potty around from room to room and treats it like a seat.  I think getting something that looks more like a real toliet would have worked better. Or perhaps she was going thru a phase that is not over yet, so maybe she will get into it again after a few weeks.  Thanks, anyway."  I don't find this very encouraging, so I wish I had purchased something else.
