These are perfect for your ThinkBaby strawcups, but if you have a child that chews, they don't last long.  My son would chew the end off each time I put a new one on.  I decided not to buy more, because it got to expensive.  We switched him to Miracle cups.  Before he was chewing on them, they were great, and I didn't have a problem with leaking.
