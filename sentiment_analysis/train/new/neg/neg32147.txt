Like another reviewer, my Moses basket "swims" in the stand.  While the stand itself is okay, the description is very deceptive - mainly the measurements.  And I did measure my basket before ordering the stand.  My son is going to "customize" the stand to fit our basket. He's going to shorten the rods at the bottom to make the stand narrower and shorten the plastic pieces that frame the basket at both ends.  That should make the basket fit securely. Seems like a lot of work to go thru but my daughter's baby is due within the next 30 days and I want to make sure she has the basket and stand when the baby arrives.  On the plus side, the stand seems to be sturdy and none of the parts were missing. The natural color matches the natural color of the basket quite well.
