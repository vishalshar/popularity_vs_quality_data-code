I know this toy is advertised for infants and young toddlers butfrom my experience, the blocks aren't used for anything other than throwing.  This toy requires a child to place the blocks back into the slots in order for a music sequence to be played. In my opinion, that's pretty advanced for an infant!  I'm really not quite sure how older children like this toy as my 2 year old has not played with it except to toss the blocks around (as I mentioned).  It looks interesting but I am not sure it is targeted for the right age group.
