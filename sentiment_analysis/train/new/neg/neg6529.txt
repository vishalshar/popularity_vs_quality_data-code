We have several of these from another brand (kushies) and they fit great, but have limited patterns.This robot pattern looked great, but the cut of the sleeves is very weird and just doesn't fit right on our toddler. It somehow manages to be too long in the arms, but too short in the armpits, resulting in a very tight neck that isn't comfortable for our toddler.We have shelved it for emergency use only.
