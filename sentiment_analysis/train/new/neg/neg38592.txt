That was the quote from my little one when I asked how she liked using the bags.  So before buying more of these baggies I decided to do a little experiment.  In one bag, I put a handful of stick pretzels.  (I tested to make sure they were not stale before putting them in there.)  IN the other bag, I put a slice of bread cut into 2 halves.  After 12 hours, the pretzels were not exactly fresh, they seemed the slightest bit rubbery on their way to feeling stale.  The bread was becoming stiff around the edges.  Now we love the way these bags are made with the plastic integrated into the material, but we wanted to check how well they kept food fresh especially since we pack lunch the night before.  Unfortunately they did not pass the test so we will not be buying more.  We'll try our luck with the bags with a plastic liner or some other type.  I will use them for things like grapes, trail mix and anything that I'm not concerned about exposure to the air.  Hence I gave them 3 stars.
