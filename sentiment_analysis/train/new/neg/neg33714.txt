I am very Un satisfied, the breast pump I purchased didn't work it had no suction whatsoever. Im more than sure this breast pump was used when I opened my package some items were in place already as it shouldn't have been. I noticed after I tried to use it and wasn't functionin I looked at the instructions to make sure I did it correct and things that I was supposed to put together myself were already intact in the box! A waste of 26$ I most likely will not be shopping at Amazon anymore!
