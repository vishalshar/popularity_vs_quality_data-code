If this fits any "newborn to 6 month old" on the planet, I feel incredibly sorry for the mother.I bought this for my 2 month old daughter, along with the aviator outfit by the same maker, and am very disappointed that even though they are labeled "0-6 months" in size, it is bigger than most of the 12 month sleepers I have in the closet! She is big for her age, and it still won't come anywhere close to fitting her for at least another 6-8 months.The "tutu" is a little flimsy/cheap feeling, but for a novelty outfit, it's ok. A few more layers of ruffle would improve it a great deal. Everything else about it is adorable: the outfit, the hat, the packaging... so cute.I just wish the size were given accurately!
