First of all I have to say I love Uppababy products. I own both a Vista and G-luxe and I have rarely had issues with them. Most of the problems were from 3rd party participants and UppaBaby CS has always been helpful which is why I continue to purchase their accessories/products. HOWEVER, I purchased this for our G-Luxe and the material/workmanship is horrible. Within a week the rain cover tore around the holes where you snap it in to the stroller at the bottom. I ordered it Dec 10 2011 and to day it's torn around all areas that have a velcro snap and the plastic has come undone in several places from the fabric lining. To pay another $25 for a replacement cover that will likely tear again in 30 days is just not worth it!! I am not careless with the cover either, I would take it off and fold it up nicely when it was not in use and it still disintegrated with normal wear and tear. I am going to look for a cheaper replacement. Uppababy should really come up with a more sturdy rain cover. Maybe it fits the G-lite better but at least for my stroller it just didn't hold up.
