Terrible quality.  We bought 3 - one game and the clip part was already off - we could pop it back on but it keeps falling off.  The rubber edging on all 3 peels off easily (my 18 mo old peeled it off within 2 minutes).  My son used normal dry erase markers on it, and I went to wipe it off when he was done coloring.  Did not wipe with a dry eraser, would not wipe off with water, rubbing alcohol, dish soap.  So now there are permanent lines on them from a dry erase marker which defeats the entire purpose!  The back is made of flimsy cardboard and rips easily, especially without the rubber edging (which again, falls right off).  I didn't expect them to last forever given the price...but I did expect them to be more than a one use and throw away item.  Don't buy this product!
