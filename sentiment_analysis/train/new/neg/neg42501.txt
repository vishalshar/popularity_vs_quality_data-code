So basically this gate is the SS-30 OD model with stainless steal screws and bolts. If I would have known this I would have bought the indoor model and acquired the stainless steal parts from other sources and saved $35. It literally comes in the indoor model box with a sticker that says "outdoor model" When you open up the box the only diference is you get two sets of hardware, one for outdoor use and one for indoor use.Construction of the gate feels fine and I like the child resistant / adult resistant latch on it.
