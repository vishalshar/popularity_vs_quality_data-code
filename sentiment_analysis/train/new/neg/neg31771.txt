This is great.  My 3 month old daughter loves it.  I don't find that it attracts fuzz or anything.  I got it in black and it actually looks like a semi funky piece of costume  jewelry.My biggest issue is that it's a weird length, and it's not adjustable.  I guess long makes it easier for baby to chew, but it falls basically right below my breasts.  Would be nicer and still functional if it were just a bit shorter - or at least adjustable.  Adjustable would be very useful.  Knocking it to 3 stars, because although it's a 5 star product in most ways, the length makes it less likely that I'll wear it without feel self conscious.  Since it doesn't LOOK like a baby item, it's not like people will say "wow that's weird, but it's a baby toy."  They'll just think I'm wearing a weird length necklace.
