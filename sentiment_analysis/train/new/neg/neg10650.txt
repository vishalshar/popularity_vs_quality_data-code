I drive a Chevy cruze a decent size 4 door sedan. However when installed the carseat and base were so long that the drivers seat won't go back at all! So we moved it behind the passengers side and now that seat won't go back. It takes up so much room in our back seat that we only have 2 car seats installed and have no space for a 3rd person.... I didn't even think this would be an issue.... But other than that it's a nice carseat.
