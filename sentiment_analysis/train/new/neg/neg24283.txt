The product does what it is intended to do - most of the timeBecause it doesn't have a timer, you need to measure out water based on the starting temperature of the milk and the quantity of the milk.  The unit then will "shut off" once the water has evaporated. It doesn't always do this.  I have found this process tedious with a screaming hungry child. Because the measuring reservoir if stored upside down, you are constantly dripping water on the counter after you fill the warmer.The unit will also not turn on again until it is cooled down.  I've had my child finish bottle one and want more and the unit still won't turn back on.
