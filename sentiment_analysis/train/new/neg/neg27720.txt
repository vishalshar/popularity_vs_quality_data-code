I was hesitant about getting this because of the price but I had all the other items in this collection. It was a bit of a pain to put together, but it looks cute in the crib. It is pretty loud though and there's no way to control the volume. I think it might actually wake my baby up instead of lull him to sleep. Also, it doesn't play very long, not even for a minute it seems. Would definitely not recommend anyone purchase this unless they want to spend 50+ bucks on something that just looks cute and serves no valuable purpose.
