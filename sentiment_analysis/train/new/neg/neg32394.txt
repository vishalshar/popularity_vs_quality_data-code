I loved this diaper bag! Love that it doesn't look like a diaper bags has so many pockets for everything the only thing I wish it was a tad bigger. After having used it everyday for 1 1/2 years straight...the handle is noticeably worn, the rest of the bag looks in great condition. Only down side is the handle material starts to peel and hoping they can come up with a better material for longivity.
