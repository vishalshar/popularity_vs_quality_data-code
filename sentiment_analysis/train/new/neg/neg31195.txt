Wow, what can I say? These are not the pretty pink as shown in the picture. I know that colors look different than what it shows on your monitor, but ugh! These are a dirty pink. You know how some people can't do laundry and everything looks dingy? Well that is exactly how these look. There is no way I am going to give these to my pregnant twin nieces. They are just plain nasty! Zero stars!!
