I have purchased many things on Amazon but this is my first review.  I feel compelled to share this.We got this for our 8 month old son for international travel.  It took 10 minutes to set up the first time but the second time it only took 5 minutes or less.  My husband was drawn to the baby Bjorn because it was so much easier to set up but we needed something we could check in on the plane or put inside a suitcase and there weren't any other super lightweight and compact alternatives so we got this one.The one thing we had a big problem with is:  At the top of the crib you can zip up the entire top, resulting in an enclosed "box" on all 4 sides.  I think that's a great idea for outdoors, like a tent to keep insects out.  You can also remove the top which is how we keep it.  However, the zippered edge goes all around the top.  My 8 month old son loves to pull up and stand while holding on to the edge of the crib.  The problem is, his height is such that his face is exactly at the height of the zippered lining. so he keeps getting cuts along his mouth either because he's mouthing the zippered lining or he's not steady and falls and rubs the zippered top.  Also, when my son tries to get up from a down position, his head keeps bumping the rounded lip at the top so he keeps falling down because he can't get find the edge to hold on to like other portable cribs... Overall, this feature is poorly designed and I hope Phil and Teds can do something about it.Update 1/22/2013:  I contacted Phil and Ted's regarding the issue and they assured me they would bring this back to their R&D department.  In addition they offered to compensate me.  They do have amazing customer service, I hope they are able to make improvements to the design in the near future.
