The connection is not wifi, but instead radio (like a portable home phone). It has one monitor and I like that there's a setting that the monitor will be dark until it picks up a sound in baby room, then it lights up and gets your attention and you can watch baby until its quiet again. That is enough to catch my eye or wake me when I'm sleeping. I don't know if the ones you can watch on your phone will do that necessarily.Here's what I really don't like about it:- Battery is not strong enough to last the night. Has a super annoying loud repetitive beep when battery is low. I've woken up to this a few times at 4 am and had to plug it in.- When we are using wifi at home, it interferes with the connection on the monitor and not only can we not see/hear baby, but it makes a super loud beeping to alert you that its not connecting, and again when it reconnects. It can repeat this cycle over and over again.When my baby is sleeping, guess what I DON'T want - thats right, loud noises to wake him up. This monitor has woken baby up a few times from exactly this. There is no way to disable to turn down the volume of the alert.Yeah, don't buy this one.
