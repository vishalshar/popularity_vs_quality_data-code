it looks really cute but thats it. behind the carseat material there is styrafoam (cant spell it) then it just ends mid back of baby. everytime we took baby out there was a red on his back from the styrafoam just stopping in the carseat. its so uncomfortable we just bought a new seat. paid way toooo much for this POS!
