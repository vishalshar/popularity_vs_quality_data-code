Normally, I love this brand and have purchased the smaller multi colored ones before with no issues, but in my latest order of these it seems that the tops come off easy, Bad batch? We use these with our 2 year old, and she had several incidents in which the lids came off the cup. At the same time, I also bought: The First Years Take & Toss Spill-Proof 7 Ounce Cups 6 ea Assorted Colors and after some tested came to the conclusion that it was the lids on this set that were loose on this set as well as on the other 7 ounce rainbow colored ones. With those other ones we use the lids and these bodies and they work fine. In the end we had to toss all the lids from this set but kept the cups, and we just use the lids from the 7 ounce rainbow ones. These are normally really solid, so I am thinking I got a bad batch.
