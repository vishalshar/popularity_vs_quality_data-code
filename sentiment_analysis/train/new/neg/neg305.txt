Here's the thing: it is SO DIFFICULT to get the bowl detached and reattached to the base, it's almost not even worth the trouble. I mean, I bought this so my toddler can't dump food all over herself and the floor, and in the struggle to attach it to the base, I might end up flinging the thing across the room in frustration myself!They use these at my daughter's daycare, which is why I bought two of them before trying them out, but so far I'm disappointed. The first one is as described above; the second one I can't even get to detach from its base in the first place, so I can't even test it out. It *is* unbelievable, and - as another reviewer mentioned - seems adult-proof, as well as child-proof.
