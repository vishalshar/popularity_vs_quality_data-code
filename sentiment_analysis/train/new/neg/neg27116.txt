I was really excited to use this spoon. Putting the food into the spoon made a little mess. Using the spoon was okay until the food started to get low. I would have to tap it to squeeze the food out since it would spit out food and air if I didn't. My baby didn't like the spoon. I don't see the point in using this for travel either. Either you would have to fill up the soon prior to leaving your house, or still pack your food and a spoon which makes it easy just to use a regular spoon. This just didn't save me any time or provide any benefits. The time it took to clean the inside of the spoon when done make me like regular spoons even more. For me, I just wasted more time with this spoon. It does what it says, but I don't like it.
