Honestly, the quality of Aden & Anais muslin products is terrible.  I have had two of their muslin sleepsacks and both fell apart very quickly (the zipper track separated from the seam on one and the shoulder seams separated on the other).  I washed this blanket once before use and now there is a section where the blanket is ripping away from the outer hem.  I should have learned my lesson from the first defunct sleepsack, but I like to give a company a second chance.  I figured without shoulder seams and zipper tracks, there would not be much to fall apart on a simple blanket, but I was wrong.  It is a shame, because the lightweight material is wonderful for warm weather use.  For the prices this company charges, they really need to step up their game on the manufacturing quality.
