The pictures of this product are hilarious. Not realistic. I bought these to use as extra covers for the changing table when those early diaper changes can get out of control. It helped us not have to clean/switch the changing pad out every day, which sounds like a small task but everything is harder with a newborn. Save your sanity and buy something like this. After the first wash this product in particular became pilly and not as soft as when I first received them. Even after following the care instructions. Wasn't a big deal to me, but if you're looking for something very soft, keep shopping.
