This is a frustrating little rattle.  My daughter loves it, but that means it gets very dirty - constantly being snacked on, thrown on the ground, etc.  And there's no good way to wash it.  The middle part that holds the tiny balls has holes that allow water in, which means that, if you rinse it, water is going to go in and will not easily come out.  This leaves you having to work hard to just wash the balls on the end while not getting water in the middle or else just wiping the rattle down with a damp cloth (which doesn't feel like enough to me).Of course, I realize that (i) this review makes me sound like a crazy germaphobe and (ii) this may not be a problem for other people so, if you don't mind the cleaning problems, there's nothing else really wrong with this rattle.
