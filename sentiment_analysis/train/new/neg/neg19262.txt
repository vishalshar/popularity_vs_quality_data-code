I liked this stroller a lot in the beginning.  I started with the bassinet and used it for outdoor naps on a daily basis until my son turned six months. The stroller is sturdy and easy to maneuver.  The issues started about three months in after I had to switch to the toddler seat.  First of all, the seat is very hard an uncomfortable and I had to put in a pillow insert to make my son sit still for at least some of the walk.  Second, the various pieces that comprise the toddler seat are hard to assemble; things get stuck constantly.  It got quite frustrating during the short time we were switching between the bassinet and the seat every day.  Lastly, the wheels became deflated within two months of use.  The pump that came with the stroller did not work.  The front wheel had a defective tube and could not be inflated at all.  Thankfully, the customer service was great and sent a replacement wheel quickly and at no charge.The main reason I got this stroller was because of the bassinet because my son would only nap outside and I wanted to make him as comfortable as possible.  Usually, bassinet strollers are very expensive, so this was a reasonable alternative for someone on a budget.  If you can, get something better.  If you don't care much for the bassinet, I wouldn't recommend this stroller.
