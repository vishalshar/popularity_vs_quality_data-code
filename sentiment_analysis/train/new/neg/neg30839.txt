We hang these in the bathroom and put cloth diapers in them before bath and when we put my son on the potty. It's the perfect size!Edit: I ordered two of these bags and the first one leaked horribly on the first use and the handle on the second one ripped completely off after also only being used once! I am so angry!! I had used this same product before and never had these issues, but when I ordered these new ones, it's been nothing but disappointing. They are useless pieces of trash! I guess the old statement "they don't make them like they used to" stands true with this product. I cloth diaper to save money and on very upset that I wasted money on these
