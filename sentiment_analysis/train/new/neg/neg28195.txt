Suction Control:You control the strength and speed of the suction with a trigger that you squeeze on one of the collection units.  Once you are at a pace you like you can click a button on the trigger and it keeps up this suction and speed for you.  You can create your own "2 phase" expression this way by selecting a fast, shallow pump at first followed by longer and deeper pumps.  I felt more comfortable that I was doing it right with the Medela where I just had to pick the suction strength and it took care of the speed.  It required less thinking so I could multitask while pumping.Suction Strength:Seems comparable to the Medela in capability.Clean-up:(Actually a really important category when you wash 4x a day!)  Medela was easier to rinse out and reassemble than Avent. Avent also trapped milk behind silicone breast shields requiring extra cleaning.  Only 1 fewer part to assemble with the Medela but some of the Avent pieces are silicone and required more attention to put in place perfectly.  Also, Avent is tippy making me worry about spilt milk as I dissasemble.Power Accessories:Liked that I could buy vehicle adaptors and power packs for using Medela without outlet power. I couldn't find for Avent.Plus of Avent was good customer service refunding me when power supply got fried and fits well with Avent bottles if you like feeding from them. (I purchased Medela for 2nd Pump with 2nd baby and use the Medela at work and the Avent at home.
