There's just not much to this pack and play. It's not particularly attractive nor extra functional. I wish we had spent a little bit more on a nicer system. It's very basic- a simple bassinet section and changing flip-over top. The changing section is slanted, which could prove to be difficult when changing a busy body. The mobile is simple and shows the baby the bottoms of the elephants (who would want to look at elephant butts?). The color scheme is like an earthy, canyon style. It goes well with natural stone and wooden elements.
