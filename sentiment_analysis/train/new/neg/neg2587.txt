I didn't keep this chair long enough to try it out but I still feel the need to comment.  The "new straps" are too long and stick out so much no matter how much you tighten them.  My daughter didn't like the way they stuck out in front of her, hitting her chin.  They might be easier to clean but they look and feel uncomfortable.  The cover didn't cover well.  There were large gaps between it and the seat on both sides so I can imagine that food would always get trapped there.  The tray did it for me.  There was no way I could only use one hand.  I had to kneel and watch closely while putting the tray on track.  With five kids, I knew that I wouldn't have time for that.  Back to the drawing board.  Also, not worth the price.
