Haven't used it for its intended purpose yet - just put it together. The holes in the base were drilled incorrectly. On the short sides, there are supposed to be 4 holes: two on the left for for the cam bolt and dowel and two on the right for the same - but one one side the dowel holes were drilled on the wrong side of the board (I think you can see the missing holes in the picture attached). We debated sending it back, but since it just affected the placement of the dowels in one short end, we opted to put it together as is. Once it is all together, it feels very solid, but this is a pretty big factory error. I guess you get what you pay for.
