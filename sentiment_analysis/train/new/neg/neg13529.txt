I was happy when I received this Cup due to that it is big enough to hold enough drink for my daughter's 3 hours in VPK.  But after washing it the first time, I was disappointed with their design, it is a nice idea with the twist to close top, but when you wash it with liquid soap - Make Sure you wash it well because the twist top will hold water inside, meaning if you don't rinse it well it will hold the soapy water inside too -- Unless you have try and Break apart the twist top which is Not easy to open.I did not experience leak since it was just water or juice I put inside, and I didn't experience any bad things with the straw either.
