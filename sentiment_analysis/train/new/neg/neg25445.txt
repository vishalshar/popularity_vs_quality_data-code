I must admit that I read the only review on this backpack and went for it.  I already had the Eddie Bauer Backpack and I thought that getting another one for my husband would be a great idea (since I always leave mine in my car).  This was not worth the money.  When I got it out of the package I was completely excited BUT then I felt the material and tried to fill it up with the necessary stuff.  I hated the fact that I have to un-sip the top (which is not good when you are in a rush to grab something).  Three was hardly enough room in there.  I much more prefer the EddieBauer one so I returned this one and got another one.  Funny thing...my husband is the least picky person I know and he did not like it either.  Go elsewhere when purchasing a backpack...there are many other betters ones out there for the money!!
