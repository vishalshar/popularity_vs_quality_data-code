This is a decent play mat. It has good amount of padding and is easy to clean. It also has a picture on each side. It does smell a little right out of the package but that will dissipate within a day or so. I just wish I had been more observant when I ordered this product. There are different picture options and the one I wanted had castles on it. Unfortunately I wasn't careful when I made the online purchase and didn't notice the castle picture was not the one selected. I got the village one instead. I didn't want to deal with returning it so I just kept it since both my son and daughter liked it. One thing to note though... the picture is kind of busy and though it gives lots for kids to look at it also makes it hard to see toys scattered on it since they blend so well with the pictures. My husband asked me to turn it over to the less busy side and now we can see the toys better.
