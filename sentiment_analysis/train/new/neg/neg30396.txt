Our son sleeps in a crib, so we only used this co-sleeper during morning fussy periods. The concept is good and we liked the overall design of this co-sleeper. However, it is very small, so really only suits newborns. Our 9 week old is already too tall for it.We used it for 3 weeks, and the negatives are:It has a strong chemical smell which we can't seem to get rid of;Quite small interior;Poor ventilation/ breathability (our son, who was fine in his crib, was quite hot in this after only being in it for an hour or so).
