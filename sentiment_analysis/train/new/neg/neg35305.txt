Cutting those precious little fingers is a chore each time I do it, which is like every other day =PI thought the magnifine glass would be super helpful, but honestly, my little one is so active that it's kind of pointless. Also, it's quite blurry even when she's not squirming around.The actual clippers are not as sharp as I'd like them to be. I usually have to push very hard for them to cut the nail and it usually just rips the nail instead of cutting it and then I have to use a nail file afterwards.I would probably use a different product.
