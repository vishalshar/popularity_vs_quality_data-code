I bought this product before my daughter was born because I had read that it was a recommended product to use with cloth wipes. It was nice. The spray smells very nice and works fine. It was a little on the expensive side, and I found that when the bottle was empty, I just refilled it with my own mixture of water, olive oil, and a little baby wash, and it worked just as well.
