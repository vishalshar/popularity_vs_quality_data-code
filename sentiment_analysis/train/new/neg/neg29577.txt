The pictures show a polka dotted fitted sheet however I received a alphabet sheet that is yellowish in color. I love the quilt and the bumper is very cute. The bumper features various words play, nap, dream. I really wanted the polka dotted sheet and am not pleased with the yellow color. I also cannot find any information on how to purchase a second window valance. The quilt had several loose threads but since it has held together after a washing I'm overlooking. The brown trim is like a suede texture and it would have been nicer with a different color to match the great colors on the quilt. I adore the quilt so we're keeping it.
