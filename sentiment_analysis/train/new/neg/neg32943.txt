Can not tell you how disappointed I was with Amazon -I ordered this chair for my grandson on Nov 25, December 1 the money was taken out of my account with a note it should be delivered between the 6th-9th -it wasn't until I inquired about it on December 21 that I found out it wasn't coming,needless to say my grandson did not get a spongebob chair as every store I checked at was sold out. Not sure if I will trust ordering from amazon againRuth Isola
