Every aspect of this booster seat/diaper bag combo is excellent except 1)the seat is too high for my average 25 month old.  His knees will be hitting the underside of the table.  The seat part is 5" high.  So check if this fits your child and table before purchasing 2)Like another reviewer mentioned, the seatback is not tied to the back of the chair, so the seat back keeps falling forward.  You may do some sewing and add some kind of easy mechanism attach the seatback to the chairback.  But that takes time.This is probably an excellent product for smaller/shorter child before age 2.
