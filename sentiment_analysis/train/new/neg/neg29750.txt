These came in a package deal with some other games I purchased for a baby shower at the office. We are a promotional products company and sell pens, all kinds, and not one pen in our office would write on the slick shiny surface, so no one could give the new mommy advice on these cards.  It was a good thought, but a real bummer.  One person literally scratched the message and that was the only one she got.
