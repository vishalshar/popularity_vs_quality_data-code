I like the snap and twist lid, it prevents spills. But we mainly use the cups for smoothies for my daughter, and for some reason smoothie always bubbles up the straw and drips onto the lid. This doesn't happen with regular liquid, so if you just want it for that I think it's a good cup. But we need smoothie cups and we won't get this kind again.
