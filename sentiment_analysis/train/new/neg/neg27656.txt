I loved the concept of magnets in bibs and bought 11 of these.Pros:- great idea to use magnet closures (much better than velcro or snap closures)- beautiful patterns- absorbent terry in the frontCons:- The quality of the actual manufactured product is very poor. There are threads sticking out in some places.- Some places have been sewn severals times over, clearly because the first time around it wasn't right.- The logo label is crooked on several bibs.- Worst of all, in 2 of the bibs the magnets have been sewn in the wrong side up, which means that if I want them to snap, I have to twist the bib...I really appreciate the creative approach here but please, dear Ah Goo Baby, start working on your QA. This low level of quality is not acceptable, especially not for the price.
