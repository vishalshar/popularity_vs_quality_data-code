I ordered this without trying it in store based on the decent reviews out there on blogs, etc.  However, a few design errors were deal breakers for me and had to send it back for the following reasons:- Short Seat Height.  I ordered this rather than the BabyJogger City Select because it has a 55 lb weight limit per seat to appease my 4 yr old occasional rider when we do long walks or trips to the zoo.  However, they should list the height constraints of their seats too.  My 16 months head (32") is already nearing the top of the seat.  My daughters head (41" tall") rests on the frame of the seat already which leads me to my next complaint.- Poor canopy design.  They come straight off the seat frame, unlike others which angle upwards and give the child 4-6 more inches of play.  The result is that my daughter couldn't even use her canopy and my son likely would have the canopy touching his head by the time he turns 2.- The stroller itself seemed well made and the seat materials seem comfortable.  But for the price, I was hoping for a stroller that offered seats that could last us for years.  The high seat capacity seemsirrelevant if my 25 lb 16 month old is likely to outgrow the seat before the age of two.
