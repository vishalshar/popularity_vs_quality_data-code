Boon Flair Highchair is far from a perfect highchair.  It's overall design is great...it's mobility is great on wood floors.I purchased this for my grandson at 5 months, weighing 18 lbs.  The safety straps are not adjustable (can't be made shorter) to strap him in at his current size, to keep him upright in the chair.  The padding for a 5 or 6 month old is insufficient.  Boon needs to add a comfortable seat pad to their line of products for infants.  The tray does not function easily, making it difficult to take on and off.  This is very important if you are holding the infant with one arm and hoping to release the tray table to place him in the highchair. The release lever gets stuck every time.  Frustrating!!!My daughter-in-law was going to order this chair for her home when she first saw it, but now that she has experience the frustration in using this highchair, she is looking to select another highchair.  Boon...you need to make some important improvements.
