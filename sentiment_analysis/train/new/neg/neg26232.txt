I cannot open the straw to this. It is impossible. No way my 5 year old can open it. I have bought these before but for some reason the lid has become so tight and is not usable by a child. It's difficult to close the straw as well so even after finally getting it open your child can't close it so it leaks.  So disappointing as these were my favorite. Is there a way to get a replacement lid?
