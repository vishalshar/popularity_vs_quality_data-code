I am grateful that the NUK learner latex spout is still available, but highly disappointed that the only way I can make sure I get it is to order the bottle that comes with it.  What an absolute waste.  It is really sad that they depend on the big box stores for their numbers to help them decide if they should continue a line or not and ignore online sales, and then not have the big box stores carry the items in store, but online only??!!!  Not good business sense, but when you are put in a barrel, it is either sink or swim.  I only order these because of my 8 yr old grandson that has cerabral palsy and can't use a cup and won't use any other nipple or at least can't bite through them as quickly like he can with the silicon ones.  Very frustrating when trying to find options for special needs children when it is already limited and money is tight, but to waste money on useless items is truly ridiculous.  Please help offer a viable solution that works for everyone.
