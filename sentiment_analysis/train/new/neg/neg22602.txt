I absolutely love this dresser. We bought it for my daughter's nursery after ordering furniture from another retailer only to have the last two dressers in existence (the line was discontinued) come to us damaged. That process took so long and I was sooo close to my due date and I was in a panic. I am very particular about large purchases and this set is so beautiful. I gave the dresser three stars because shortly after receiving the dresser a LARGE piece of paint chipped off of one of the feet. The crib/toddler bed has taken a lot if abuse and has held up wonderfully. Not sure what happened with the foot of this dresser, but with a newborn and an 18 month old I just kind of threw my hands up, which I of course now regret. Other than that one spot of paint, this piece has also held up very well and it's just beautiful!
