I bought this pail over the diaper Genie because I was told that it controlled the smell better. Not true. The smell is horrible and it hold way less than the diaper Genie. Also you have to put your hand down in this pail to put the soiled diaper in and it's gross. I bought a diaper Genie and it's much better.
