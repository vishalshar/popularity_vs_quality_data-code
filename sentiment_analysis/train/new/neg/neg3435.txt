This is the first time I've reviewed something but my experience was so bad I had to share for others... I bought this thinking it'd be better than a pack and play or any other bassinet/sleeper to use next to our bed since I was having a c section and wasn't sure I'd be able to bend over to lift our baby out of the crib or anything lower than the bed. I actually caused more damage to my c section trying to set up and take down this co sleeper. There are 2 springs that have to be popped on all 4 sides and they are impossible to pop. My husband and I wrestled with this for about an hour both when we set it up and took it down. also the mattress pad is very cold and does not insulate. It's not a practical purchase, save the money and. either buy a pack and play with a bassinet feature so you can at least get some use out of it later on or stick to a traditional bassinet.
