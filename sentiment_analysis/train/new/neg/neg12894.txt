I bought this for our child to sit on while taking a bath and the knee pillow.The color is not that stylish but comfort wise it's very nice. Feels great on the feet and when I sat and took a bath on it. The knee pillow is 100% awesome, durable, and drys fast. So feels great and good for the kids and yourself.The bad, the mat will not stay stuck, I read other reviews and didn't think much of it, but I will promise you after the third or fourth time you fall, slip, or halfway die in the tub you will trash the mat and buy a new one that sticks.I would buy this if its for a bath only situation but its impossible to use this safely if of stand up and take showers in the same tub. The knee pillow rules, but the bath mat is almost okay. Pass...
