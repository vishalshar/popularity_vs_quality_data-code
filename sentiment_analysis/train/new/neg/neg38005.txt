I purchased all the "animals" (TRex, Brontosaurus, and Owl) for my three sons, so my opinion is based on three items and not merely one. Foremost, my boys LOVE their nightlights. Even the two year old twins can use the button to set it to the color they want. Having the option of keeping the light on all night or having it turn off after 30 minutes is a nice touch. The downside, however, is that the charging station is not well made. One is already broken and we've only had the item for a week! The children haven't been playing with the charging stations, so it's just through normal use that the little piece of metal is depressed to the point that it doesn't make contact with the nightlight and thus does not charge it. We like it enough to exchange in and give it another try, but agree with previous reviewers that this shouldn't be expected to last for the long haul. We have also never had the charging light turn green on any of three nightlights - no matter how long we charge it.
