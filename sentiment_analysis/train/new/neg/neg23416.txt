I wish I had purchased another brand of mesh feeder. With my first baby, we had the other leading brand and it was extremely easy to clean. I thought I would these with my second baby. Bad choice! I love mesh feeders, but the mesh food net on this kind is impossible to get clean. It is supposed to be reusable, not disposable. I have soaked them for 48hrs in vinegar, then hand washed them, then ran them through the dishwasher, then hand washed them again only to have to trash two after 1-2 uses (banana, avocado). Food gets trapped in the extra netting wrapped around the ring. The design is flawed.
