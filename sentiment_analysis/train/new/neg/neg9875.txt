One of the reviewers said they had talked to Motorola and they said the Focus360 would pair with an MBP36 camera. This is not the case.  I called Motorola and they said it would pair with an Mbp43 not an Mbp36.  I wanted to get it as a spare for the two MBP36 sets I bought for my children.  The indoor unit worked very well with the monitor, but since it can't work with the six cameras I have already purchased, back it went.  Also be aware that some of units being sold as MBP-36B are really SCOUT1000 pet monitors that will also not pair with and MBP36.
