My daughter used this seat for almost two years before we discovered that she could pull the chest clip apart without pinching the release. I tried it myself and you can EASILY PULL IT APART WITH TWO HANDS. This is NOT SAFE as the force of a car accident would be a lot stronger than a 2 year olds hands, and obviously would not keep the child in tact. Britax only warrantees for one year despite it being a "five year" sear. So check your clips and buckles often!!! This will fall apart long before your child is done using it.Also the styrofoam liner cracked in half at the top of the shell. Despite that it was very rarely transferred from one vehicle to another and mostly just sat in my car.I am a big fan of the safety features offered by Britax, and thoroughly did my research before purchasing. However, despite their safety features it is definitely an over priced car seat if the chest clip, which is ESSENTIAL to a child's safety in a car, breaks so simply, and so early on in the car seats "life" -  not to mention that it wasn't even an obvious malfunction- if my daughter hasn't started fiddling with it, I never would have know- unless of course there had been an accident where she had been propelled out of it.Not happy at all.
