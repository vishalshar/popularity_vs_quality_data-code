I wish more people that have leather seats would take this product off their seat and then write a review.  They would find that the glue has melted into the leater seat.  I was able to get the glue off the seat but in the process I have rubbed the leather raw.  There is now permanent discoloration in the seats.  Avoid this product and any similar product that has exposed glue on the back.  I should have realized the glue would melt but Amazon needs to stop selling this product as well.
