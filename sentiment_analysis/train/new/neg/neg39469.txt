I wanted to love this necklace and am kinda bummed that i ordered 2 one for me one for a friend. Its great that its silicone and organic.. But not great that it is shipped in a pvc bag and absorbs all of the offgassing smell in transit to me in las vegas. I tried soapy water, i tried govong it a few days.. It smells like a pool toy. =\ therefore im not to keen on letting my daughter put it in her mouth. Very pretty, great idea. May i suggest cloth draw string baggies? Id pay a dollar or two more to cover the cost difference of going from plastic to cloth packaging.
