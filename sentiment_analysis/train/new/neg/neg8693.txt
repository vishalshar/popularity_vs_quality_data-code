This is such a great idea, and would probably work in theory for a child who walks more upright but just needs a little extra balance support. My kid leans forward alot when he walks, which is really hard on our backs when we are holding both his hands to walk him around the house. Got this thinking it would save our backs, but he doesn't like it squeezing his torso, and he seems to lean even more when its on because it gives him something to lean into. Also, you have to hold both straps at the same time or he can end up spinning around, which makes it hard to navigate with this since his hands are free to grab things and sometimes you need to remove something from his hand, but you cant without letting go.
