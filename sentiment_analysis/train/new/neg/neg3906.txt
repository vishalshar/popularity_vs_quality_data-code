After the Boon frog bath toy holders adhesive failed within a week I ordered this extra part which really should be included with the original Boon frog. It worked great at first, held everything up for several weeks, then quit. The rubber of the suction cups seems to have dried out or warped in some other way, I can only get half the panel to stick, which results in the frog falling again and again. And yes all instructions for cleaning and adhering where followed to the letter. Disappointing because the toy holder is really cute, and ended up being quite expensive after having to buy it and this part and still having fail.
