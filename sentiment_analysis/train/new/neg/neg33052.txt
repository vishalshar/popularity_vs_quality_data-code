I bought this Memory Book a short time before our child arrived, I absolutely love that it has each month milestone pages, and that it has a lot of places to write different milestones in. This book is very gender neutral which is perfect for a baby boy or a baby girl. It would be nice if some of the spaces to write were larger but other than that it's an overall great book. The quality of the book is top notch and holds up well over the years. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
