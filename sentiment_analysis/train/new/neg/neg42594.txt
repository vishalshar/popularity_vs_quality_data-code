I bought this to add some softness to my sons mattress in his toddler bed. It's not often he wets the bed, but he has had a couple of accidents. Supposedly this is machine washable and had great reviews so I purchased this one.It's definitely soft and provides just enough extra padding to make the mattress comfy, but it did live up to the washing! It basically disintegrated in the washing machine. The water proof plastic-like bottom just ripped open in the washing machine!Not worth it if it only last a few months before needing a replacement!
