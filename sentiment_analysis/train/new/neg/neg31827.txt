I purchased this stroller because it was lightweight and compatible with my Maxi-Cosi Cabrio car seat/ carrier. I was excited because I heard so many great things about it. However, I was really disappointed by the quality of the zippers. The seat attaches to the frame via zippers and velcro. You need to zip off the seat and attach the car seat adaptors in order to use it to carry the car seat. This is a pain in itself, but the zippers were really difficult to open and close. The zippers collapsed and were impossible to close. There are zippers around the whole thing! One would think they would use quality zippers. Trying to zip the zipper around the bottom corners gave my husband and I blisters! We literally worked on closing the zipper for over a half an hour. I am returning it unzipped.I really like the color, the way it maneuvers and its size, but I can't deal with the aggravation of the zippers. The Maxi-Cosi products I ordered recently are different than the models from Europe. I am not sure if it is the same with the Quinny. I can't imagine people singing the praises of this stroller if they used the same zippers.
