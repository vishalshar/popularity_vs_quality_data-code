I used this bag for the better part of the first year of my now 2-year old son.  It was small and compact (I don't like giant bags because I can never find things in a hurry and everything is rushed when your child is crying or whining), my husband liked that it wasn't a "girly bag", it fit our baby necessities for short trips and was very durable.  Durability is most important to me.  I know myself; I throw bags around, I'm liable to spill my drink on it, I over pack.  My one complaint is that I could not attach it to his umbrella stroller without it tipping over.  But, overall, this bag did all for me...  That is until my son started growing and demanding snacks and wearing larger clothes and needing toys to entertain him while we were waiting in line.  We soon graduated to another canvas bag - a Skip Hop to be exact and in an exciting red, stylish color.  Skip Hop Duo - Canvas-Charcoal
