We were looking for a simple, economically priced highchair.  This highchair meets that description and seems to be durable.  My husband says it is easy to fold up, but I have never had the need to do that and do not even know how.  My daughter loves the pictures of the animals on the seat cover.  So, all of that is great.  The chair worked perfectly when our daughter was younger and we fed her (and there was basically no mess).  Now, that she is 18 months old and has been feeding herself for some time, like most toddlers, she gets food (including yogurt and applesauce) all over the highchair - not only on the tray, but in the seat, on the seat belt straps, etc.  It is easy enough to take the tray off and stick it in the sink to wash.  However, the straps and chair cover are another story.  They do not come off, and they are a real challenge to clean.  Also the design of the high chair includes having little open slots on the arm rests/side bars that the tray slides on to.  Food (e.g., yogurt, applesauce, sauces) gets packed into the slots and is difficult to clean out - we wipe the side bars down but cannot get the wet food out of the slots (we just end up pushing it into the slots more).  So, then, it gets dried/ caked into the slots.  I've tried to use a sharp knife with thin point to scrape out caked-on food but it is not entirely effective and a rather gross job.  If I were buying a high chair again, I would make sure to get one that is easier to clean - with removable straps and cover.  Paying a little more would be worth it!  Every time I have to clean the chair, I resent how inconvenient it is - as I was resenting the job yesterday, I decided it is time to write a review and let others know about this downfall.
