PROSThis stroller is very easy to put together.BIG CANOPY!! Just like my BOB stroller!Rides pretty smooth.Easy to recline the seatBIG basket underneath.Lots of pockets to put all your junk in.Handle bar adjust to different positions.CONSBoth cup holders suckRethreading the harness for your child's appropriate heights SUCKS!The peekaboo window on the canopy is in a weird place. It is too far forward. You would have to pull back the canopy or move yourself to the side of the stroller. At that point, there is no point for the window! You can just check on the baby by peeking through the side.THE SEAT IS NOT DEEP ENOUGH!!!!!! Arrrrrg!!!! Why?! My son is 8 months old and is of normal weight. He fits OK, but I wish it would go further back. It measures only 9 inches from the front of the seat to the very back. He just doesn't look comfortable in it. The leg space is also VERY short! Like I said my baby is of normal height and weight, but why are his legs almost reaching the foot groove.I'm going to send it back. Although the price is excellent at $109. I just don't see this stroller lasting very long. My son might outgrow it next month!!I get that they are trying to sell a fairly priced stroller that "looks" like the designer strollers. But the execution is lacking.The YouTube videos I researched never pan down so you can see how the child is fitting in the seat. Same with blog reviews. These youtubers/bloggers who review the stroller got the stroller for free so they encourage the recipient to give a good review.
