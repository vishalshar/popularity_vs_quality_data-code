I have 19 month old triplets that LOVE to play with their sippy cups and throw them down.  AND, it isn't that this particular product doesn't work well for the purpose it is supposed to provide - but the sippy cup industry (which I have tried many brands) need to get on board to create cups that don't leak.  So, when I tried this product I had great hope that even if they threw them or dropped them, that they would in fact be something that they could bring up themselves - this would be the case, except I had to constantly put them back up on the trays because the stupid sippy cups that aren't supposed to leak, just drip drip drip on the floor.  So, either way, I'm still having to do something with the sippy cups.  All told... if this product company can come up with sippy cups that don't leak - then I'll give both of those products 5 stars.  Because this review is supposed to influence people to buy, or not to buy... all I can say is that the product works beautifully - but my sippy cups leak on the floor none-the-less.  I do hope being able to utilize this product on long car trips when they are a bit older... it may still leak all over the place, but I'll at least be able to find them easily!
