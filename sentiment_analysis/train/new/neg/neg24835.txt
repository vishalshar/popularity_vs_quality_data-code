I got this based on reviews, large size, fits everything, Mine has a front flap over it, like a messenger bag, that gives you another flat pocket.  My two main complaints are the openning and the storage space.  I hate the openning; it's more of a slit.  If they removed the zipper portion it would be much better; easier to load and unload. The inside is 'squared-off' and sturdy to be supportive, which I thought was the greatest thing when I saw it.  I can stack my diapers and clothing and it won't become a jumbled mess.  The bag has too much lining inside - I don't need to keep my diapers and clothing cool.  I feel I can't fit much more in this bag than the Mini-Messenger bag I use so often.  It is such a large size, but only to carry.  I expected a lot more.
