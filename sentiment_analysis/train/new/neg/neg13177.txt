have to check periodically to make sure the thing dies not fail at the stress points.  mine came with the thinner strap rather than the plushy strap as shown in the picture - but return was taken care of. only mentioning in case the plushy strap is more durable (safer) than the canvas scratchier strap, but not for certain that the plushier strap has more durability/strength/lastsLonger. got another one with the plushy strap, and might shorten the leash by tying a knot.
