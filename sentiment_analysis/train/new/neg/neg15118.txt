If you are looking for a lightweight bag that you can shove an entire days worth of baby needs in...this is NOT it! It looks big, but is deceiving. The pockets are too small and the material is so rigid, that everything is hard to fit and find in it. I couldn't put it in my stroller basket because it didn't fit under the car seat. Even without anything in it, it is way too HEAVY! I was excited about the print, but the bag was a flop!I hated the hard plastic bag inside it to, nothing fits in it but a single diaper maybe. The separating pocket it flimsy and useless, and just gets in the way. There are two VERY small mesh pockets on the inside that not even my bottles fit in. I plan on returning this asap.
