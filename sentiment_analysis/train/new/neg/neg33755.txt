My 3 year old sucks his thumbs, so I bought two of these guards. Sometimes they work, when he's agreeable to putting on the guard. Othertimes, when he's determined to suck his thumb, he'll pry his thumb out of the thumb guard piece (and leave the contraption on his wrist) to suck it or he'll even pry off the whole contraption without opening the clasp. Overall, this works if the child wants help to stop sucking his/her finger.
