It does what it says it will do - it is very sturdy and boosts the chair up well.  It has two different levels of height, depending on which side you flip up or down.  What I didn't like about it was that it was a bit awkward to use.  I bought this hoping I could avoid yucky restaurant boosters/high chairs - I could just keep it in my car and bring it in to any restaurant and turn any chair into a high chair for my toddler - but it is too awkward to use that frequently. You have to get down on the ground, and pull each side out (spring-loaded; which is part of what keeps it sturdy, so I get it...but it didn't help for my needs) and have someone else holding the chair in place for you to maneuver the sides.  It's not something easily done by one person...so I sent it back.  If you need this for home use, where you will put it up and leave it somewhere for awhile, then you would probably love it.  But I was looking for something more portable.
