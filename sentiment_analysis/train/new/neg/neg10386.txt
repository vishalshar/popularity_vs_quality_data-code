So the title of the review says most of how I feel. This thing will NOT fit a newborn unless your newborn is the size of a 5 month old. If you snap it down so that it's the smallest possible, the fit is very strange--the corners that fasten down in the front sort of work their way out of position.  The material is very soft and breathable seeming and doesn't seem to stain easily. I will say that we haven't really had a leaking issue with this, but we also don't use this cover very often. I'm sure we will like it more once the baby is older (maybe like 7-8 months; baby is long but skinny).
