This was very cute, my 4 year old loved it. It feels firmer than the last silicone pendant I bought her which lasted about 4 months, so I had high hopes. Turns out the niche between body and head was irresistible, and it was decapitated within 36 hours of reciept. Oh well, on to the next, sturdier, uglier thing to keep teeth marks off of all my belongings.
