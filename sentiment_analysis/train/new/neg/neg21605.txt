I bought these shields shortly after giving birth, because the shields supplied with the pump were not big enough.  However, I was quickly disappointed to learn that these were not much better. I can assure you I am not that chesty of a lady (C cup on a good day) so I was surprised that even a large seemed snug.  I experienced a lot of rubbing and discomfort.  I was almost ready to give up pumping and breastfeeding all together, but then I discovered the pumping pals shields.  They are a bit more expensive, but you get 3 sizes in one purchase.  They work way better and I highly recommend them over this product.
