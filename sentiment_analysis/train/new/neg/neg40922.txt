We have loved this car seat. It's light weight, easy to install, comfy for my son, and it looks great. However, the max. height and weight (22 lbs, 29") for this seat is so low - much lower than many other car seats. So, at 8 months, we have to buy a new car seat because my son is about to outgrow this one. So, if you don't mind using this for less than a year and then spending another $150 on a new seat, this one is great. If you're looking for something that lasts a little longer, keep looking.
