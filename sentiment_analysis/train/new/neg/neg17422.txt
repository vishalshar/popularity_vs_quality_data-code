The first box that was delivered was almost completely destroyed, barely held together by a few remaining pieces of tape. Two sides of the box were open and completely exposed to the elements. Peering into the box it was obvious that some pieces were banged up and water damaged. Amazon promptly agreed to arrange for a return and to ship us a new one. (The UPS guy who picked up the package gave me a hard time about accepting such a beat up box.) The second dresser arrived in a box that was also seriously distressed, but the sides were still intact so we decided to try to open and put it together.Inside we found that a container of 26 wood screws was broken open. We found about 11 screws throughout the packaging that had caused a number of superficial scratches to the facade of the dresser, but at this point we decided to keep it rather than hold out hope that the third dresser would be in any better shape. Luckily we had wood screws that we could substitute for the missing screws. Then putting together one of the drawers, we noticed that the drawer slider on one side had been incorrectly pre-attached to the top of the drawer instead of the bottom. We had to unscrew that drawer slider, drill on the correct side of the drawer and re-attach it ourselves. Finally two holes that should have been pre-drilled to attach the top side of the dresser had not been drilled so we had to do that ourselves as well. The directions were a bit lacking, especially the photographs, and it required a lot of patience on our part to figure this out.Believe it or not though, the dresser itself is actually pretty good quality for the money. For comparison, it's much more stable and better quality materials than the dresser we got from Ikea for our first baby. If they could just figure out how to ship it....
