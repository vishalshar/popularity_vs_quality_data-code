These baskets are awful.  I usually don't return anything to amazon.com, since most items are great, but these are loser baskets.  First of all, they stink.  They are so stinky, they give me a headache.  Secondly, the wood is not smooth.  Then, the paint chips.  The liners don't fit.  I am afraid to put my baby's blankets in these baskets because I think the wood may push through the thin, crummy liner and my baby will get splinters.  YUCK.  I rarely write a review, but these are seriously awful baskets.  I can't believe all the positive reviews this item has received.
