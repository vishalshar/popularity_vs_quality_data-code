We bought these because we wanted to avoid the throw away bags and the milk touching the plastic. unfortunately, this didn't work out for us because the pyrex dishes we stored the milk sticks in didn't allow us to utilize the space well. Also, the milk sticks are sticking to the glass and were hard to remove. we now are doing the following:1 - freeze milk in milk trays2 - remove milk and store in Target disposable pouches (nice thing: only a little milk touches the plastic)3 - depending on how much we need, we take sticks out of the pouches and don't have to defrost it all.am hoping to get more value out of these trays with baby food but am considering baby led weaning so this might not get us much value after all
