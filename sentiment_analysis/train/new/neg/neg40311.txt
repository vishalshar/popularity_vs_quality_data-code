Our only issue with this unit is that it doesn't extend the height of the seat high enough above a City Select twin stroller to allow the Britax infant seat to sit facing mom while having a toddler seat below facing outward. If this adapter was an inch taller, the seat would clear the toddler seat. This is a big design flaw, mostly with the City Select twin stroller, but blame falls on this adapter as well. We can force the infant seat down until it clicks but doing so puts strain on this adapter and on the toddler seat.Again: with a Britax infant seat using these adapters to face backward toward mom while also wanting a City Select toddler seat on the lower attachment point facing outward (toddlers want to look outward), there isn't enough clearance to make both the toddler seat and the car seat click into place comfortably. This is the problem buying a City Select in the first year it came out for twins. They might fix the design next year. It will click together if we force it, but this may weaken the structure over time.Come on! This was made for the City Select and they partnered with Britax . . . Does engineering not try these things out first?UPDATE!! This is now an older model. The new model, model number BJ90331 solves the above issue! When ordering, make sure to order this new model number, and not an older one. The new model adapters are taller, allowing for enough clearance to have the Britax infant seat up top facing mom, and the toddler seat facing outward below.
