I only used the toilet seat part yet (not the bottom potty).1) The pee guard is awful. One of the major reasons we bought this was the pee guard, as the son has a hang-up about "Don't want to go #2 on toilet because I'm afraid I'll pee on the floor". First of all, it is EXTREMELY wide. Basically, unusable - the child immediately said it's very uncomfortable to sit with (could not bring his legs as close together as he's used to). On top of that, the design of it is bad (very flimsy where it goes into the seat, AND not easy to go in/out, and too many curves/bends/details to easily wash thoroughly). Plus, just looks like cheap junk, to top it off :)2) The seat top sticks to the child's butt VERY much. MUCH stronger than previous toilet seat tops we used.Pros include the handles - very convenient and well designed, and the quality - other than pee guard (which was very important to us) it looks/feels/works pretty well.
