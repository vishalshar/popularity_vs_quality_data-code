I rarely write reviews, especially bad ones, but this product is so poorly made and ill designed that I feel obligated to help save other well meaning parents.  I bought this watch TWICE and both times it arrived DOA with dead batteries.  TWICE, like the naive and loving mom that  I am, I bought  $10 worth of batteries for a $11 watch and committed minor surgery to replace the batteries  (a task that involves prying off the wristband and marring it, design fail) .  BOTH occasions, after said surgery and reassembly, the piece of junk malfunctioned!!!  In different ways!!!  The first one would turn off after 1 countdown instead of resetting itself like it is supposed to.  The second had a faulty Timer button that only worked when the watch was disassembled and would no longer respond when put together  (loved unscrewing and rescrewing those tiny little screws several times to figure that out).  Now I have to disappoint my daughter a second time that the timer is broken and mommy can't fix it!!!Oh, and in case you are still considering buying this, even if yours does work, the design is TERRIBLE.  The only way to turn it off is hit Set and the Timer together, release both, then hit Timer 4 more times till you cycle through the menu to off....that's right, a 6-click-off-series every nap and bedtime AND the same 6 click series to turn it on and select your child's correct potty duration when they wake up and to reset the duration if they pee early!!!  Hate parents and daycare teachers much PottyTime??!!!Amazon is not responsible for the garbage product, but they are responsible for continuing to stock it knowing 1/2 the time the product arrives defective and DOA!  Tell PottyTime to spend  $5 more to make a viable product before you agree to stock it again.  Weâ€™ll all happily pay the extra $5 for a non-POS that doesn't disappoint our kids when we're right in the middle of trying to get them excited about potty training...just sayin!
