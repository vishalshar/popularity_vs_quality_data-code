These ARE super soft but I felt like they weren't great quality. There is a square in the middle and it started coming loose and getting a hole where it was stitched. And if you like to swaddle tightly, I feel like bamboo is not great for that. My son kept getting loose, which he never did with muslin blankets. Overall, a soft blanket to cuddle with but don't expect a lifetime out of it, or a tight swaddle.
