Ordered two, had to return one as it was broken upon receiving it. Returned it and got another one...it was also broken upon receiving it. So just returned it and kept the one which is hard to use. The gate is incredibly hard to open to put in place. Maybe it's just my gate, but I feel it should be easier to slide open and close. It also sometimes doesn't tighten against the wall in some doorways. Is the wall uneven or is it the gate? My 8 month old lifted himself up and the gate fell on top of him. At 8 months old he's pretty strong, but shouldn't be able to pull down a baby gate, isn't that it's purpose. Still using the one gate, but not the biggest fan.
