This item looks really nice.  Unfortunately, not one single piece was cut properly which caused us to have to scissor-cut every single decal!  Considering there are more than 90 individual decals on this set!  What should have been a 30-minute project turned into a 2.5 hour project.  I'm 9 months pregnant and did not expect to be EXHAUSTED when I was done putting up decals in my daughter's room!  I was highly disappointed in the quality of workman ship in this product.  It looks beautiful up on the wall.  Unfortunately, we had to go through a miserable experience to get there.
