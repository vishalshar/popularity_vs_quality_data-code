I like the chair and love that you can roll it from one room to the next without having to move the baby.  My 8 month old son loves it.  The bouncer is easy to travel with as it just comes apart and lays flat in our luggage.  The only difficulty I've had with it is trying to change the seat positions.  The locking system is really, really difficult to change the different seat settings.  I wish they had a way to make that more user friendly.
