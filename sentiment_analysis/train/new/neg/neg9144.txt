I see that this product was discontinued. I orignally bought this item 3 years or so ago for my son's bathroom so that he could brush his teeth better and take a drink more easily. However, as memory has it, they didn't fit well and constantly needed to be cleaned. I don't believe we used this for that long before taking them off. I don't like to give less than 3 star, but this one really didn't do the job that I needed it to do. Sorry for the late review on this item, but better late than never.
