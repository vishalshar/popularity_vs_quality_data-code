One star because the information on the product is incorrect. It claims to be the exact size of a C battery but it is not. The distance between the end of the positive contact and the negative is about 1/2 millimeter too short. The battery might work in installations where the battery sits by itself but in installations where the battery is installed in tandem |----|-|-----|- for example, the combined shortness of two batteries prevents them from making contact. The manufacturer should correct the description or make certain that the length of the battery is correct.
