This is an old product, but i have one and now I use it for my son...The bee rolls, wobbles and flutters forward and back,  but the motion is provided by you pushing it and then hopefully your baby is crawling after it!  It's fine for what it is for the price point...  This is just a simple crawling enhancer - no bells or whistles but that's nice sometimes when there are so many products out there that are loud and bright!
