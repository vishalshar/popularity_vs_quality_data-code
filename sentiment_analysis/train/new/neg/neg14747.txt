At first we were very happy with those diaper covers but with time we grew more and more disappointed and now I cannot imagine a worse cover!Why we don't like them:1) The biggest problem for us is that the velcro tab always scratches the gentle skin of our baby, so we always have to put a body on our girl and make sure the tabs are as far from the skin as possible. I tried to fix the problem myself by cutting and sewing the edges, but the material is just too rough and keeps on cutting into the skin of our daughter. Sometimes the scratches are so deep that the blood comes out!!!2) Approx after 3 months of intensive use the velcro tabs stopped sticking together! So they still scratch our baby but they dont hold the diaper closed!3) They leak! They don't hold more than 1 pee. They get completely soaked easily and the clothes get all wet as well!They do have some positive sides I must admit:1) They are soft and breathable, we never had a problem with Alida having a diaper rash or "green house" moisture effect on her skin.2) they fit great over fitted diapers and are very trim.3) the sizing is very "strechable". Since our daughter was 2 months we have used only NewBorn and Small size covers till this day (she is 7 months now). The newborn cover still fits her ok (Alida weighs 8 kg now).so there ARE some positive sides, but this scratching issue + the fact that they don't last more than 4 months (the tabs stop sticking)made us completely unsatisfied with the product. We move on to Thirsties Duo and Gen-Y covers.
