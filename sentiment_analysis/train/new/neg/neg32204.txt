Assembly was going great. This piece seemed to be coming together nicely, it is heavy and strudy. The color is a nice deep espresso and it is a clean-lined, low profile design. Just what I was looking for. That was until the last step of assembly...applying the lid support on the inside of the bench. The piece did not fit correctly and I had to muscle it into place which caused me to ruin this application. I stripped the pre-drilled holes from repeated attempts to get it on correctly. That never happened. The screws were incorrect for the lid support, short and ill-fitting. I ended up NOT using the lid support. I'm not sure if this was human error or a manufacturing error. I am open to suggestions, I held on to the lid support in hopes I can figure it out eventually. The inside of the bench is now a mess and has no support for when it is opened. Soooo close to being the perfect piece, but sadly it is not.
