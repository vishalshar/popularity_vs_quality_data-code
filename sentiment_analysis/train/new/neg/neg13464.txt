I really do like this product. It is convenient for feeding cereal and jar baby food.  Baby sucks down the food just like a bottle. Spoon feeding takes time and makes a mess, you get very little waste using this thing.Downsides: product is cheaply made.  There are no replacement parts, so if some part goes lost, you need to buy a whole new one. These are usually inexpensive so maybe it doesn't make sense to sell parts.  The nipple is OK, but a bit small for thicker foods, but see my hacks below.  Plunger doesn't always seal that great.  If you fill the container with food, some liquid will eventually leak out, so it is better to fill at the time of need. Also watch out, if baby throws this on the floor, the plunger will come loose and it makes a mess.Hacks: buy yourself a set of Dr Brown's Y cut nipples. Those nipples are so large they will pass any food you put in here.  Thicker food works better than thinner food in this feeder. With the Y cut nipple I would suggest using the little round grate as the smaller nipple base makes a better seal.  You can use this without that grate (especially if you misplace it), but take care on alternate nipples as baby can push them into the feeder.I have 4 of these and would buy more. Any challenges here are offset by the convenience you get feeding your child on the go.
