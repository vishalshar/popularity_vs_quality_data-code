This latch is very easy to install and easy to open and close. There are no problems when being used on cabinet doors with handles. The big issue is on cabinet doors with knobs. The 'U' portion on the latch fits easily behind the head of the knob on one cabinet. The slide lock portion does not fit behind the second cabinet knob. You have to slide it up as close as possible. If you yank the door open forgetting the latch is on, it will open up. Once the kid gets strong enough and wises up to the situation, he can (and will) just pull on the latch and it will pop off the knobs. Thus ineffective. we ended up keeping this on the handle cabinets and wound a rubber band around the knobs on the others.
