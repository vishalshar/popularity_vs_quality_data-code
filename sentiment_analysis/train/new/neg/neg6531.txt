I got this mobile because it went with our collection. I just opened it. There were only picture instructions (a poor diagram at best) which didn't necessarily reflect the model in the box. After putting it together, I found the music and mobile didn't even work. I plan to return the mobile and purchase a different one. The only reason I give it two stars is because it was cute... just didn't work.
