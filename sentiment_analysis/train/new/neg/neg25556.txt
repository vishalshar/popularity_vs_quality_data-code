We've got the Jeep Liberty all terrain stroller and absolutely adore it, so when we were needing an umbrella stroller, this was a natural choice.  We were shocked when we brought this one home and discovered the wheels don't roll properly.  We got it from BRU, and the floor sample had the same problem.  We were so confident in the company we figured it was just messed up by so many customers handling it, but got home and took our brand new one out of the box and discovered it had the same problem.There are two wheels on every leg of the stroller, and only one touches the ground and they don't roll freely, nor do they pivot with turns...it felt like we were pushing a broken shopping cart, with one wheel turned the wrong way no matter what we did.I"m incredibly disappointed, and just wanted to warn other folks out there about this.Otherwise, it's really compact, with a nice seat, three point harness and relatively light weight and if it weren't such torture to roll around, it would be a great stroller.  No storage compartment (basket) on the model we bought.good luck
