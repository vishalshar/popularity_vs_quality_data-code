I cannot complain about the shipping as it actually arrived earlier than expected but the quality is awful. I would not have paid so much for this had I known the quality was going to be so bad. For starters I bought a cover to go on the pillow because the pillow was a little scratchy feeling but after three washes in attempt to soften up the fabric the cover has turned out to be more scratchy than the pillow was. After trying to soften it up to no avail my husband finally put the cover on the pillow and it immediately ripped right in the corner where your shoulder goes and I don't mean small hole either.  The cute pattern and the shipping speed were the only good things about this cover. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING!!!!!!!!
