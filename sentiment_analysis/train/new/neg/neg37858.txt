These are much much smaller and thinner than I expected but they do the job for younger babies. These would be most helpful as a doubler for an infant probably up to a year old, but once you get a heavier-wetting and more mobile toddler, you will probably want to look into something a bit bigger. We have several brands of cloth diapers, and in all of them, this doesn't cover front to back as an insert unless the diaper is on the smallest setting. There is nothing wrong with them per say, they just aren't as big as I expected therefore they didn't work as an overnight doubler for my toddler like I was hoping. The size of these inserts is definitely why these are so much less expensive than other bamboo inserts, so if you are looking into bamboo for a heavy wetter or a nighttime diaper alternative, these aren't the inserts to purchase.
