This is a very nice heavier cotton wearable blanket. It is not made of the jersey/t-shirt/interlock knit that some of the other HALO cotton wearable blankets are made of. This one is more of a light sweatshirt, french terry style material. Just FYI, in case your house is warm, and/or your kid runs warm.
