I purchased this travel bag for my Peg-Perego Pliko P3 stroller. First trip and it did not reach the destiny unharm: two small holes on the bottom and one of the two plastic feet broken.  It is not a top quality product, IMO.Pros: it is easy to grab and pull and has the ideal dimensions for flights(you will not pay for a larger box to transport your stroller).
