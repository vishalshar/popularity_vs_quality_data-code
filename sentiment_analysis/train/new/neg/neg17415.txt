I'm very disappointed in the poor quality of this bag. My son is only 6 months old, I was home with him for the first couple of months so the Jeep diaper bag hasn't been used much at all, yet many different features have failed.The main zipper has frayed so badly the bag no longer closes, this is not caused from the zipper getting stuck on the material while zipping. The seams are also fraying in other spots.  One of the buckles that attaches the bag to the stroller jammed and the strap had to be undone to detach it, but the buckle is still jammed and the bag can't be used on the stroller anymore. I only used that feature about 10 times before it broke. The whole bag is now broken and unusable after only a few months of gentle use  :(
