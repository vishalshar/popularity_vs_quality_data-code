I love the Britax (double) stroller, and I love almost everything about this bassinet, but the thing I don't love is annoying enough that I have to lower my rating to 3 stars. That thing is: the canopy can only be pulled up or put down by simultaneously pushing in 2 buttons on the side. I am using this item for my 3d child, so I am quite experienced. But  for the life of me, I can't understand why this precautionary mechanism is necessary. It just gets in the way, exactly when you need it to be easy.
