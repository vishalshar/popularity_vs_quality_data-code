thin and rough. elastic is sooo tight that it was very hard for me to put them on the mattress. they also shrunk on cold wash and low heat drying so when on the mattress, the corners of the mattress are squished down. wish i could return them, but i already washed them to see if that would soften them up. :( color is great.
