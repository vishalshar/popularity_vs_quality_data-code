This product was so cute in the pictures but we were so disappointed when we opened it. The fabric is thin and stiff and cheap looking. Most distressing of all is the fact that the bed skirt didn't fit.  It was supposed to be 52" long.  The length of a standard baby bed mattress.  It wasn't even that length if you counted the ruffle and all. The width was correct but the length was about 14" short.  Also, the ties on the bumper pads are so short they wouldn't fit around some of the rails.  The blanket is cute and the fitted sheet is fine...we washed some of the pieces before we started putting it together so we didn't feel like we could return it.  We,re going to find another bed skirt and just live with the rest of it since time is an issue but I would recommend looking  at this at a store before ordering.
