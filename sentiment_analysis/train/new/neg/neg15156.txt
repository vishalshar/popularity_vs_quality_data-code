I had high hopes for this activity gym. It changes position so a baby can by lying down or sitting or standing to play with it. But. Ours broke. My son is only 7 months. We have had this for probably only 4 months. He is sitting and standing up on things now but I can't change the position it is in!! It is stuck in the lying down position. Now I have changed the position many times before so it is not user error. The little teal/blue buttons that you press to release it are no longer functional.
