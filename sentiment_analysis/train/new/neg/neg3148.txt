The Luvabe Friends 3 Piece Manicure Set is smaller than I expected.  The angle on the scissors could be a little more.  Otherwise they work fine.  They aren't the most durable set I've ever owned but they do the job and work well for the price paid.None of the stores in my area carried this style of nail clippers for babies and this is the only style we trust to make sure we aren't taking too much off of baby's tiny fingers.
