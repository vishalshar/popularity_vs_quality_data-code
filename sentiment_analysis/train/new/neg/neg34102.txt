I wanted this original version which actually "snaps" and isn't secured by straps like in the newer version (Snap N' Go EX Universal), and thought I would save a few bucks by using the Open Box option, but they sent me the EX Universal instead! I'm in the process of exchanging it now. I'm really excited about this product and hope the switch goes smoothly!
