This just doesn't bounce.  My 6 month old niece already had a Fisher Price Rainforest Jumperoo, and LOVES to bounce.  Bought this as a backup for my house, and she hated it.  She tried and tried to bounce, but got nowhere.  The look of disappointment on her face was heartbreaking.  Get the Jumperoo instead.  Also, it was difficult to put together, and one of the little "arms" that hold toys never fit and had to be thrown away.
