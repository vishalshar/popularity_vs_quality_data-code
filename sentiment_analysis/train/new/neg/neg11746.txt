The bike attachment has been discontinued and is not sold anywhere. They need to update the product metadata to reflect this. Baby Jogger had little sympathy that I spent over $400 on a product that can't be used for what I purchased it for. I will be returning. Don't buy this if you think you'll be using it as a bike trailer.
