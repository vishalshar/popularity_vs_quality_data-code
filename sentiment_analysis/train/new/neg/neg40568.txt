DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!These bottles leak unbelievably from the side "anti-colic" holes in the nipples. The top of the nipples do not leak but once my baby was sucking it created a huge wet mess on her shirt!! You can clearly see those useless holes that were not properly placed because they leak!!AGAIN DO NOT BUY!!!I couldn't return because I tried all three bottles and they all leaked!
