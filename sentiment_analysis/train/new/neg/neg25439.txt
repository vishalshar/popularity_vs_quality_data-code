Muslin is light - good for summer. However the snap closure on top is about a half inch lower than where the zipper ends, and leaves the metal zipper exposed. Would not buy again simply for that reason as baby can easily put zipper in their mouth. Also, it is a "one-size" item. It's pretty big on my large 4-month old, so it's probably best suited for 6-18 month babies.
