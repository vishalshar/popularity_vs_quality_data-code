I was pleased with the low price of this (licensed character) slumber bag.  However, I was disappointed to find that the inside is made of the same vinyl/plastic like fabric as the outside.  A child can't be expected to be comfortable sleeping on this type of fabric, so I lined the inside with a flannel sheet. It's now a usable slumber bag-so if you don't know how to line a sleeping bag-don't order this item.
