I love how this booster fits in my chairs and my daughter thinks it is very comfortable, but BEWARE...There is white text on the bottom of the booster and it has rubbed off on my leather chairs. I managed to remove it from my chairs the first time, but the second time I couldn't get it all off so now you see white text on my chairs. I tried covering the text on the booster with clear packing tape, which worked pretty well until my toddler discovered it and kept ripping it off. Now it sits in our garage. What a waste.
