Beware ordering. I ordered seat and the bar at bottom was way too long and would not fit on my table.plus it was very poor quality.  I had to get one with shorter bar. When I sent this one back and they charged me 12.00 to return it. I am a Prime member and suppose to have free returnes, They are a Rip  Off  I will never buy from them again. I purchasedx theInglesina - Fast Table Chair With Dining Tray  from Amazon andx it is ten times the seat as this one.  I love it and it is very good quality..
