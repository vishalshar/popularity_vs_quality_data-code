I bought this because it had great reviews on every website and because it's completely washable. But - it did not work on my table. My table has a 3 1/2" long skirt that is 1 1/2" from the edge of the table. The skirt is 1/2" thick. We tried really hard to get it to fit on the table because it is a great seat, very durable and sturdy - and when we almost had it squeezed on, my husband pointed out that there was no room for her legs - the chair was only about an inch from the skirt. I wish they would be more detailed in their specifications so that you would know if it fit your table before you bought it. Makes sense to me, now I'm out of the $8 to ship it back.
