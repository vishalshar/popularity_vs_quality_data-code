These fit great in the Dekor pail, wash well, hold all the moisture in and do their jobs as they should (I wash with my diaper laundry and hang dry, as recommended on the label).  My only complaint is the drawstring.  I had this hanging in my bathroom while I was figuring out how to rearrange my diaper pails (I originally used my Dekor for disposable diapers/trash but after buying these pail liners, I purchased a second trash can  - the new one for disposables, and then converted my Dekor from a disposable trash can into my cloth diaper pail).  After washing both bags, the drawstrings do not close.  It takes a CONSIDERABLE amount of effort and struggling to tighten the drawstring - it seems that the rope is sticking to the PUL which is inside the channel where the drawstring sits.  Obviously this was one large piece of PUL lined material that was folded over and sewn  - the pul sticks to the drawstring and makes it nearly impossible to tie shut.  I discovered this AFTER washing - this did not happen before I washed the bags.  So that's slightly irritating and I don't know how to fix it or if anyone else has this issue - that's the reason for the 3 stars, otherwise, I would have given 5.
