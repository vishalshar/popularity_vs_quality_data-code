I don't have much to say except read the reviews before purchasing this stroller! It is a good stroller for walks but the wheels shake and rattle. I bought the Graco Trekko for peaceful walks with my daughter and the whole walk is listening to a bunch of racket coming from the plastic wheels shaking. Defiantly not a good quality purchase. Other than the shaking and rattling it would be great, but it's not great with all the noise.
