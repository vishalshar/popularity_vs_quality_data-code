My husband and I registered for this seat when I was pregnant because it looked to us to be the most comfortable baby seat in the store. It has warm fabric and vibrates and plays music which we assumed would allow our baby to snuggle right in and be happy. We were delighted when we received it at our shower, but very disappointed in the months to comes. First of all, our baby was almost 8 pounds at birth, but was still much too small. His head bent too far forward until he was about 4 weeks. At that point, he would sleep in it when tired and needed soothing. I would say that from 4 weeks-10 weeks was the best time to use it. Once our son reached 10 weeks and became interested in being entertained, forget it. He cried and got bored very easily and he outgrew it VERY QUICKLY! It seems that as soon as he was big enough to fit, he was too big! We were hoping to get a few more months of use out of it and hoped to use it once he started cereal as a feeding chair. I do NOT feel it is worth the money. I love Fisher Price products and I believe that there are better seats out there for the money. Or invest in the swing that goes with this set. That is comfy AND entertaining for small and big babies!
