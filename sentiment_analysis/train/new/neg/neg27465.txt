I was so excited when I found out that Dr. Brown's was coming out with these. I too was worried about chemicals leaching into the milk from plastic bottles. I got them, and not only are they 7 oz. (why 7? strange size, too small) but the lettering on the outside of the bottles has already started coming off. I love that Dr. Brown's bottles help with my baby's gas, but I was much happier with the performance of the plastic bottles.
