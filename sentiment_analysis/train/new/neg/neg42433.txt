I would have given this a 5 star rating before but it's just no good.  My son had gotten one a few years ago and we LOVED it.  After several years that one has yellowed and the bottom piece that charges, and holds the lights broke out (very sharp plastic).  My son refused to throw it away, but asked Santa for a new one.  So Santa delivered.  It only worked a couple of times before it just stopped working.  The base says it's charging, & then that it's fully charged, but when you try to turn it on, it won't go on.  When you place it back down on the base, the light indicates that it's charging again.  But even on the base, it won't turn on.  We had gotten the dragon one for my baby last year, and his did the same thing.  I noticed that between our older version of our elephant has a different style charging base.  I would have thought that the new style would definitely do better at charging the lights as the contacts on the base are solid.  But if they changed the base, what did they change in the creature?  I'm extremely disappointed that we (myself & my family as the dragon was a gift from my Mom) put out so much money for two defective lights.
