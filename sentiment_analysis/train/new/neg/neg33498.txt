The mobile is attractive and the pauses in rotation are nice. However, the remote control only ever worked to change the music or turn off the mobile once it was already going! We really wanted to use it to START the mobile from the doorway. Also the white noise was so much quieter than the other settings so we has to manually change the volume if we wanted to switch from lullaby to white noise etc. Overall I am not impressed.
