I spent a good amount of time reviewing the many side by side strollers on the market. With two boys, Sam six months and Jason two years of age. The Maclaren offered all the features that I wanted in a stroller. Full recline with leg extensions for my little one and a nice wide seat for my big guy so he's not cramped up in there like a sardine. The individual sun canopy's with an additional sun visor offers good sun protection. I especially like how easy the stroller is to push. Those extra large wheels make it effortless to turn and the Maclaren rolled over those nasty crack's that you find in most neighborhood sidewalks with ease. You don't need a degree in engineering to break this stroller down. It's fast and simple. After searching the internet for the best price. I found travelingtikes.com to have the Maclaren stroller including free shipping at $332.49 NO TAX and two free head and body pillows to boot. I placed my order online and chose the Insignia Dapple color which arrived just a short time later in nice big box. It came pretty much assembled except for the canopy which took a few seconds to clip on. The Maclaren stroller also included a weather shield and matching foot muffs for those windy cold days to keep my little ones as snug as a bug. Im one happy camper!
