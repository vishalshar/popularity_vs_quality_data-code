We ordered two butterflies and they are exactly what we expected.  Our daughters have enjoyed using them for nap time at day-care; they're soft and colorful, fun and unique.Unfortunately they do not survive trips in the washing machine.  The stitching comes apart and the stuffing comes out, resulting in a mess.  We have been forced to repair them a number of times.
