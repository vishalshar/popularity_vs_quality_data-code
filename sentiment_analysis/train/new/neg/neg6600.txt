I really love my Thirsties covers. They do a great job with our prefolds and hold in a vast majority of.... Yeah, they do their job. ðŸ˜‰ My complaint with these is the Velcro latching. It's great because it's so easy to put them back on and take off but it's at the sacrifice of leg space. My little guy's thighs have a hard time with the angle at which they attach to the front making the leg hole too tight. And when he was at the end of the size 1 the Velcro was rubbing his thighs red; I was able to get a longer use out of the snap covers as they didn't have that issue.
