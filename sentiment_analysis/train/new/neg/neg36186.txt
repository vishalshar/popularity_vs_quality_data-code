we like the shape, because it cannot go further into the baby than it should. But its very hard to make t read F, it always goes back to celsius and doesnt switch easily you have to try several times while you baby might pee or start to cry! also after a few uses it doesnt read accurately, I noticed that after taking the tampereature a few times in a row, they were all different and not just decimals, but by 1 or 2 whole degrees !!
