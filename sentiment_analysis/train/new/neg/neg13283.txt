I use 115lbs dumbbells (each) for shrugs for 15-20 reps. I start with that to let you know I'm no slouch in the traps department, and have been accused by my jujitsu buddies of having no neck. I'm also in the Army with tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, so I am familiar with carrying heavy loads longer distances than the average person. The problem with this device is that no weight is transferred to the hips, in contrast to modern army load bearing equipment or the outstanding ergo carrier (which I realize is for smaller kids). As a result after about 25min, this starts to feel like my 75lbs Vmax weighted vest. Fine during a grueling workout, but not fine at minute 25min of a Disneyland family vacation with my 42lbs daughter on my back! I tried it with my 35lbs daughter, but much rather would have had her in the trusty ergo carrier.I applaud the dads who designed this and hope they can incorporate a hip strap to distribute the weight. There are many pros, easy kid loading, folds up really compactly in the included backpack, the parade view, and really high quality. My daughters loved the ride. The feet in the butt or hamstrings slows down the gait, but seems unavoidable.This could be used as part of a physical conditioning program, or for walks less than 30min. For anything else, this just doesn't work. I returned mine when we got back from Disneyland.
