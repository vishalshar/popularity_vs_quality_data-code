This is a neat photo clock, targeted for kids who wake up too early. I would assume that most kids who need this kind of clock are sensitive to their sleep environment and a dimmer for the light emitted from the screen would be an obvious feature...but alas, it is not. I am very disappointed but cannot return it per amazon's policy. Otherwise, it is user friendly in setting alarms (both silent photo alarms and auditory alarms) and loading pictures to use. It is a helpful daytime clock as well. We have not used the music feature much. I hope zazoo can add a dimmer in future models-would definitely earn a higher rating for me at that time.
