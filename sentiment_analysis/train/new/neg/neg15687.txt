When they say "light leaks" they aren't kidding.  These don't work well AT ALL and can assure you the 5 star ratings you are seeing are because the company adds a little slip of paper in the product saying they will send you a free pair if you give them a good review on Amazon or Babies R Us websites.  I would not recommend these at all.  I leak a decent amount but these didn't even hold up an hour before I felt cold and wet in my bra.
