This inexpensive tote protected my Britax carseat well during recent flights my son. However, before purchasing, you should know a few things that make it less than ideal. I would recommend this item to parents who fly infrequently and don't want to buy the Gogo Babyz Travelmate because of its cost.1) If your carseat is huge and clunky, the tote won't change that. The tote is simply a bag to protect the carseat. My husband wore our carseat inside the tote as a backpack and it was so huge that when he turned around a few times, he almost hit people standing near-by. The handles are okay, but imagine they are the same height as your seat so the tote isn't very ergonomic to pull because the handles are lower than a typical carry-on suitcase. Also, I tried pulling the tote and found myself pulling the side without wheels and I caused a tear.2) Security takes more time. We gate checked our seat which meant we had to bring it with us through security. We also had our stroller (no extra cost), carry-on bags and our diaper bag (also free with lap child). Security made us take our carseat out of the tote and because our Britax is so huge, this took some extra time to take it out and put it back in before our flights. It would have been too hard without my husband there to help with all the bags and deal with the carseat.3) The material is flimsy. After one trip, we already have a tear at the bottom and won't use it for our next trip unless duck-tape will "fix" it.While at the airport, I saw a mom with the Gogo Babyz Travelmate and she told me that she loved it so much. She was traveling alone and seemed to be doing alright. I don't fly very often so being a little annoyed with our big tote was inconvenient, but doable and not worth $70.
