I am on my third child and he has a toddler sibling who is not much older than him.  I hated that he wasn't able to get as much floor time as his siblings because I had to worry about him inadvertantly getting hurt by his toddler sibling.  I've had a pack n play for all 3 kids, but the older two spent very little time in there.  I always found them to be pretty constraining in terms of room for them to move around and room for toys.  There are plenty of crib toys, but not a whole lot of toys that are specifically for the pack n play.  That's why I had such high hopes for this toy, but these hopes were dashed and Fisher Price just didn't deliver on this one.PROS:-Placement:  It's a toy specifically for the pack n play and it clips along the edge of the pack n play.CONS:-Very little activity in this activity mat:  The other plastic pieces just dangle. The only piece which plays music or has any interaction with child is the penguin, which is placed at the tope of the mat.  My child is 6 months and he already sits up.  He's off the charts for height and he still can't reach the penguin.  He definitely can't reach the beads.  Perhaps it will be better when he can stand, but I doubt it.  When they stand, it will be below them.  I think Fisher Price didn't think through the placement/layout of this toy and missed an opportunity to deliver a functional toy.BOTTOM LINE: It's still one of the few products on the market specifically for the pack-n-play so it's not a total waste.  I also bought the crab pack-n-play toy and this one is definitely better.  I just wish that the Fisher Price or some other toy manufacturer would adopt the kicking chimes or other crib toy for the pack n play.
