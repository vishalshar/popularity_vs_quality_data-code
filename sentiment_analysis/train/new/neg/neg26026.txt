So I purchased these inserts to go up against my Kangacare 6R Bamboo Soaker Inserts.  When my son wakes up in the morning, his diapers are super wet, and our current setup is a Kangacare 6R soaker with a contoured newborn microfiber insert to wick away the pee pee.  This set of the bamboo soaker plus microfiber newborn insert is the way Kangacare sells the combo on their site for $16.00.I had heard from another cloth-diapering mama that these BabyKicks Joey-Bunz are the bee's knees, so I ordered them to try.  I washed them 15 times (over the course of a month, washing with each load of diapers every 48 hours) to make sure to remove whatever evil spirits are in the fabric that must be removed to absorb properly.  After a solid month of washing, I was ready to get super nerdy and do some experimenting:I filled two bowls with 420 grams of water.  I put the Bamboo 6R in one bowl and the Joey-Bunz in another.  I allowed them to absorb water for about a minute, then I removed each from the water.  I allowed them each to drip any excess water for one minute, then I weighed the soakers:The Bamboo 6R now weighed 327 grams.  Subtracting what the soaker weighs when dry (88 grams), it absorbed 239 grams of water.  So the 6R absorbed 2.72 times its weight in water.  If you disregard the weight of the soaker, it absorbed 77% of the 420 grams of water I had it soak in.The Joey Bunz now weighed 262 grams.  Subtracting what the soaker weighs when dry (58 grams), it absorbed 204 grams of water. So the Joey Bunz absorbed 3.52 times its weight in water.  If you disregard the weight of the soaker, it absorbed 62% of the 420 grams of water I had it soak in.So it's counterintuitive: the Joey Bunz absorbs more "gram for gram" but the 6R absorbs more water overall.  So, for me, the Kangacare 6R Bamboo soaker insert is the winner since it can keep baby dry longer, even if it does weigh 30 grams more when it is dry.I hope this has helped you!  Don't make fun of math geeks- we can be helpful!
