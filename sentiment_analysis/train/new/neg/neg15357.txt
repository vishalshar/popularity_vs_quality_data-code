Item was shipped from China. It took one month to arrive. I was not aware that it would take that long when I ordered this "Jeep" stroller net so I ordered the Jolly brand which arrived with prime shipping. I was going to use this Jeep net as backup when it arrived. The item did not come with the black pouch. It came unwrapped in a shipping bag. Which made me wonder what types of exposer it has had. After comparing it to the Jolly brand I would not recommend this product for your child. The holes on the net are much bigger than Jollys net. The fabric is rough compared to Jollys. It is large enough to wrap around a stroller or crib, but I would use it for something else... like a wall net to hold toys. The presentation made me feel like I had rather not ordered it. 2 stars because it works for something else.
