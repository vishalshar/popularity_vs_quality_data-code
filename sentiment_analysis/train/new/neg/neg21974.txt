Bought these after numerous recommendations from other parents and our pediatrician. Supposed to work well for babies with acid reflux and those prone to spit ups, as our baby was. Worked well, and the ease of clean up was nice, but we found the inability of measuring out water for formula directly into the bottle a real annoyance. Could be messy on occasion as well. Also found myself worried over running out of inserts, which would be a disaster in the middle of the night with no other bottles on hand.
