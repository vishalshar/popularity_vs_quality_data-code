There were 3 screen protectors in the pack. I went through all 3 trying to be super careful not to get any dust on the screen. Each time there were little particles of dust which created bubbles. I've installed a number of screen protectors on other phones without this sort of issue - so it isn't like I was being sloppy or didn't know what I was doing.
