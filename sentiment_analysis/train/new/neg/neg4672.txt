I like the fact that it is easily attachable to the side of the cot and that it is sturdy but I wish there is an easier way to change the batteries on the remote.  The screw is not easy to remove. I damaged the soft plastic while doing so.. also the mobile is really heavy so if not assembled properly, any pieces that fall off might kill the baby. The speakers are not working well so the songs have some electronic static disturbances which is quite jarring to hear.  Maybe it is damaged during the shipping process. But projection is good and so are the stuffed animals. They are so cute.
