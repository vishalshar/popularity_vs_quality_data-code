I'll start out by saying I love alva baby diapers! They're a great choice if you want to start out using cloth diapers without paying a ton of money. The majority of my diaper stash is the regular alva baby dipaers which work great. The color snap diaper did not work as good for our chunky legged girl and was more prone to leaking than the others. Our daughter is a year and a half and she's quickly out growing this diaper where as the other alva baby diapers seem to be just fine. The double gusset I couldn't see made a huge difference and seemed to be harder to scrap the poo out of the diaper when it was a messy one. I've heard some people love this diaper but it just did not work out for us!
