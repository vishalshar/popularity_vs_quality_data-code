We bought this seven months ago.  The mobile no longer turns and i wrote to the manufacturer for help.  we were completely ignored.  for two hundred dollars... you would think they would make good on their product.  i bought tiny love products for my now eight year old (back when he was a baby) and had good experiences, so i thought it was a safe bet although it was expensive.  But after some research, i find that apparently the quality of not just this product, but other Tiny Love products has gone way down-hill in the last few years. i guess this is why the manufacturer/seller of this product did not respond or try to help in any way. sad... i really thought it would be a great mobile. Highly suggest you pick another mobile  and brand for that matter.
