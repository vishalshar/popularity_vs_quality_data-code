I bought this for $23.50, thank goodness I didn't spend a penny more! I hate this monitor. After using it for a few months, I went back to using my 8-year old trusty ol' Fisher Price old-school analog model.Pros:-Inexpensive (when I bought it)-Two-way walkie talkie feature is useful for older kids-Two parent monitorsCons:-Horrible reception (cuts out, notice this mostly when baby is crying loudly), one of the parent units randomly turns itself off-Connection drops frequently, even though monitors are placed quite close to the base. Often turn the parent unit off & back on to discover that the kid is actually awake, even though there was no indication that the unit wasn't receiving a signal.-Incessant beeping & clicking. Picture this: Middle of the night. Parents already suffering from lack of sleep. Units start beeping for no apparent reason. Daddy starts swearing. Mommy rushes to quiet the now-awakened baby. Not good.-Volume setting is way too quiet. Thank goodness my son isn't a fussy baby, there have been many times where I'll walk past his room and hear him awake, even though I couldn't hear a thing through the monitor.-Range is terrible in my house (split level) - can't take parent units downstairs or into the garage, neither of which are very far from the child unit. Not useful at all.Don't. Just, don't.
