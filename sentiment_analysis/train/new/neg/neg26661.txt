This battery is listed as an 1100mAh NiCD battery, which is what my monitor takes. This is not what I received. After reading that others had received an 1800mAH battery instead, I still decided to purchase it since the listing clearly states 1100. WRONG. I was nervous to even put the battery in my monitor after reading one person's review that it fried their monitor screen. I ended up trying it after reading all the good reviews and it does work well. BUT, the item is still listed incorrectly so I only give it 3 stars. I would think the seller would fix this with so many comments already. I did not notice my monitor working any better/differently than with the 1100mAh batter it came with.
