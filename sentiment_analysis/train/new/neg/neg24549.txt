I got this as a gift when I was eight months pregnant! I was so excited, so I put it together. It worked great! My daughter was born two weeks ago; I put her in it, and the vibrator was broken already! It wasn't even used once except when I turned it on to make sure it worked! This is a beautiful bouncer for any  little girl. The swaddle blanket is a great addition to this purchase! But I'm really dissapointed that I have to return it already!
