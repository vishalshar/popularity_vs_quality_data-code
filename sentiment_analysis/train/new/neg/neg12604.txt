The pacifier pouch is cute.  I was expecting more from the wet bag.  I was disappointed it was a drawstring closure.  I do not recall reading anywhere that it was and all my dealing with wet bags have been zippered.  I wish it mentioned as I probably would not have purchased.  The fabric seems very light to me as well, I have some concern about putting wet diapers in it.  I will be honest and say I probably won't try to either.  I plan to use it to hold dirty clothes should my child need to be changed while out.
