Good while it lasted, but developed an unwashable funk after about a month. Overwhelming nasty mold smell that wouldn't go away. I'd call it a quirk but it's starting to happen to our second smock, so I think they just aren't that washable. Not buying this brand again (we love other BB stuff- but never getting this product from them again). Also: overpriced.
