Worked well for first 2 months. Then, started to alarm in the middle of the night, which scared my husband and I. Thought our son was not breathing..well it was a malfunction because it would alarm while we were holding him in our arms. I sent back because of the defect, and the company did testing for 14 days. They said there was no malfunction, and would send me back the SnuzaGo. I asked for a refund or a replacement, but had no luck. They do not test on real babies, just some kind of simulated motion to mimic a baby. I refuse to put this unit back on my baby, as it is defective. Anyone in the company would not use it as well, I am sure.  It is not reliable, and wakes both my baby and us up at least once a night. It worked well for 2 months, but totally not worth $89.99 for 2 months. Terrible customer service.
