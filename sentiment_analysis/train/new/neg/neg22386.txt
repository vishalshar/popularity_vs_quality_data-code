This stroller is ideal for quick errands or grocery shopping. I would not use it to go on walks or to do any adventures activity. If it weren't for the fact that I threw away the box that it came in, this item would have been returned by now. These are the reasons why I feel unsatisfied with my purchase:1. The canopy is nowhere near big enough to cover the sun and wind from hitting my son's face. The canopy does not serve any purpose.2. When you fold up the canopy, the canopy hugs your hands while pushing the stroller. This is an annoyance especially during hot days because it causes your hands to get hot. Again, the canopy serves no purpose.3. The stroller has a very big ventilator that has no cover to it. This would be a great feature if I lived in a place where it had summer weather all year round. The cold air will easily hit your infant/child from the back of the seat. This may cause your child from getting a cold. This is something that Mountain buggy could have easily fixed by adding a ventilator cover.4. The storage area at the bottom of the stroller is too small and compact. I can hardly fit my diaper bag in it and in other to place the diaper bag in the storage basket I must push it hard in there or else it will not go in.5. I have used this stroller twice and it is evident that the wheels won't last long. The wheels wear off too quickly. If you want to use this stroller to go on walks I would advice you not to because the tiny rocks on the sidewalk will stick on and damage the wheels.6. Mountain buggy could have used better quality material. The fabric is not very soft for infants.This stroller has so much potential. The only perks to this stroller is how compact it folds and how lightweight it is. Other than those two reasons, this is an ordinary stroller.
