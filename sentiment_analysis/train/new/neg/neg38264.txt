We replaced an old set of wall decals with these for our new baby girl.  After a single day, a number of these were just falling off the wall and never really adhered well (several bubbles, two clownfish, shark, the submarine, etc.).  We have continually pushed them back down on the wall, but the same issue continually reoccurs.  Since these are around our baby's crib and changing table, it is a huge safety issue as pieces that fall off the wall will become choking hazards.I like the style and color of these, but the safety concerns make this product an unacceptable risk for those with young children.
