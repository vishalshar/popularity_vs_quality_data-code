Bought this item to take on a trip to Disney with a large group and wanted to keep my very active toddler close. This is literally a strap that goes around the childs wrist with a loop on the other end. It is essentially a dog leash, although I probably could have gotten a better quality item in a pet store. Plus, it hurt my son's wrist when I put it on-very bothersome and he pulled it off in 30 seconds. I did not even use this.Total waste of my money...don't bother with this item. I am sure there are more functional tether's out there.
