We bought this thinking that it would be better for our preemie than a typical baby bath but it is cumbersome and our child (who is now 3 months old) still doesn't sit comfortably in it. You can try to maneuver it a bit but unless you want to keep messing with positioning, it's not that great in a standard double-sided kitchen sink. It does keep their backsides warm but it also floats if your baby isn't all that heavy, even when the whole thing is wet.It makes a pretty good knee rest when you're bathing them in the tub, though.
