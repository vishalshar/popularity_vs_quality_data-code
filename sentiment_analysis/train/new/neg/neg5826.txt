I love the design of this pacifier clip, it is so cute in person but it broke right after I received it in the mail.  My 14 month old was wearing it and I looked down and the pacifier was gone and the plastic was broken.  I contacted Haba and they replaced it immediately with another one of their pacifier chains and I have had no problems at all with the new one.  I am giving the product three stars because Haba's customer service is so amazing!
