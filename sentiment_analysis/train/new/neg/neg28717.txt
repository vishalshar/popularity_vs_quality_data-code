Read all the wonderful reviews so went ahead and bought a tube. Got to try it today on the entire family during a trip to Legoland. It was a bright sunny day so we made sure to apply the sunblock very generously every hour and a half. By the end of the day, we had already finished most of the tube. We loved that it went on smoothly, had a nice natural fragrance, and wasn't sticky. So, why the one star? Because we all got burned!!! What little amount we have left is going in the trash. I'm very hesitant to try this product again. Loved everything about it, except that it didn't keep us from getting burned. Why is this when we did our due diligence and applied large amounts of product at frequent intervals? Not sure, but very dissappointed to say the least.
