Pay attention to the sizes! "Frustration-Free" packaging only goes up to 35" while "Standard" goes up to 40.5". It doesn't make much sense to me that a packaging preference would change the size of the product, but it apparently does. It is an okay gate for the most part. Ours is currently pressure mounted only, but we will be changing that soon. We've noticed that If you tighten the sides too much, it doesn't close properly. If you leave them too loose, an older kid can easily move the entire gate when shutting it too hard or leaning on it. We've had to re-adjust it multiple times. It is OK for the money but I think next time we'll invest in a better one.
