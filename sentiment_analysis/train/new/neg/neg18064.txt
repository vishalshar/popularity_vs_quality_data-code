I found the latch system very convenient, but the seat was too short.  The seat stopped mid thigh so my 5 year old's legs were not comfortable.  Her legs fell awkward, if that makes sense to you readers.  Since we frequently make road trips, I wanted her to have a comfortable seat.  I loved the color, the fabric, and didn't even mind the armrests were just plastic.  This seat was generously padded, which is probably the most I've seen.  I wished this seat worked out, but it fell short.  Bummer.
