I love the Munchkin brand and the plates are what they should be. Disappointed in the complete difference in colors not just shades. The pic shows pink blue and purple - however what came was orange and yellow - I didn't expect it to be that different in colors, I really wanted the pinks and purples. Timing was great and arrived as stated.
