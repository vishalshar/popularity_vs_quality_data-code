The Velcro on this cover is not strong enough to withstand my one year old's grasp, or even, sometimes, his rolling around and general movement. So, although I like the color of the cover, its sizing flexibility, and its snug fit (when secured), I have found this diaper cover and its corresponding insert down my boy's pant leg too many times to use it regularly or to rate it well.
