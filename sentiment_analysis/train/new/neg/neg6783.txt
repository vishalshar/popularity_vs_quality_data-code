I accept that these don't work well with my Baby Jogger but that is something that I have to accept as these are just wonderfully warm for my infant and 2 year old.  I have two of the Urban BundleMe's which are spectacular and have stood up to lots but thought that I would get the Polar to grow with my 2+ year old in the double stroller.  However, put this in for a wash as per the instructions.  Two zippers came off and it is now unusable.  Going back.  Not expected for a $120 item.  Will chalk this up as an anomaly, so only 3 stars and will get a replacement, but if it happens again, the rating is going down.
