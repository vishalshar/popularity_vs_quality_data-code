I'm short and leaning over the tub was hard for me.  The stool on this not only saves my knees but gives me better access to my little guy. It's also wide enough that I don't have to worry about losing my balance trying to stay on something small.Part I don't like is the arm rest.  It's a great idea but very unsturdy.  My son likes to grab onto it and tries to stand and lean on it.  With only two suction cups that stick on the outside of the tub it comes off very easily.  And even when the suction cups don't release the arm rest still moves around and can be lifted.I'd say this is a bad product for anyone with an older child because of the arm rest.  It's an accident waiting to happen for a more mobile little one.
