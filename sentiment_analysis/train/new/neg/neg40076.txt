I ended up returning this.  I have Crohns Disease and so I will buy pretty much anything that will make going to the bathroom easier (highly recommend bidets for everyone - life changing).  However, after trying this out, I didn't find that it made much of a difference to me.  My husband found it uncomfortable.  I think it's a great product, but just not for us.  The quality itself is great.
