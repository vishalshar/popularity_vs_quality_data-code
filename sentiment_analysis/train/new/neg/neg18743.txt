We've gone through half a dozen of these locks over the last couple of years.  They are the sturdiest fridge locks I could find, short of bolting a padlock set up to the fridge.  But they do have one major flaw.  The lock holds by a tiny little plastic lip on the latch, and that little lip isn't a molded piece of the latch, but glued on.  Well.  One good pull from an adult guest who can't figure out why the fridge won't open, or the determined day after day yanks of a little toddler, and eventually that little lip breaks off, and there goes the whole set up.  Very frustrating, but a single latch will last a few months, and is still the best I can find for this class fridge lock.Remember to wash the fridge edge well and clean with alcohol before you apply the latch.  Then it stays stuck.  Never had the glue come off.
