There's definitely some good points here: Because of its retractable nature, there's very few concerns about where this gate fits, and it's completely out of the way when it's not in use, which is great.  That's actually my favorite feature, as the other gates are often in the way even when we haven't latched them.  I didn't find it troublesome to install, as some have implied, although that was a while back, so perhaps I'm forgetting some of it.The gate itself is reasonably robust, but clearly not up to the same standards as, say, a metal gate. Over the two plus years we've had ours installed, the most-frequently used gate has shown some signs of fraying near the latch, and the internal spring has finally stopped working, so that it no longer self-retracts, rendering it near-useless. That said, it has done the job well for the period we had it, and two plus years is enough for a single child's use of gates, just don't expect that you'll necessarily be able to use it for three kids or whatever.It's very very noisy when retracting, and the retracting occurs even when latching the gate, which can mean you wake your barely-sleeping children. You can retract it near-silently if you hold the switch in a particular position, but that requires some practice and can make it difficult to properly latch the gate one-handed.  It's not a terribly easy gate to open or close, which is a pain, but also means your child won't figure it out -- my son can open the rest of the gates in the house now, but doesn't have a clue how to operate this gate.I don't regret buying it, but it a simpler gate meets your needs, I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to recommend this either.
