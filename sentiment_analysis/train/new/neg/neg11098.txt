Slightly disappointed. First, the picture shows teal, but the one that arrived was blue. Not a big deal but it would have been nice to know I was getting another color than shown.  Second, I thought the material (plastic) would be softer than it is. I have another teether by Fisher Price made of the same material (apple-shaped), and it really isn't a huge hit with babies.  We'll have to see how this one works out though. Hopefully it'll be a different story.  The rattle is nice; not too loud.
