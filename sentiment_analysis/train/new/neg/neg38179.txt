This is a great little divided bowl for babies who are just starting solids.  I think the bigger side holds roughly 3-4oz and the smaller side holds roughly 2-3oz (depending on if you fill it to the brim).  Once the lid is snapped on it doesn't leak (I filled both sides with water, snapped the lid on, then shook it like an animal and it never leaked) so it's great for the diaper bag.  I can't say I really cared for the spoon though.  I used the Boon Swap 2 Count 2 in 1 Feeding Spoon, Green/Purple and prefer those.BUT I think the biggest caveat to this bowl is the size.  Though it does fit perfectly in my hand, I wish it was a little bigger because it really doesn't hold enough food and so I was only able to use it for about a month.
