I wanted to love these flanges so much, but after using them for 3 weeks I have a mixed review.Pros:-comfortable due to the suction that mimics a natural latch-less nipple pain-completely empties the breast well-package comes with all sizes to try-good customer service that truly sticks to their 100% money back guaranteeCons:-caused blocked ducts. For the 3 weeks I used them I had 3 blockages to work out, which jeaopodized my milk supply at times.-the manufacturer claims a universal fit for all pump brands but they did not fit my Medela Pump in Style Advanced pump well. There would always be milk leaking out of the front and back of the connectors.-Because of the fit, the vacuum was not as strong as it should be, causing me to increase the speed on the pump beyond what was comfortable so my breasts ached afterwards.-yes, they helped completely empty the breast, but I had to pump for an hour to do so! An hour! Who has that kind of time and patience? Maybe this is due to the design or the problems with the fit but that is way longer than recommended per pumping session. I can get the same results in half the time, and on a slower speed, with my original Medela flanges.I am exclusively pumping and produce alot of milk so my nipples are often sore from pumping 6x/day. In the end, I will say that these flanges are a good option to have when you're very sore but still need to pump because they don't stress the nipple further, but I wouldn't use them all the time. It is a no risk purchase with the money back guarantee so I would give them a shot, just don't get rid of your originals.
