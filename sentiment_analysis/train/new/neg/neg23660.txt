It was really easy to assemble. It's a cute product and matches any pink or princess theme nursery.I dont have any experience with other mobiles so for all I know all the music boxes sound the same but this one isn't totally clear. I spent under $20 for it so small quirk can absolutely be overlooked.  It only plays for about 7 minutes. (Once again, I'm not sure how long any other mobile plays) I am satisfied and happy with this product.
