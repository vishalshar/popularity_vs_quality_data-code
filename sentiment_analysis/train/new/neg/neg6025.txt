As I was shopping I was unsure which mattress to get for our Pack N Play (Nimble Nook model). I started with the square corner (model 25-GR) as it looked like our base had square edges. However, when insert into the pack and play the square corners squished into a rounded shape so I returned that and looked for rounded corner version.  I couldn't tell the difference between this version (26-GR) and another one on Amazon (25C-GR) so I went with this one because at the time it was a few dollars cheaper.  Reading the description now I see that this one is "high density foam for extra firmness".I have read articles that recommend using the high density foam when possible for a crib mattress, for safety reasons. I also just noticed that the description for this product says "creates a comfortable environment to play and sleep" while 25C-GR says "create a comfortable environment to play" and "This product is not recommended to be used for sleeping".In my opinion this is VERY firm.  At 6 months I ended up ordering a mattress pad ("American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Pack N Play Playard Size Fitted Mattress Cover") to make it more comfortable. We also use the American Baby company sheets. Sheets alone make for a crinkly sounding mattress, but once we added the pad it really helped with the noise.
