Although this bag looks pretty nice, DO NOT order it unless you are 100% sure! It is impossible to get a hold of the company to make a return and Amazon does not help at all. We decided to return the bag because although it may be cute, half of the bag is white. Unless you plan on constantly spot washing it (that is the only way this difficult fabric can be cleaned) then your bag will look dirty all the time. The company has horrible customer service and I highly recommend going elsewhere!!
