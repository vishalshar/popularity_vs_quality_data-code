I liked the idea of being able to give my baby a taste of foods he could not yet eat without many teeth. While the idea is good and helps keep baby from potentially choking on pieces of food. These things are a pain to clean. We tried several different foods in these and they all made a huge mess and left food stuck to the mesh. I wound up throwing these out.  Save your money for better baby items.
