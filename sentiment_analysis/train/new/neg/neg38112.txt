Just got it and returning it immediately. The assembly is extremely insecure. The spring pins in the middle are very low and could therefore not secure, resulting in the bed rail frame pulling apart in the middle. As a toddler safety product that is completely unacceptable. Secondly, it was shipped without a shipping box. A big sticker with my address was just stuck on the product box which really took a beating in the shipping process. If this was a gift it would have been completely unpresentable with the condition of the box and the huge irremovable address sticker. There was also no packaging inside the box to protect the parts from getting damaged. All in all, bad presentation and a disappointing "safety" product.
