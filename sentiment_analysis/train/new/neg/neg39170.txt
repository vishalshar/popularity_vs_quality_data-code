We've already been in an accident with this product, less than a month after we bought it.  Our 1-year-old was unharmed.  It has a lot of great safety features but some major drawbacks.  It does not come with clear installation instructions.  It is pretty much impossible to install it at the angle it requires for rear-facing, and the angle only makes sense for a newborn anyway.  It takes up a LOT of space rear-facing, even in our minivan.  It is difficult to put her into the seat without bonking her head, and the side air bags make her unhappy because she can't see anyone around her, and it also makes it difficult to tend to her when necessary.  I would recommend this for once you plan to forward face, which we will do (in a replacement seat of course) as soon as our skinny girl meets the weight requirements, because I feel she is well-protected in there.  But as a rear-facing, not really a big fan.
