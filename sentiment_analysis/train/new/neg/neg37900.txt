Great concept but terrible execution.  The mats frame does not hold the product up - the whale's tail collapses onto our little one when she lays on it.  Its obvious this product was cheaply made with poor support rods, we put it together exactly as instructed but if we put more than one toy on the tail the whole thing collapses.
