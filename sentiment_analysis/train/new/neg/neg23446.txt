These bags are terrible.  They leak, tear, break open, if you freeze them for long-term milk storage, they DEFINITELY self-destruct so that when your husband or daycare worker is defrosting it, they end up losing all the milk in the bag because it has magically become porous while frozen.  More than once I have lost all the milk I pumped because the crappy bag just committed what must have been bag suicide because it was not bumped or jostled, it just flung itself off the counter, spilling 5 ounces of breast milk EV ER Y WHERE.  Their only saving grace is .... what.... pumping directly into them?!? Fantastic.  Meanwhile, every stupid box of 20 comes with two plastic pump-to-bag adapters so now I have, like, 10 extra of these things just hanging around the house fulfilling NO purpose.  (Maybe I can make a medela collage when I'm done breast feeding... I need something to vent my rage at these bags.)  I feel like for the RIDICULOUS price, they could possibly throw a little into some R&D and make a better bag.  I dunno, call Lansinoh and ask them how they make their bags because those bags are AWESOME.
