I got this for my taller-than-average 2 year old son.  He was outgrowing his baby hooded towels, but we still really liked the idea of a hood for him.  This towel is about the same thickness as a beach towel, not a traditional bath towel.  It also goes down to just below his bottom, but doesn't even begin to keep his legs covered.  It's ok for what it is, but it's not our favorite.
