I have only had this set for 4 months and it has come apart!  The ties on the bedding have all ripped off and the butterfly on the quilt is coming off after only having been washed once.  The padding in the bumpers is not stiff enough to stay up and is always slouching down.  My previous bedding lasted through 3 boys and this hasn't even lasted 4 months.  I am very dissappointed.  Spend the extra money and get something that will last.
