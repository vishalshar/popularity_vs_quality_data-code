I purchased these because my 10month old was chewing on her crib. When i purchased them theimage of the crib in the picture looked almost identical to ours however, it wasn't and they did not fit. The build quality and looked to be nice if they fit your crib rails and the Velcro is super strong. I have returned them and will be ordering the larger XL version.
