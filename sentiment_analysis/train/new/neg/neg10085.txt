I was hoping to create an awesome piece to remember my pregnancy but this turned out horrible. I threw it away. It took forever to dry and when ot finally dried it was still flimsy and  I used all of the casting material. More of the casting materal would have need nice, if didnt cover my very large belly. It also quickly lost its shape. Being pregnant and sitting forever waiting for this to dry was miserable. I would never do this again. Shipping was quick but the product did not meet my expectations.
