The case I received is flat out not the same case that's pictured. The pictures all clearly show beveled edges all around the case, the case I was sent is completely rounded, no edges whatsoever. I bought the case SPECIFICALLY for this look so I don't appreciate being sent something that's not even close to being the same. The pictures also show a matte black finish and what I was sent is extremely glossy. I feel duped as the pictures on the Amazon page are clearly renders and not the actual product, I'll be returning for a full refund.
