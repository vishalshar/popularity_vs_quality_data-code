This is okay.  It serves it purpose but my son didn't like being in it much.  I think he was kind of hot but I do live in Arizona.  It was also difficult to get my son in & out of without my husbands help.  If your baby likes being in this I think it is as good as a Baby Bjorn but I won't be using this for my future kids.
