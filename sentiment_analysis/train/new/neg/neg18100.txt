I could never get this to work. I looked at the instructions and visited the website multiple times. It seemed to be pulling my baby's legs too far apart. I must have been doing something wrong, but it just didn't work for us. I used it a couple times, but it was also a hassle to get on and off. Very difficult if you didn't have someone to help you.
