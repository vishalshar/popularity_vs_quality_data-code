I received this item today. It is really cute, but I was surprised to find that each tiny little dot is an individual sticker!  Seriously??  It is going to take a very long time to put this item up, if I even bother.  I can't draw a straight line with a ruler much less make a straight line out of hundreds of individual dots!  It's just not my thing.  (I know I should pencil a line on the wall then add the stickers one by one for a few hours, but it's not likely I would ever spend that kind of time) This item is super cute, but it would be much more efficient (for me) if the "string" came in one long row vs. individual dots.  My husband is still laughing at me.  Likely, the ornaments will be incorporated with other decorations and we'll scrap the rest.  We have a six month old so we are doing all wall art to avoid small pieces of decor. I purchased the stuff that I thought would make my home look the most fun and festive for the holidays.  This one is kind of a bummer ....
