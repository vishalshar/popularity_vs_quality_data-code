Didn't really end up using these. Seemed to take too long to get on, and maybe my prefolds were too narrow, but it seemed like it was hard to get these stretched to the sides without feeling like my little one's tummy was being smooshed. She was around 4 months when I tried these, and around the 40th percentile, so its not like I was working with a giant baby or anything. They worked ok if you could get them on. I ended up using thirsties covers, so I didn't end up needing to use these.
