Happy enough with the product that we purchased a second, but its not without its flaws.  The cons may sway othersPros:~ Doesn't slide around on leather seats.  Holds the car seat well which is important for safety~ Fairly easy to clean, has protected our seats from a few accidents~ Sturdy construction~ Easy access to LATCH pointsCons:~ Obstructed access to seat belt buckles~ Unforgiving to different height headrests.  Fits great in the CRV but its to tall for the Silverado seats, creates a bow in the back~ In both we have received the front flap has been hardened flipped up.  Seems to be because of how they box the product, it takes some heat, time, and molding to get it to fit the contour of your seat.  Doesn't matter if you are rear facing but would be annoying for a front facing child.
