I weigh my son every morning on this scale and while it does do the job there are two problems that frustrate me.1 - The on button has to be pressed really hard. This doesn't seem like a big deal unless you have just placed a screaming child on the scale and realize you have to pull them off and press the button again and put them back down (just leaving him there would tare the scale).2 - The display is hard to read in dim light. I weigh my son at his first feeding when he isn't really awake and I don't want to turn on bright lights, I have a single lamp in the room. The display is also tucked up under the tray so that you have to get closer to be able to see or you are blocked by the tray.These complaints don't diminish the effectiveness of the scale, it still gives accurate weights (I use it to track how much he has eaten), and I am not planning to return it. But if given the choice I would try out a different scale.
