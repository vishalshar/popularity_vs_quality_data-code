I purchased this camera both for a 'lazy install' front door security camera and as well general-purpose around the house monitoring. Compared to commercial security cameras and hi-end baby monitors this was reasonably priced (<$200). Since the camera is wireless installation is convenient, as long as you've got a plug for the AC adaptor. Its plastic and somewhat flimsy, so is better suited as a counter-top baby monitor than a security camera (unless you can install in a dry, secure location). The remote video receiver is convenient (about the size of a video iPod), but consumes a lot of battery power, which means you'll either require the AC adapter for on-going video monitoring (in reach of an AC wall socket) or use the batteries only for periodic monitoring. The picture quality is "ok" -- I was expecting better overall picture quality considering today's technology and a 2.4GHz signal -- and I corraborate other reviews here that unless you're only a few feet away expect a lot of picture static -- which is annoying. The camera has a built-in microphone, but the static is so bad it rendors the audio useless (another dissappointment -- and likely a show-stopper as a baby monitor if you can't get a clean signal).But the 10 infrared LEDs provide a reasonably good night-time picture (actually, the picture quality is much the same, from bright sun-light to pitch black). So overall the camera has been useful. Fun note: Had a Gambell's Quail nest in a bush outside so I placed the camera right by the nest (yes, w/a rain cover) to monitor mom on her eggs -- have learned a lot about how Quails tend to their eggs. This was an unexpected, pretty cool use for this camera.
