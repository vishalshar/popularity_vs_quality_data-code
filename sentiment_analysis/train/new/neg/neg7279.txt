I bought these as a cheaper alternative to the aiden + anais (not that they're that much cheaper but i like the option of being able to buy 2 instead of 4). I wouldn't buy these again. They are not as soft or stretchy as the aiden + anais and they're not a true square so when you fold them into a triangle to swaddle you cant get your sides to line up no matter how hard you try.One thing i will say - they are better than those flannel swaddling blankets. If you've never used aiden + anais you'll probably think these are great but i wouldn't recommend them to anybody who's used the real deal.
