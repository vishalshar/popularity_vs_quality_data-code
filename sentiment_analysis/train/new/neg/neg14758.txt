You'll regret buying this. At first my husband and I were really impressed with the quality and convenience of this set. However, now that my son is three months old and we've got some use out of it, we have two big issues with the car seat and I honestly regret buying it. Firstly, the handle is a PAIN to bring down. It's ridiculous. We have to fight with it each time we put our baby in and out of the car (it's not safe to drive with it up) and having it stick and not go down easily is enough alone for me to regret buying this set. It's that annoying. Also, because we're fighting with it each time, I can feel it getting progressively looser when I carry my baby in it.Secondly, our baby gets VERY hot in this seat. With the cooler blasting on him he still overheats, which causes him to cry and hate going anywhere in the car. He hates the seat, and honestly, the material and cushioning isn't comfortable. Without fail each time we get him out of the seat his back is wet with sweat. Additionally, the head support is ineffective and we had to get creative with a rolled blanket instead. There is an insert that pushed his head too far forward when he was newborn, and when he got bigger we put it back in and it caused his head to bounce around whenever the car made a slight turn. I hated checking on him in the back and seeing him asleep with his head having been pushed all the way forward and him sleeping like that (we check that the seat was at the correct incline). The stroller is awesome and we will probably just end up using this set for outdoor walks/runs, but buy another car seat altogether.
