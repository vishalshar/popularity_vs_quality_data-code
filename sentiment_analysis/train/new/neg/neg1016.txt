I ordered these because I thought that these were the old Avent Airflex/Avent Classic Nipples. These nipples are the newly released AVENT CLASSIC + NIPPLES. Purchased a few months before I gave birth. I noticed that the milk was overflowing beside my son's mouth during feeding.The nipples for newborn are not slow at all. In fact if you try to pinch the nipple, it looks like a hose! No wonder the milk would just spill in his mouth like crazy! Not to mention all the choking and terrible spit up!
