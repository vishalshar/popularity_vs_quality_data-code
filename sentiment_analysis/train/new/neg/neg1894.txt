I bought this mainly for the nail clippers with the magnifying glass.  The clippers and the thermometer are the only components I've used so far.  The thermometer doesn't really work.  I've tried to take my daughters temp with it, but it takes so long to get a reading that I've given up and bought one that does it in seconds.  I like that the nasal aspirator has a removable bottom to make for easy cleaning.
