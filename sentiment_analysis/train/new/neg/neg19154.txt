Okay so this is actually the second one of these I bought. First I bought the one called "Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up" here on Amazon and we loved it so much I went and got this one for another potty in our house. Big mistake- I definitely should've stuck with the first one link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AV5LZ8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_titleVS:This one- all plastic and you have to put EVERY piece together... it "screws" together with an included tool and you can never quite line it up right or get it tight enough. The entire thing is plastic and uncomfortable- no cushie seat and no grips on the feet.Mommy's Helper: A few simple snaps and you are good to go- it is already mostly assembled. The seat has a cushion so it is more comfortable for them to sit there (important when they sit there for what seems like hours when they potty train)and it has nice grips on the feet.This one keeps coming "unscrewed" and literally falling apart when my daughter climbs up it- once she hit her face off of the toilet because of it. Please PLEASE save yourself the trouble and the money. The other is the SAME Price and a MUCH better quality.
