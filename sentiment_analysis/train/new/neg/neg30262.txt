These were presented as "must-haves" in the cloth diaper world, so we stocked up on these while preparing for the birth of our little one. Our daughter is now 14 months, and we've been exclusively cloth diapering since she was 2 months old. In these last 12 months, I can literally count on one hand how many times I used these. With a plastic cover and a good fold, I don't use any reinforcement (pins or Snappis) and don't think they're necessary. I think these are fine, but not essential as they were presented.
