Could not get this car seat to fit backwards without being unsafe.  I had a Camry and a 4Runner, and in both vehicles, we ended up turning it around to be forward-facing sooner than we should have, because it was actually safer.  Rear-facing wasn't sturdy, and on a sharp turn, the entire seat would flip to the side, even after my husband put all his might into getting it tight. The carseat needs some kind of bolster to sit it up when facing backwards - it sloped downward so the baby's head would fall forward.Purchased after it got good reviews from Consumer Reports, but I'm not sure why.  Cheap, bare bones, little padding, no frills, but effective for forward-facing child.  I WOULD NOT get this for an infant or rear-facing child.  We ended up replacing, and this is our backup seat for family now that our son can safely sit forward-facing.
