We received this as a gift when our first baby was 6 weeks.  It worked like a charm with soothing him or putting him to sleep.  Our second child does not like this swing. I've owned this swing for almost 2 years.Stuff I don't like:- Relining the seat takes practice. (There are 2 large buttons that need to be pushed in, on either side of the seat, at the same time. Meanwhile you also manipulate the seat into pos 1 or pos 2)- The mobile doesn't do anything.- The tray's base that is attached to the seat (Newborn's legs do not sit comfortably.  It's unnatural to put them in the seat and then separate their snug legs to fit around the base)Stuff I do like:- Seat cover is easy to remove and wash- Mobile moves out of the way (Great with an over stimulated baby)- The tray is an extra security (Knowing they are secure and safe you can fall back asleep at night)- Music stops after 15 min or so (By that time the baby is asleep anyway. At night, I would not want it going non-stop. During the day, I can turn it back on)- The fabric is gender neutralStuff you should know:It says there are 16 songs.  You have the choice of these 8 songs that play continuously or another set of 8 songs that play continuously. There are 2 volume choices. Low or High.
