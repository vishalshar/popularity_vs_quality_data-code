We have owned 3 Graco swings. We love them because both kids seemed so comfortable in them and they had room to grow. On all 3 occasions the motors burnt out after just 3 months. Neither kids were even close to the weight limit (one was 14lbs the other 9lbs). This swing also made a weird squeaking sound that we could not get rid of. Very very disappointed in the product. Off to buy a fisher price swing and hope for better luck!!!
