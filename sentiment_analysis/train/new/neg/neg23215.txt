I really wanted to like this product and gave it many tries before giving up.  The suction simply does not work reliably.  At times it has remained suctioned throughout my one year old's entire meal.  More often it fails to stay in place and I need to re-attach it multiple times throughout her meal.  I have tried slightly moistening the table and at times it slightly improves the suction, but overall it fails more than it succeeds.  Also it's worth noting that my daughter is not pulling on the plate or attempting to move it when it fails to suction.  It simply loses suction on it's own or from being slightly bumped while she is eating.  Since the reviews are so mixed, perhaps the product isn't produced with consistent quality and some buyers receive plates with faulty suction mechanisms.
