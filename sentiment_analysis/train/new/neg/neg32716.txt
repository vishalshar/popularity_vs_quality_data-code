Got this for our 4 month LO.. I did get the sophie before and thought it would be good to have few variation. But ultimately this one didnt work. It is too soft for him and he doesnt like this. Sophie is much harder and he likes that much better. Especially at this stage where he is having a lot of irritation and urge to bite, harder rubber would help. For some reason didnt work out for us!
