Got them when I was pregnant with my first baby. Read all the reviews and wanted to order 20 of them! Glad I didn't... We use them as burp rags :P They do not stay closed with snappis or boingos. You need actual pins for these to use them as diapers. When I use them trifolded in a cover they dont stay put. They are great as an insert in a pocket diaper though. They hold a TON of liquid without feeling soaked.
