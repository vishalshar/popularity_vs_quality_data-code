We bought this as well as the tommee tippee to try out sippee cups.  My baby has been drinking from bottles exclusively for the past 3 months.  She could not get anything out of the tommee tippee one but had no problem getting the liquid out of the munchkin cup.  This cup does leak if tipped over and flows pretty fast.  The first time we gave it to her with water, more water ended up all over her clothes than in her mouth.  I think once she gets used to this shape nipple we may see if she can figure out the tommee tippee one so we don't have to clean up the mess!
