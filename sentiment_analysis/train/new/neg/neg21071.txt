I ordered these to label my child's bottles. I also ordered a more expensive inch bug labels. These have just been ok. A few reasons. The ball point mark gets dull after a few washes. Writing using simple ball point before sending the container off to school, is not the easiest. I have to experiment with different pens before i get a few to work. However, this has also been a nice feature at the same time. Yes; the writing is difficult but at the same time the freedom to remove anything by rubbing makes up for that, I guess. Plus these are less expensive than inch bug labels. I won't say these are very good but serve their purpose well. Could have been better, though. I like the color choices they offer.
