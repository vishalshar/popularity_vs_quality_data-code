Very comfy and acts as a head support in the carseat as other reviewers mentioned, and super cute.  However the one downside is that for a newborn the bear heads are so large that they prevent her from being able to touch her own mouth to comfort herself while she is waking or trying to sleep during a drive.  I often feel bad for her that these get in the way of her trying to reach her own mouth.  BUT they DO keep her head up and cushion the seat belt straps from rubbing her neck and chest.
