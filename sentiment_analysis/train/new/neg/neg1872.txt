Very cute, but it was not completely as described! The tail did NOT have a drawstring, which made it difficult taking pictures! Also, it was NOT pink, it was red....cute if you want red! The size was perfect for my 15lb. 4 month old, but wouldn't recommend for a newborn...at least not a small one like mine was (5lb.)!!
