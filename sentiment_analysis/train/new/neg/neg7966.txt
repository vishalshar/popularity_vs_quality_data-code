Great idea/design, bad construction. We loved this product while it was working properly and were extremely disappointed that it broke on our FIRST trip (the first leg of our SE Asian tour). One of the locks on the wheels broke, which meant that we couldn't use it for the rest of the trip. When we tried, the wheel kept turning in, so that we were basically dragging the car seat. Also, when we stored it in the overhead compartment, the wheel stood up. By the by, we did not use this for anything, but the car seat. We did not have our child sitting on it when in use. So I don't understand why it broke.  We have another trip in two weeks and will have to buy something else.UPDATE: I contacted BRICA about the broken transporter and they shipped me another one that very day (to Seoul!). I must say that their customer service is amazing. We have another international trip and we will use the replacement they sent us. We will see if the replacement lasts any longer than the original.
