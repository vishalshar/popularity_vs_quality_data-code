I do really like this diaper fastener. It works well and is easy to use. The only reason I marked it down is because there isn't enough space around the teeth to grab and I've managed to draw blood 3 times while putting a diaper on my baby. Thankfully, it was my blood, but if it should slip, it would really do some damage to a baby. I'll use occasionally caution, but I'll stick with my Snappi for sure.
