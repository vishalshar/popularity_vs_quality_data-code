Not my favorite high chair.  I bought this for my grandson when visiting. It is a very awkward design and shallow seat. We took the upper part of seat off, which is great for older babies, but the padding has nowhere to connect with so it just hangs. I could go on with a list of things, but suffice it to say. It OK but if to choose again I would find a different brand.
