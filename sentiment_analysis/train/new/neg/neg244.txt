I bought this in hopes of using it with the Prince Lionheart organizer I have on my changing table.  It doesn't fit which is okay because it would have been to small for daily use.  I feel like it's too big to throw in the diaper bag where it would take up valuable space.  It's also a little impractical for outings as it needs to be plugged in.  It comes with an adapter for the car, but when I'm out with the little one I won't be waiting around in the car for the wipes to warm if I need to change him.  I think you can skip this.
