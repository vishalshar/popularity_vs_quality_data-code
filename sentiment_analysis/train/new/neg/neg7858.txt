I like that the clip is plastic with a "rubbery" feel to the edges. I use it on Soothie brand pacifiers and some others that are made of one molded piece of silicone with a hole in it. My baby is 6 months old and very active and doesn't seem to pull it off when it's clipped to his carseat or clothes. I usually clip it behind him where he can't get a hold of the fabric to pull and pop his pacifier out of his mouth, which usually causes a meltdown.
