I ordered this bucket because I wanted something small and minimalist. I'm planning to use cloth diapers, and planning to do laundry very frequently, so I don't need a fancy diaper pail system. This nappy bucket is somewhat larger and flimsier than what I expected. I could have sworn that I looked at the product measurements and compared them to the measurements of the shelf on my changing table before purchasing. I also remember one commenter saying that the bucket came much smaller than expected, and would only hold a few diapers at a time--which was what I wanted. But the bucket is definitely too big to fit on my shelf, and would hold about a dozen diapers at a time.The lid is supposed to latch, but the latching mechanism is very minimal, very ineffective. If someone accidentally knocked the bucket over, the lid could come off even when latched. My husband was not impressed with this purchase at all. He said we might as well re-use an empty bucket of cat litter to store dirty diapers until laundry time. There's nothing really special about this bucket, in his opinion.At this point in my pregnancy I'm too fat and swollen to be picky, so I'm planning to keep the bucket. But I'm open to alternatives, for sure.
