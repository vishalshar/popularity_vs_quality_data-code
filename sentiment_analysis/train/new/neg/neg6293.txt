This ships from the UK and takes forever. Also so small it's unusable. Used to long tethers for the Bob or Phil&Teds joggers. This is barely a few inches long. Might work for steep hills, but awkward for jogging as little/no freedom of movement. You basically cannot let go of your stroller at all and have to detach to tie a shoe, etc.
