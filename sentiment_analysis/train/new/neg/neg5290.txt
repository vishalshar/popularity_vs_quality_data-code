This is OK overall - the one I received doesn't look quite as smooth and polished as the one in the picture.  It looks like it was a rush job.  The teether key with the hole in the end got stuck in my baby's mouth as she was chewing on it - the bulbous end caught on her two little bottom teeth and against the roof of her mouth and she screamed and I had to help her get it unstuck by twisting it sideways to get it out.  Scary!
