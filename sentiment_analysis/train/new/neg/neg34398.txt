I bought this for my 5 year old daughter after my full size Moby arrived.  She really wanted one too. It goes on just like mine, so my daughter cannot put it on herself.  That in itself is a product use limit. It takes a bit of time to get on her, and Fairly quickly she wants it off again. It would get more use if she could do it herself.The product itself is very well made and very cute. It will likely last through several children.
