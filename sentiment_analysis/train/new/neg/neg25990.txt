I gave these bags 3 stars only because the do hold breastmilk which is what they are supposed to do but they aren't user friendly at all. Will not purchase these bags again and will stick to my parents choice bags or lansinoh bags which work well. I freeze most of my pumped milk and use it in rotation. As a working mom, I freeze milk for the babysitter during the day. I have pumped and frozen approximately 1800 oz. of breastmilk for my son so quality performance and price play a major factor in my opinion of these bags.Cons:very hard to transfer milk from bottle to bagstiff closure makes the bag hard to open and hold open with one handdo not lay very flat to freezelabeling area is to large causing milk to run down the sides and get on your hands when reopeningmaterial is thin, crinkly and seems like it will be easily ruptured (haven't had one actually tear yet)tear off top isn't perforated so you end up tearing more or less than what you shouldopening is much smaller compared to parents choice and lansinoh making it hard to pour milk intonearly impossible to get all air out when trying to freezeprice vs. quality just isn't therePros:measurements seem accuratedesigns are prettytruly are stand alone bags whereas others just don't stand alone without falling over
