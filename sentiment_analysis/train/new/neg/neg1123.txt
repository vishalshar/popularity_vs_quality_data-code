This blocks are wonderful and perfect for our little one!  The only downside to this was that it did NOT come with the reusable bag.  I even requested an exchange and wrote my concern about the bag.  Amazon was amazing and immediately sent me a replacement product, free of charge... but even the second set of blocks did not come with a bag.
