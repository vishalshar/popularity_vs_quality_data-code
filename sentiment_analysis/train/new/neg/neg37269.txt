I purchased this seat for my son who just turned 2.  He is very big for his age (35 pounds), however, he is not mature enough for a booster seat.  I liked that this was safety rated for up to 65 pounds, as I know my son will need to be buckled in for a long time yet.  Anyhow, the seat is way heavy, which I liked.  It looked and felt very safe.  I installed it into my very small car and it fit okay.  I raised the head-rest as high as it would go (since at the highest setting a child should be able to use until the top of their ears are at the top of the head-rest) and at that setting the head rest was about 2 inches from my roof.  Not a huge problem since I am planning on buying a roomier car this fall.  The seat was very easy to install and adjust.  The crotch strap was too short and too close and my son was pretty much sitting on top of it.  I had a friend of mine try it with her son who is a year older than mine (my son cannot talk and has a high tolerance for pain) and he said that it hurts his wee wee to sit in it.  I sold it on ebay and bought the Marathon instead.  I really liked the side impact protection.  That was the reason I had purchased this instead of the Marathon to begin with.  The seat sits up high, so my son really liked that.  He did not have a problem with the wings blocking his view.  Anyhow, I believe this seat would be great for an infant, however, it is not very comfortable for toddlers.
