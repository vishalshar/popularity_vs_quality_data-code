These are definitely fast flow - were a little too fast for my 9 month old.  We are going back to the medium flow for now even though it's very slow, and will try again when he's older.The reason for 3 stars is that these nipples are bigger than the medium flow.  This means that the caps that come with your bottles are too small for these and will bend the nipple when locked on and make the lid pop off easily.  I use my NUK bottles for formula, and we couldn't properly mix the formula with the fast flow nipples without spilling everywhere.
