The cup holders will only hold a bottle that's about as big around as a 12 ounce water bottle. I know you're not supposed to put hot drinks in the cup holder, but most of the reusable water bottles are pretty large. The cup holders are also right where I like to hold on to push the stroller. It's okay as this is pretty much the only option for our stroller.
