The concept is great! Too bad the product doesnt work! I was so sure this was the perfect product for my baby and I...that I immediately gave my husband the fisher price monkey one I had. It may not have had frills, but at least it lived up to its function! This one always sounds like its on its last breath, even with new batteries! The remote has never worked! TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!
