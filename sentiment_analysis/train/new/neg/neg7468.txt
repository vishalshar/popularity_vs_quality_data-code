When I purchased this, it was sold by E-Retail Shops.  My breast pump was performing poorly so I tried the new adapter caps once, for about two minutes, to see if they would help.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the solution.  E-Retail Shops would only take the product back if it was in the original package, unopened and they charge a 15% restocking fee!  Keep an eye out for them when you are buying on Amazon.
