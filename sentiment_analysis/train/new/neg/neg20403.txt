If I could put a zero I would. Bought this product and emailed the company because they only list 6 formula options for the insert. On my baby brezza if you email the company with your formula brand they tell you which insert. This company sends you to a website where you have to buy a scale and measure it yourself to find out which insert. Annoyance number one. After doing so the two provided inserts didn't work. I ordered a pink insert and that didn't work either. So waste of $60. I can't tell if a blue insert is even smaller as they don't tell you. This product sucks. I should've just bought another brezza for my babies daycare. Do not buy unless you use one of the six formulas they actually took the time to test.
