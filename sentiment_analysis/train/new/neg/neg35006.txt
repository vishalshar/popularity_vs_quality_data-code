I like the idea, the colors and shapes are fun.  The pieces that I can use work well and look adorable.  When trying to use the set to link toys, you run into problems.  My set came with 4 circle pieces that are open links.  The remaining 8 pieces are solid.  To make a link to hang a toy on I must use an open link hooked to a closed link hooked to another open link that I can hook to the toy.  If I am using two sets of pieces (2 open and 1 closed) on say a carseat and a stroller, I am then left with 6 closed plastic pieces that can't link to anything else.  I can't add them to the other hooks to make the chain longer because the closed pieces can't hook to anything on the other end.  I can use one or two for my kiddo to hold, but to use them as links I would have to buy another product to supplement the set.  I would only recommend buying this if you are okay with only using half the pieces you pay for.  Also, I didn't receive any of the swirl pieces at all in my set.
