I bought this diaper bag for my husband to use and it is now our primary diaper bag.The good:  The material that the bag is made of is heavy duty and is made to last for a long time.  It doesn't look like at typical diaper bag.  The shoulder strap is cushioned.  I like how there are stroller straps.The bad:  The wipes are supposed to be easy to access however, the only thing holding the wipes container is velcro and not an actual pocket so if the wipes packet is not full, it slips and slides out making it not so accessible anymore.  I stopped using that function of the bag.  The bag has large velcro which is very loud to open and close.  Bc the material is heavy duty, it makes the bag heavy and stiff making it difficult to shove more things into it.  TThe neutral:  The clasps are nice, but unecessary b/c the velcro seems to do a good job of keeping the bag closed.he stroller straps are made out of cloth ribbon, it hasn't broken on me yet but I don't see why they didn't make this out of sturdier material.
