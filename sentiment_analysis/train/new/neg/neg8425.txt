We purchased our turtle as a soothing way to help distract our little guys back to sleep without turning on the ceiling fan (their other favorite distraction), and it worked GREAT! ...but then after about two months of use the lights began to dim and within a week they were barely on at all.  We changed the batteries, cleaned the contacts, pressed all the buttons... to no avail.  If you roll the boringness knob you would occasionally see the lights flicker, but that was it.  It hasn't been dropped or rough-housed, in fact it hasn't ever left the bedside table where it lives.  What a shame to see such an expensive item fail so quickly, especially when it isn't directly used by the child.We have contacted Cloud B and hopefully they will be able replace our defective unit.UPDATE: After a few days, I was contacted by customer support at Cloud B.  Directly underneath the email note where I explained that I changed the batteries twice they recommended that I try changing the batteries... sheesh!  Their alternative was that if I was not satisfied with those results (and I was not - it was still not working) then I could send it to them AT MY EXPENSE and that they would look at it and replace it if they found it to be defective.  Nearly a MONTH later we received a new unit... no note of apology, no offer to pay for shipping their defective unit, nada.  The new unit is much brighter than the previous one, which leads me to believe that Cloud B quality control was lacking when our first unit went out the door.  Hopefully this unit lasts more than a couple of months.In the end, there are a number of companies who make similar products and who care about your satisfaction and want your business much more than the folks at Cloud B... This will be our last product from this company.
