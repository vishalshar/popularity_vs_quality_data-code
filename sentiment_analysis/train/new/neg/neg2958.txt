This changing pad worked perfect for our IKEA changing table.  The raised three sides and firm pad were comfortable for our baby and a piece of mind for us as parents.  We bought two; however, I was really angry and surprised when I found out it was treated with flame retardants.  I immediately removed them from the changing tables. Unfortunately, it is too late to return them to amazon.  Wish I would have checked earlier.Every parent should watch the movie " Toxic Hot Seat" and then do more research on the chemicals that are used in baby products...it's unnecessary and puts our babies at risk!
