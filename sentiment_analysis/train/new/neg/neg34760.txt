My children (2 & 4 years old) fit comfortably in this stroller and enjoy riding in it. Storage is good (two cup holders and covered compartment for small items).  Storage under seats is good but the opening to get into them is not (very tight squeeze).The major downside is that the front wheel shakes severely when you go any faster than walking speed (as many others have stated).  I have found the only way to stop it is to lock the wheel at all times which totally defeats the purpose of having the convenience of a freely-rotating front wheel.Overall, it's good enough for trips to the zoo, mall, park and serves it's purpose - to keep both children contained and comfortable.
