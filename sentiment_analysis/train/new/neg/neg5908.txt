I have tried everything to get comfortable while sleeping (now 36 weeks) and have not found a perfect solution. But, this wedge has come in handy when I just can't deal with my huge full c-shape body pillow and want to kick it out of bed. I have used the wedge for tummy support, between my knees, or behind my back and it's nice to have an alternative small option. However, it does lose it's shape easily despite being quite firm, and has not magically solved any sleeping issues.
