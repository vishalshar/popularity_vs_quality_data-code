We bought this chair about 2 years ago for our first daughter.  Now we have another one on the way so I ordered a 2nd chair for the new baby's room.  I purchased the 2nd chair because I was very impressed with the quality of the first one, especially for the price.  Very well made, durable fabric, all pieces tight fitting, no squeaks or wood creaks.  Fast forward 2-years later.  Just unpacked the 2nd one and assembled it only to be let down.  The fabric is cheap and doesn't look like it will hold up, the wood creaks all over the place.  When you lean back you'd swear the spindles were about to crack off.  The wood parts are thinner than on the previous chair also.  In all I'm pretty unhappy with the build quality.  Not at all what I expected, for the same price I paid for the first one.  I would have given the first chair 5-stars, but this one gets a solid 2.
