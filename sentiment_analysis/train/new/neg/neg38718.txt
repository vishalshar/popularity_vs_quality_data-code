For some odd reason straw cups elicit a love/hate reaction.  This cup is just OK.  It hasn't leaked even if I've found the top a little tricky to thread on correctly.  Like any other straw cup it's not fun to assemble all the pieces but at least it's only 3 pieces (not counting lid).  My only other "crazy parent" concern is because you can't run water freely through the soft part of the straw I question how clean is that part.  Other than that it's been thrown, slammed and tossed without leaking.
