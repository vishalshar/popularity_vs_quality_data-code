I got this carseat to use on our vacation.  We went on a cruise and I knew we would be in shuttles and taxis a lot so I wanted something easy to carry around and safe for my child.  However it was not easy to install at all, so we never used it.  It had so many variations on how to install it with different types of seatbelts that it would have taken forever while we were sitting in the taxi to read the instructions for each one and figure out how to install it correctly. Plus you had to remove the fabric on the front to intall the seatbelt and uninstall it each time.
