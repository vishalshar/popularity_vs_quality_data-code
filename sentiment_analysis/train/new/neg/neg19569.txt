The ornament arrived with two pink ribbons and not a pink and blue like the picture shows. The keepsake ornament box was also dented and torn. I was going to return it but decided to keep it since it is for my daughter, so the two pink ribbons were fine. The ornament is decent sized but a little pricey.
