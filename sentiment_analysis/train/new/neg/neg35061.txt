I bought because I liked the inner PUL layer.  They are a good fit, comfortable for my daughter, and cute, but.  The leg openings are just cotton and the pee wicks out the leg holes and goes down her leg.  Honestly we've had more success with Hanna trainers and they have no pul whatsoever and far less padding.  She is more aware she is peeing more quickly and runs for the potty.  With these, they feel like a diaper, she treats them like a diaper, and mess ensues.
