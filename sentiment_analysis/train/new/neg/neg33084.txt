My daughter loves the music and animals. Unfortunately, the clip that is supposed to keep the strap tight around the bars of her crib doesn't work well at all. We've tried everything. As soon as we tighten it and let go, it loosens the strap about an inch or two. The longer it stays, the more it slips :-( Since we don't want the mobile falling on her in the middle of the night, we're not currently using it. It's such  a cute little mobile, but without a good, tight clip, it's pretty useless...
