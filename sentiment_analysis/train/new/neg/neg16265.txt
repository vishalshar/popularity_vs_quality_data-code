I choose this rating because, even though my twins love this cup, the durability is poor.This is the 5th cup from this brand that I had purchased. Knowing previously that the soft spouts get broken and worn quickly, I purchased extra spouts from another supplier on Amazon.So, not only did I have to replace the spout on this cup within 2 weeks of purchase, but now only 4 weeks after receiving it, a large crack has appeared up the side. I do not wash these cups in a dishwasher and most use is in our carpeted house, so I would not think it was because of the user, and more likely because of lower quality manufacturing.Like I said, expect any of these soft spout sippies to need the spouts replaced if you have a chewer, but I did not think it was appropriate that it cracked up the side of the cup within a month of use.
