I bought this item in February Before my son was born. It's only August and it has started to lag and play music very slowly. I attempted changing the batteries but that wasn't the problem. I should have returned it when I received it because it came with scratches on the front like it had been previously used or badly banged up during shipping. I figured that it worked fine so I wouldn't make a fuss. It's too bad my return window is closed or I would be sending it right back.
