I love aden + anais products, but this changing cover is very thin. I took it out of the wash and there's already a hole.  Definitely not made for durability.  I have the carter's cover with the dots that's cheaper and I've used it for 2 yrs without a hole or a fray.  Don't waste your money on this cover.  It's so thin, that you can see the pattern from the changing pad show through.
