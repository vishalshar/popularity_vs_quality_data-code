Originally, when I purchased this item it was $59.99. The item arrived in a timely manner thought the shipping box was damaged in the corner. The gate was in good shape, though.Pros:-Solid wood-Fairly sturdy designCons:-The foot spacer is a tripping hazard-The wall support bars may damage wall board-The wall supports need to be tightened oftenAlthough I have more cons than pros listed, I would still purchase this item as a pet gate. I do not think it is sturdy enough to be a child proof gate on stairs.
