We searched around online and in stores for a walker for our little 7 month old. It was between this one, the Ferrari walker and a Cosco walker. My husband fell in love with this one because it's Cars, red, advertised that it has a lot of features to keep baby entertained, and is easily collapsible to store under a bed or crib.Well, it was not as advertised. The only musical sound is from the horn and the vroom vroom and racing sounds that it does make scare our little daughter (she's 7 months old). So far we have not figured out how to collapse to store it under her crib. She's long for her age, and her feet have yet to touch the floor in this walker. She's barely on her tip toes, in the low seat position.I would definitely return it if I could, but my husband already threw the box away.
