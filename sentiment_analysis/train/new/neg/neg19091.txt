I needed a pressure mounted gate and although they say this one is, it requires you to use sticky tabs to keep the pressure points in place. Without using them you can't spin the tension mounts tight enough.  Problem is that removing the sticky tabs do more damage than a screw into your wall would. The sticky tab slipped out of my hand and attached in the wrong place. When I peeled it off to move it, it took a big chunk of sheetrock with it That said once the gate is installed, it's nice for my purpose (a pet gate).  Don't think I'd rely on it at top of stairs to keep a child safe though. Door keeps puppy in, but probably not a determined child.
