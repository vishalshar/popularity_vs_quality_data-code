I got the more expensive of these seats because of the extra safety features.  I looked at all the sites I could find to see if they would give me the difference in the material, but found nothing.  I got the giraffe print, which my girls loved.  However, it's a soft, 'grabby' fabric and both my 4 and 7 year-olds complain that each time they slide back into the seat their pants pull down.  It was funny at first (as you can imagine with a 7 year old).  Now it's just annoying; I have to go back and pull up my little one's pants each time she gets into the seat on her own.I still want the better safety features but can't figure out if any of the B510s have a different material from the descriptions.In addition, in my car (a Subaru Forester) the backs of these seats are up rather high.  It's a great safety feature but I am having trouble seeing in the rear view mirror with them.  I wouldn't trade the safety for this, but it's good to keep in mind that the wider, higher head restraints might make it hard to see.I am sending these two back for a less annoying fabric.
