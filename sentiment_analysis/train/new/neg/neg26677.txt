My baby was having a horrible time with teething and a friend of mine swore up and down that amber had helped her kids while they were teething. Being desperate I figured I would give it a try. I have to say I was disappointed in the results. It seems to make no difference if he was wearing the necklace or not. I was really hoping this would help, but it seemed to have no impact.The only reason I gave the product 3 stars instead of 1 is because the amber is definitely real, it just didn't work like I hoped for my little guy.
