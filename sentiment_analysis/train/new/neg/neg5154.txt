This is my third try with my third kit getting a baby hand print... It fades as it dries (the print does not stay in the mold, it goes away like footprints on a beach!) I have no idea why this is happening. I thought it was a defect but it happened again and again with two additional kits. I followed all the instructions and I have used this product twice before with my two older children with no problem at all. Don't know what is different but this is just not working!
