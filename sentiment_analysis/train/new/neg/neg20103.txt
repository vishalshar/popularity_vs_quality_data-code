We were looking forward for our Deluxe Musical Gym to work, as our baby has arrived. While assembling the items, the mat was missing one loop on the right side (it was supposed to be 3, it came with only 2 - photo attached), so I am unable to insert the arch through it, making the whole item unusable, unfortunately.I will avoid Fisher-Price products in the future.
