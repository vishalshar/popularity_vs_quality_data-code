I purchased & received this item in December 2015 & as of March 2016, it is no longer usable (see attached photo).I'm very disappointed that this mattress pad did not last longer than 4 months as I have another one of these (same brand, style, etc.) that I had purchased through a department store online in summer of 2013 & it is still usable to this day (would have purchased through them again but they no longer carry item).This brand, Carter's is known to carry quality items so I'm very unhappy that this occurred with this purchase.I have now cut off the part of the mattress pad that makes it no longer usable & donated the top part of the pad which is in great shape to an animal facility to use as bedding.I would not purchased this item again through Amazon or anyone else.
