I had a cup like this for my first son and I loved it. It was a great first straw cup because it had a spot to squeeze to get the liquid up to baby's mouth to help them learn to use the straw. This cup does not have that ability! I think this is a new version of the same cup but I didn't even take it out of the package when I realized I wouldn't be able to squeeze it (that's the while reason I bought this cup- my second child hadn't used a straw yet and I loved how easy the old cup was to use for teaching that skill). I'm sure it's a fine cup if your kid already knows how to use a straw or if they take to it naturally.(The directions in the product description talk about squeezing it to get liquid up the straw.)Also to note: you don't get too pick your color. I ended up with a pink one for my son. I would have overlooked the color if the cup had been what I had hoped for but it wasn't.
