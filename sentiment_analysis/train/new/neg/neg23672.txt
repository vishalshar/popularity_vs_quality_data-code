This review is not so much for the Tommee Tippee cups, as I'm a supporter of Tommee Tippee, but rather for Best Service Stores which is fulfilled by Amazon. The cups sent are NOT at all like the ones pictured. The cups I received were smaller and had 2 handles on the cup sides. Had I wanted that cup then it might have worked fine. Amazon was great to refund my money quickly and I had to return the cups. It's surprising Amazon hasn't resolved this issue as it appears from the reviews that the cups advertised are not what you'll receive.
