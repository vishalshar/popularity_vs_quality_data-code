The material was soft and comfortable. There was a problem in them fittingadequately/properly on the foam mattress that came with the portacrib.They were not generous enough in size--just curled up the edges of themattress and I ended up not using them for visiting grandchild. Had the mattressbeen of a firmer type they probably would have worked.
