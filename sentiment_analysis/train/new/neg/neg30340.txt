The cover looks nice, well padded, but I can only give it one star because I found that the company is not honest. Before purchasing, I made my research, I called the company to know what materials are used for the cover and the answer I got was the same as in amazon description, it's a cotton/polyester blend. After I got the product I was extremely disappointed: it has a layer of POLYURETHANE coating, which I would never agree to purchase if I knew about it. It feels like plastic and has an unpleasant smell, I'm returning it.
