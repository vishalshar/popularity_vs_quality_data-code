I give my child hot food for lunch at school. I've been using Thermos for 3 years and have 3-4 of them. They keep the food warm, not hot, by the time she eats it, thus the 2 star. I recently noticed the pink one start having black stuff in the bottom of cap you really can't get to. I had to use a SHARP knife to get to it to get rid of it. This morning just out of curiosity I used a toothpick and jammed a small piece of paper towel and I found this disgusting mold! So I used a dull knife and paper towel and kept getting more! How long has my child been eating food with mold??!! Unless you have a high power jet you can't possibly clean the cap properly.
