This is adorable and fun - I run a home child care business and the little ones love this - It's only really needed for such a short time in their development phases, however. So it's probably best to just put the baby on a normal blanket with a regular Boppy or pillow and not waste your money on this ... The pillow is so small that it doesn't actually support the baby in any way - except it provides a nice little tummy time support boost. But like I said - any pillow would do nicely for that short time in their lives.
