I bought two of these for use at my mom's house in another state to prevent me from lugging our regular seats on the plane, etc.  Seemed like such a great idea for short-term, occassional use!  However, in practice, my daughter (4.5yrs and scrapping the top of the weight allowance) found the straps too tight (with no extra to let out) and the shoulder straps too close together, causing irritation to her neck (and she's rather on the skinny side).  My son (2.5yrs and smack in the middle of weight allowance) could wiggle all over the place even when buckled into the center backseat belt - literally lying down on the back seat while buckled!Wish someone would make a similar thing that actually worked!
