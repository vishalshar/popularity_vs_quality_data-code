I've tried a few different nursing pads and I thought I would like these because they were so big....but they are terrible. First, the glue that is on the back of them comes off on your bra and ends up on your breast/nipple. You definitely have to be careful so you get it off before you nurse so you don't risk your baby swallowing it. Second, the pads shift all over the place and I've ended up with a fair share of wet shirts and bras. I wouldn't recommend these.
