This pack n play worked fine for us for awhile (though you do have to do the locking sides JUST RIGHT or they break), but after being in storage the bottom pad definitely began to exhibit the manure/chemical smell another reviewer mentioned. Same experience, the smell is super strong, makes you kind of sick, and transfers to the sheets.  I tried disinfecting it, soaking it, scrubbing it, and unfortunately you can't soak that pad because it gets wet inside and won't dry right. I thought it was my own issue, something from our garage, but when I began cleaning it there is something nasty INSIDE the bottom pad that the smell is coming from, so my guess is that there is something really disturbing in there. I'm not making my baby put her face in there anymore.
