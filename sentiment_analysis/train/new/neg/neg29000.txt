So this is admittedly just our experience - our baby HATED the newborn napper and erupted in screams putting her in there (we immediately took it out).  I also found, like other reviewers, the hanging toys on the napper to be super cheap, easy to fall off and in general, pretty cruddy (but again, she wouldn't go in there, so it's sort of a moot point).  We ended up not using the changing table because if the other one of us is sleeping, we'll let the other sleep while we change her in her room (as our daughter screams 50% of the time when you change her diaper).  Now - the things we like -> She really does seem to sleep pretty well in the bassinet portion of the bed.  I think she just likes flat surfaces.  The shelves help keep some of that baby "clutter" to a minimum - ours are full.  I love the colors of the pack and play, which I realize has zero functional benefit, but it is cute.  I use the music and vibration almost daily when I head into the shower - she seems to like those features.Summary: in hindsight, I wish I would have purchased a "simpler" pack n play with just the bassinet & main body, but we got what we got and had no idea our daughter would hate the newborn napper so much so instantly - hopefully your little one is different!
