I have had this stroller for about 2 weeks now.  My girls love it.  (They are 3 and 1).  I think it is a good stroller but not great.  It is easy to push once going and folds relatively easy.  What I don't like is the turning ability of this stroller.  It is very difficult to turn especially when going slowly or going in/out doorways.  It is OK when you have a bit of momentum.  It really isn't a 'one hand push' stroller - if you are going straight on an even surface not too bad, but anything else and I find you have very little control.I would also hate to push the stroller when loaded to full capacity.  I am lucky that my girls are small - they total less than 50lbs.I do love that it fits through all standard doors (even in Manhattan) and in my small elevator.  I like the storage space even though it has the weird cross bars in the baskets.  I like the position of the cupholders on the handle.  The height of the handle is great even for my 6ft husband.
