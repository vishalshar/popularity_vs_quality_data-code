I took a chance with this crib set and I REALLY wish I hadn't. I received it when I was told I would, but hadn't gotten my crib yet so I waited to wash it. 12 days later, I washed everything and its all FALLING APART!! I was furious! The frogs and the lily pads on the blanket and bumper are kinda like sewn on patches and they're coming off. I immediately got onto Amazon.com to see about returning the product, but this company only offers a 7 day return policy. Again, this was day 12. I emailed the company anyway and asked if they could make an exception. I got a phone call a few hours later and the best they could do was refund me half of the product price. The set had been 66 dollars and I paid about 15 for S&H. So out of $85, I only received $33 back and have a defective product. I am VERY upset and hope no one else buys this.
