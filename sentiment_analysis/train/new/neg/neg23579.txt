My 1st Rosary with Trinket Box -PinkThere is a danger warning on back of the box...This is something for a gift and goes to the parent I would think as a baptism gift. When I saw the warning sign on it, is is embarrassing to give it now.I am not giving it to the baby..I don't think the mother is going to give it to her either, but keep it as a keepsake.
