Update February 20th - both Calma Nipples are in the trash nowUpdating my review to 1 star - as of today I've thrown away both Calma Nipples I bought for our infant.- One started failing regularly - the poor baby would keep sucking without being able to get any milk out. He even got a blister on his lips.- The other one just did not work for him at night (something was wrong too) - he was getting frustrated while eating, would try to spit the nipple out and burst in tears.Nothing of the kind is happening with either plain Medela wide nipples, Avent Natural or Kiinde. Calma "fansy" nipples have turned out to be a compleate waste of money.February 4th - This bottle nipple represents failed hope. :)While I was excited to pay any price to get my baby eat without losing his latching skills (which he had very little to begin with), in the end I am not sure this was the best way to go.I am not producing a lot of milk to begin with. After having to fight for every drop that needs to get into the tiny infant, I see about half an ounce at the bottom of the bottle every time he empties it via Calma attachment. You cans stir or shake the bottle to get the last few drops into the latex end of the nipple - yet, there is always something left. This never happens with Avent bottles (which we also use - only for formula) - Avent brand nipples manage to get all of the liquid into the latex portion and available to the baby, and there is no waste.With all the fuss and muss of buying Calma, assembling Calma, washing parts of Calma every time - I cannot say its worth it. I'm going to try regular plain Medela nipples that go with Medela bottles and see if there is any waste of product after that.I'm sorry, but a product that wastes milk during every feeding is insulting.
