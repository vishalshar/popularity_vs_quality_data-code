this product works as it was designed to work, so no design flaws, but once my toddler threw her drink off her high chair, and it was dangling, she was still unable to retrieve her drink, and I was still having to pick her drink up and hand it to her every time. she would try to reach down and get it but because she's still young (17 months) it would get caught up underneath the high chair and she couldn't get it untangled to retrieve it. maybe once she gets a little older she will be able to figure it out, but probably by then she won't want to throw her drink down every second either. :)
