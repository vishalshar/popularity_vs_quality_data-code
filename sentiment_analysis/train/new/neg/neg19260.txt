First of all - this is NOT a pack of 3.  Don't be misled by the photo of 3 cups like I was.  Also, the Playtex Insulator cup is AWESOME.  We bought one in our local grocery store and LOVE it.  However, this must be an older model of the cup.  The ones in the photo are the newest kind that we bought at our grocery store (for $5.99 by the way, $8+ is ridiculous for one cup).  But that is NOT what they send you.  We received a very cheap version of the insulator cup.  It doesn't even look like the photo with the silver interior, it's blue and it's very cheap plastic.  The connection on the twist part of the cup is totally different than our other one.  This one leaks like crazy, my one year old knocked the cup over and I immediately had 6oz of milk on my carpet, it wasn't even a slow leak and I had it twisted on all the way.  The real version of this cup is amazing - we've gone through 8 sippy cups and the Playtex Insulator is THE CUP!  We LOVE it.  This is not the same thing.  I don't think it's a knock off because it does say Playtex on the cup, but it was different packaging and there are so many obviously different things between the cup we received from this seller and the cup we bought in the store that there is clearly some difference - maybe an older model or something.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.  But I do highly recommend the real version of the Playtex Insulator.
