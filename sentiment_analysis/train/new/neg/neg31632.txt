I was so excited to try these cups because they were cute, did not have a third piece to clean, and seemed higher quality plastic than the ones I had.  But, they are almost impossible to open without hurting your hand.  I guess that means they are spill proof with the spout down.  The other problem is that neither of my kids (2 and 3.5) can get the last bit of milk out, so they are frustrated by the cups and don't want to use them.
