Purchased the mattress relying on previous reviewers mentioning that it perfectly fits DaVinci Kalani crib. However, was disappointed to see ours being too lose, I can easily fit my hand between the mattress and the crib. Hopefully, the gap will be smaller with the pad and sheet on but we'll probably have to return it or see if we can use a towel or blanket to plug in the gap (not ideal).
