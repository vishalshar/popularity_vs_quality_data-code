I normally don't take the time to write reviews, but being a mother-to-be and highly dependent on others for help in creating the best possible nursery I thought you should be warn of the following before purchasing.1. In general, the lamp is very very cute and I love the colors! I also like the fact it comes with one of those energy saving bulbs which is a great bonus.2. I had to ask for a return on the first shipment because the metal part of the lamp shade was bent and thus created a very lopsided effect when placed on the lamp stand. However, Amazon customer service was amazing to say the least. They apologized for the inconvenience and shipped a second lamp with a two-day shipping at no cost and provided me a label to print out so that I could return the defect one. The second lamp shade I received was not bent so problem solved.3. Please know that this lamp in its entirety is not perfect. For example, lamp shade has some small black spots/ marks. This might bother some and it can look a little dirty. However, it's not actually dirty, it's just the way the fabric was created. The second lamp shade I received had less of these small marks than the first and it was towards the back so I choose not to be picky and will keep it.4. Everyone mentions the poor quality of the paint job. Yes, it's not perfect and not cookie cutter. The first lamp I received had better painting job than the second. I did notice up close that one of the animals had like small nail dents in the back. However, the stand is sturdy and doesn't feel flimsy. My advice would be to still order this if you really want it and see in what condition it arrives. This paint issue may or may not be a big deal for you and worst case you can simply return it for a refund.Hope this gives everyone a straight forward review.Happy Shopping!
