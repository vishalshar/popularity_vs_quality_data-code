Even though this is a cheap item, I would have to say don't waste your money on this horrible made item!  The switch is very sensitive and when you just press it, it will turn on and then once its on the only way to turn it off is to take off the battery cover.  It mixes well but makes a mess once it stops turning on and off.  I have to put my bottles deep in my sink and pull it out of the bottles with it still spinning.  The only reason I am still using it is because my daughter is on an 8oz bottle and when you are just shaking the bottle all the powder goes into the nipple and does not mix well. Thankfully, she is almost off formula.  Will definately purchase the more expensive items for the next child!Also, smaller than expected! Does not reach the bottom of bottles.
