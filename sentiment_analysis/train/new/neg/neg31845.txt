For a while I loved this play yard, because it gave baby so much room and it's easy to set up, fold and move. However, I just caught my 10 month old trying to climb out of it AND SUCCEEDING! I was looking in on him every minute or so, luckily, because at some point I looked in and he was at the top! So make sure when you use this play yard to watch baby closely and make sure they aren't able to climb out.Update: I will be contacting the company about this ASAP, as baby being able to climb out would not be a problem if the walls of this product were designed/positioned differently. The walls are made up of oval-shaped holes which are in a diagonal pattern. WRONG DESIGN! If only the holes were patterned VERTICALLY, I believe babies would not be able to get enough toes into a vertically positioned oval hole as to be able to climb out, especially while wearing socks or other foot covering. The way these oval holes are currently patterned, might as well make the walls out of ladders.*Contacted the company, they informed me that I could return this play yard to them in exchange for their other play yard, which has smaller holes. The thing is, shipping this play yard back to the company would cost more than buying it on Amazon, so I am stuck with it. Now I use it to keep baby in the living room and it works fine. Actually, it being kinda flimsy helps to help keep him in, because he doesn't want to climb up something unstable. And I've found that baby can't climb the walls of this play yard with shoes on. So bottom line, it works for some purposes under certain circumstances. Do as much research as you can before investing in this.
