I'm not sure why everyone loves this bottle. You can't see how much to fill it up, you don't know how much your baby has had to drink, and when you clean it, the metal becomes boiling hot.  The way the nipple lets the air out is the only interesting feature. If you want to forgo plastic, go for glass!
