we have to constantly hold his head while washing him or there is a huge drowning risk. It's pretty hard to wash him with only one hand. Plus he's rather tall at 27" and he's just too tall for it already at 4 months. I would not recommend this to anyone. We got it because we wanted something he could grow with but he doesn't sit up yet so we can't use that feature but it's a hassle to use the lay down. I'm on here today buying a different one.
