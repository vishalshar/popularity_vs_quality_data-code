These spoons are kind of a mixed bag. We got them for my daughter when she was about 11 months and they worked fairly well. The best thing about them is that she tended to put the spoon in side-wise or right side up and then twist it. Unlike metal spoons, these did not hurt her.However, the "bowl" of the spoon is quite small and shallow, so you are limited in what your child can use them for - certainly not soup, for example. Also, it takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r to feed you child with this spoon, which is why my wife barely used them. Finally, we like to make purees, freeze them, then microwave and serve. Breaking up the half frozen food to mix it (so that it doesn't overheat) is not really possible with these spoons because they are far too flimsy.
