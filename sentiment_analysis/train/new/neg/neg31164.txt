One of the cribs was damaged. It was impossible to straiten two of the upper ends. As they had to come all que way to South America it is very expensive to send it back to you and get a new one. I had to make a provissional arragement to be able to use it, as I need it now.I protest because you sent me a damaged crib, I can see that you do not take the time to see if what you dispatch is in good condition.Additionally the music box for the crib is also damaged. We gave it batteries, but it does not play the music  Hortensia Galvis
