I purchased the Goodbyn for my son, who's 8.  We try our best to reduce the amount of garbage we create and to recycle as much as possible.  This was the reason for our purchase.  I was excited about eliminating plastic baggies and juice boxes, but the Goodbyn hasn't entirely lived up to my expectations.  The drink container enclosed pops open a little easier than I think it should which leads to a leaky mess.  The bin itself won't keep "wet" foods separated well (like mandarin oranges, for example) which leads to another messy scenario.  Additionally, the sections are really rather large for just lunch food.  I can fit a whole bag of store bought baby carrots into the one bottom square section!  Lastly, the Goodbyn needs washed after use and leaks and the stickers don't hold up well with the washings.  I'm still using it in hopes that we'll get used to the quirks and continue to do a small part to clean up the environment, but overall, it's kind of a hassle.  A few Gladware containers in a lunchbox would have served the same purpose for cheaper.
