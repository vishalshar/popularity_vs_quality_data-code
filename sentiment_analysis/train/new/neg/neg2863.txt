We purchased this to give more room in the passenger seat of our Honda Odyssey. It definitely gave us several more inches of leg room. The problem was my 10 month olds head would still go forward when she fell asleep. She has  great head control, crawling pulling to stand, etc so based on the description I was hoping it would work. Unfortunately on our road trip we had to remove this and had to give up the passenger seat leg room because of her head going forward. Hopefully others have better luck with this than we did.
