I purchased this to place over my bathtub, but I will need to return it, as it is too small for the space. This is a cute chandelier for a tight budget, but you will notice the difference in quality.The pendants are not glass (as stated in the description). They are acrylic, but they shine with rainbows in them a bit more than the average acrylic piece. If you wanted to switch these acrylic pendants out for ones with more quality, it will be a difficult job. The acrylic crystal pendants are threaded together, rather than held with a clasp or crystal bowtie.
