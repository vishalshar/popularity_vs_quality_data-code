We ordered this product and I thought it was fantastic having twins! my biggest problem is that we had not even had it for 30 days and it had broke. The plastic bar that goes thru the storage part on the bottom of one side broke in half. It is just not up to alot of use. We wish it would of been better especially for the price that you pay but it is not!!!!
