I love the style and how perfect it is for a little girl but I didn't give a higher rating because I don't like the toys that come with the playmat. For one, the toys are nowhere near long enough for little hands to reach and play, the toys don't make enough sounds and the center piece of the playmat is a flower that doesn't light up and only plays 3 very short songs.
