I searched for a pad that doesnt have the hole for the middle buckle and thought I found it, but when it arrived it was like all the others I have seen online and has a hole in the middle for the buckle.  Well this allows for the pee to go right thru to the carseat.  I ordered 2, Seller did let me return one and I kept 1 just to try and sure enough, pee goes right thru it every time.  I do not recommend.  I have an old one that looks more like the pic with the pad curved up in front of the buckle and it works great every time so if you can find one like that I recommend that kind.  But again, this picture shows the kind I like but thats not what they send you.....
