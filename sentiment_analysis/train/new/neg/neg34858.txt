My kid treats cups that are meant to minimize spills like a brain teaser: he does not give up until he figures out how to make the biggest mess possible. The amount of fluid allowed out per "tip" is a little more than a mouthful for my toddler, and that is the first way in which he will cause a mess with this cup. The next way is that he will shake the cup very quickly, kind of a rapid reload situation, in order to get as much liquid out of the cup as he can before we notice and take it away from him. I think this cup is awesome, but not the right product for my little Tasmanian devil.
