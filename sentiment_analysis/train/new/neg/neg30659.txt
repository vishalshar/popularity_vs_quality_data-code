Beware if you buy this.  On the one I received, the handpainted Sophie had two fingerprint smudges that seem to not be removable.  The packaging looks cute, but the zipper at the top of it is not properly connected.  On the stuffed Sophie, it looks like the neck will break soon.  Because this is for a time-restricted gift, I can't return it for a replacement.  I'm sorely disappointed in the quality of the product.  I hope the recipient likes it more than I do.  I really shopped for a long time to try to find something that I thought would be just perfect for this adorable baby!
