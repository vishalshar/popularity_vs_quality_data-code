It serves the purpose; the outlet functions well.  There are two main issues.  First, these outlets are slightly smaller than typical outlets with regards to the length and height.  In one room in my house where the walls are the original color, the contractor taped and painted around the "standard" outlets.  Upon installing these "baby safe" outlet covers, I now have an exposed unpainted border.  This isn't a major issue as it is easily remedied.  The reason for taking the time to review this item is the second issue.  Once again, not so much of an issue with the manufacturer but more so with the installation of the existing plugs.  About half of these outlets don't sit flush on my wall.  This is due to the fact that most outlets are perfectly square and level.  Standard outlets usually have a fair amount of wiggle and this allows a standards outlet cover to "mate" and sit flush.  The way that these outlets "mate" to the existing plugs doesn't always allow for nice, flush fit.  I believe this fit issue would occur at almost all homes. Both of these issues could be remedied, but the second one would take a significant amount of time and effort.  I probably wouldn't pay what these cost if I knew the fit was going to be so poor, or at a minimum I would only install these outlets at high use locations...I replaced every outlet in my entire house with them.
