These things are cheap. They work well enough, but you get static fuzz from just about any source of electromagnetic interference. I found that I had to plug the receivers into circuits without ANY other electronics plugged in to avoid problems, and even then I had issues with certain LED bulbs just being in the vicinity!Also, they WILL break. We had two sets, and all four receivers eventually stopped working for one reason or another. Typically the battery compartment is the first to go, and then you have to keep them plugged in for them to work at all. Then, the plug connection stops working unless you tape the thing in position. Finally, the knob goes, and you have to toss it. I think they managed to last 2-3 years, though.That said, they do work, so if you want a cheap baby monitor solution for not much money, this is a good choice.
