We used to be big fans of Chicco products for our son, not any more. This product is OK, we had problems using it to begin with.It wont easily fold and we live in an apartment building. I called the chicco customer service for help, left a message and waited and waited and waited. E-mailed and to my surprise, the so called "customer-service" manager made it look like they had donated this product to me and were done with it. Really i was flabbergasted at her response. I have had same ( though no so extereme) responses from Chicco customer service in the past as well. So folks, be cautioned once you get that product out of the store, dont expect any help or even any response from Chicco if you come across come problems. You are on your own and THEY SIMPLY DON'T CARE.
