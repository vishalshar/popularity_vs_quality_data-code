This bag was great when it arrived. It doesn't look like a nappy bag so good to take to work as well as out and about. Big pockets and lots of them, fits everything. After a year and a half however the outside of the bag (Polyester, Polyurethane - whichever) has started to chip/flake off and looks terrible (see photo). NOT A DURABLE HARD WEARING BAG! Such a shame because size/pockets and everything else was great. If you are wanting a bag that lasts longer than a year this is not the bag for you.
