Would have been nice if somewhere on this website they mentioned that you can't use the sunshade with an infant adapter. Also, the item comes with a front page recall declaration on the user manual stating you need a retro-fit kit and you can order one for free. Really?. And if that's not enough, they say you can't use it above 65F. Really?? Who needs a sunshade when it's below 65F? The BOBs have huge canopies. Also, know that you have to pay the return shipping if you realize any of the above after receiving it. Three strikes you're out!
