We have two different methods for testing the temperature of the bath: this and the thermometer we got from the hospital when baby was born.  The duck is extremely hard to read and only has one reading: HOT.  Even then, its extremely difficult to tell if its actually too hot since the letters are deceptive.  The couple times I used it for actual temperature testing, the bath was waaay too cold (since I couldn't tell if it was registering HOT or not) according to our other hospital-given thermometer.  The only reason I am giving this as many stars as I am is that my daughter LOVES to play with this during bath time.  It is not bath time without the duck in the tub, and it floats (right side up) a lot better than the regular rubber ducky we have.
