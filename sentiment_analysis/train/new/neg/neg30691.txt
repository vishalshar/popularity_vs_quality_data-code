My mom has this chair at her house for my son and his cousins.  It looks nice and I considered it when we needed our own high chair, but I am SO glad I didn't get this one.  While it is an attractive, "old school" looking high chair, it has a very poor design and most children will outgrow it by 18 months.  The padding is very thin and my son constantly bangs his head on the back of it since the chair sits so upright with almost zero recline.  It is horrible to clean and food often gets stuck under the seat and between the rails on the side; the back and underside collect dust very quickly.  My nephew has tried to climb the chair (he is 2 y.o.) and the chair can easily be pulled over with one quick toddler yank; the chair has fallen on him more than once.  I hate that thing.  We bought a Graco Duodiner and while I didn't like adding more plastic to the world, the design, use and safety of the chair is very good.  I am glad we chose the Graco over the Eddie Bauer chair.
