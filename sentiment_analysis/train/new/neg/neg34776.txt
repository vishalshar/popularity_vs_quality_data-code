Hard to find socks with "no-slip" pads on them for the motoring toddler.  Shoes for these tireless little ones too restrictive and take away their natural balance, slowing their development. So ditch the shoes, get the NON-SKID socks and DON'T WASH THEM IN THE MACHINE...better to use cold water and air dry.  With 6 pairs, you shouldn't have a shortage.
