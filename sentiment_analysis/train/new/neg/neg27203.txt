I purchased both this high chair and the inglesina fast table chair 2013 (white bars-newer one). I really like how light and portable this is, and great to keep in the car for traveling. However, I have a 9 month old (petite little guy) and he sits so deep in it. The back bar doesn't seem padded at all and he just sits in it funny like he has no real support. The inglesina one I purchased for our table at home (because this pod chair doesn't work with our table that has a skirt) sits so much better!! He sits well supported and it is padded very well on the back bar as well as the seat itself and he looks comfortable. I thought originally I'd keep this one just for the car to use at restaurants and gmas houses etc, except it BARELY fit on gmas standard table. It took some nudging and finally got it, but made me realize how much more the other one is going to be useful compared to this one and am returning it. Hope that helps someone else out
