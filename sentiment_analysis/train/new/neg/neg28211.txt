There was not enough feet in one roll.  I also had the same problem, I was 3 and a half feet short to finish the room.  So I had to go out and buy another 21.00 roll for 3 and a half feet!Also when I purchased the second roll and got it home, it was about 1/2 centimeter shorter in width then the first roll.  So make sure they match up in width before buying the second roll.Otherwise this wall border is cute, and will last awhile, because it's not just for a baby!
