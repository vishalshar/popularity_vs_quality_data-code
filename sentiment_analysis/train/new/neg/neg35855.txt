We bought this November 1, 2011 for our 12 month old and it hasn't lasted 6 months yet. He currently weighs 27 pounds which is below the recommended max weight of 30 pounds and the playpen is falling apart! The floor mat is broken due to cheap wood, the velcro straps that keep the floor mat in place have ripped off and there are holes in the bottom of the playpen from where the poles have rubbed against the cloth supporting the floor mat and we have only used this in house and have taken it to a friends house ONCE! I will be contacting the customer service center at GRACO because now the cost to replace this playpen on Amazon has more than doubled! You get what you pay for, not recommended at this point, pay for a better brand/model.
