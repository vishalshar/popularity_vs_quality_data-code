I can't believe all the wonderful reviews.  It's actually why I purchased it.  BEWARE!  Yes, it is a nice height for tall people and it has the handy cup holder.  The storage basket is useless because the frame is in the way of putting anything in the basket.  The wheels are terrible- you have to maintain a tight grip with both hands to steer the stroller.  I have a cheap $20 umbrella stroller that steers like a dream compared to this.  Plus, within two weeks of ownership and light use, the wheels started squeaking and now, one set of wheels is warped making steering even worse.  The material on which the baby rests is pretty scratchy.  The shoulder/chest pads slip constantly down over the clips so you have to push them up every time you want to lock the clips in place.  Ugh!  Just a huge disappointment overall.  I wish I could get my money back but I'm sure it's too late.
