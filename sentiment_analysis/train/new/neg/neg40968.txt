Piece of garbage from this seller. I bought one at ToysRUs and it was perfect but this one started squeaking after only a couple of weeks. I had bought it ahead of time and given it to my sister as a gift for her baby shower so by the time the baby was born and we discovered it was a piece of garbage, the seller refused to exchange it for a new one. Do NOT buy this one or from this seller. Buyer BEWARE.
