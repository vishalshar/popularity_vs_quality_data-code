I have bought 3 of these. All 3 were the same design. The first one (black) was lost after a month but had little signs of wear besides having been chewed daily. The second one (blue) fell apart within 2 weeks and was used the same as tbe first. Not only did it fall apart but small chunks came off - a potential choking hazard. I am unsure if the issue is the color or the silicone used or maybe a bad batch but I tried once again with a black one (because my child wanted that design). Hopefully this one will hold up, I felt like the blue one was a complete waste of money. I will update in in the future as to how the black has held up.
