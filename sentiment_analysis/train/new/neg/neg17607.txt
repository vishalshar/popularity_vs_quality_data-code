My chairs are with the specification measurements that this will fit but doesn't fit properly.  I think this is a great design but just didn't work for us.  I wanted something other than a plastic booster that I could used on our chairs.  My chairback is 16in tall, this states it will fit up to 17 3/4in.  When placed on our chairs the seat was at an angle which caused my son to slide to the edge of the seat.  He didn't like it and looked very uncomfortable.  The seatbelt is also not attatched to the backrest as it looks in the picture.  I think this is a great idea but it should fit the specifications the manufacture states.  I would not have ordered it otherwise.
