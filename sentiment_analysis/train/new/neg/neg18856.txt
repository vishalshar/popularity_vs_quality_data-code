A lot of other reviewers mentioned that they had a hard time installing this adorable scoop, but I followed the directions exactly and it's been up for over a week now with no issues. My shower walls are smooth, but I could see there being a slight problem if the walls were tiled. It only comes with adhesive strips for a one time use, but has directions for removing and you could definitely use "command strips" to re-attach. It is A LOT bigger than I anticipated (which is great) and it holds so many of my son's toys now and has a ton more room. I love that there is a place for my son's body wash and shampoo and the frog's feet act as little hooks to hang washcloths or sponges.Great product! I'm so happy with it and now I'm not stepping on bath toys while trying to shower! Wonderful and so cute!**EDIT: A week later and while my son was taking a nap in the room next door to the bathroom, the frog fell and when I heard it on the monitor, I was so so scared! It sent toys flying everywhere and woke my son. I'm not happy. The strips that came with the scoop are still sticky, the wall is/was dry and clean and I don't understand what happened. I'm going to buy Command strips and see if it holds that way, but I really hate having to go through the trouble of waiting 24 hours again for it to fall. For now, I'm giving it 2 stars.
