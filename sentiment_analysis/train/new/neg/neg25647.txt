The bug needs to be in the center of the room at bed (not dresser) level in order for the moon and stars to project across the entire ceiling.  Most people don't have low level furniture in the center of the room, so when you put it on a dresser along the wall, the moon and stars project onto 1/4 of the ceiling only.  If you can manage to get the bug to tilt to almost upright (by putting something under it), the light will reflect on 1/2 of the ceiling.
