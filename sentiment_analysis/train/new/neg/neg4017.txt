I read some of the negative reviews of this stroller on other websites and was particularly concerned about the front wheel shaking, but several of the reviews were good, so I took a chance. The stroller was an absolute breeze to put together, looks great, has great storage, etc. I was thrilled... Until we hit the road. We were not far from home when the front wheel started shaking terribly. It shook so hard it made the entire stroller impossible to steer. It would randomly stop shaking, be easy to push for a while, then begin wobbling again. While going down a very steep hill, it started shaking, and the front wheel turned so far out of line, that the entire stroller stopped abruptly. Luckily I realized what was happening and stopped quickly. It could have been a very serious accident, and my toddler would have certainly been thrown from the stroller had he not been buckled in. We locked the front wheel, but it was so hard to keep straight my husband's arms were worn out after only a few minutes.  It seems the alignment was way off.Of note, we didn't have to put the front wheel on at all.  It came assembled.  However, we did try tightening everything the instructions said to tighten, and nothing made a difference. This stroller is a piece of junk. I had such high hopes and was so thrilled about the price, but it is just not worth it. It seems some people get lucky and get a stroller that doesn't have problems, but you are absolutely taking a gamble if you try it.  Luckily, I was able to return mine and got a different brand.
