Received the set, it looks beautiful - but made a mistake of not opening right away - waited for a few months to open and after washing discovered that the crib sheet was ripped - and the rip looks like it was from packaging - there is a straight cut line from the cardboard insert that they package the sheets with.I've already decided to keep this set instead of sending back but will definitely inform Amazon of this.
