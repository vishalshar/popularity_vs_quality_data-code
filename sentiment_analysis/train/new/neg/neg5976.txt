The crib itself is good enough- pretty sturdy and what you would expect.  Drawers are a good size and are deep but it and the changing table feel a little cheap.My big issue is that the size of the changing table is 26.5" x 16" when a standard changing pad is usually 32" long.  It does come with a very thin pad (less than an inch thick) and obviously there are no fitted sheets for it (I've seen recommendations to use pillow cases/flat sheets or some say IKEA pads are a better fit and they have fitted sheets for their pads as well).  I was pretty disappointed that this wasn't mentioned at all in the description.Another reason why this is an issue is that for a convertible crib to which you have to keep the changing table while using it as a toddler bed, your child will most likely outgrow it before its first birthday.  At 1 years old my daughter is 28.5" in length so that means the table is nearly worthless.  Really disappointing.Also you cannot see it on the picture but the drawers do not go the full depth of the crib- instead they fall about 6" short of the full depth and then there are open shelves.So if you are going to buy this combo DO NOT buy a changing pad for it.
