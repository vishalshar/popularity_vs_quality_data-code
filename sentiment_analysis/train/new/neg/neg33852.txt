Hen I first got ths bag I loved it it coud finally fit all the things I needed or my son in one bag even if it woudnt do up - I never tried to do so as I knew it woudnt.The second week of using it I tried to get my phone from the outer magnetic pocket and it ripped the top of the fabric when I pulled it open. Ether the magnets are too strong or the fabrics piss poor. I'm now on the Hunt for a new bag. Again.
