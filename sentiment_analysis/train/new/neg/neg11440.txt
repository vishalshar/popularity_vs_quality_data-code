I cannot get the "Bumpers" to suction to the tub at all! I tried extensively on my own until enlisting the help of my husband who also could not get all or even a majority of the suction cups to adhere and suction completely to the tub. After we thought we had a few of them suctioned they all came loose once the tub was filled with water. I am extremely frustrated by the product failure because I was excited that my little one has outgrown the need for a baby tub and she was excited about the "princesses" in the tub. I still want to ensure a measure of safety as she learns to bathe without the security of an infant tub so I will attempt an alternate product. I do not recommend this product due to it's failure to secure/suction to the tub or function as advertised. This mom feels sad and let down.
