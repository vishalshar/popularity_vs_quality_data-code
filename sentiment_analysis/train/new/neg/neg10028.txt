I am furious with this product. Nothing is labeled clearly, smallest dose is 5mL: two year old dose. A two year old doesn't need a pacifier to take meds. Only the syringe will guarantee they got the whole dose, but the bottle topper doesn't make a proper seal. Dropper also doesn't seal, so it doesn't work. Nasal aspirator also doesn't seal, so it doesn't work. Stupid waste.Just get yourself a two buck plunger syringe with bottle topper from any pharmacy.I feel this product should only be a toy. Unreliable.
