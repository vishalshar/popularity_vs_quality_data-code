Despite doing a ton of research on the various bed rail options, I missed a very important detail if you select the DOUBLE-SIDED hideaway option:  The height of the bed rail itself is only 18" versus the more common 20" for the swing down or single-sided hideaway options in order to fit both sides under a twin bed.  For the increasingly common extra thick mattresses (ours is 10"), this only leaves 6-7" of rail protection which we didn't think was sufficient for our daughter.Additionally, the tracks to support the hideaway options are quite thick and could make for some lumpiness in a thinner mattress.  For our needs, we are now going to use two single-sided swing down bed rails that will afford a taller rail height for protection without the need for a thick metal tracks to run under the bed.
