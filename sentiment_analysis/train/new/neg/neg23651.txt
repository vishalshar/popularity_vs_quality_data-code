After a detailed and lengthy search for the perfect diaper bag I finally decided on the Storksak brand.  I had seen Storksak bags in retail stores before and knew they were good quality and very functional.  I was excited to find this discontinued bag at such a discounted price on Amazon.  To my disappointment when it arrived it was clearly not a true Storksak.  It is a very good replica, however, and if you are not familiar with the product details you may not even notice.  1.) no feet on bottom of bag  2.) pockets are not magnetic--they have traditional snaps that have a clasp sewn to the inside of the pocket. 3.) Tan accents are not real leather when it clearly states they are supposed to be. This bag was returned.
