I really wanted to like these cups, but unfortunately, I don't. Some of them, not all, are very difficult to get the caps to screw on correctly. Which leaves the cap crooked and allows the cup to leak. I feel like I'm fighting a battle with it every time I want to screw the cap on. There is a little white inset that goes inside the cap to prevent leaking through the top. This causes the child to have to suck in order to get a drink, which is totally fine. No problem there. However, my daughter would have to suck so hard to get a drink, and she seemed to barely get anything, that it caused almost like a vacuum effect inside the cup. The cup wasn't getting any air in when the drink went out, so she wasn't able to get anymore drink. When she took her mouth off of the sippy part, you could hear the air rushing in. I tried removing the little white "plug" type thing that goes inside the lid, to try to relieve this problem, but it doesn't seem to help much and then the cup leaks if it gets tipped over. I purchased two of these four packs, for a total of 8 cups, because two of them were going to daycare and I was so sure that I was going to like them. I do not use any of these cups now and they are all sitting in the tub of baby items that my daughter has outgrown in the basement. They will be sold in a yard sale.
