These are clear and not very noticeable which is nice. As many others have said, the plastic piece itself that sits on the door should be wider. We have standard sized bi-fold doors and the fit is very tight. There is no way you can move them using the little rod provided, so the rod is pretty much useless. If you are tall it isn't a huge issue since you can reach up and pop the lock upward to remove it from the door and slide it over. This would be a problem though if there isn't much clearance above your bi-fold doors, or if you're short and can't easily reach the top of the doors. I think this is a great solution for bi-fold doors you don't open frequently, but for ones you use all the time I would suggest looking for an alternative solution.
