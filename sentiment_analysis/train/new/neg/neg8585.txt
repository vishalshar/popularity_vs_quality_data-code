I've loved this swing. Until I noticed a small bruise on the back of my babies head. The padding is not thick enough to protect his head from the notch that lets you adjust the sitting position. He doesn't sit in a lot, but has gotten bigger and wiggles around a whole lot more. So I was surprised when this happened. I put a blanket under the cushion to fix the problem. But I'm still disappointed.
