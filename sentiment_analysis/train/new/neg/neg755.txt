I purchased this gate for the top of our stairs based on the great reviews it received.  My husband installed it with little trouble, although he did have to get drywall anchors for the screws as their weren't studs nearby.However, one installed, we could tell the gate just wasn't sturdy enough to really feel comfortable with.  The wood rungs are very thin and bendable.  Our baby is 10 months old, and while he couldn't do any damage to it now, I'm concerned a wood slat could snap when he gets older (maybe 18 mos).Also, we have a 5 year old who will be using the gate, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of him putting any weight onto this gate as he's using it, I feel it could easily break.We're retuning this item.I think it's a fine gate for other household areas, but I wouldn't trust it for the top of the stairs.
