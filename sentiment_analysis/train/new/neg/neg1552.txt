I agree with other reviewers - this cup is a great concept but the design and materials are significantly flawed. The straw is made from a type of plastic that does not sustain chewing or bending. My toddler isn't teething or particularly a biter but inevitably the top of the straw has gotten split from his biting down with regular use. I had to cut it to remove the chewed up part but now the straw is a bit too short and doesn't stick out of the bottle enough. Also, the 'stopper' on the bottom of the straw does keep the it from pulling out all the way but my son likes to still play with it and pulls it out as much as he can. It would've made so much more sense if they'd have put the stopper partway up to keep the straw in and limit how much it can move up and down. The bottle is also an odd shape - the narrow part is almost too narrow, making it difficult to clean with either my hand or my standard sized bottle brush. I love the idea of a cup designed with smoothies in mind since most sippy or straw cups can't handle thicker liquids, but unfortunately this just doesn't do it and I'm pretty sure soon enough it'll have to be thrown out. C'mon Dr Sears, you can do better!
