This is a colorful addition to the carrier but it doesn't hang down too far.  I suppose it may depend on the car seat you have.  We have a Britax, and perhaps this would be great if it wasn't on the handle!  Still, it provides new colors and textures to look at, but unless there is a toy that hangs down low, wobbles to and fro, then most handle toys just don't do the job.It's great for gym time or tummy time though and can offer good interactive play, but other than that, it's a decorated handle.(Which...means you will need to grip around the caterpillar, and the handle when you carry it...just something to think about...)
