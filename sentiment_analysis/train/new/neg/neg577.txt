This product is a complete waste of  time and money.  Our daughter started moving around the house a lot and start standing up by holding stuff. We wanted to safe guard all sharp corners in the house with sticky safety tape.  Bought this tape from amazon spent time to stick in on the dangerous furniture and window corners once we received it.  I have done this sticking in the evening, to my surprise when we woke up in the morning the glue came out and it was not sticking to the corners.I have tried sticking this back again & again for the next few days, but the glue was so bad that it just came out in the next couple of hours.Don't waste your money and by buying this useless product.
