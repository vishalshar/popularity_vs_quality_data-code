This stool is adorable and my son loved seeing Elmo. Unfortunately it is TINY and had to go back. My son is 19 months old and this is too small for him. Any younger and they wouldn't need a stool so I don't understand why it would be made so small. If they ever make this exact same stool in a larger size though I would totally purchase it.  I attached a picture of it next to my tape dispenser to help show you its size.
