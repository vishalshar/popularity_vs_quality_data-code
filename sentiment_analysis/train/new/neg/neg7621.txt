This product caught my eye as I was browsing the internet for baby products. When I received it, it was exactly what I expected. The colors were fun & bright. It didn't fade when I washed it. The swing worked great until 2 months later. The motor stopped working and I had to push my baby with my hand. I didn't really mind too much since my child wasn't a big fan to swing in the swing. It was great for travel (family reunions, trip to the grandparents house, etc.). The batteries didn't last very long in it and we had to continuously change batteries when the swing did work. The swing seat cover started ripping in the back at the top. That's when I called Fisher price customer service line. They were very helpful and I had the choice to purchase another one or get another Fisher Price product. Their great customer service made this go from 1 star to 3 stars!
