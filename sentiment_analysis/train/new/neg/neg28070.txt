I have the Baby Jogger City Mini Single stroller (not GT) and the Peg Perego Primo Viaggio 4-35 car seat and this adapter does not work! It's TERRIBLE! My car seat does NOT "click" in. It just rests in the adapter and is wobbly. Not safe or secure what so ever! What's sad is that I thought this was right. My husband and I are new parents and just assumed that's how it was supposed to be. Then one day I was talking to a friend who has the exact same stroller and car seat and she told me her car seat "clicked" into her adapter. So, one day my husband and I were at Babies R Us and I noticed they had the adapter. As it turns out, the adapter I bought is missing 2 pieces!!!!! Maybe that's why the description says "Discontinued by Manufacturer".
