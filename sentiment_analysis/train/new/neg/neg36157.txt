I ordered this for my 6 month old who was average height (26 in)and weight (16 lbs 3 oz) at the time and had outgrown her size small swaddle sleep sack, which I loved. This size medium sack is rated for a baby my daughter's size, but it is much too big, most importantly in the opening for the neck. When I tried it on her, I saw that it could easily slip above her face (and she has a big head!) with nighttime movement, so I have not used it. Defeats the purpose of a wearable blanket if it poses the same risk as a regular blanket.The difference between this size and the smaller swaddle sacks is the Velcro flaps. We stopped swaddling around 4.5 months, so I would just secure the Velcro flaps around her belly with her  arms out.  I now realize that, because this material was secured around her, it kept the rest of the sack from moving upward over her face. The above sack, as you can see, is not a swaddle sack, so there is nothing to prevent the material from bunching over the face. If the opening for the neck were significantly smaller, this sack would be great. The neck opening is so big I don't know if my daughter will ever be able to use the sleep sack. She will probably outgrow it lengthwise before her head is big enough to keep it from covering her face. I had also ordered another size medium in a different color, and tried that too in case there was a fluke, but same problem.I gave this two stars instead of one bc the material is very nice, and design is cute. But I'm not going to use it.
