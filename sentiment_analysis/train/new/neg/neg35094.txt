my plan is to return the Tyke Totter. It is well made and has proven to be the next step for my growing daughter from an iBert. However, unlike the iBert, the Tyke Totter offers no way to secure the love of my life to the seat or the bike, which means a pothole, an open car door or sudden hard braking can send her over the handlebars, face first into pavement. I can't even think of more dangerous possibilities. Adam's Trail A Bike makes a back rest with shoulder straps that would make the Tyke Totter perfect but the clamp doesn't fit. Does Tyke Totter offer such an add on?
