I like the Zoli cup. This is my fourth or fifth. It's the only cup my little one would drink from when I transitioned him from the bottle. My only complaint with the cup  is that after a while it starts to leak, but a replacement straw usually helps. The straw brush that comes with this set is NOT made by Zoli and unfortunately doesn't work well with this straw (it's too thick)but does work with some of our other thermoses and straws cups.  I have a Zoli brush and it works well, but you'd think because this one is being sold with the Zoli cup, it would work as well .
