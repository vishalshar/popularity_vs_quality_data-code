We researched both the BOB and this stroller before purchasing the Baby Jogger.  The decision was made based on some test driving - we felt like it was too easy to push on the handle of the BOB and make the whole stroller tip backward.  The Baby Jogger seems to ride the same - smooth and controlled - and we liked that the area where the child's feet go is plastic instead of cloth.  It's easier to fold up and switch the front wheel from straight to swivel.  We do wish more accessories came with the stroller like the child tray, parents cup holder and the carrier attachment (the stroller is $[...] after all, shouldn't it come with a couple of perks?) but we bought them separately anyway and are loving the product overall.  Update 08May10:  We loved this stroller until the rear tire blew out. It has been impossible to fix so far. The gentleman at the bike shop cannot get the tire back over the wheel frame and says that it's an unusually tight relationship to the wheel, making it impossible for him to repair or replace with another 16 inch tire. In trying to figure out why the tire blew in the first place, it turns out the Baby Jogger website recommends pumping the tires to only 20 psi even though the manual says to pump them to the amount listed on the tire (which is 40 psi). We haven't even jogged with this stroller a whole lot, just taken it on walks and to parks.  I will be contacting Baby Jogger customer service for a replacement wheel and ranting about the poor design of the tire/wheel fit. If they won't replace the wheel for free, I am returning the entire thing and ordering a BOB. I'll update this review when the ordeal is resolved.
