This umbrella stroller has three distinct flaws: 1) unless you are shorter than I (I'm 5;0"), you will step on the rear wheels constantly 2) the stroller seat is so shallow and flat that it doesn't mold to your baby/child's rear. In other words, he/she doesn't sit in the stroller, simply on it, making #3 dangerous in my opinion 3) the restraint/seat belt sits VERY low on the baby/toddler's body and is very difficult to tighten or loosen. It has no shoulder or chest restraint, therefore my grandson, who is 18 months old gets out of this stroller at will, with the seat belt securely closed. We put it away after the last attempt at a walk in the neighborhood and I would offer this advice to anyone looking for an umbrella stroller:  it's just as well to go inexpensive so long as there is a way to hold the child securely in the stroller and the handles are long enough that your footsteps don't hang on the rear wheels.
