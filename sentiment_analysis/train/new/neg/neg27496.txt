If you have a few hours to test the outer limits of your sanity while installing these abominations, then this is the child safety latch for you.The excessively robust mounting hardware requires drilling pilot holes in order to avoid damaging your cabinets.  The problem with this is that this is IMPOSSIBLE to do in anything smaller than an 8" deep drawer.  And forget taking the drawer out to make the installation easier on yourself, you won't be able to fit the drawer back in after the installation should you try.Without a ratcheting screw driver with a 3" extension--which is a fairly obscure piece of equipment, and not likely to be in the average tool box--I never would have been able to get these things installed AT ALL.Finally, the latches require that you mount them at a depth of 1.77" on the top of the drawer frame in order for the drawers to fully close after the installation.  The problem is that no drawers are designed with anywhere near thick enough wood on the frame to accommodate this specification.  So I had to mount it flush with the edge of the frame and now my drawers permanently hang open about 1".I have done a number of home renovations and am relatively handy, and this is by far the most poorly engineered doodad I have encountered thus far.Bottom line, DO NOT BUY THESE!!!
