Meh. It's kind of cute (a part the fact that the paint on the monkey's face was already chipped when I got this, I didn't bother sending it back thinking that it would come of in the dishwasher anyways), but that's about it. It's more, as other people said, a cute snack box, but as far as my preschooler goes, it won't work to pack lunch: the bottom compartment is smallish, the tray can't be removed because you won't be able to close the whole thing if the tray is missing, also I think this would leak so whenever I pack pasta salads, rice etc I just use another lunchbox. This one gets used when lunch consists of  series of small dry foods like tiny wraps, cheese slices, carrot and veggie sticks etc. Would I buy this again? No.
