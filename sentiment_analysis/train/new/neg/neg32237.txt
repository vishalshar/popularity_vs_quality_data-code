It served its purpose, but over time it start to have issues. After about a year it started to become flaky. I have two units. One unit doesn't work at all, and the other still sort of functioning. I bought it b/c it would not interfere with my wifi router due to the operating frequency range.Issue is the power connector for the monitor has become temperamental. Have to wiggle it just right to get a good connection and then it works. Likely over time some internal connection has become loose. Likely a product defect.
