I bought this car seat for my Down Snydrome child, whom is unable to communicate as well as has a high tolerance for pain.  He would fussed in his car seat after some time since I have used it but assumed that he just was tired of riding around per any child can get.  Last week after he has been in this carseat over a YEAR.  I had to rush out the door taking him without any clothes on. He was just in a diaper. When I reached my destination I discovered a very large red area in the lower part of his back.  When I felt the carseat in the area matching region of redness on his back it had a very large hard bump and a hard plastic hook as well in that spot. NO way he could even adjust himself out of the discomfort. I have managed to miss this discomfort to this point which really ticks me off.  This carseat is crap. If they cant get the basics right, it makes me question its whole intergrity.  I will be pursuing getting my money back from Evenflo.
