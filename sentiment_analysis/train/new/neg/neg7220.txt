These cups are absolutely terrible. I had a coupon for these and our old cups were worn out so I thought I'd give these a try. The lid is impossible to screw on. The cups are so flimsy that while struggling to screw on the lid it feels like they are going to break. If you finally manage to get a lid on, they leak out the sides and the first time they are dropped on the floor the lid pops off. I am very disappointed. I will be throwing these away and buying some more of the cups that we liked. What a waste.
