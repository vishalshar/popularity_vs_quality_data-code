I bought these bottles as an alternative to all the bottles containing BPA. I read customer reviews and decided to go with these. Contrary to what other have written, these bottles' venting system doesn't work properly. I have assembled and reassembled several times to make sure I have it right. My 6 month old daughter has to unlatch to let air in. If I put my ear up to the bottom I can here the air going in the vent, but I guess it's not enough. Other than this I love these bottles. It's a great idea behind the design, but it just doesnt work. Before I got these, I picked up some cheap Gerber Fashion Tints bottles (3-pack) for $2 and they work better than these.
