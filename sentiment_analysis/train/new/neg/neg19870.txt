I bought this to use on both my Maclaren Quest and my Maclaren Twin Techno.  What a waste of money.  The velcro attachment on the back ripped off after only 2 uses.  I also found that it's not the best idea for a side-by-side stroller since they barely fit through doorways the way it is.  I only used this on my Maclaren Quest.  I might try the skip hop version for my Quest.
