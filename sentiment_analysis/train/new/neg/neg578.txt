The good - Very adjustable, easy to adjust, fits on chairs, and generally works as described.  Very easy to take off the fabric, run it through the washing machine.  Attaching it to a chair was a snap.The moderate - it generally seems to take up more room than it should - we are past the need for all of the reclining, which I think drove a lot of the space hogging.  It isn't at all practical to take this with you places.The bad - the tray is HUGE.  Way way bigger than necessary, which meant we could not get it to fit in our dishwasher, no matter how hard we tried.  For that reason we returned it and got the Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat, Red/White.  That model had a tray that was plenty big enough, but easily fit in the dishwasher
