If I could give it no stars, I would.I ordered this item specifically because it shows it as it is- with the rubber backs and sponges. The sponge catches leaked milk and the rubber back helps them stay in place comfortably.However, when I received them, neither of those things are present.I paid $13 for 2 pieces of domed plastic. What in the world? Is this some sort of a joke? I'm going to find out where I send my complaints, because I know they wont be answered to here. I'm furious.I want what I thought was being purchased. I figured I was purchasing what was pictured, seeing as that's what the imagine is for- to show you what you're buying.Nowhere in the description does it say they're going to rip you off and send you something else entirely, or I would have spent my money elsewhere.Do not purchase this, people. You wont be happy.
