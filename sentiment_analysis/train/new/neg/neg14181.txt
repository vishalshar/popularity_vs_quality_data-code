This is one of the Spectras that aren't my favorite. I think her hair can get to messy and out of hand although I love her outfit. She's pretty but not my favorite and I really don't like her makeup. Her makeup is to purpley. Although I like Spectra I think Mattel adds to much purple to Spectra! I guess I recommend her.
