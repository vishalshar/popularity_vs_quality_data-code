It smells like the Original scent Poo-pourri, so I don't know that there's a difference. I had hoped it would work better than it does, but you can't expect miracles either. I have tried spraying directly on the stool, on the inside and outside of the wrapped up diaper, and into the diaper pail, but it doesn't seem to make my pail liners last any longer. I was hoping to not have to change the pail until it was full, but the smell still starts to creep out before then. I think this would be best to keep in your diaper bag and spray when changing a soiled diaper in public. It does help to immediately neutralize the odor! Unfortunately, it is not the cure for a stinky diaper pail - and that's what I wanted it for. I probably wouldn't buy this again, but I do love Poo-Pourri toilet spray :)
