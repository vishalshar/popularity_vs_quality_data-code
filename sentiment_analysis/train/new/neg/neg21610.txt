HORRIBLE!!  DON'T BUY IT! RUN, DON'T WALK.  First of all, I didn't receive the color cloth I ordered. The seat cushion is thin and feels like your sitting on a wooden board.  The fabric is cheap and cheesy. Arrived poorly box and a leg was scratched (Amazon, take note).  My back and legs hurt by the end of the first day.  I use it in my office for several hours day....I cannot imagine a new mother feeling comfortable and relaxed with her infant for even a few hours.  I am extremely disappointed and hope I can make a speedy return.
