The very first day that my daughter used this bottle at daycare, the green paint chipped all over the place.  The daycare providers had to peel it from her face, making her pretty upset.  I can understand how it might chip over time, but this was the very first day of use and I had hand washed it.Do yourself a favor and only get the stainless steel bottles.  No color
