I’ve never written a review before but felt compelled to since I value the opinion of others so much on amazon.  I was super excited to get this since my 4-mo old son loves mirrors, we wanted a teether, it’s BPA free, inexpensive, and had good reviews.  Well, in this case you get what you paid for…cheap.  The paint surrounding the mirror (yellow and blue) is cheaply done and the biggest concern is it’s CHIPPING OFF.  It went straight into the trash.  No baby of mine will be sucking on something that has paint chipping off unless it’s a food-based paint or something non-toxic, which this isn’t. Buyer beware!
