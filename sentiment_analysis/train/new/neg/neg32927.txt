I don't recall this being noted in the product description, however I was quite surprised to read this upon receiving the item. My 9 month old daughter drools and spits up on pretty much everything and I am disappointed they would market such a product that can not truly be "washed" - wiping with a damp cloth does not cut it in my book.
