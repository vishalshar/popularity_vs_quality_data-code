Have the feeling these diapers are seconds - they are all marked with an "X" on the tag and the fit varied slightly from one diaper to the next.  Don't know if this makes the general FB warranty void.  Otherwise, diapers performed brilliantly - however, my son outgrew them at 3 months (14lbs) - not 18lbs/8mos as stated!!!
