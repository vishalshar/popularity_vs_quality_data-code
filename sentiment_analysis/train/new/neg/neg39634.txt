I actually ended up sending these cups back, and I rarely do returns because they're usually a hassle. I've used other cups made by Gerber, but these just don't fit the bill. We filled them with water or milk and my 3 year old couldn't work up enough suction to get any liquid out. On top of that, after they sat on the counter for 5 min, pressure built up and they started leaking milk out of the top of the straw and collecting on the lid. My girls are messy enough, I don't need a cup adding to their mess. Our favorite cup is the double walled Gerber graduates straw cup, and it appears ours was an old model. Can't find it anywhere.
