I was really wanted to love this pillow.  I have several auto immune disease and am desperate for pain free sleep.After reading many reviews, I decide to spend too much moneys and buy this pillow.I woke up each morning (three nights in a row) with horrible headaches and neck aches.The seams inside the pillow are so hard that you cannot find a comfortable positions.  In fact, I awoke one morning to have the seam of the pillow indented upon my neck...it stayed that way for thirty minutes.The pillow has now been donated to Goodwill and my money donated to Leachco.Don't spend the money.
