I love the way this looks.  I loved the price.  Putting it together was kind of a pain, but these things usually are.  What I HATE about this high chair is taking the tray on and off.  I do like that the tray fits in my sink for easy cleaning, unlike my last high chair, but it has taken quite a few on/offs to make the buttons that secure and release the tray move a little easier.  I get frustrated on an almost daily basis trying to get this tray on and off.  A little muscle goes a long way.  Also, my kid is pretty skinny, and this high chair feels a little tight for space, even for him.  I wouldn't recommend this if you have a heavier/chubbier baby.
