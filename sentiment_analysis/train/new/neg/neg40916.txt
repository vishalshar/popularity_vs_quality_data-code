I purchased this because I fell in love with SwaddleDesigns flannel blankets-they are large, thick, and attractive. I expected the same type of quality from the sleep sack, but feel it falls short. First, the material doesn't feel as thick as their blankets; it is, however, cute with it's little dots and pink satin trim. Next, the neckline is roomy, so it can rub up against her face. I'm ok with this b/c she's nine months, but it might make me nervous if she was a younger baby. (The Halo sleepsack has a smart v-neck design that avoids this situation.) Zipping from the bottom sounds like a good idea, but you quickly get over it when trying to contain a wiggly baby and she keeps pulling her feet up before you can get the zipper up. Finally, it has a snugger fit that seems to frustrate her when she's awake in the crib. Unlike the Halo sleep sack that allows her to move around and stand up, this restricts her movement a bit. (Maybe that is a good thing if you have a crib jumper!)
