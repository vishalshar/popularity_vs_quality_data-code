The overall concept is great, and after a few days my daughter really warmed up to the idea of having a lot of tags to play with and chew on.  My only criticism is that the blanket material is HEAVY flannel and extremely hot.  I live in South Florida so this is not an item I can use everyday, especially on car rides.  I believe it comes in other fabric options which I suggest you look into based on your own particular climate needs.  If you live in a cold weather climate, this one would be perfect.
