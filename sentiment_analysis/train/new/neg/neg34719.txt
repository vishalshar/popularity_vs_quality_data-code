I was so excited to receive my Stokke Table Top since I already own the Tripp Trapp Chair.  With the first delivery, I received an empty shipping box (must have been stolen), so Amazon shipped another one to me.  When I received the package, I was disappointed to find out that the Table Top only came with 2 reversible templates (the template with the giraffe was not included), although the product description and the product images clearly showed 3 reversible templates.  It also did not come with an inspirational book, as advertised in the Amazon description.  I called Amazon to report this and they said that they would ship out another one to me with the 3rd template and book.  I then went on to the Stokke website to find out from their product description that they have stopped including the 3rd template and book.  I called Amazon to let them know this, so they canceled the replacement.  They also said that they would update their website with a new description (however the images still show the giraffe template).  I was really disappointed and felt that this was false advertising.  The reason I was willing to pay so much for this table top was that it came with the 3 reversible templates.  If I had known I would get only two, I may not have purchased it.  I also have noticed that the suction is not so great.  It is constantly moving around, although I have made sure that my table (which is wood) and suction cups were clean.  Maybe that is why they recently lowered the price...again, I wish I had paid this lower price instead of the higher price I had to pay.
