This product was absolutely awful. If I could give it 1 star I would. We thought this would work great for feeding at night thanks to the cooler part but we never got a chance to try it. The first time we used it, it heated the bottle so hot that it actually started to melt the top and caused the milk to boil over before finally shutting off. We followed all the instructions, it said for the amount of milk we were us to fill to the 3 minute mark which we did. We plugged it in and turned it on. I waited for the 3 minutes and I could see the light was still on so I had not gotten up yet. My son was crying so I didnt get back to check on it till about 10 minutes later. I went to pull the bottle out and noticed it was more than half gone, it was all in the bottom of the warmer. I was livid about that wasted breastmilk and it ruined a one of our Dr Brown bottles.We are returning this and getting the Dr Brown one.
