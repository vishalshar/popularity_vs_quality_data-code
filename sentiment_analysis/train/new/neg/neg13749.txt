I would have rated the chair lower if it weren't so inexpensive. Assembly was very quick and easy. My husband did it in about 10 minutes. The ottoman came pre-assembled, but since we have gotten it (about a week ago) some of the screws that hold the top of the ottoman on to the mechanism have fallen out on their own. I can't imagine this improving over time... I only rock very gently, so am not sure why this is.I also find this chair very uncomfortable and think my height has a lot to do with it (I am 5'9"). When I first sat down in the chair it felt odd, like it wasn't very supportive. Now I find that if I sit in it for longer than 15 minutes, I am itching to get up and shift around a lot because it is uncomfortable. I think this chair was made to sit a shorter person. The seat itself doesn't feel deep enough and that only gets worse if you add a small pillow to the back for lumbar support, which is necessary with this chair. If you're a shorter person, or have not had any back injuries (I did take a spill during my pregnancy) then this chair might work for you.
