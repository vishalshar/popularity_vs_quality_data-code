I love my Cuisinart Baby Food Maker and I really wanted to like these Food Storage Containers. Sadly, they are a complete fail... Here is why:- Yes, they are compact - but their form doesn't make them easy to store between all other (square) storage containers you usally have in your fridge.- Their lid doesn't snap, so you sure can't travel with them and as soon, as you take one container from the block, all the others open - a complete mess even when frozen.- The flat, but curved form makes it difficult to pour puree into the containers.- Great idea to thaw babyfood in the Cusinart Baby Food Maker. Nonetheless, it doesn't work really well - you have to use the "steam"-setting on your Baby Food Maker twice to thaw the frozen food.Definitely not worth the really high price... So, even when I love most Cusinart products, I went with the OXO Baby Food storage blocks OXO Tot 12 Piece Baby Block Set instead.
