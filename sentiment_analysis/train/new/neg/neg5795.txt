The product arrived pretty quick. It's very lightweight and compact but it's not stirdy. The seating area is too small and not deep enough for my boy. He is only 12 month (27LB and 30" long). No way he can sleep in there without his legs hang out too far.I thought I want to have something that can handle my boy till 3 year old. The plastic wheels are flimpsy. They turn easy but not the direction you want to go so I return it.
