This is actually the second one that I bought and I absolutely love the first one.  This one is slightly different (a different year / model) and has  less padding, but only slightly so and it no longer comes with a carry bag (again, not a big deal).My biggest problem is that the product specification details indicate that the maximum recommended weight is 96lbs.  When it arrived today, I was rather saddened to find that the maximum recommended weight according to the packaging and safety instructions is identical to the first on that I bought (37lbs).  Frankly, that is only 38% of the weight that is claimed on the description.I have a nearly three year old who likes to do what his infant brother is doing, so I thought this would be perfect.  Unfortunately, what I thought would be months of side-by-side messy dining bliss is likely to be a much shorter time period.  A great (five-star) product, but I am likely to return it, as the amount of time I can use it doesn't warrant the price.If you have an infant and are looking for convenience, I strongly recommend it, but if you have a toddler, be prepared to have a relatively short life-span of use for the product.
