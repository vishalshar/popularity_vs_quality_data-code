I purchased this thermometer based on all the positive reviews. I also paid almost double for it about 1,5 year ago. Sadly, this thermometer has NEVER given me the same reading when used several times in a row on the same person. I used it on my baby and on myself, always trying at least 3 times (it works fast), usually even more, and not once it gave me the same number. So very disappointing, and incredibly useless. Just today I could tell my baby has a fever, and it gave me a reading between 103.1 all the way down to 99.1 within a minute of separate swipes in front of his forehead. So frustrating. He was very calm and still just lying on the changing table, and I was really able to swipe peacefully several times. And yet, different number every single time. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.
