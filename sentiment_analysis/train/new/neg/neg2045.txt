The burp cloths are soft and made of what appears to be durable material, however they are tiny. You can not use this to put on your shoulder for a burp, you would most definitely end up soiled. They can be used to wipe spit up off your child's mouth. I would not tell you not to buy them, but buy them understanding that they are the smallest burp cloths I have seen to date.
