Last year I debated on these reusable yummi pouches or disposable ones. I decided on the reusable ones but wish I had just gone with the disposable and here's why. They are impossible to clean. I usually rinsed them thoroughly, ran them through the dishwasher, and then rinsed them again. However, around the zipper area and along the bottom of the pouch collects small particles of food. I would try to clean those areas as well as I could but there was always dark little bits along those seams. With this issue, they became cumbersome to try to clean and I never felt like they were really clean and therefore never felt good about feeding my babies with these. I  am now throwing them away and plan to buy disposable ones. I had been excited to use these but unfortunately was overall disappointed. I give this product two stars because I probably used these at least four times each and they held together and functionally worked great. I just wish they could somehow change the design so the pouch doesn't harbor food particles.
