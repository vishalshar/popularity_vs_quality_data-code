When it first arrived I wasn't thrilled but it seemed to do what it was supposed to do. I was, however, immediately disappointed to discover that it is by no means a one hand job to get the bags out of the dispenser. (I bought this over another brand based on the reviews that said you could use it with one hand. I am unsure how the people who wrote that managed to do so...not saying it is impossible but I couldn't figure out a way to do this.)The best thing about it are the bags themselves that do smell nice and do contain nasty smells well (as long as they don't rip, they are not very thin or flimsy though).I find the dispenser quite bulky (especially the hook) and like some of the other reviewers said it does open easily on it's own.The worst part is actually getting the bags out of the dispenser. It was never easy to begin with and with a wiggly baby in arms I had a few of the bags rip before I managed to tear them of the roll. The issue was made worse by the fact that after a few weeks of very light use (I used perhaps 5 bags) the part of the dispenser that keeps the roll in place broke off. So now the whole thing is quite useless except for the fact that it is still hooked inside my diaper bag so I always know where to find it (but honestly that is the least of my troubles given how much effort it takes to actually get a bag out of it). I regret getting the refill.
