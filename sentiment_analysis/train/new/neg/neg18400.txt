I don't love the clips on this one.  The little hook got chewed on, which I think is a reasonable occupational hazard for a pacifier clip, and then did not keep anything attached very well.  I thought I would like the plastic collar clip instead of metal, but it is large and over time, the seal is not very tight and kept falling off the collar.  It's not a bad clip and functioned OK for awhile, but I went back to metal clips like Booginhead and Bumkins, which hold better.
