This twin stroller works as advertised and the main features for which we chose the Joovy Twin Roo over other twin strollers are the "compact fold" feature, which indeed makes it "easy to fold and fit in any car", as well as the "lightweight frame". If you then also own a Chicco car seat (as we do), then there is not much to desire feature-wise. If you do not own a Chicco car seat, you can use one of the included adapters. Be aware, though, that those adapters are to be removed prior to folding the stroller (as I understand the manual) and hence, it's not that "easy folding" anymore in this case.However, the overall quality of this stroller could be better. The first stroller that we ordered went back the same day. The package was damaged and the frame was scratched in more than one place, with some scratches already showing rust. The second stroller came in a similarly impacted package, but seemed OK at first glance. Fully assembled, however, the frame showed bad painting and scratches in various places and I believe I even noticed a "touch-up" in one spot. The tires show signs of wear and tear after the first trip to the mall, the plastic parts are cheap-cuts and parts are attached to the frame via rivets, which are likely to wear over time, but cannot easily be replaced.Bottom line is that the stroller will be useful for occasional visits to the doctor or shopping in the mall. It is certainly not your daily jogger.
