I bought this to cover our Baby Jogger 2010 City Mini Double Stroller, Green/Grey, because I didn't want to spend anther fortune for Baby Jogger's mosquito netting, and this netting is advertised as working with most double strollers.  The price is right, and it does it's job.  However, it is minorly annoying that it has to cover the stroller's handle to work.  Also, there are several spaces that are not fully covered by the netting, although the mosquitos do not seem to have figured this out yet.  The most annoying part is that it is so loose that my toddler can easily grab it and tug on it, making it quite difficult to keep on.  If your toddler is more sedate than mine, this might not be a problem.
