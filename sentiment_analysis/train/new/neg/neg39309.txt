I wish this thing would have worked properly! When we used it for the first time it worked for a good five minutes and then seized up. We checked all the nooks and crannies to see if there was any sort of build up and there was none. We checked the batteries to see there was water and there was not. We tried again after ten minutes and it worked again. Within another five minutes it again stopped working. I then decided to email the seller to see if there was something I was doing wrong or if the item was in fact defective and did not receive a response. I ended up returning it which was a shame since my kids absolutely loved it for the 5 minutes they got with it.
