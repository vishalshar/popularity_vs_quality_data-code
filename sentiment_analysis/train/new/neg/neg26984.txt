Okay for the price, the material lining the seat is vinyl, it looks a bit on the cheap side. I would not recommend for people who will actually use these in a vehicle every day. I bought the cheapest car seats I could find because it's the law to take your babies out of the hospital in them. I live walking distance from where I gave birth.
