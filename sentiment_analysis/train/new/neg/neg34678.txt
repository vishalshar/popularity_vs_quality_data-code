I bought it through the company about a month ago and used it twice! My husband removed it from the stroller and the clamp broke very easily!  we then realized there was also a hole in the umbrella! I went to the facebook page and just posted "I just bought this a few weeks ago and the clamp already broke" i went to ck my comment today and it was removed, someone "unliked" the page for me and I am blocked from posting on the page after I liked the page again. The company did contact me via e-mail and phone and offered to replace. I told them I wanted a refund instead and they refunded my money right away. They said that it was the first complaint of a broken clamp that they had recieved
