I bought this seat because it seemed like it was quality, had a good price, and wasn't too girly (for me the dad).  After a couple of months, all of the foam padding started deteriorating creating chunks of dirty foam all over my car.  It eventually would turn to dust and get in my daughter's eyes.  It's really horrible.  Because the seat was used much less than her mom's it lasted long enough for her to outgrow it, but I really wish I had replaced it earlier.If that's not enough for you, the fact that the buckles are really hard to snap in even when my girl is sitting still is an even better reason to hate this seat.  Once you've got your child's arms through, you clip the top of the belts to each other then have to align the two buckles holding them together in the most precarious way, then shove them into the other end of the buckle. Our other seat allows you to insert one at a time, without the need to perform some sort of magical feat to accomplish.The seat detaches from the base which most infant seats do, but that's even harder to release than the buckles are to latch. :(  You have to push down the seat/push up the base, all while pressing a giant release button that always seems to get stuck.
