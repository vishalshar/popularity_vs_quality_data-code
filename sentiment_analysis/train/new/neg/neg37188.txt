It is lightweight and easy to set up. Also easy to move around to whatever room you are in.There are two things which are definitely big cons, and I would not have purchased this if I had known im advance. First, while it is supposed to be flat, the bottom is actually slightly inclined... and I don't think it's intentional. Secondly-- the mattress. I just hate the mattress in this thing. I trusted that this product was designed safely but I don't understand how this mattress is safe. It is a thin, lining type thing which is not firm and can be easily pulled up, wrinkle or move under the baby. Two velcro securements do little to keep it in place. You have to wash the whole thing which means there is no where to put the baby while it's in the wash. If this had a "real" firm mattress that you can put a sheet on it would be great.. as it is this mattress is terrible and makes me nervous.
