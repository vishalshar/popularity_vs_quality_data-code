This item is not as it appears online. Poor quality, cheep material in washed out colors. I'm so disappointed. Wanted to like it, and for the money I wanted to make it work, but its such poor quality that it made me sad every time I went in the nursery. Tried to return it and got the run around first, then a complete lack of response. Have contacted them over 4 times and still not receiving a response. DO NOT BUY THIS- you will regret it, and you'll be stuck with it because no one from Geeny will even talk with you to work it out. Worst customer service ever!
