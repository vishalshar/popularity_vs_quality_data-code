These cups work great and don't leak.  But every one of them ended up separating.  The inner cup came apart from the outer clear plastic cup. You can put them back together, but then my kids kept taking them apart and playing with them.  I ended up just throwing the outside part away.  Which is fine, it just isn't insulated anymore and then the design wears off.Pros:Doesn't leakCute designsCons:Comes apart quickly (in a few months)
