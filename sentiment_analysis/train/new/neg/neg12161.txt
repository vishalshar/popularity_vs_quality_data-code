It's made out of cheap plastic.. The kind of plastic you see inside of Oreo cookies bag, being used as tray. (if you know what i mean.) Very flimsy and not worth the money. It is cute tho, and looks okay in the pic, but when I got it, it was more dissapointing than anything else. It doesn't come with anything else.. and my whole reaction was like, "oh.. is this it..???"
