I brought this mat for my son who will be starting daycare soon. When it arrived, my son was pretty excited, the mat was plushy and he loves the tractors on it. The color is a bit brighter than the picture and as some reviews mentioned, it is a bit short. My son is 2 years old and in the 50% for height. This mat fits him, but just barely. It's not a big deal as I have a younger son who we will pass this to.My biggest complaint is that it came with stains--hopefully it's just dirt and not something gross. I would've returned this for another one if I didn't already write my son's name on it. I'm pretty disappointed that the seller would send this out without inspecting it. We haven't washed it yet so I'm hoping the stains will come out. Carefully inspect this if you order it!
