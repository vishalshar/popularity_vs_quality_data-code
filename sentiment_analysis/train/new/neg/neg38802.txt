Ordered on 6/25 received on 6/30. Packaging was adequate. The thermometer comes with two batteries (that's always a plus), measures in Celsius, and has a very easy to read display.I read the back of the packaging and the manual to understand how to accurately measure each temperature, how to change C to F, and tried memorizing the pictures on the display.Sorry, but I don't have time to remember what each little symbol means and the backlight hardly stays on long enough to try to figure out out.I'm a nurse and this was purchased for work, I tested it out on myself multiple times and my 2year old. Every reading was completely different and WAY off, this was even obvious without another thermometer.I need 100% consistency 100% of the time.Even in the instructions it reads to not measure when a shadow on forehead or a breeze..I read and reread the instructions how to change from C to F, each time it would beep show error and shut off. Even had my husband attempt it in case I was not understanding, same occurrence..I will be trying to return as I paid $35 and it's not even worth chancing as this is an important vital sign.
