Bought this crib in January, set it up in February, in a well ventilated room.  It was really smelly, strong chemical smell like in a pesticide section in  Home Depot. Since we had an alternative, left this crib for 4 months (!) fully assembled in a room with a window crack-open to "air it out". Still, the smell was so overpowering, that my husband, who has virtually no sense of smell, couldn't stand it. My father felt "his lungs were burning" after working for an hour to disassemble it.How can anybody put a baby into it?  The whole room was rendered toxic by this product.
