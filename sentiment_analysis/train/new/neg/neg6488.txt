Firstly, it is cute. That's where my pros end.But......quality was lacking. The single AA battery it requires doesn't fit into the battery slot. It sits in there with JUST enough edge to work.Speaking of working; there is no backlight. I read one previous review that said it was backlit. Not so.It also has a very loud tick.
