So, to start off, this is the first product I have purchased from OneStep and I rated the toy overall as 3 stars because there was no option to rate my satisfaction or expectations beyond the product itself. I received the product faster than I had anticipated, within less than a week, I believe. However, when I went to put it together, I found that I was missing one of the fourteen dowel rods and a panel (though I wasn't sure which one, as they were not labeled) needed to assemble the bookshelf. I immediately called OneStepAhead and ordered replacement parts. Within a few days, I had received more dowel rods, but no panels. I waited another week, and still no panels. So I sent them an email and was told that the item was on backorder until the 3rd of February (nearly a month from the order date). I was sent a partial refund for the shipping costs. Still, I spent nearly $100.00 on a product that I couldn't even put together. The panels arrived a few days ago, both of which were slightly damaged. Another disappointment. Nevertheless, it seemed manageable so I went ahead and put the bookshelf together. Finally, it is in my living room and my son is so happy with our new addition. It looks great and I love the color of the wood. It matches all of my other furniture just as I had hoped. This bookshelf is beautiful and holds a lot of books and makes it easier for my son to put them away and take them out. So, the point of my review is this: Love the product, but the service was a bit disappointing. Be prepared, just in case.
