Now that my son is bigger this works fine.  At first the hole for his face was too high, his face was in the zipper part.  I couldn't use it until he was about 2.5 months old and he is a big baby.  Also the straps on the side don't really fit my car seat well.  I had to improvise.  I have a Graco car seat.  But now that his head is higher it works great.  However because the straps don't work well for my car seat I think cold air can get in the sides.  What I like is that it doesn't take up room inside of the car seat, like others do.  The problem with those, is that the straps in the car seat can get too tight for your baby with all of the cushion inside.
