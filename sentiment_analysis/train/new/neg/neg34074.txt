The scissors were horribly dull and could not be used to cut.  I took them out of the package and tried them on both my infant and toddler.  They would not cut either of their fingernails, instead they bent the fingernail or started to rip it.  I usually like Safety 1st, but will not buy this grooming kit again!  Definitely would NOT recommend.  I'm disappointed because Safety 1st has so many great products.
