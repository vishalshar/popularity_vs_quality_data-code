I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  He loves the rocker; however, it is supposed to play music and the sound part of it doesn't work. It should make various sounds, and play "Take Me Out to the Ballgame."  I'm particularly disappointed because it seems I have no recourse as I ordered this earlier in the year and stored it in anticipation of Christmas.  Boo, Hiss Amazon.  $85 isn't the end of the world, but I expect when I purchase something new that it should work as intended...I'm an avid Amazon purchaser who may need to re-evaluate my thoughts on this.  :-(
