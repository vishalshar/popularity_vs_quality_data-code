I returned this item without using it.  It might work for some, especially if they are just using it for diapering.  I wanted to put it in my daiper bag with feeding supplies and changes of clothing, but it was to bulky in my diaper bag.  I didn't think the wipe box would be practical.  I just use the travel size wipes in the container they come in and the Ultra Soft Changing Mat - Large 29" X 29" from Diaper For A Change, Inc.  It's a large mat that is machine washable/dryable.  I can fit the wipes, the changing mat, 10 size one diapers, travel size trash bags, travel size rash cream, and travel size hand sanitizer all in the space this product took up.
