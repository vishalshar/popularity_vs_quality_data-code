The idea is good, but there are some faults with it.  - It's a bit small for me, not mentioning my husband, who is a big guy.  - Zipper is useless, I've never put things in there. And you would definitely not put your watch or phone over there. It might get wet.  - You can't wash it in a washing machine, just "spot cleaning"  - As well, one of the clips fell off after 2 months of using.I still have it, but I don't use it at all. Probably, useless item.
