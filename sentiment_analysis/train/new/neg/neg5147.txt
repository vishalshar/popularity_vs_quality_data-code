We initially purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  It is very cute but very flimsy and the bar/handle would not hold the seat in a sitting position (it kept slipping).  I ended up finding another doll carseat at a store and ended up giving that one to her instead.  We will be returning this one.
