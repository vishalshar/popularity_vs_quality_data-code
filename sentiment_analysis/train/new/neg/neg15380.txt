The ones we got when this was a Lightning Deal, definitely from this item page, do not have the handle part protruding from the shield. They have the same design on them, but the front that doesn't go into our baby's mouth is flat with a few holes cut out.Just feels misleading to get a different product than what's pictured, especially since it's useful to have a handle. That's why many pacifiers have one and why the original design had one. The case feels cheap too, and I'm not sure it's actually BPA-free like the pacifiers are promised to be. Wouldn't want that leaching. I will update this review if the company promises all cases ever produced for this item have been BPA-free as well.Fortunately our baby seems to like them. After being weirded out on the first try, 10 minutes later she was asleep with one of them. That said, the unexplained difference from the product images and low-quality-looking case are enough to deduct two stars.
