UPDATE:  The snuza worked great for the first 4 months, but now that my baby is moving more (on his own) at night we get "false alarms" every night whenever he lies on his side.  I guess it's the way the snuza is positioned.  It's fine when he lies on his back, but once on his side it only takes a few minutes for it to go off since it's not touching his tummy in the right spot.  So unfortunately, it only worked for us until he turned 4 months and starting changing his sleeping positions more throughout the night on his own.Original post:  It's working great!  It does have a bright, green light so in a dark room it is pretty bright, but I'm glad I can see it very well.  I have had no problems with the battery.  It really helps me to stay calm and sleep now that baby is sleeping through the night.  I don't worry as much.
