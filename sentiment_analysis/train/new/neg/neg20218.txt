I bought this because my baby had nipple confusion after introducing bottle (I went back to work full time). I was in pain from improper latch and bought this in hopes of getting through the pain. It never worked for me...my baby could not grab on properly- it made his latch worse. I ended up just tossing it aside-- it was just easier to go bare.
