We bought this for my autistic son, who is prone to bolting.  Unfortunately, this product is also very easy to remove, and my son wouldn't leave it on.  We kept finding them discarded all around the house, or on the grass outside.  If your child is likely to get lost, and isn't apt to remove things, this could be helpful.At the price, it's probably worth the try.
