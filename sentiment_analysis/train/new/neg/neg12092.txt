I just bought these receiving blankets today based on all the good reviews.  Washed & dryed ONCE according to instructions and they have lost their shape, the stitching at edges is coming unravelled and they balled up and have lint all over them.  I can't imagine what they will be like after the baby is born and I am actually using and washing them on a regular basis.  Definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND at all.  What a waste of money!
