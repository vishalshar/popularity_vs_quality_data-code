Smells like paint! I'm not sure why these products have so many positive reviews. I bought an LA baby pillowcase awhile ago and threw it away because it smelled like paint. Still, I figured with all the positive reviews I probably just washed it with something bad or got a bad one. I bought this mattress, mattress pad cover and a sheet from this company. Horrible decision. They all smell like paint. I had other people check it out too just to make sure I wasn't crazy. Such a bad smell I could smell it as I approached the product. Figured because it has some organic material it's a better option but not if the remaining material is so toxic!
