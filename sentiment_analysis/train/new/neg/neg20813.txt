I don't understand how this has such good reviews. I'm still pregnant and tried washing it once on the gentle cycle with Dreft detergent, and it looks like it's two years old now. It's coming apart in multiple places, has strings hanging off of it, the thread from the owl eyes is coming off. This is not worth the money. Please check the photos. PS Ths is my first review. Never before have I been so let down by a product.
