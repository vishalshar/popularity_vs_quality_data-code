I was thoroughly dissapointed with this sign. It was flimsy and it started to peel from the front on the first day I placed it on the window.Not good for tinted Windows (cannot be seen at all)And the suction cup also came off the sign which led to the sign falling and being lost.Overall very unsatisfied
