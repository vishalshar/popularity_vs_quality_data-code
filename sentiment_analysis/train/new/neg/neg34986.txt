The clamp that attaches to the stroller has rubber pads which compress a little when used, but not enough to keep the holder stable on round bars. A little weight or bump will tilt it if installed on round bars; actual use by a kid makes it a pretty haphazard thing to use. The cups themselves are disappointing too: The blue cup sits loosely in the shallow side so it's easy to knock out (or for the kid to take out) and its guard(?) pops off with any use whatsoever; the deeper cup for drinks has little flaps that, once shoved downwards (in use), pretty much stay down and therefore are useless. Maybe mine is just defective, but it's more than just one problem so I doubt it.However, if you have a stroller with square bars, ditch the blue cup thing (or at least the top unless it happens to work for you), and use cups that fit pretty snugly, it will work for you. I rate it at two stars because it is sturdy as well as easy/quick to put on and take off as a complete unit and in only removing the cups.
