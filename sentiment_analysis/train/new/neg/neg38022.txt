I bought the Philips Free Natural Drinking cup and the Muchkin Miracle 360 trainer Cup in the hope that these would work better than traditional sippy cups with the rubery spouts because my boy (20 months) has learned that he can chew on the spouts and get them to flow freely thus removing any spill prevention benefits.  The Muchkin is by far a better product.  The mechanism that the Philips uses is complex and feels funny to use.  You have to push rubber disc, thats kind of like a lid, down into the cup with your upper lip to get the liquid to flow. This makes it kind of uncomfortable to try and drink from but really easy for child to flip it over and push the lid in with their thumbs to get he liquid to flow out on whatever they are holding it over; as we quickly learned when with in seconds of giving the cup to our son he was pouring it out all over him and the carpet.  The Muchkin on the other works great; far better than the Philips or traditional sippy cups.  Its lid has two parts, a plastic lower cone/funnel shape peace that has little holes and channels for liquid to pass through and a rubbery cap that snaps tight against the plastic base that seals the holes and channels to prevent unwanted leaking.  To drink from the cup you hold it and drink like you would form any normal cup but with just adding a little suction similar to a straw or like how you would sip a hot drink like coffee or coco.  The liquid is pulled through the holes and channels under the rubbery cap and into your mouth and only your mouth.  For spill prevention it is awesome, we have used it and tossed it around everywhere even letting it roll around in the back seat of our car and no spills to date.  Plus my boy so has not been able to figure out how to make even a little liquid spill out.  The Muchkin 360 cups are the only non spill cups we use now.
