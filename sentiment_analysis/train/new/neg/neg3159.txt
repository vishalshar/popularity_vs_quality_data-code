Overview: Unfortunately, I don't think this product lives up to the hype and 5 star reviews for a $19.99 baby toy. It's a plastic rattle the same as all of the other ones that are around $5, except this one lights up, too. The one I received from Amazon seemed defective because I would have to knock the rattle up against something to get it to change color. I emailed the company and they sent another, so they do have great customer service. The replacement still takes a little more effort to make the color change than I would like. It's not like you just shake the rattle and it changes color; you have to really fling it (not ideal when you're playing with the toy in front of your baby's face).Pros: The smiley face is cute. The rattle really does keep baby's attention, and so it is good for tracking. It's easy for a baby to hold the middle part. The mirror is an actual mirror, not a fun house mirror like most baby toys.Cons: Too much effort to change the light color. Too expensive compared to similar toys. Some might consider this a positive: it comes with a little booklet with infant milestones by age and how to use the toy for each milestone. It seems pretty gimmicky to me and contributes to how they justify the price tag.Would I recommend: No, if you have other, cheaper toys that keep your baby's attention well enough. However, last night I did play with this for maybe a solid 10 minutes with my 9 week old tracking the toy the whole time. So I guess we're keeping it.
