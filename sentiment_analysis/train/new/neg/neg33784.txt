This seems to be a high quality basket and is aesthetically pleasing, but it's huge.  I realized it is large enough to fit a few bottles of shampoo, lotion, diapers, wipes, wash clothes, etc... Really all you need in a diaper caddy is space for diapers, wipes, and a tube of diaper cream.  This is better served stationary to store a bunch of items instead of lugging it around the house.  The handle folds down which is nice for storing, but it actually becomes a bit unsteady when the basket is full.  I use my less expensive Eddie Bauer diaper caddy from Target instead.
