I love Tiny Love products.But this item is totally a disappointment.The tap feature does not work.There's a seperate small cheap Chinese device in the middle of the product. I've plugged it out and tried to figure out how it works. But in order to make it work you have to hit it hard (I mean very hard). And It does not work when you put that device into the toy.In order to make it operate, you have to  bang it very hard to the ground..
