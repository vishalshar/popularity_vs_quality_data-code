These towels are super-cute but the material is pretty thin. I thought they would be more plush for the price.Although we are using them and the kids love them. There is no way I'd spend $20-$25 on these towels again (we got the Owl towel too).The quality is that of a $10-15 priced towel at Target or Wal-Mart.If you want a cute boutique type towel, I would look for something locally. We have a couple of really cute and plush towels that have been given to us as gifts. They couldn't have been more than $20-$25.
