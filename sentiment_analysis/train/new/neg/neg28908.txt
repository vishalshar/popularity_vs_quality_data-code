So we bought this couch for our 3 little boys(1, 2 and 6 years old) and it looks exactly as it does in this picture. It only gets 3 stars because we expected it to be better quality for the price... I mean it costed a quarter of what our full sized brand new couch did.  The back is about 1 and a half inches thick (I thought it would be something more like the Disney Mickey Mouse upholstered chair that we own), the drawer is very difficult to open for children and adults alike.  Also it wobbles terribly because one of the boards on the left side(where the feet are attached) was put on crooked on the underneath part of the couch.  I did have some washers laying around and unscrewed the foot and put 4 washers on it.  The wobble is much less now but my husband and I still think that we should not have had to do this to brand new item.  We were really going to send it back but the kids love it so much.  A few positive things: that it is very easy to clean, we had a milk mess all over it the first day and a wet cloth took care of it in half a minute and it is modern looking.
