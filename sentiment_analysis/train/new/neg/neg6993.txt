This is the second model I have purchased and am sorry that I wasted my money.  Although the multiple camera and recording capability is what sold me, after LESS THAN A YEAR of having this video monitor, the parent unit won't charge when plugged in, unless I manipulate the cord.  I have 4 cameras and have tried to even switch out the cords, and now I just have to listen to the battery dying, unless I tape it in to charge the unit.We took a chance and bought another unit, because we had all the cameras, after the parent failed to "connect" after less than a year of ownership.  THIS time its been 9 months and it fails to charge.In addition, the obnoxious vibrating alert (better alternative to the sound alert), poor temperature gage (it always says its about 82* or MORE in my children's rooms) and short battery life (must be plugged in overnight) is just a few other reasons why I would not recommend this product.The only thing that really sold me on it was being able to record and save video to share with family.
