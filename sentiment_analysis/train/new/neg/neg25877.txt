the glider arrived barely functional.  The music is way too loud and the motor on the glider barely moved.  I contacted Graco and they offered to send me a new motor.  That would have been great but it was on back order and would take up to 2 months to arrive.  By that time my daughter will be too big for the swing.  In reading other reviews it seems like this is a very common issue with the product.  Don't waste your time/money.
