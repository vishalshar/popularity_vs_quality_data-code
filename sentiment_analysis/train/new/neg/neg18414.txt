I love this toy box. I ordered it for my kids' room.I saw where some said that it was bigger than they imagined, and honestly, i expected it to be bigger than it was. I ordered a second one to go at the foot of each my girl's beds to make sure there was plenty of room for their toys.The picture makes the toy box look soft and fuzzy, and vibrant in color.In reality, it is very rough in texture (like a tarp?) and the color is duller.I still love this toy box despite it not holding up to my expectations. It is the cheapest i found for this quality, size, and style.My girls love them, and they dont hurt themselves on it.I would recommend it still.UPDATED: Sept 2013I have had these toy boxes for a little while now, and I feel I should mention that they are both "bent" in the carboard on the inside of the box and it doesn't look very pretty. There isn't really a way to fix it, so i suppose I am stuck with it looking like that.
