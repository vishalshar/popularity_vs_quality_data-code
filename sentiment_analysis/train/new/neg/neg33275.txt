The final product is great for our small home and small baby. Our baby is in the 1 percentile for his age so I was looking specifically for a smaller high chair. However, this rating gets only 3 stars because there was a faulty screw and bolt that did not work. We called the number and emailed the email address that came with the instructions (and specifically said to contact them if we received any damaged product) and both the phone number and email address did not work. I had to go to Home Depot to find a similar bolt, pay them, and have it look a different color than all the other bolts, but I was able to finally assemble it.
