My husband, my in-laws, and I have all bought several pairs of these products (same brand and type) from one of the "big box stores" and the one that came from this "box store" have been working absolutely FINE, which is why I read past the negative reviews and purchased this product anyway. Well let me say this can not be the same product! Maybe they are selling a bad batch on Amazon, I don't know, but I am having so much trouble opening these locks! They simply do not seem to run across the "tread" the same way; they even sound different when opening and closing. At one point I thought I was going to have to have my husband cut the lock off the cabinet for me. I would not buy these locks from Amazon.
