I love the pattern but this feels a little cheaper than the other jersey knit and plain crib sheets that I bought.  A little stiffer and more "card boardy"  I've only washed it once so it may soften with time.  It does fit perfectly around our mattress and has elastic all the way around which is what is recommended for cribs.
