I bought this jogging stroller because I trust the Baby Trend name.  I have owned two regular strollers (a single, and the sit-n-stand) made by the same manufacturer, and have been very happy with them.  This jogging stroller was priced on the low end of the spectrum, and was doable for my budget.  As they say- you get what you pay for.It is a sturdy stroller.  It handles bumps well, and running 25+ miles/week with this thing, my kids have been bumped around a lot!  There is a basket underneath, which is WONDERFUL when packing snacks and juice boxes for long runs.  The front wheel does not swivel, which makes it a smoother ride for the kids while I'm running.  However, when we have to turn corners and we're not moving quickly, it is VERY heavy to try to push down on the handlebar to raise the front wheel and turn the stroller.The seats don't adjust to a fully upright position, which drives my children nuts- especially my 22 month old son- who wants to see all the cars that pass.  He constantly struggles to sit all the way forward.My children were 36 months and 14 months when I bought this stroller, and we've had it for 8 months now.  I plan on replacing it this next year with a much lighter model, since my kids aren't getting any lighter!A good friend of mine has a $400 double jogging stroller, and she's had it for 4 years- still uses it.  When you figure this $180 model will last me only a year, and I'll be upgrading to a more expensive one, I'd say it would've been a wiser investment to just get the nicer one in the first place.I recommend this stroller, though, for someone who needs a jogging stroller and can't afford the nicer models.  It serves its purpose.  And, to be honest, I think having to push a heavy stroller has made me a stronger runner.
