We bought this swing before I had my baby and we put her on it when she was 3 days old,but it would swing her so fast we did not use it for the longest. She is now 3 months old and doesn't really like it yet, she doesn't mind sitting in it for a little bit, but when she is on it for a while she starts to fuss. Something about the bird she does not like. She cries everytime she sees it, so we always turn his face away. She loves looking at the lights, but espcially loves watching the left bar with all of the different colors. Over all, its a pretty neat swing. I would of prefer the Aquariam Fisher Price though.
