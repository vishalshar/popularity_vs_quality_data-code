The first order came with a broken arm rest support. Amazon's great customer service sent a replacement promptly.The instructions to attach the back support to the bottom base was straightforward (pretty much flip the chair upside down and drill 4 screws).The instructions were awful for:1) Attaching the left and right hand crank(?). It was in a separate piece of paper with very cryptic instructions on what "left" meant and what "right" meant. The drawing of the chair was awful - was the picture of the chair facing front? or back?I put the left hand crank on the right side accidentally. The only way I figured out this was wrong was when I zoomed in on the picture on Amazon.com and realized my mistake.2) The instructions to attached the ottoman was OK.. but it came with 8 screws!!! 4 screws attached to the ottoman base and 4 screws in plastic attached to the base's wooden support.. which am  i supposed to use? considering the ottoman cushion has 11 holes!!! ( 4 on each side (8 total) and 3 in the middle for a total of 11) but the wooden base only has 4 holes (on 2 each side)Anyway, regardless of the messed up left and right cranks, the product looks nice and is comfy.Suggestion to the manufacturer:Make a simple assembly video and put it on video and provide the link with the packaging! This way everyone can view the video online.
