this product was true to other reviews i read about it is good because you dont need batteries, and its relatively quiet, and smaller than other entertainers, but our son got bored with it fast.  he never really did use the bouncing feature as it really doesnt give much bounce! he did enjoy being upright and the seat supported him well.  and it was difficult to put together, not technically but physically !!! those toys snapped into place with great force applied. and if you want to take it apart, forget about it!!! i was initially happy the seat was made of cloth and machine washable, but i never could get it off the toy to wash it, so just wiped it down often. he did have some good times in it though.
