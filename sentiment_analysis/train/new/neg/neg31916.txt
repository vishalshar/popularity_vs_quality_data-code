This is not a bad monitor, it just has one major flaw. When we were looking for monitor, I wanted a good picture, a panning camera and a unit that was well built and would last. This unit has 2 out of the 3 criteria. The picture is better than most of the baby monitors I have seen. It is clear and easy to see your child sleeping in their crib. It shows you the air temp in the room which is nice feature. It also has the feature to allows you to talk to your child through the head unit. This has come in handy a few times. I have never run out of range on this unit, but it will get interference from other devices using the same frequency. The panning camera is a very nice feature as our child moves all over the crib at night. We can just move the camera and never have to worry about him being out of the camera's view. So what is the major flaw with this monitor? We have had to purchase 3 of these units because they keep breaking!  They always break at the same spot. The socket that accepts the power plug on the monitor comes loose and won't let you recharge the unit. Sometimes if you hold it just right, you can get it to charge, but don't let go! I got so tired of these units breaking that when our current one breaks again I will not buy another Motorola!! Good monitor, but doesn't last.
