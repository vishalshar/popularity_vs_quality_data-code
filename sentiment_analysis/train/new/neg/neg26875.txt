I wasn't expecting much for the price and you get what little you pay for. I do like the fact that there is a little memo section on each page to write something in for each picture. But I am mainly disappointed with the fact that the"b a b y" on the cover was glued on crooked, so it makes it look even more cheap. Not worth paying the shipping to return it though.
