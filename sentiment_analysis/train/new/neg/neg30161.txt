Beautiful but so SO small. I will TRY using this for my newborn, but even then I think it will be a bit small to he practical.It's zero help with my toddler. I had planned to slid this under her while she sleeps if she is wearing underwear on my bed or couch at nap time. Just as added protection between her and the furniture. She's only 25lbs abd very very petite and this WILL fit under her bum, but I don't think it's large enough to contain any accident she might have. Especially if she happens to move at ALL in her sleep.I may throw it in the carseat as a waterproof barrier there. Really love the print, so I want to make this work for me. But in my experience mattress pads (especially from cloth diaper retailers) are a much more practical  (larger) size and I should have read the description closer before ordering this one. It's just not very useful for much of anything.
