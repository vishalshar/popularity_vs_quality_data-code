Spent $12 on this piece of crap.  The first time i used it, it split at the seems.  It is so lightweight.  It does not cover the entire stroller like it looks in the picture.  I remember I bought one years ago for my first baby.  That was a good quality rain canopy.  It was heavy-weight and covered the ENTIRE stroller.  This canopy is only good if the rain is more like a mist.  If it is raining or torrential downpouring your poor little one is going to get wet on the sides.  So mad that I wasted money off a gift card to purchase this item.  I'm going to One Step Ahead to purchase a good quality canopy, and you should too.
