If you pump around the clock and plan to change the valves out routinely on a monthly basis, these should be fine. However, if you plan to use these valves for as long as the valves still hold suction, I would recommend purchasing the Ameda valves instead. However, I did not do a cost/benefit analysis to see if the Maymom valves gave me a better bang for my buck than the Ameda since I have already forgotten the price of the valves and would have a difficult time tracking how long I've used each valve for.
