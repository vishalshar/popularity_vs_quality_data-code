The stroller is fine. Is heavy but that for us is not a big concern. It does have a FATAL flaw (see pic). The front wheel will lock in its own after about 5 mins of unlocking and walking with the stroller. This means you can't turn it and therefore can't use it. Is that simple. I have already contacted graco and got a brand new replacement. Put it together took it out for a stroll. BRAND NEW and within 5 mins of walking wheel locks and can't turn the darn thing. Wish we had never bought it.
