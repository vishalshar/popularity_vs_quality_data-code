This toy is an overall great toy to purchase for the infant learning stage; however the clear sorting blocks that come with it are tripping hazards for parents. It comes with 3 soft blocks, 4 colored hard ones, and then 3 clear rattle blocks. The rattle blocks are very difficult to see if your child doesn't always put them back and I've tripped many times. Additionally, the velcro latch doesn't hold the 'roof' down so the blocks fall out if the house is knocked over (causing the tripping hazards).  Otherwise it is a great product and great to travel with.
