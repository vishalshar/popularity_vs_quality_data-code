I really liked the pattern on this chair but I never would have bought it had I seen it in person first.Pros:- Cute gender-neutral pattern- Easy to assemble- Tray cover makes clean up a bit easier- The "horn" that sits between child's legs helps prevent child from sliding out while being strapped in or snapping on trayCons:- It seems to take up more floor space than the average high chair- Construction is wobbly and not super-sturdy (but it is made from plastic and aluminum, so duh)- Tray has to be completely removed to remove child from seatI got this chair for around $65 - much less than the retail price - and I still think that was a little too much.
