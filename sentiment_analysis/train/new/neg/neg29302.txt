This is a seriously good quality seat. It's sturdy, comfortable, and well built. It seems like it will last forever. It is every thing a car seat should be, except easy to clean.My daughter gets carsick. Often. You know the frustration of pulling a new toy out of the box and having to put it together with cryptic directions? Every time something is spilled, or your child pukes, you will be forced to take the entire seat apart in order to wash it, and then put it all back together. After the third or fourth time, you start to get good at it, and the process only takes a half hour or so...not counting the time spent with the cover in the washer, which they don't recommend. I wash it on the delicate setting, and it comes out fine.To further explain why this is so frustrating and difficult, let me elaborate. The seat cover and fittings are well designed to fit snugly. Parts only go into proper location in one way, and that way usually requires very small, but strong hands. I have large strong hands. My wife has medium sized, strong hands. Consequently, the holes that the buckles are supposed to go through have been "stretched" (ripped). Another point: when mess works it's way downward, as gravity tends to direct it, it finds several holes in the cover and gets embedded in the hinge contraption. This is very difficult to clean. Again, you have to take the entire cover off, which requires a complete disassembly of the buckles. Also, the cover is held on partly by velcro, partly by hooks, partly by snaps, and partly by pins. The pins will break. But that's ok, you won't care because you will be so frustrated by the damn thing. (Remember, you are trying to take it all apart while it's covered in this morning's breakfast. The smell is getting to you.) If you really love your wife, you will volunteer to clean the seat and let her take the baby, because a crying, screaming, squirming, puke covered baby is infinitely easier to deal with.
