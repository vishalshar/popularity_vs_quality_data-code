After returning the Organic pads that piled after their first wash, I ordered these.  UNBELIEVABLY they did the SAME thing?!  As always, Amazon shipped them in lightening speed, I threw them in the wash to start using them immediately, when to my surprise they piled and frayed in the wash.  I returned them promptly for a refund.  If I had anything positive to say it would be that the size is generous.  However, the polyester-nylon-type material wouldn't have been soft on my baby's bum even IF they would have held up to a washing machine.
