I did a lot of research on baby monitors before my LO was born.  I was looking for a sound monitor that had a very good distance range as I want to be able to go outside and work in my flower gardens and still know if my baby is awake and crying.  This monitor is listed at 1000 feet.  So I bought it.  BUT after plugging it in and trying it for the first time last weekend...I can tell you that the 1000 feet distance is an out and out LIE!!!!  It barely covers my single floor 2500 sq ft home.  And when I walked right out my front door...it started beeping telling me it was out of range.  Stupid!  I counted my steps from baby monitor unit to my front door and it was only about 35 steps.  I then tested it going out onto my back porch...and I got 2 feet into my back yard and again the out of range beeping started.  This unit has some nice features (lullaby's, temp, humidity, etc.) but the Range sucks!  And since that was the main reason I purchased it...I am sending it back ASAP.
