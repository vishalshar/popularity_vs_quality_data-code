Over all I like the design of this product. The 2 plastic sides work well to protect the camera. Having said that, I bought this for my Coolpix S9300 which it stated that it should fit this camera, but it doesn't. You have to force the zipper to close and the stitching gets stretched trying to close it. Sooner or later you know it will eventually tear.
