Over the years, I have purchased DOZENS of items from Amazon.com, but this is the very first time I have been inclined to write a review on one of the products I bought.  The Octotunes Toy is NOT for babies.  I bought it for my 6 month old daugther because her father is a musician and I thought I could start her learning about music early.  Yes babies might like the softness of the toy, and the bright colors, but if you think your baby will be making music with this thing, you are WRONG.  My husband and I both had difficulty making the tentacles BARELY squeak... and even if we did, we could hardly hear it. There is no way a baby or even a toddler could do it.  If you are looking for a MUSICAL toy for your baby, this is NOT for you! Not worth the money!!
