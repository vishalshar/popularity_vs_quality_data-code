It's a good idea -- a Bumbo with a seatbelt for wigglier babies, that can also convert to a high chair.Would be great if it actually worked.Bought two for our twins. One, the round cap fell off as we removed it from the box before first use, leaving behind sharp pieces of plastic and metal poking up. Round cap won't go back on, tray won't go on. It's garbage now -- I feel really cheated.The second one did not break out of the box, but the round cap keeps coming off when our little girl squirms. Where it comes off,  little metal and plastic bits poking up. Did the people who designed this even have kids?
