Its as advertised - but the flaws in the product design become evident after one starts using it. I have a 9 month old hyper active twins.Here are the flaws I found1. Only 2 universal wheels - the back wheels are not universal.. Because of this - the walker tilts over when my son tries to take a hard left / right2. The harness / buttons to fasten the seat to the frame - are very flimsy and difficult to insert.3. The 'stoppers' on the sides (at the wheel level) are completely useless - my daughter gets he toes hurt a couple of times in them.
