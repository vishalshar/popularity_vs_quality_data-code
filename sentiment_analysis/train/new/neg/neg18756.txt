Amazon, PLEASE change the name of your product description to ADEN BY ADEN + ANAIS, because these are NOT original Aden + Anais. Original Aden + Anais are much softer and bigger than these muslin swaddles. I'll be keeping them because they are still useful, but definitely not as good quality wise as original Aden + Anais. I feel very misled and would not have purchased these swaddles if I knew they were the cheaper and lower quality of the brand.
