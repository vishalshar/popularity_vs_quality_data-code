I specifically purchased this sippy cup because it was labeled on this website as Made in USA, which did not surprise me at the time because many of Dr. Brown's / Handicraft's products are produced in the USA.  However, when it arrived, the enclosed material very clearly states that it is made in China.  I cannot return it because my Nanny already took it apart & washed it.  It did not come in a box, but in a Ziploc-style bag with the information insert inside.  I expected more from Amazon, Dr. Brown's, and Handicraft. Obviously, I am disappointed.
