I purchased this stroller for my baby twins in early summer.  After using it for several months, this is my view of the features:PROS: - very lightweight, easy to fold and carry - the 5-pt. harness keeps children secure (some double strollers only have  3-pt. harnesses) - fits through most doorways easily; it accommodates two children comfortably yet is still narrower than double jogging strollers, etc. - the variable reclining position of the seats is truly variable: the seats adjust independently from fully reclined to almost completely upright - the sun visors above each seat are independent, so you can cover one baby more than the other if you need to (this is the ONLY double stroller that has this feature; all others have one big canopy).CONS: - cupholder on handle is worthless; fell off on the second day, doesn't stay secure - basket underneath drags, so you can't keep anything in it (plan on getting a stroller bag for the handles, or wearing a large backpack for baby gear) - the sun visors are too small, so unless your babies have on hats and lots of sunscreen, you don't want to take them for a stroll at midday in the sun - the wheels are small and get caught on bumps and cracks easily.  This is the perfect stroller for the mall and well-maintained sidewalks, but not good for parks, etc. - stickers labels come off easilyOverall, the biggest pluses are its super light weight and easy width.  I'm not sure I would purchase this again, however.  I also have a double jogging stroller which is very sturdy and great for parks and hiking up fire roads, AND I purchased another "mall" double stroller (GRACO) so I would have one with a functional basket underneath.
