Bumpers are out so to fill the gap and make this package seem more worthwhile, Skip Hop has included a sleep sack. Um, my babies are 9 mos. old and would not fit in that so I guess this bedding is for newborns only. I wish there was another way to buy the pieces separately. I really only the want the skirt/sheets/blanket.
