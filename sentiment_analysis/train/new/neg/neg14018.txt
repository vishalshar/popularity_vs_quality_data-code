I drank the tea and passed it on through nursing in hopes of helping my baby's digestive system as he seemed very uncomfortable much of the time and was unable to sleep for any significant period of time. The first night after trying this my baby slept 5 hours in a row!!! which had been unheard of- The next night: 6! But he soon reverted back to his up every hour to 2 hours throughout the night. However, the tea did seem to continue to help his belly and he was generally happier through the day.
