They are absolutely adorable and my daughter can't stop smiling at them, but they are peeling off of the wall immediately after being applied.  I have plaster walls, so they are not completely smooth, but I also have Circo decals from Target on another wall in her room that stick just find and don't peel at all.  Several of these Animal Decals have fallen to the ground and aren't sticky anymore, so I can't even attempt to use them elsewhere.  It's really too bad.Edit:  I contacted Wall Art Corner and told them about the peeling.  They sent another box to me and suggested pressing the sheets flat under heavy books before applying (good customer service).  I did just that.  I pressed them under a heavy box for a week.  They were still somewhat curled.  I applied the decals to the wall, and some decals do stick much better.  However, some parts that were on folds still curl a bit and a few of them fell off of the wall.  I do think someone should rethink the packaging and sheet layout so the letters aren't on folds.
