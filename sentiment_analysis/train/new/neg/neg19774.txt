I like the chair, and my son doesn't complain, but I think I was a bit spoiled by another Fisher Price bouncy seat that he outgrew. That seat had soft fabric and seemed very comfy. This chair has much stiffer fabric (read: cheaper)and rocks, but only a little. I haven't quite figured out the purpose of the kickstand (to recline and sleep perhaps?). It's also much higher off the ground, which makes my son seem really high up (but this is in comparison to the aforementioned bouncy seat).Yes, it's perfectly fine. Nothing to write home about, but perfectly fine.
