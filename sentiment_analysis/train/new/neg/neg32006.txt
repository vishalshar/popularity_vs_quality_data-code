I LOVED all the options that I had since I had a new born.. Car seat attachment that came with it was a PLUS!! (glad it wasnt extra $$ like other companies !!) .. and option to have the baby face me and with different angles for when he gets older GREAT!!... just one thing.. One month into using it wheels started squeeking .. try walking through store and all you hear is squeek squeek squeek (a little embarrasing) tried wd-40 no help.. but i lived with it.  Now 6 months into using it (for the most part only on weekends) the wheels are whobbling all over the place and rubbing onto the attachment that holds them.. not allowing me to turn or even go straight.. so fustrated .. I read a couple reviews that the wheels were a problem but decided i would see how it worked because i really liked the stroller.. I guess I should of taken others advise and listened to the reviews =( This stroller would be great if they fix the wheel issue!!
