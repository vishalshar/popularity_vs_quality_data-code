The pump I wanted to write about is the Double Select pump. I bought it last month ago and can't even find it listed anymore and as such am publishing my Medela review here. I just opened the box yesterday and turned it on. It is my 3rd Medela pump. I bought it because it looked like my first Medela pump (no longer manufactured), but I want to warn everyone. As much as I love Medela pumps, DO NOT WASTE your money on the Double Select. It has ZERO strength to it. I had to turn it on to MAX immediately and even then had to squeeze to get anything out. It has NO suction whatsoever. It is LOUD. For the noise it makes you'd think you'd get terrific suction, NOT the case!The pump itself only has low and high settings. Most of Medela's pumps offer two methods of adjusting the suction; which make them good products for new breastfeeders and those who are used to pumping daily.If you find yourself looking for a pump I'd recommend the Pump In Style or similar. Beware what you buy as once you've opened the box they can't be returned. The Double Select was a total waste of money down the drain, and I was appalled to get such a junky product from Medela.
