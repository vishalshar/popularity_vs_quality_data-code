We just received the crib and pulled everything out of the box.  The mattress pad is not 3 inches as indicated on the product description.  It's about 1 to 1 1/2 inches max.  I ordered this mini crib through this website specifically because the description said it was a 3 inch mattress pad.  Other mini cribs we found only had a 1 inch pad. We are very disappointed. Our baby is coming soon and have very little time to return this and find another mini crib with a better mattress.  Do not believe the information in the product description - it's wrong.  We haven't put the crib together yet, so I'm not sure how that is.  We don't know yet if we are keeping it or not.
