My daughter wanted a cute dinosuar baby bedding set and this was the only we could find that we liked.  The quilt is very cute but the rest of the set is not of the highest quality.  The bumper bad set seemed a bit small for the crib she bought.  We are going to have to pull it tight and it may gap a bit in the corner.  The diaper stacker is flimsy.  We were disappointed that there wasn't a mobile or a lamp to match this set.  We hung the quilt on the wall and it looks very cute.
