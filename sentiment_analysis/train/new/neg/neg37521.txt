Not impressed. With seat . I find for a small child this car seat is not accommodate them very well the padding is not enough they seem to slip side to side still with the adjustments and all the base is big and bulky it's hard to fit in a smaller vehicle due to the size of the car seat it does however sit well with a medium sized child but when the child is a talk on the taller side it is not fit them very properly I own a daycare and run it and I have all sizes of children find it easy to adjust but due to size limitations with it I only can use it on the mediums to the larger size children I would not recommend this for a infant from 5 pounds to at least 30.
