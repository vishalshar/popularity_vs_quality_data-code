These containers are awful.  They are very small, about the size of one ice cube.  They say that they are freezer safe, however, if you attempt to open a container that has been in the freezer, or move a lid that has been in the freezer, the lid breaks off.  They do not seal well, and are not safe to put in a bag without first wrapping in duct tape.  A terrible purchase.  After purchasing to sets of these, and one set of Vital Baby's 1st food pots, I just logged on today to purchase another set of vital baby's.  Those work wonderfully.
