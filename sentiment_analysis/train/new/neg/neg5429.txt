My sister-in-law has two of these (which she told me after I bought this that she got it much cheaper than I did) so I figured I would get one too. I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on a nursing cover.CONS:Since the neck part doesn't go end to end, it flaps under and over and basically cuts the "cover" aspect in halfThe neck isn't stiff enough to hold it open to see my daughterPROS:Cheaper than other coversPretty printCovers SOMETHING at leastMy daughter is 2 months old and we've only used it twice (I try and plan around feedings), so maybe I just need to practice with it more, but overall I'm not happy with it. I would suggest spending the extra money and getting a better brand. I'll continue to try and use this one because I've already paid for it and I can't afford to just be buying all kinds of covers.
