I don't recommend these at all.  They are very cheap, a basic piece of flannel that is sewed loosely around the edges.  The look "crinkled" with one washing, and one wet burp soaks through the rag AND your shirt.  I'd recommend using Aiden & Anais burpy bibs or a nicer cloth diaper insert instead.  I wish I had spent more money initially for the better quality burp rags instead of wasting money on these.  Some things don't pay to buy the cheaper version!!
