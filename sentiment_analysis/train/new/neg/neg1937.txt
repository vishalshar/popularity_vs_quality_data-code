I used those with inserts, flats and prefolds and my babies are always a little chubbier on the belly, which leaves a huge gap around the legs - no matter which insert or how foldedThe only cover that really gives my kids a good fit plus fits from newborn to potty training are best bottoms diapers. (I tried everything from rumparooz, bumgenius, flip, thirsties etc)I still have those in my stash but I don't love them. They are good quality though and very affordable, but like I said don't fit well.I have snap ones and hook and loop and they seem to fit better with the snaps, so I can close the bottom one closer to the middle so it is tighter around the legs but I can never get that far that it would be completely snug because it automatically gets too tight on the belly then.I have the imagine one size diaper covers as well and they seem to fit my baby (10 lbs) now and used to fit my toddler. Can not complain about those. They were to big on my newborn though.my tip is: try different brands, every baby is different, so they might work for you.
