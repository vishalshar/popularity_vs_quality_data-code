I bought this to use as a breastfeeding support pillow, and even brought it to the hospital with me.  The lactation consult told me, flat out, that I had wasted my money, and that it was useless.  I used it a lot in the hospital as I recovered from my c-section, though, to support my incision and also to lean on.Once we got home, we found that it was quite useful for bottle feeding, as well as for propping the baby up, now that he is older.  It's a nice thing to have, especially for tired arms, but not the breastfeeding essential I thought it would be.The slipcover is cute, but very flimsy.  I ripped a huge hole in it when taking the tag off, and when I went to wash it, it practically fell apart in the wash.  We purchased another Boppy cover in a soft, thicker fabric from Amazon, and that has gotten a lot more use.
