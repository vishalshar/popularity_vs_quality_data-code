I shouldn't have expected much from this product, but my hopes were too high. The milk was barely lukewarm after 20 minutes, so I guess it would work in an emergency if you had absolutely no other way to warm the milk, but if you can, just boil water to warm a bottle. Shortly after buying this bottle warmer to use in the car during long drives, we discovered that our baby actually didn't mind cold milk, so we only used this a couple of times.But hey, it could double as a hand warmer! Seriously, we actually have hand warmers that work exactly like this.
