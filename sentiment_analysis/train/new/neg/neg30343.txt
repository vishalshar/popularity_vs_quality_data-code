This product was very well rated and seemed to be a quality item; however, it did not work at all for our 3yo. The thumb holes were too long and frustrated our child as he could not eat or play with it on (could not grasp). We cut down the tubing as suggested on the website, which helped a bit but not much.He also resorted to chewing on the tubing, making pit-marks and slivers that could be swallowed--not just by him but also our infant if pieces fell on the floor.Finally, the guard just did not fit well enough. Both my husband and I read and watched the DVD directions, but it did not fit properly. We found the setting just before "too tight," but he was then able to take them off; on the flip side, the next notch was DEFINITELY too tight, as it left multiple lacerations on both hands--no in between setting, so it either injured or was wiggled off.Both my husband and I tried MANY times each over the period of a week to make this product useful, but it was to no avail. I am disappointed the product did not work for us, but even more so at the cost (this was a big purchase for us) and highly advertised success.
