PROS:- It's stand alone, doesn't need to be mounted.- Big wide area for toddler to urinate.- Height adjustable.- Fairly easy to empty.- Tank of water to flush/clean.CONS:- Not as stable when not mounted.- The flush mechanic is just a button that when pressed, releases water from the tank above. So my boy is able to just hold the button and the water just flushes till its empty.- The seal on the flush tank drips. So the flush tank only lasts 20 minutes until its empty. (Not sure if its just a defect on my particular unit)- Some water gets stuck inside the bottom of the unit, beneath the bottom tank, especially when you clean it, since the top leaks.Overall, it is okay. Maybe I got a defective unit. It still works as a pretty good urinal even though in my situation I won't fill the tank to use the flushing since it leaks. If this problem can be fixed it would receive 5 stars.
