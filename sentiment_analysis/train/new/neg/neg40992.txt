I was expecting a piano, so my then-8 month old can learn cause and effect. But the keys aren't separate- it's one big block of cushion. And when you push the keys, music plays- and I really wanted something that just made one sound, like a regular keyboard/piano. Not a bad toy - he likes it, but also not what i was looking for.
