I really wish I'd seen the reviews for this product before I bought it.  If you're thinking about buying this, DON'T!  I was looking for adhesive non slip bathtub things like we had when I was a kid and these are nothing like those.  the ones we had when I was a kid, you darn near had to take a straight razor to them to get them off the tub but these came up in the first bath.  I had one stuck to my 9 month old daughter's [...].  Terrible product, a waste of money and unsafe for your children.THIS IS ABSOLUTE CRAP!!!
