These are very necessary if you wish to keep the straps on your Boba 4G clean from a chewing baby, however, they soil in a day or so and must be line dried and they are very thick, hence, the drying can take over a day. This might not be a problem for the average person though it is a problem for us because I constantly wear my daughter in her 4G carrier and thus when these are being washed/dryed we have no protection against her chewing on the straps. I would purchase another pair to avoid such situation but at $20, and already $155 into this Boba 4G investment, I just don't want to. So, they work well, yes, though they are difficult to clean.
