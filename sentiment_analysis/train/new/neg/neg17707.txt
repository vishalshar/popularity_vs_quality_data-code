These are cheaper than the Medela bags by a little, and they work well enough, but there are two main downsides: #1: like others have said, the steam spout is too small, so it takes forever to drain the water.  I'm okay with that, since I usually just dump the contents of the whole bag into my dish drainer anyway.  But this leads to problem #2: because the steam spout is too small, the bag sometimes pops (and I do mean pops) open in the microwave.  As in, it explodes.  I had sealed it well, but the steam spout was nearly folded over onto itself so there was no way for the steam to escape.I got these because I needed them right away but next time I'll probably just run to Target and get a $5 box of Medela bags instead.
