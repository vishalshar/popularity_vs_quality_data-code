My baby hated being swaddled so I thought I'd purchased this because it looked like something that would keep her nice and tight, but she could still move around. We'll she was able to move her arms around so much that the fabric was going all the way up her nose. So scary! I had to go back to my normal sacks because I couldn't sleep a night. I constantly had to check on her to make sure the fabric would not keep going up coveting her nose
