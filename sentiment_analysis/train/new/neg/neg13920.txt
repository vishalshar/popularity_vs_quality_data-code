I thought these would be great for my 5-month old to catch all the dripped food since she's new to solids. These bibs are GIGANTIC and are really meant for toddlers.  It hangs down below the highchair tray, and it's too long to use it in the Bumbo.  I don't hate the product, it's just not the way I thought it would be and I will have to wait and use them later.
