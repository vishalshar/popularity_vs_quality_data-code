Love the snaps, absorbency and length. You still have to watch the little ones sleeves but it's far superior to other bibs. It is kind of pricey so if you find a sale get a couple. Great shower gift. Update 05/05/14:  Have to remove two stars because the back came off of the top snap. Since I wash on gentle, cold cycle only and usually line dry I am disappointed. I babysit once or twice a week and it's not the only bib I use.
