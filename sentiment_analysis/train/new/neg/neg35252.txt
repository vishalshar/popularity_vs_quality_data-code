Where do all these good reviews are coming from?I bought this all excited it ...and here it is... Standing in the corner of my basement gathering dust.It is super uncomfortable to carry with you anywhere. The top doesnt close. It is like a box. No zipper or clips or buttons. It closes like a box. The shape of it is hurting your legs when you hold it....And it's just...so bulky.Would never buy it again.
