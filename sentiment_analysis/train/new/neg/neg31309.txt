This container is just WAY too big for a child's lunch. Unless you're going to carry it by itself, which I wouldn't recommend bc the lid is iffy, you have to buy a special lunch bag to put it in. This didn't fit in either of my kids' lunch sacks and the bags we have aren't small. There is a "handle" on the side which doesn't actually seem usable, just a way to prevent you putting it in a regular sized lunch sack. SUPER LAME!! So now I have 2 which we don't use....
