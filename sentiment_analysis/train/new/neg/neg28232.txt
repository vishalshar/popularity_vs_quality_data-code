Really nice cover if it fit the bottle I intended it for.  I tried really hard to cram the bottle in there but couldn't make it work. Unfortunately this seller requires a $3 restocking fee and you have to pay return shipping, so not worth returning.  I will see if I have anything else it will fit on, but I am disappointed that this vendor requires the restocking fee which just seems ridiculous for such a small product.  also, since this shows up as a "related product" for the CamelBak .4 liter kids bottle, I just wanted to make sure others didn't make the same mistake I did.
