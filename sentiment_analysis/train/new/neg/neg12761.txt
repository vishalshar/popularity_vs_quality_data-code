These locks are great for cabinets that you don't need to get into very often.  I love the flexible arms because they can go around any size knob. We had problems with C-locks because the knobs on our cabinets are too close together - c-locks don't work, but these do.  The only problem is these locks are very difficult to open.  You cannot open them with one hand.
