I don't know whether it was the product or the seller but this product didn't work for me. I followed the instructions to try to remove a pee stain in a mattress and there was no difference after two applications on two different days. Fine, I hoped it would work but when it didn't I wasn't suprised. However, I  pretreated a pair of fresh poo stained underwear and the pair remained stained after the wash cycle, again I followed the instructions. Isn't that the purpose of this cleaner?The product was nicely packed. The scent of the cleaner was pleasant to me.
