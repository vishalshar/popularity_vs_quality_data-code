it is a very good stroller and i really love my joovy ultralight caboose BUT i was really looking for a lightweight stroller in the maclaren line (with intact fingers). i bought it influenced unduly by that prior caboose purchase and how much i love the caboose and all the rave kooper reviews. i should have taken note of its weight (18lb, the same as my ultralight caboose). it is still something i use and think is very wellmade and my child is comfortable/safe/supported in it, but i would not have bought it if i had lifted it up prior to purchace as it is significantly heavy. if they made an ultralight kooper i would probably buy it
