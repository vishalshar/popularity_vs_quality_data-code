I found that this was just more than I was looking for with a newborn. There were too many things to adjust and my baby just did not like being in it. I found it very hot as well. Maybe I could have figured out all the bells and whistles but between a crying newborn and new mom brain, I didn't have the time or energy. I returned this item.
