I am sure the Maclaren Easy Traveller is everything everyone says it is. I myself have a Quest for my 2 year old & couldn't be happier. That is why I purchased to Easy Traveller for my baby on the way. I thought how could I go wrong?I read all the wonderful reviews and knew I'd love it too. Except for the fact that no one has mentioned its size. It is HUGE. I was only assuming it'd be the size of my Quest & I could use stroller adaptors to connect the two if need be. That definitely isn't happening. I am still shocked by its size. I am so sad to send it back for a refund. Its size just isn't for me. Just to descibe a little more for the people who expect it to be Quest-sized, it is about as wide as a Graco Quattro Tour & very tall.I just figured I'd take the time to share my opinion as I really appreciated everyone else's while I was on my search.
