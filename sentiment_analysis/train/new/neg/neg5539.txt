I bought this item thinking that my 5mo old daughter would enjoy this, but she did not touch the floor and there is no height adjustments except for the seat, but it is only if your baby is getting bigger.  She hated the fact that she could not touch the ground.  I know that she is tall enough to use walkers and activity centers because she is in them all day at daycare.  The mini maesro is wonderful and she loved when I would hit them and she would play with them.  So I believe that this is a great toy for baby's that are longer or for maybe 7 mo's and up.  (my baby is in the 50th % in height.)Just my opinion.Erica
