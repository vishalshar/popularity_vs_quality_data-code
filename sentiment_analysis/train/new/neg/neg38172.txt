These are no where near the same quality as the Playtex VentAire Wide Bottle. I thought they were at least in the same family but I was completely wrong. The universal nipples that Playtex makes for all their bottles do not fit on these bottles. Also there are no meterings on the side so there's no way to know how much milk is in the bottle. These were so far from what we wanted we didn't even use them and ended up donating them to charity.However, you don't have to look too far to find the perfect bottle and they are somewhat related. The Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set is exactly what you want. They are so good in fact we went back and bought another set.ALSO BUYER BEWARE EVEN THOUGH WE NEVER USED THESE BOTTLES AMAZON WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO RETURN THEM!
