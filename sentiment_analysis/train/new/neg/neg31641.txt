As far as 'doing its job' goes, I find that the sterilizer is just fine.  However, we are using the Dr. Brown's bottles and have found that the 8 oz. bottles are too tall for the unit!  (A very frustrating situation).  The 4 oz. bottles are just fine.  When we sterilize a load containing the 8 oz bottles, we cannot use the top rack where you are supposed to place all of the other bottle parts.  We have to just place the cover on and do the parts in a separate load.  If the sterilizer was only about 1/4 inch taller there would be no problem at all.I've seen a few people writing about getting brown deposits on the hot plate.....As far as brown deposits go- this may be caused by iron in your water supply.  You might want to check with your town if you have public drinking water to see what the iron content is.  Could be coming from iron pipes/ water mains as well.  Not a health hazard, just a NUISANCE!
