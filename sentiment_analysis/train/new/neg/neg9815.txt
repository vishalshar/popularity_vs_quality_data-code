My son is in the 50th percentile for height and the tenth for weight. This bracelet which he has been wearing in his ankle falls off often. It falls of his ankle right over his foot  which may be caused by his size but more concerning is that many times the clasp has actually just unscrewed itself. This is definitely not caused by the size of his foot or ankle.I do see benefit to the amber itself so I typically have him wear it when he is being supervised closely, under his pajamas when he is in the sleep sack or under a pair of socks.
