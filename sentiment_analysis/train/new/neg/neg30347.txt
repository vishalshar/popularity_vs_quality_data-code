When I purchased the diaper bag, there was only one other review and it was for one star.  I thought that maybe that was just one person's opinion and I may like the bag.  As soon as I received the bag, I decided to return it.  The bag looks cheaply made.  Especially the handles and parts of the bag made out of the same material as the handles.  They were a cheap plastic that did not look as though they would wear well or last long.  The handles made the whole bag look poorly made, when in reality the material that the rest of the bag is made of is probably fine.  The bag looks cute in pictures but looks like dollar store quality in real life.
