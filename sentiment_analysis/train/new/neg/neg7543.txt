Cute. Probably the best tub on market for its price range and lack of toxicity. However, the shape is a bit awkard for putting baby in. Wish they could design it so that baby could practically sit in it without being held much like the blue first tub one people love, but this company says they don't have bpa and other chemicals in the plastic, which was my main concern. Easy to wash and hang. Wish it came with two cups to put inside those cup holders, that I could use for wash and rinse.
