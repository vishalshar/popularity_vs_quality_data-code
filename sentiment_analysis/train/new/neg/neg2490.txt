I have since purchased this aspirator as well as the "Baby Comfy Nose."  I only got the second one because I lost the tube to this one and the Comfy Nose was what they had at my local drug store.NoseFrida:  Effective but my baby has HATED it since day one.  The ads and videos typically show the baby laying in your lap in front of you, most of the babies are calm.  My baby wouldn't have this, and always struggled.  I'm guessing that would be the case with most kids. The straight design on the NoseFrida is a little difficult to use with a struggling baby. The filters are small and the first one went missing quickly.  My new pack went missing also and I would frequently forget to buy more although the mucous rarely went that far up the tube to worry about it (for those of you who are afraid of getting it in your mouth!).  Overall, it worked well but...I liked Baby Comfy Nose better:The "L" shaped design was much easier to use on a baby/toddler that didn't want to have their nose cleaned. It made it easier to clean their nose sitting up with puts gravity of your side getting out more mucous.  The open reservoir uses a small piece of tissue for a filter which is more economical and you don't have to make a trip to the store to get more of.  (obviously you buy tissue from the store but you know what I mean)  The soft silicone tip seemed more comfortable for my baby and after using it a over the course of one cold and then the next, he eventually volunteered him self to get his nose cleaned!  Plus, it's the cheaper of the two.Both effectively suck out snot.  Both are easy to clean,  Both have small pieces that can be easy to lose (although Baby Comfy Nose comes with a little mesh bag to store it in.)
