I was expecting a soft, rubbery skin since they used the word "press" in the description. "On/off and mode changing with just a slight press"It has a switch to turn on and off. The soft ones are kid friendly, these hard ones are not so much.I gave it two starts and not one because $3.33 for the price each is not bad. They would be great for decorating for a party or one time use event.
