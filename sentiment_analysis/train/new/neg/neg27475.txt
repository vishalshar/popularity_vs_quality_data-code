****update.  After having the gate installed for about five days, one of the wood slats broke from my five pound chaweenie putting his feet on it. He can push that slat outwards and escape now, rendering the gate useless.It's pretty, for a child gate. I bought it because my dog has figured out how to climb gates with anything that could be a toe hold. Don't make the mistake I did with measuring. Take your baseboards into account. I had to place the bottom bar over the baseboards to make it fit. The framework seems very sturdy, but I'm not so sure about the wood door. I got it for $40 but I wouldn't pay full price for it as a dog gate. The door is easy to use and opens both ways.Pet related items: if you have a dog who is destructive or likes to chew wood, he will ruin the gate. There's plenty of space to get their mouth around those bars. I also wouldn't recommend for dogs with very small heads, like chihuahuas or miniature wiener dogs. The bars are a little far apart, and if they can get their head through, they can get the rest of their body through. It is tall enough to defeat or discourage most jumpers, unless you have an Olympic level husky or something. I also don't think the latch is strong enough to hold up to chest bumping from large dogs like Great Danes.
