This did not hold up after the first time it was washed by itself on delicate and dried on low.  Super poor quality! Returning it.  Also the Breganwood Organics Hooded Towel and although it's much more expensive it is much better quality and looks like it will hold up.  Barely any lint in the lint trap compared to a dryer full from the Jumping Beans (from Kohl's).  It's worth the extra $14 for the Breganwood if it means it may last 3-5 years instead of 3-5 washes with the Jumping Bean!
