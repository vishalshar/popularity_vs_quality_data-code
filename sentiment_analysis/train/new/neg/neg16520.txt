This is a good pacifier holder.  It seems well made and it's certainly very cute looking.  Unfortunately, it's a little longer than other pacifier holders we've had and gets wrapped around our little one's neck... or it's so long that he won't be able to find it in the middle of the night even though it's connected to him.  The other downfall of it being so long is that it drags on more stuff if it's connected to him during the day.
