Geez , I don't know why this terrible product has a 4 star overall rating ! Actually that was why I picked it and although I consider myself a savvy shopper , I have to admit I was totally mislead by the nice pic and reviews here .The actual product looks and feels cheap . It's totally uncomfortable and very hard to clean. I installed it myself after finding out the instructions are totally useless and found in very flimsy; so I took it to a police station that has specialized officers in installing car seats.The seat flipped on the way to the station with my kid in it!!!!!! I pulled by a fire station,they fixed it a little bit but told me I better return it .I drove to the police station which was close by and the officer told me the same thing . I called Amazon and they told me I needed to contact BabyAge . I did so but they asked me funny questions like the name of the officer and the location of the station and finally said they have never had a complaint and since it was 40 days past the purchase time , they wouldn't return it ! (i didnt install it as soon as i received it of course ). Piece of crap product and customer service both!TERRIBLE experience , awful product .And it's not that it my purchase was defected.The product is very cheaply made and is not safe AT ALL .
