I love the original bumkins bib and since my daughter started to try to feed herself and get all her long sleeved shirts dirty I was excited to try this product. The material is AMAZING. It is soft, waterproof, does not stain and is SUPER easy to clean. And it dries in 5 minutes. However the original sleeveless bumkins bib is SO MUCH better.First, the tie closure is horrible. I end up just not tying it but the food sometimes fall on my daughter's neck on the gap between her neck and the bib. The velcro strap on the original is GREAT.Second... my daughter is 14 months and the bib is tight of her wrists. I don't think any toddler would be able to use it past 18 months unless the toddler is skinny. I don't think my daughter is very chubby but it just bothers so much that it is super tight that I end up just using the sleeveless bib.
