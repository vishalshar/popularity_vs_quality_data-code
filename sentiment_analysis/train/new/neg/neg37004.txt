This is a decent concept but the makers fell short on design when they included such cheap audio electronics. The monitor and video quality are as expected - black and white CRT screen with a vertical hold adjuster, which you'll need to use just like the old days of black and white TV. Nighttime vision is OK but I have seen better IR illumination on cameras.The main problem is that the microphone is set to such a sensitive level that there is no way to avoid noise on the other end. There is no way to turn the sound down to an acceptable level on the reciever, so you must turn the sound off to avoid the nuisance of constant static and buzzing. The sensitivity overload is further enhanced by the blinking red lights (visual cue to sound) that blink constantly, even when there is silence by the microphone.Since bad audio reception and static are the main consumer complaints about these types of products, I recommend avoiding this unit until they can figure out the audio issues. If you're just looking for good video coverage for cheap, then this might be a good unit for you.
