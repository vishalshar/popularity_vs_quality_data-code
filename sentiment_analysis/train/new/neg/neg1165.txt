My twins are now 3 months, and I can say that I've used this pillow every single day since I brought them home from the hospital. It's great for tandem feeding. We're now using it for tummy time as well. These first few months would have been much, much more difficult without my twin z. For that, I really appreciate this product.My main complaint about the construction is that the seams ripped on the pillow itself within the first month of use. Following that, the seams on the cover itself started to come apart during month 2. The pillow and cover are still usable even with these tears, but the holes have gotten much bigger as the months pass by. Anyone that has twins can probably understand why I didn't bother to attempt a return -- I didn't have the time in those first three months, and I was in survival mode attempting to keep my twins fed while staying sane. Still, having this happen on a $100 product was frustrating to say the least.
