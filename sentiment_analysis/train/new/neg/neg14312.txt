I ordered this product for my 8 month old son with high hopes that he would be running all over the house with it. Unfortunately, the back wheels keep falling off. It's ok for a few minutes until he runs into a cabinet or wall or when pulling him out of it and the wheels come off. I feel like maybe I just got a lemon. :(
