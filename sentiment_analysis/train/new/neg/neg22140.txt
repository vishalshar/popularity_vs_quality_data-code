I love the concept behind this product! I have only tried the colored side (helps keep baby cool). While I believe it does keep my baby from getting as hot and sweaty in her stroller the design/shape in not really compatible with my stroller and makes it impossible to use the stroller straps to buckle baby in. I have a new baby jogger city mini stroller, pretty common so I'm not sure why this doesn't fit.  If it did allow me to strap baby in this would be a 5 star product.  But as is I have to choose between baby's safety and keeping baby cooler - safety will win every time.
