Great concept and seems like a great toy except my little guy was totally not into it. I got it around 5 months bc he hated tummy time and I wanted a toy that would help distract him. THIS did not help at all. Even at 9 months, he really didnt care for this toy and ignored it. I filled it will vinegar and water and the fish stuck together and didnt entertain my baby at all.My friend really liked this for her twins and recommended it highly so I guess it is dependent on your childs preferences. However, I was just not impressed with the quality - the fish are not really that bright, stick together inside the mat, and dont grab even my attention.I have thrown out the mat since my son would rather throw it and chew on it rather than play with the fish and touch it. I would not buy this again.
