I wanted to really love this gate (not that one can fall in love with this) and it does have a few shortfalls.The most disappointing was that the left and right sides of the gate show straight panels with rubber ends attached. I figured that this would be great for my stairway since I have an older home and just wanted the rubber ends to push against the posts.  Unfortunately the gate is constructed differently than shown on the site. The rubber ends and the framing of the gate are almost the same which means that the wood frame competes with the rubber bumpers.  I posted some pictures to give you a better idea of what I had to do.I selected this gate based on the Amazon site picture. Although I have it now, I added an extension on the bumper and I have to use velcro to secure one end of the gate. I decided to keep it since I had it Prime shipped and needed it the day it arrived.  The gate is OKAY and I'm surprised it is a bit flimsy.  If you need something with more durability, find something else. But it does serve it's purpose as a temporary barrier for a dog that visits us on occasion.
