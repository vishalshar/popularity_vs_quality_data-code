First time we opened the package, I was able to turn on the blue and green ducks and they lit up fine. The big yellow one, however, broke on the inside instantly, so obviously was never able to be turned on. Besides that, I am still disappointed with the ducks that do glow, because they only stay lit for about 30 seconds and then shut off. We had previously been given as a gift the ducks from Elegant Baby, and they worked great for about year, which is a long enough time, and more than likely we will buy those instead next time. Would NOT recommend.
