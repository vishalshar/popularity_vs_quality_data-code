I don't love this product, i ordered the large tube for my 2 year old with Sensory issues and when i received it it was disappointing it was so small ! I guess i didn't read the product detail and assumed it would be much bigger. Seriously not even three days later i can not find it  ! It is that small. So all in all i would not recommend this product to someone and i would not buy it again maybe it is good for someone else. I will look for something bigger
