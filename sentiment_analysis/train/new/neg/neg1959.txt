I bought this toy for my 10 month old niece as a gift, but decided to buy one for my 23 month old son so that he could have a nice soft ball to throw around the house (he's got a good arm). The ball is nice and soft (even though the little jingler inside can be felt if the ball is thrown hard enough), it's great for learning to catch, and my son likes to fling it around by the tags. However, my son decided to carry the ball around in his mouth like the doggies do, and one of the tags actually cut his little tongue! Even made him bleed! I am PISSED that something being advertised as soft and comforting could do this. I touched the tags afterwards and they are actually quite "sharp" in the creased area... had to warn my sister about letting my niece put this in her mouth. Boo on you, Taggies.
