I ordered 2 of these for my 4-year old twins' booster seats. What a waste of money. The velcro and snaps are very hard to adjust and hardly ever seemed right no matter how much I tried to set them. Worst of all, the seat belts seem constantly tangled and get stuck in the car door. Save the money and use a hand towel wrapped around the belt near the kids' neck... that will protect the child better than these things!
