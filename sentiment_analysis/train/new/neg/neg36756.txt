This gate is okay/average, and if not for the affordability and ease of installation I'd have knocked off a star.  Yes, it's tall, and yes it's easy to put up and use (we needed the extension). We actually have no problem with it coming down/loose, as the tension mount is fairly strong against the wall without using screws; we're in and out of it dozens of times on a daily basis and are only adjusting it maybe once a week.The biggest problem is that the opening is narrow, and anybody who is very pregnant has to walk through it sideways, and unfortunately there are rough edges on these parts and we've been scraped (I've attached picsâ€”two months later the scar is still there).  After we learned that we had our pregnant friend turn the other way, but it's a pain and shouldn't be necessary.  We had to pad it, also a pain.  Pass-through areas should be surrounded by metal edges that are smooth as silk!
