This was a really cool light but over the past year it has drastically changed colors from the bright white to a dingy yellow.  We are a smoke free house and it was cleaned regularly.  The light sat on a night stand next to my sons bedroom window and it seems the plastic dis colored from the sun.  For $70 I think it could have been made way better (I placed the lamp in my white kitchen sink to show the true color it is now!)***Update - I wrote to Boons customer service and they are replacing the light.  They said it is not normal and they want their quality control team to look at it.  I'm pretty impressed that after 1.5 years they are replacing it
