I was sick of always being surrounded by gross cloth diapers covered in spit-up, and I hoped these cute burp cloths would add a little excitement to the newborn grind.  Not really.  I do like the print (I got the black and white Versailles) so they have some aesthetic appeal, but they are cheaply made and don't stand up well to the frequent washing that burp cloths require.  The printed side is useless as far as baby vomit goes - it just smears it around.  The terry side is absorbant and textured so at least you can use it to wipe, which is at least its better than the a lot of other burp cloths that are so smooth that they don't absorb and just push wetness around (ew).  They are washcloth sized, so they are really only good for one good burp.  If you are looking for cute burp cloths, I find the Bebe Au Lait cloths to be much more useful, well made and still cute.  Skip these.
