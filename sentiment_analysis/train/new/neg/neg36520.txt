I bought this mainly as a side carry wrap. I like it to wear around the house. I haven't worn it out and about as our Ergo is much more comfortable. The ties are long enough. The main part is wider than other wraps so it looks uncomfortable on her hips and legs. I wish the bottom part that ties against your body was thicker so it would feel better against you and be more secure. Those are my two main complaints. Other than that I like it and it does the job. I had this shipped internationally and it came a lot sooner than expected and shipping was cheaper than expected. My only other experience with a mei tai wrap was a Babyhawk. In my opinion, any wrap would fall short compared to a Babyhawk.
