I ended up selling it after a month.  did not particularly like wearing it and it was uncomfortable for me.  Baby liked it for about 30 minutes tops and then was done.  This is okay for a trip to the grocery store, but I would not go to the zoo or something like and expect to walk around for a significant amount of time.  The complimentary leg cover things are ridiculous and I did not like them.  They fit the bottom of the leg great, but were way too tight toward the top.
