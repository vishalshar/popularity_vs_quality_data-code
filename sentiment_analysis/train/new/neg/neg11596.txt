Love it! My baby kept bumpimg her head against during diaper changing and this is perfect to protect her. No matter how much she moves there is no way for her to bump her head anymore.UpdateI used to love this pad but after a few weeks, it started to break appart. My baby y can now get the foam out which is, in my opinion, really dangerous as we know baby puts everything in their mouths.Do NOT buy this pad unless your baby stays still and never kicks when you change his diaper...
