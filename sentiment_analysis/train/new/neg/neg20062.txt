Got this raincover cuase needed smth upgently. Don't recommend it at all. It started tearing only after 2 times we used it. Plus we couldn't get if it has any holes, so baby can breathe. Finally we discovered few really tiny ones, which apparently are not enough, cause it gets misted from inside very fast.
