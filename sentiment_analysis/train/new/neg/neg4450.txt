i like the product because of the color however everytime my child spill a little bit of milk or liquid it leaves a mark so it looks pretty disgusting and nobody wants to wash this every time our kid spill something.the wheel is not pretty solid sometimes it came off. the foam around the handle ripped 2months after i bought it.the stroller is also heavy to put in the trunk.i now have the stroller for 8months and i have to buy new stroller.
