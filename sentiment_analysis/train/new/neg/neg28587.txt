It's a big mat with bright pretty pictures. However the alphabet is not in order. I went over the edge with the vacuum cleaner by mistake and the blue material that's sown into the edges started to come off. Whenever my daughter falls asleep on it or spends too much time on it it makes her sweat real bad and keeps her extremely hot.
