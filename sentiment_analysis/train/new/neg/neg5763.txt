I bought this to help my then 15-month-old son get used to the idea of using sippy cups. It's kind of an odd design, where you can go with either a more traditional nipple or a sort of silicon "spout." I used the spout, since we were trying to encourage him away from bottles. I have to say I was disappointed. He LOVED chewing on the spout, but he wouldn't actually drink out of it, so the water would just gush out of his mouth. I also felt like the pieces warped a bit after a run in the dishwasher, and after that the cup leaked constantly. Too many little bits to wash, too. It's overly complicated. Luckily, he took to the Advent soft spout cups a month later, and he's finally figured out how to drink out of a cup. It's a shame about the MAM cup, since my son loves their pacifiers.
