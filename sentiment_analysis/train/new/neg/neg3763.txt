Came w\o instructions in box.  I am mechanically minded so not problem with install, but sliding mechanism that locks gate was not smooth and my wife and teen daughter had a hard time opening the gate which we bought to keep dogs contained.  Would have sent it back due to this, but I just modified the mechanism instead.  Took me quite a bit of effort and time, but now works OK. The sliding design of the locing mechanism is not very well done. Obviously this modification would not have been an option if used as a child gate. Possibly my gate was defective and had been returned (?, no instructions in box might have been an indication of this?).FYI, If you have\buy this gate and need to expand the distance to make it a little ( up to an inch) wider, just buy some of the HEAVY DUTY protective circular felt "feet" from the dollar store and adhere them to he ends of the gate adjustment pads.  I put two on each side and that worked well.  Also better protects the walls.
