I purchased 2 of these for my toddlers to use when we go camping, hotel room stays and for sleeping at the grandparents thinking that this would be great for an easy set up keeping my kids off the dirty floors but this is not as well made as it appears to be. I love the idea of the cot and sleeping bag but there are several things that I am not fond of...there is little flexibility of the cot mat especially in the middle where it needs it most, the sleeping bag is very thin and very slippery (somehow I don't think its very comfy since my kids would rather sleep with just a blanket than use it), the sleeping bag covering does not have enough material to completely cover the cot like it should and every time my children roll over it comes undone.I'm guessing this is a good option for a one time use thing but for long term use over the next 2 years, I don't see this being the best option for my toddlers.
