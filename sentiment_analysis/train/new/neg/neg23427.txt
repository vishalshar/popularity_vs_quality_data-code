My daughter is six weeks old and loves to be swaddled. It calms her down so much. We have a couple Miracle Blanket swaddles, which we really love, along with this HALO. I do like this HALO swaddle, as it keeps her nice and cozy. However, her arms are not as secure in it as the Miracle Blanket. I've found I need to swaddle her with her arms at her sides INSIDE the pouch (not coming out through the arm holes) to get her arms to stay at her sides while she sleeps. If I keep her arms inside and sort of use my hand to hold them down at her sides while I pull the flaps around her, they are much more secure. Luckily, she doesn't fight the process of being swaddled, as it definitely calms her down. If she were fighting me as I swaddled her, I think this would be a hard swaddle to use. The one time I swaddled her with her arms out through the arms holes, but still inside the flaps, when I picked her up after her nap, she had almost worked her little hands out the top of the flaps. She startles easily when her arms are free (and wakes herself up!), so I want to be sure her arms stay swaddled while she sleeps.
