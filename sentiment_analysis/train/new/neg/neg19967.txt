I was so excited to get this diaper to turn it into a Coast Gaurd diaper.  However, I just can't get it to fit my 18 lb 13 month old.  I've tried different combinations of using the snaps to make it smaller, but we always get leaks out the top of from the leg holes.  The insert snaps in and seems super absorbent and has been prepped properly through multiple wash cycles, but still leaks every time she pees.  This my only trend lab diaper out the 26 others I have but I don't get leaks in any of my others in my stash mainly consisting of BG Freetimes, Alvas, Best Bottom covers, and Little Monsters.  I hope to try the trend lab diaper out again as she grows because I think it will work well for chunkier babies or toddlers.
