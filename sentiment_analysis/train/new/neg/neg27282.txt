Love them, they're affordable, and allows me to put food on it so that my baby can feed and occupy herself at restaurants. Otherwise I'd be feeding and tending to her constantly because she'll throw the plate, food in tow, into the floor. And restaurant tables are sticky and gross, so there's no way we're letting her tiny little hands play with things on the table.One request: stickers all around! There's only stickers running on the top and bottom of the mat, so the older she gets, the easier it is to rip the mat off the table. We've also bought the green spouts mat, which is made from a material in addition to having stickers on all four sides, so baby can't tear it off the table. Both still peel off cleanly, however. It's cheaper than the green spouts, though, so we'll see if she continues to tear it off, because then it renders it completely useless.
