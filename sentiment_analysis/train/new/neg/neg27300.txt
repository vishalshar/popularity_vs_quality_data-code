What a terrible waste of money. Sickening to think we spent this much for a product that does not work. We bought this before we had our baby and by the time we used it and realized it didn't work, the warranty was up. We did everything the instructions said, but the sensors were still too sensitive. The alarm went off while our baby was laying on the pads, even while he was moving around. So frustrating, we kept him away from the vents, no ceiling fan, kept the monitor 5 feet away, everything. And the parent monitors suck. Since they are wireless, to save battery, the monitors only turn on for about 7 seconds, then shut off for several minutes at a time. Who cares what the room temperature is when you cannot hear your baby? They wasted too much time on unnecessary features and not enough on the important ones.
