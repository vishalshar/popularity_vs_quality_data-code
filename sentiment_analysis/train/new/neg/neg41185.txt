this chair is ok- it is very cute and super soft. maybe i didn't realize how tiny it actually is- my 18 month old is the perfect size to use it so I am guessing it won't get much longevity from it. it actually looks very pink too- not a true red like the picture shows. came packaged well and came quickly. it is a conversation starter and my son likes playing with it (he sits on the curved base and puts his books on the head part). for $38 you can get something bigger or put it towards something with more purposeful use- although I do not regret buying it
