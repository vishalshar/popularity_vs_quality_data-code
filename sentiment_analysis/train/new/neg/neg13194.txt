I rated this unit only 3 starts even though I really like it. Reason for that is outlined below.Pros: very clear sound and very sound sensitive (picks up sound from cat walking in the room).  Easy to use and carry with you.Cons: rechargeable batteries in the parents unit stop holding charge 1.5 month after purchase. Contacted manufacturer- they were very polite, opened case and told me to wait from repair department to contact me….. 24 hrs later I get an email from repair department stating that I need to send check for $50 and a unit to them, then also pay for the return s/h and they will repair/replace unit…… really? This should be covered under the warrantee repair… With an actual cost of unit at $70 I am better buying a new unit… Till today ( 2+month) I am waiting on repair department to answer my question on should not it be covered under the warrantee.We still use it, but keep in the charger at all the time. That is not convenient and I would expect more from couple month old Samsung product. That is why I rated it 3.
