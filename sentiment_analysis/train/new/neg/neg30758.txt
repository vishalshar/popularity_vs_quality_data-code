This carseat is nice enough, but I would never think of buying it again ( and actually wish I could figure out how to return it!). The colors are nice, the fabric is soft and thats about it. I bought this for my 5 month old - and he is not comfortable at all in it. The "Infant support" piece is a joke and the head rest doesnt adjust so i had to unstrap it for him to even use it. It reclines, but since my seats in my 2007 Tahoe are at such an incline it does no good. I had to buy a large wedge to get the carseat to sit at a decent level. Manufacturers should really consider this when making them!!! It is rather large, my husband has to sit cramped when he drives because he cant move the drivers seat back any further.
