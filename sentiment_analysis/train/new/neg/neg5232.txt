When I bought this I imagined wearing the bra under my work clothes, obviously needing to do some adjusting when I needed to pump at work - but using this so I could be hands free at work. I tend to pump in the car a bit. But, this was the most awkward bra to use for hands free. I only used it once.First, it's halter - which i thought would be comfortable - but, really, it's just hard to put on. Then, you can't wear it all day because the holes for your nipples just make your breast look really weird under a shirt. They kind of poke out, and there is not cover flap for the holes, so leaking is very likely.So, I learned that this is meant to wear more around the house and not at work because I am not going to wear a bra to work under my work clothes then completely undress, take off my bra, put this on, set the pump up in the holes, then pump - the entire process would take 15 minutes then the 15-20 minutes for pumping them another 10 minutes to re-dress and clean up? Too much for me.But, even around the house this was not helpful. If there was a flap  for the nipple holes this might be better. I ended up buying the Medela hands free pump and this bra has just been sitting in my dresser unused.
