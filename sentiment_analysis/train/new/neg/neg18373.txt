Maybe my six month old daughter just need to grow a little more to really appreciate this toy. So far we've had it for about a month and every time I put her in this bouncer she just whines until I take her out. She reaches the ground but doesn't know how to use her legs yet and she keeps spinning in circle. It's very very hard to get her into the seat bc it moves around so much. We don't put batteries in ours because we don't want to use too many lights and sounds to distract her. So I don't know anything about the light up part of this toy.I'm sure once she gets a little bigger she may like this better. I do push her back and forth in it like a swing (not too hard because I'm afraid it may fall off the door) and she really really likes that. Lol even though that's not what it was for, but it works for right now.
