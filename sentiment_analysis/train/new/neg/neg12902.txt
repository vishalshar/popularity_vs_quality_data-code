So I am not sure what to review it because when I used these for my son 4.5 yrs ago, he used to like them just fine. I bought the same for my daughter thinking she should like them too (she is 4 months). She practically hates them. She got the soothie kind of pacifiers when she was younger and I assumed since she was about 4 months old, I should graduate her to these...not a good idea. She still like her old pacifiers and does not use these at all.That being said, I am not sure it is the pacifiers fault but this is a warning for parents who use the hospital pacifiers in the beginning and then try to graduate their kinds on to the other kinds.As for the color, I had no issues. I got the gender neutral one (yello and white) as per the picture.
