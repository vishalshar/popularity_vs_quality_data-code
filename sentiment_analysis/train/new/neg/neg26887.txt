My 10 month old is fuzzy in baths (we used to separately wash her head while holding her sidways. She was getting too big and heavy to do that) so we got this. It arrived in time, well packaged. The baby typically has a dislike to hats and she would just take it off :( I think if  it had a sort of strap (optional - I don't suppose all babies need them) that would have been great.
