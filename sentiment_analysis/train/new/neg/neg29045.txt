The gate looks great and works well.  I don't like that we had to set it up as semi-permanent, but I wanted something with ease of operation and that looked nice.The gate is supposed to fit a doorway as small as 28", ours is 28.5 and it did not fit without modifications to the hardware.  We had to cut down the bolts and remove a bumper to get it to fit in the doorway.It works great and looks great, but was a pain to install.
