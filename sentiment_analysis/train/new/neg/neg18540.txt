I had bought the Skip Hop Zoo Large Storage Bin, Livie Ladybug to be part of the set of the other Skip Hop Large Storage Bins - the Owl, Monkey, and Butterfly.  I was disappointed that this storage bin is noticeably smaller, both in height and width, than the other three.  The other three bins of this set are of the same size and are wider and taller than the Ladybug bin.  The Labybug bin appears to also be made of a slightly different material, as it is flimsier.  Yes the Ladybug is cute and gets the job done of holding stuff, but I was looking for a matching set in terms of size and material.
