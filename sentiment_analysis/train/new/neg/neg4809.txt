The idea of this set is nice, but the toothbrush bristles are not quite soft enough for baby's teeth/gums and a little large for baby's mouth, and the gum stimulator (which is the main reason I got this set for my teething baby) is a bit too big for my baby's mouth too, and he gags on it pretty easily. The finger brush is good - the same as any other. However, none of the products are BPA-Free, and they're all made in China, which is always a red flag for me these days; especially for something that I'm putting in my baby's mouth. If you're looking for a good gum stimulator/massager, I suggest the other one we got which fits my baby's mouth much nicer, is BPA-Free and is offered with free shipping by Giggle: [...] (Called Gum Massager Brush (BPA-Free).) You're likely better off getting a baby toothbrush and/or finger brush at your local grocery store.
