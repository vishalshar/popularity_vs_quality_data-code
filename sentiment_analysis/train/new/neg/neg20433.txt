OK, so I'll admit it took me awhile to figure how to install this thing properly.  My first few attempts were when we first installed the car seats and when we had to go on a long road trip.  Neither times worked and led to a lot of frustration and annoyance with Clek.  I finally took a closer look and realized the reason the adapter kept popping back out - there is a thin, long slot on the underside of the hole.  The adapter has a thin long part that needs to be inserted in that slot.  Also, the tab should be lifted up to help it hook into the big hole.  If that makes sense.  It seems really obvious, but I think the drawn instructions really don't point those two details out well.As for the actual upholder itself, it looks a little bit small and shallow.  We use Camelbak Eddy and Thermos Funtainer for drinks.  Both fit, the Cambelbak perfectly.  Anything bigger would not fit.  I would not recommend any of those top-heavy bottles (like with character lids), because ether would easily topple over/out.I have to agree with previous reviewers, with the HEFTY price of a Clek to begin with, the upholder should be included and not have to be nickel-and-dimed to make an extra buck.  Seriously, $25-ish for a upholder is outrageous.  But my daughter was already used to the built-in-cupholder she had on her previous car seat (Maxi Cosi Pria).  If the price weren't so ridiculous, I'd buy her 2, one for drinks and one for snacks, since we do 6+ hr road trips quite often. And I have to think about getting the baby one for his Clek when he's a bit older.
