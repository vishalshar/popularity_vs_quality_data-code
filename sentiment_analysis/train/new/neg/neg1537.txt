I am SO very sorry that we purchased this camera 3 years ago. Including the original monitor with camera, we have had a total of 4 cameras- and only have one currently working one. We also bought an entire new set- due to issues with the handset and Samsung was unwilling to fix the issue because it was past the warranty- so we bought a new monitor set because we already had an additional camera that we didn't want to go to waste. Since Samsung is a big name in electronics we were so excited to purchase (what we thought was) top of the line products for our new baby boy. We assumed since we can add cameras on that we would have this product for a long time- hopefully last us through all of our children. Well, here we are on baby number two- we have gone through 2 sets of the monitor/camera and two additional camera purchases on top of that. I am beyond frustrated and now we are left either buying a complete new set or limping around with what we had. We recently had to go out and purchase a baby monitor that just had the sound on it because the sound went out on one of the cameras. Just unbelievable. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Apparently Samsung does not care that it's products last- so if you want to use these beyond a year without purchasing another, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!
