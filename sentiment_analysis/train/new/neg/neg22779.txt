I bought this set because I thought it would be a good introductory pack to cloth diapering, which it is. The diapers are very absorbent (use diaper detergent), and the covers have not leaked on us. So overall, it was not wasted money.This set only contains enough diapers for 1 day of newborn diaper changes (if you're lucky). You'd need to get two or three sets just to avoid doing laundry daily. Well, really you need 2-3 sets worth of prefold diapers, and could get by with fewer covers.I just wish that I had realized that I could buy all the components of this set cheaper elsewhere:Thanksmama.com Prices:White Indian Cotton Prefolds - Infant 4x8x4 $21/dozenProrap Classic Diaper Covers - Newborn - White $6.99 eachBio-Soft Liners - Small (5x12 inches) $6.29Total <$50 for the same quantities of this setI bought the items listed above and the prefold diapers are EXACTLY like the ones in this set, and my husband and I actually prefer the prorap covers (they dip for the umbilical cord stump). Also, breastmilk poo can go straight into the washer, no liner needed.
