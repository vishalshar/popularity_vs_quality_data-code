Here is the scoop. Need a wig for Halloween party. Last minute shopping. Wig arrived next day. Crazy fast. Came in flat plastic bag. Elastic in wig  doesn't keep wig on head. Just sits on top. Wig will fall off if you tilt your head.  Quality is trash. Wig holds no form. I am trying to get it to stand up a little. When you pull to give it volume, thread starts to fall out. I will try to get some hairspray to create an Afro form.  Don't let that picture fool you.  Not even close. Looks like a clown on crack.Bummer of a purchase. I will try to spray it and then throw it away.
