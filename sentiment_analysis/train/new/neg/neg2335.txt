I bought this night light for my newborn son's room at night. I have four major complaints:1. The Size- This night light is SO small. As you can see in the photo, it is barely larger than my thumb.2. The Batteries- The batteries it came with did not work. I pulled out the plastic piece and voila- nothing happened.3. The Battery Life- The battery life is only 30 HOURS and it takes 3 small, obscure batteries. For that reason, they include a spare set of 3 batteries. At most, the night light will work for 3-4 days before dying.4. The Price- $9... for what? If I were to use this, which I'm not, I would be spending a small fortune on batteries to keep it running.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
