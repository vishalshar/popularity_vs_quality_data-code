I ordered this for my 1 year old baby after weaning her off of her Nap Nanny for night time use. She was diagnosed with GERD as a newborn and we were told to switch her to a pillow when she turned one. I found this pillow and thought it would be great due to the fact she could feel something all around her like she had been used to with the Nap Nanny. Maybe as she ages she will use it, but as of now she will not. She moves to the opposite side of the crib from where it is.I also wish that the cover zipped on and off so that it was easier to wash.I do feel like I can reintroduce this pillow to her at a later time and she will use it- possibly when she's in her toddler bed.
