My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and pretty easily entertained. I read all the glowing reviews, and thought this would be a hit. So far, this hasn't been the case. The toy itself is bright, cheerful, and very very durable. I also like the fact that it doesn't need batteries. However, apart from a few things to spin, and a few shapes to fiddle with, there really isn't anything to sustain her interest. At first I was pleased to find a toy that wasn't at all noisy, but, given the lack of visual stimulation, I don't even think that that's a bonus. Also, the picture on Amazon of the toy shows a mirror at one end - the one I received had a boring spinner with a dog and a bone on one side, and a kind of "cage" design on the other. I think it's supposed to be an optical illusion when it's spun, but it doesn't work at all. Hopefully she'll find it more interesting as she gets older.
