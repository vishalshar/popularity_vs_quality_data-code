I have a love hate relationship with this bag. I think is very functional. I really get use of the stroller straps and all the compartments and zipper compartments. I like that I can keep everything organized. The things that I don't like about this bag is that it's a heavy bag on its own, and when filled with all the baby essentials (I don't usually overpack), it is not very practical since it becomes very heavy. I have though about getting rid of it but there are a lot of things that I really like about the bag that keep me from getting rid of it. I now keep it with all the essentials in the car and when I need something I just grab it and put it in my purse instead. Overall is a good diper bag.
