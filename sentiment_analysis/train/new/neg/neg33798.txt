It is Okay at best, don't get me wrong as my son loves it.  What we don't like is how light the blanket is (not good for winter or even 60 degrees Fahrenheit outside fall weather) as my son complained how cold he gets with it even with the indoor thermastat set to 68. The sheet itself is nothing that good (Not cotton) or feel really robust.  We bought it because it was cheap and my son loves dinosaurs.
