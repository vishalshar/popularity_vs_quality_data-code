Bought this to tandem bathe my toddler and infant. Since I have to fill the tub up anyway to bathe the toddler I just throw this and the infant in and knock out bath time together. If I were to only bathe the baby I would not choose this. To fill up the entire tub with water is unnecessary. I would just use the infant bathtub.
