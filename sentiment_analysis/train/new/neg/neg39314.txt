the blanket is only decorated on one side, the other is blank and the blanket is thin enough to allow the dots to be somewhat visible from the back side in and unappealing way.  The edging also seems to be a cheap non-cotton thread. i would like to see the blanket and detailing with 100% cotton and double sided, other than that the blanket was soft and satisfied my needs.
