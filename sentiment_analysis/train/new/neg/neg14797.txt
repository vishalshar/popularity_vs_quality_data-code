This was very cute when we received it.  We discovered right away however, that the tiny boppy pillow included is covered with a slippery fabric that is great for wiping clean, but the baby slides right off of it.  You can't use it to prop up the baby for tummy play with the toys attached to the pillow because the baby slides right off of it.  Also, the toys on the bar are great, but the bar that holds them above the baby is not.  After gentle use for a few weeks (the baby laying on the mat for a few minute per day), the bar began to lean over to one side.  It would no longer stand upright.  Consequently, the toys would actually lay on my baby's face when he was on the mat.  He would get really upset because the toys were way too close for comfort.  After a minute or so, the bar was actually leaning over touching the mat.  My husband and I tried everything to get it to stand upright again (including repositioning the toys), but in a minute or so, it would be leaning over again.  I think it needs stiffer supports inside the arches.  We are disappointed because we really liked it to begin with, but it just isn't an effective or safe playmat if the bar leans over and the toys are touching the baby's face.  Amazon's great customer service is allowing me to return it for a refund, so we'll just look for something different to purchase.
