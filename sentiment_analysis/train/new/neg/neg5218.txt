I bought this wanting something that my baby could use to make musical sounds. Unfortunately, it is useless for this purpose. The buttons to make music are so difficult to press that even I have problems with it. My baby is very frustrated with it, as she knows that it should make music (she's seen me press the buttons) but she can't figure out how to make it work herself. So for her, this is just a stuffed animal. While it's price would be fine if she could actually work it, it's very overpriced for a stuffed elephant. I love my other Lamaze toys, but this one is disappointing.
