This crib looks very nice and it is made of real wood, which I like.  However, I had a dickens of a time assembling this thing.  There are 12 slats that go into the bed rails and I don't know if there's some trick to get them to line up but for me it was comical.  I found it very frustrating.  Maybe we got a bad rail but everything ended up fitting fine eventually.  It took me about 1.5 hours to assemble, most of that on trying to get the slats to simultaneously align with both side rails so I could push them together.  Bottom line: fine little bed but get yourself a bowl of wine before sitting down for assembly.
