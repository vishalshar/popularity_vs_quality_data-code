This is my 4th britax product. The other 3 were easy to use, tho I had some installation issues with the Wizard, and of course the inadequate cupholders on the parkway booster.The Monarch seems well built, comfy and safe but the armrests are driving me out of my MIND. According to the instructions, the belt is supposed to go under the the armrests, on both sides. The armrests are very low - way to low to actually be used as armrests in fact. It's necessary to pull the strap way out - hook the seatbelt - then carefully work the seatbelt up under both armrests. My 5 year old can no longer buckle herself in safely, tho of course she wants to try, especially if we are in the carpool line with about 50 other cars behind us waiting to retrieve their own kids.Perhaps, if I drove a taller vehicle it might not be as difficult for me to do. Currently, I'm driving a BMW sport wagon and am having a hard time bending way over and buckling her in.I am aware that many 5 year olds can and should remain in a traditional carseat with a 5 point harness but my daughter is very tall for her age so this seemed the safest alternative.The cupholders on this model are still too shallow to be effective, plus they are pressing into the seat of the car. I wonder if they will snap off in time. They do not sit level in this car, so they are useless for drinks. My dd uses them for crayons, which end up scattered all over the back seat.The only improved function of this seat over the parkway is that the seat belt retracts very freely thru the shoulder bracket, whereas I felt sometimes that the parkway restricted the seatbelt movement a little too much.Despite my usual love of Britax products, I would not recommend this booster. Stick with the Parkway, for children that meet the weight/height limits and have the ability to sit safely and keep the straps in position.
