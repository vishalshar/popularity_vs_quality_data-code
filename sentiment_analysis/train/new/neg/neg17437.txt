I gave this handbag 3 stars and I'll tell you why... I didn't read completely the information about the product and I found out it's from China... I had to wait 1 month and a half to receive my item, it became so maddening. Plus, the word "D-I-O-R" that is hanging in one side of the bag was incomplete, the "I" was missing. I'm kind of disappointed, I expected more.Otherwise, the handbag is really beautiful, looks elegant and shapely, its bigger than I thought. I'll keep the bag, but i'm not completely satisfied.
