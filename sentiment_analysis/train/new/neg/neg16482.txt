This product is indeed a necessity and a great way to stimulate your child.  One note of caution: there is a taller plastic piece shaped like a jester's head that has 3 rounded points at its top.  My child smacked himself in the eye with it and caused damage and swelling. I intentionally kept this and another taller plastic piece off the exersaucer for over a month until I felt my child could handle himself OK in the saucer.  But, within 2 days of placing both those pieces back on the saucer, he had an accident.  It could have been worse with severe, permanent eye damage caused... I have now pulled this "jester" piece off for good.
