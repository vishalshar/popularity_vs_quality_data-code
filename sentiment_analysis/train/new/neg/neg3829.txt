I have an Evenflo Symphony Convertible Car seat.  I purchased this car seat because it's not one of the biggest or bulkiest on the market.  Even so, this cover does not fit this less-bulky model of car seat.  Even if it did fit, the holes in the cover do not line up with where the shoulder straps connect to the seat alongside the child's bottom. I don't know why they would design the cover this way--the straps would have to originate under the child's bottom and almost next to the buckle in order to line up with the holes in the cover.Also, the cover is not gray as pictured, but rather a tan/khaki color.  That's not such a big deal, but thought I'd mention it in case it's important to someone.I was impressed by the quality and appearance of the fabric.  It's a shame that it doesn't fit the seat I own and that the holes are in a weird place.
