Pros- my son likes it, sticks well to our slightly contoured wooden chairs, lightweight, easy to wipe/clean because one solid piece of foam, good sizeCons-doesn't clean well-picked up blueberry stain upon 1st use and I cleaned it as soon as we had finished eating, I'm also starting to notice some tiny indentations, possibly from crumbs, after about 1 month of use
