I bought this for my son. I'm sure the tub portion will be nice when he is able to sit up by himself but since he should be able to sit in the hammock, it's kind of annoying. The hammock doesn't allow the baby to be submerged in any water at all, so he's just hanging out, literally. My son gets upset just laying there naked, periodically getting wet when I wash him. A good tip is to leave a wet cloth across baby's chest and tummy to help keep them warm.The towel rack is pointless but I will say that the shower hanging handle thing is pretty nice. My bathroom is pretty small so its nice to be able to hang it up to dry.Also, the little hump in the tub that is supposed to keep the baby in place doesn't help. Once the baby and water are both in the tub, he floats above it. :(
