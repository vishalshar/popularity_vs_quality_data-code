Alva diapers are good diapers for the price. I have not tried any other brands, but these seem to do a good job.  The only issues I have had is with leaking around the legs. I'm not sure if it will stop when my 3mo old gets bigger, or if it is an issue with body shape and 'fit' of the diapers. I love all the cute patterns, however, the soft 'minky' ones seem to leak more than the others. I bought a different pack that didn't have the soft diapers included when I bought more. These diapers also come with microfiber inserts, which don't hold much. Buy some bamboo inserts and the charcoal bamboo inserts with ridges and you'll be set.
