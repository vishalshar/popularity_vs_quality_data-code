These bags are basically a piece of fabric with a zipper sewn at the top.  They are very small.  There is not water or moisture proof barrier for items like baby carrots.  Items will get stale very quickly because there isn't a liner, so even your fishie crackers aren't going to taste good.  These would be better with a PUL liner (fabric used in cloth diapers) in them.  You would be better off repurposing a makeup or cosmetic bag from the dollar store that is lined for wiping clean.
