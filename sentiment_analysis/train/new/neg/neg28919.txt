I was very excited for this bouncer but unfortunately i have been disappointed. I liked the look, the small footprint, the fact that it was lightweight and the toys; however all these things have led to the reasons why I am unhappy with this product. The small footprint/lightweight make it unstable. My baby girl likes to jump back and forth as well as up and down. When she jumps back and forth it tips off the floor. I thought well maybe I just have it set to low but she manages to tip the bouncer even on highest level. I have to barricade it between the couch and ottaman in order to keep it from tipping/moving however she still manages to tip it. We had to remove all the toys because she came close to hitting her face on all of them. She had a Fisher Price bouncer that was a hand me down from her cousin that she loved but she broke a spring on it from bouncing so much. She would stay in the FP bouncer forever and I was comfortable giving her distant supervision while she was in it so I could get some stuff done. When I put her in this bouncer, I feel like I have to stay right with her to ensure safety. Wish I had gone with another Fisher Price bouncer. Looks like a nice bouncer but is poorly designed and really just dangerous.
