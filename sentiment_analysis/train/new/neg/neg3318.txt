I have a small car (Nissan Sentra) and finding a shade that works well for my rear passenger window has been a challenge. This shade fits well without even needing to cut it down (but you can, if you need to). I cleaned and dried the window very well prior to sticking it on, but it still "de-clings" from time to time. And it is supposed to be able to let you roll down the window with it on... Well, the two times I tried, the plastic insert at the bottom (that allows you to do this) came out of the window slide - and it is quite difficult to get it back in without completely removing the shade from the window. (So, I just don't ever open that window).I have tried 3 other styles of sunshade and they all have failed miserably (cling, static, and suction cup), so I'll keep the mediocre one and call it good.
