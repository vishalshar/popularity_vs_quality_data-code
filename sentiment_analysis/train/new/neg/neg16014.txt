I drooled over this and read every review before purchasing.  First...the bag is not snow white. It's more cream. It is glittery but needed more bling in my opinion.  It's really a small diaper bag and ... to seal the deal on sending it back? It BUCKLES!!! HELLO!!!! No way!!! I thought the buckle was decorative and it just snapped, but no! You have to buckle and unbuckle it (then magnetic snap) but there's no way I'd be taking the time to do that every time.  Sorry Kalencom, cute idea but fail.
