Very cute swim diaper. It is made a really great material, and fits really well. I loved it the first time we used it. However, it did NOT pass the poop test. It was a rather large poop (he had recently started solids), so perhaps a disposable diaper would have had the same issue, but I am nervous about using this at the pool again. If it still fits this summer, I'll use it at the beach where a little poop in the water would be far less embarrassing. Thankfully my 5 month old waited until after we got out of the pool to do his "duty".
