When you take the tray away, there is nothing to keep the baby in the seat but the straps. I prefer a highchair that still has some kind of divider between baby's legs as an extra safety.Also, it's impossible to get the back of the chair completely straight. Baby/toddler always leans back a little bit which isn't good posture for eating.
