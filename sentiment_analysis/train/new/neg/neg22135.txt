the first time for me to leave a negetive review：the first stroller i got has a big problem，front wheel was locked and cant be unlocked，another mom who had this same model helped me to doublecheck it.i got the replacement promptly,but this one still have some flaw,one snap doesn't work, seam broken,and the sunshade cant be insert  completely，one side is good the other side i cant hear the “click”，so it is very easy to pull out！！！anyway，good design，easy to use，and my friend's stroller doesnt have these problem
