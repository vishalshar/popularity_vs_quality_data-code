and then it broke. Within a month of daily use, this swing developed a squeek, then a clank, then stopped completely. My 9lb, 10 week-old loved the strong swing of this model and would snooze for hours after feeding. Then, my showering, flossing days were gone as the hot-glued engine (we looked - hot glue!) could not keep up with the packaging promises. Buy something else. I'm not sure what, I'm in the market myself, but don't buy this!
