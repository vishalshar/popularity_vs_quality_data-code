So excited to get this for our 15 month old granddaughter. Great packaging. But, alas, the interlocking  connection was IMPOSSIBLE for her to use. It requires a fair amount of force for me to connect and disconnect them. Even my very strong 4-year-old grandson struggles to use them. Poorly designed and completely useless. Plus, I unknowingly tossed the bar code and now I am stuck with them. Paid too much for nothing. I find Amazon's return policies difficult to comply with.
