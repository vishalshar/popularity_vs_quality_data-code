I bought this mobile about three years ago when I read that it's supposed to stimulate our daughter's brain. There are compelling reasons to love it, but there are plenty of reasons not to love it as well.For one thing, It didn't last for more than a year. My second daughter tore it down as soon as she could reach. Once the plastic hooks are torn, the whole system is basically broken. She tore it off of the edge of her crib and we couldn't fix it.The little pictures are on plastic cards that you basically just fit together using holes. I don't love the design. I guess it's meant so that you can rotate the images, but they are hard to remove and put back together. And let's be honest, we parents have enough to deal with...keeping track of the cards and rotating them is kind of just something that we don't really have the capacity to think about or even care about--even when we start off with the best of intentions.So initially, I kept all of the cards after my daughter broke the mobile. I thought she'd enjoy holding them and looking at them. Not really. They have always found they way to the floor, where they get scuffed up so I eventually just threw everything away.I really enjoyed having this mobile for my first child, but it didn't last for very long in our house.
