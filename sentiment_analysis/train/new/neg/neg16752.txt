I really liked the idea of these because I could never keep socks on my newborn baby. I'm not sure if I just stopped worrying too much about keeping socks on or what but I stopped using them pretty shortly after I bought them. They definitely work and keep her socks on but they also get lost very easily. Seems like a little more of a hassle than it's worth!
