I bought this car seat for my granddaughter after a great amount of research. I believe that it is a very safe car seat but it is NOT user friendly. I have a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee that has the latch system for car seats. To put the car seat in the middle of the back seat, rear facing, you have 2 straps from the top of the car seat that you have to lift the baby over, not convenient! The straps that go over the chest frequently get caught or something and won't tighten equally. One side is tight and the other loose. Then you have to release them and try again. I thought it was just me and that I was doing something wrong. After putting their daughter in the car seat numerous times, my daughter and son in law agreed, the car seat is not user friendly. The infant car seat that they bought was a Britax and they planned to buy the G4 also, but changed their minds after using mine. I think it is a safe car seat IF the chest strap tighten equally, which can take repeated effort. I would not recommend this car seat.
