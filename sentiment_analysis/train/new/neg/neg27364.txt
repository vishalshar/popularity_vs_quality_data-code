We ordered these as they are listed among the BPA free bottles for newborns. We hoped that these plastic bottles would be a nice beginning and transitional bottle for supplemental feedings (we nursed for the first few months) as they are small and hold up to 5oz.Here are the problems....the bottles are set up to be easy to clean...bottom screws off. Yes (as other reviews noted)they do leak if the bottom isnt screwed on right...but that is easy enough to remedy and get used to.Our biggest problem is that the nipples are NOT SLOW FLOW. They really are too fast for a nursing baby who is used to working for their milk. Slow flow nipples are supposed to drip a drop every second or two....these drip way too quickly and our baby could not keep up. The milk was wasted flowing out of his mouth (not what you want as a nursing mom who pumps breastmilk to feed when out and about....that stuff is like gold and you don't want to waste a drop)...or he ended up gagging from the flow.ALSO...Since these bottles are not universal size you cannot use them and switch out another nipple brand if they are too fast for you or your baby doesn't like them.If you are looking for a moderately priced BPA free bottle, I recommend the gerber glass bottle (4oz) that you can try different nipples (we really liked the DrBrown that truly had a slow flow)....also evenflo had a nice plastic BPA free version in the small size. these can both be found on amazon!
