Total nighmare to assemble. We spent more than three hours just putting the slats in the headboard. They do not come already assembled and two slats were not sized correctly so that it affected how the other slats could not stay in place. We ended up sawing them so they would fit since the pre-drilled holes on the legs did not line up with the headboard. The ONLY reason we did not return it is because we had our heart set on having our little's girls princess bedroom ready for when she got home from preschool that day. We had already promised her crib to someone and they had picked it up that morning, and her room was basically done except for the toddler bed. With that said, after all this, the bed does look really nice. Will let you know how it holds up. Also, for the lady that says she weighs 180lbs and gets on the bed - Don't think so.........
