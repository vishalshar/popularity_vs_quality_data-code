I like the idea of the legs on this swaddle, but I felt horrible putting my baby in it.  It really looks like a straitjacket.  Aside from the looks, it didn't work well.  My baby (6 months) was able to move his arms out of it pretty easily.  The sizing is also a bit misleading.  I bought the 6 - 9 month size, and it was way too big.  The legs look like the could fit a two year old.  For the price, I'd rather buy a couple of the cheaper swaddles.
