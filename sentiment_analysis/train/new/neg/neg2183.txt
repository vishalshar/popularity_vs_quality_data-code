A few days ago I would have rated this 5 stars.  Yesterday, I noticed that the material that holds the drawstring was ripping away from the bag (see picture) after a month's use.  Frustrated that it is ripping with such little use.  This a really nice looking bag that we got for our son's birthday.  We use it every day for daycare and he and the kids at his daycare all like it.  There is one large pocket that is lined and has adjustable straps that allow our son to wear it as a backpack.
