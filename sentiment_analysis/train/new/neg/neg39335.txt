When it works, it's great. It's cute. My 3-year-old loved it. The problem is two-fold. 1) My 3-year-old can mess with the buttons on the back. We 'd often come into her room to discover that the digital clock was wrong, that the alarm had changed time, that the sleep-wake setting had been reset. She's a smart cookie, but only just smart enough to mess it up - not fix it. So there's that. We tried telling her to "just press the top button" but to no avail. She's three. She pressed all the buttons. 2) It stopped working. For some odd reason, the hour and minute hands began to prevent the alarm hand from getting where it needed to go and the alarm hand would then totally stop progressing. It tells you to turn it only one direction (to set the alarm - which you can only do with this hand, not digitally) but it would get stuck, so then sometimes the only way to set it to the wakeup time we wanted was to go the other direction. And somehow in this process, we began to realize that the alarm hand was literally no longer reliable. We'd have it set for 3 and it would go off at 1:30. We'd have it set for 7 am and it'd go off at 5 am - with sounds and everything - waking up our three-year-old early and totally scaring her!! So, yeah. We were done with it. Great aesthetic design. Poor functionality design.
