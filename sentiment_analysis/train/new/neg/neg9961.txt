We've debated getting my daughter Octotunes because we've played around with it in stores and it seems like a fun toy. Her father and I both have some musical background from being in band and want her to be engaged in music when she's older. We thought fo $5.29 this would be a bargain since Octotunes is about $25.When it came I thought it was cute but noticed immedietly that the legs don't honk as nicely as the octopus. Not only that but one of them doesn't honk at all unless you really squeeze it. I can't imagine a young child being able to do it. The shell which is supposed to be like a drum makes almost no noise. Would have been nicer if it was more hollow. Instead it sounds like the equivilent of banging on a wall. The head- which is a maraca- barely makes noise. The whole toy leaves much to be desired.Although I can't complain for the price we paid, it is a nice size toy even though it is rather large and bulky for a young baby, I was expecting a bit more. It's colorful and cute but that's about all it is.
