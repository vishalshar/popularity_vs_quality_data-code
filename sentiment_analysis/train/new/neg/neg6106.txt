We purchased this stroller for some upcoming travel (domestic and international) for our six-month-old baby. After two trips, the right front wheel wobbled significantly and the clamp that holds the stroller closed stopped working. In addition, I was very disappointed with the recline feature - it's extremely difficult to use and offers very little recline. Last, the harness/buckle system is also a total pain - you must use a lot of pressure to open and close the buckles. It seems well-made (except for the wheel issue), and I like the fabric (with the mesh on the side) but overall, I expected much more from Maclaren. We're getting the Uppababy G-Luxe next.
