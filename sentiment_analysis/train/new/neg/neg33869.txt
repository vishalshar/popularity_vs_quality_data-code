It would be a good product except for one flaw.  The shoulder straps at the back below the buckles are made by splitting a larger strap with a hot knife.  The result is poky plastic thorns along the inside edge of the two straps.  If you put this on a kid with a bare back, those thorns are going to hurt.  The child will not be happy and you will not be happy.  I recommend not buying this unless the manufacturer corrects this cost-cutting manufacturing method or unless you are sure your child's clothing will protect him/her from the plastic thorns.
