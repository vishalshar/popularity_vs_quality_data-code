This toybox does hold a LOT of toys, and is fully ready to use when it arrives at your house.  However,  i ASSUMED the lid was hinged.  Its not.  My one year old can't get into his toys.  I have to leave the lid off because it will hit his head or smash his fingers if I leave it on.  The lid just sort of sets on top of the box.  I probably wouldn't have bought this had I looked at it in person.  The colors do match his room perfectly.  He is still to short to reach anything unless it is on the top.
