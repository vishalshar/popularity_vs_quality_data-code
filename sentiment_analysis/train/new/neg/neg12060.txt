I am actually writing this review as I look for a replacement item for these edgers! I had received a alphabet mat as a gift for my daughter and I it was missing the edgers which mean that dust and dirt accumulated on the puzzle ends and it was supper difficult to clean so I bought these a couple of months ago to eliminate the problem. Instead of eliminating the problem I received new problems: 1) the fit is not good at all there is a lot of space and nooks from the puzzle to the edgers and the corners are even less of a fit, 2) although my alphabet mat is facing up with the textured size for some odd reason the edgers and corners only fit face down which is the smooth size and it looks like it doesn't belong at all 3)this set is too small ---I guess this is my bad and I need to purchase more---but since I am not happy with the product I will not be purchasing more and now my puzzle is half edged 4) the wave desing of the edgers is super hard to clean and sweep so the main reason for purchasing which was to eliminate dust and durt accomulation has not been resolved because the fit and wave design does not help at all!Anyways that was way to much venting for one item but as a mom you get frustrated when things don't work properly as you have little time and streght left in the day to fix them - last and MOST important - because the pieces don't fit properly I daughter takes them apart and chews on them and ultimately makes a huge mess!!!!
