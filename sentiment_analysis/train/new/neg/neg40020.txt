Bought two sets of these and was extremely disappointed. Quality is very poor and looks like it would not dry the baby's skin once used. Can't speak to the integrity of it being organic; there was a scent that seemed to smell like some type of processing element/chemical. Of course it is much cheaper than other "organic" towels; so I guess I got what I paid for.
