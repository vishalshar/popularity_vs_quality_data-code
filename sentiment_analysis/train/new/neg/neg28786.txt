I'm not sure GroVia has a quality control department. I have had both diapers and wipes bearing their name that I love, and ones that I hate.About the wipes, specifically. First, the ones I received from Amazon are the old ones (pink packaging, I think it says GroBaby rather than GroVia), and those are stiff and don't stretch, very papery, wouldn't buy them again. But the newer ones, labeled GroVia in the blue package can be wonderful. Pull one out of the package and give it a stretch and it just puffs up, feels much like light flannel and is very durable. My daughter has eczema and otherwise extremely sensitive skin, reacts to ninety percent of what we expose her to, but she's never had a problem with these wipes. However, as appears to be the m.o. over at GroVia, you can get scratchy, stiff, papery wipes now and then too. Same package, seemingly different product. Can't explain it.One tip if you do use these - store them upside down. The liquid tends to settle and each wipe will be increasingly wet until the last one is in a puddle if you just leave it top up. But if you flip the pack over after each use, it all stays fairly consistent.
