I with my first child I never realized you were supposed to change the valves or membranes. Pump worked fine for the 4 months I used it. When I had my daughter and was going to be using it again (less than 1.5 years later) I read I should get new valves and membranes. I ordered these and they are terrible after 2 weeks use. The membrane is floppy and saggy. I bet I could use the old medela ones from my son and they would still work better. :( Disappointed.
