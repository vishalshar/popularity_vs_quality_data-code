This worked really well for my baby. Being able to bring it with me for long visits and have a place for the baby to sleep that was his and not a strange place was great. The only down side is it broke down very easy. I was really hoping to keep this for when I had other babies but from moving it around and the sides bending it broke down pretty quick and started to fall apart.
