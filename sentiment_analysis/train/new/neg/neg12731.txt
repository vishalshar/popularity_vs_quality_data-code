It's cute and soft, but it'a not actually a swaddle/doesn't really swaddle the baby so that's a little misleading. As you can see from other pictures provided, they can get their arms out. And there's no way to get this thing tight enough to prevent that. That's great if your baby likes that but in our case she will only stay asleep if fully swaddles. This is more of a sleep sack. Also, it says in one of the questions that you don't have to use the bow, but I don't see how it will stay closed without it. The couple of times I got my daughter in it, it came undone because the Velcro strips are really thin and not super strong. They're long, but it would really help if they were wider.Three starts because I can use it for things such as a tummy time blanket (albeit an expensive one) but definitely does not swaddle the baby. It's a baby sleeping bag.
