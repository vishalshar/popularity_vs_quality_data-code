I gave this as a Christmas gift & the stitching began unravelling the first time it was washed.However, upon contacting Amazon regarding this issue, they promptly initiated a mutually satisfactory resolution.I have purchased numerous items via Amazon (especially Bubble Guppies products for our 20-month-old granddaughter) and have been very happy with these products, as well as with the prices.
