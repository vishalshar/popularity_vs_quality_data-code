I received this set for a shower gift and have been unhappy with it.  It's not worth $29.99 thats for sure.  The darn oral/rectal thermometer didn't even work.  After reading the other reviews of this, I see I am not the only one who had trouble with it.  I have had it open for a few months now, before I ever had to use it, so it's too late to take back or else I would.As for the ear thermometer, it has given me fairly consistent temps.  The only things I do not like about it is that it came with probe covers that you have to replace.  5 years from now when I still have the thermometer they may not be making the probe covers as replacements.  Summary...it's on OK ear thermomter, but not great.  The smaller one is a big joke, make sure to have another one as back up.
