I was really excited about this since it's one of the only travel high chairs that doesn't slip over the top of chairs. Our family has a lot of tall or decorative-backed chairs, so that wasn't an option for us. Still, I had a hard time getting this tight enough not to slide down. The lower strap that goes around the bottom was almost too short for some of the chairs, too. We ended up not using hardly at all, and feeing our son in someone's lap instead.
