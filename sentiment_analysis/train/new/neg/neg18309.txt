These bottles are brightly colored and fun to grip for little ones. If your child is past the teething stage these should be just fine. They are also easy to clean. However, steer clear of these if you have a child who is still teething. The description for this product both online and on the packaging says that they are for 2 and up but the spouts can easily be chewed up. This could lead to pieces being accidentally swallowed due to flaking etc. I had to throw the two bottles that we had into the trash because of this and felt bad for doing so because my son loved them. The company might want to adjust the age for these to at least 3.
