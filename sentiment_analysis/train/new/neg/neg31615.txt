I've been pleased with this mattress for the most part. It's reasonably firm and is fine for a children's mattress. However, it is not as comfortable as I would have hoped. You can feel the springs, particularly near the edges, and it has too much "give" to it around the perimeter, which makes it difficult to sit on. Overall, it feels like the kind of mattress you'd expect in a dorm room (perhaps that's too unkind). We bought a pillow top for it that improved it dramatically, but if you're already spending $750 for it, you might balk at an extra $200. We bought it for $599 from here in 2012. I guess the price has increased. I'd recommend it at $599, but at the current price, no thanks.
