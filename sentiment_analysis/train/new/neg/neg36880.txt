Be aware that these decals WILL peel the paint off of your wall.  I put mine up in January 2016 and am writing this review in December 2016 because my 2-year-old has started peeling the decals in his playroom.  Other decal brands have come of without damage, but these have heavily damaged the paint.  One of the bubbles peeled an entire circle of paint off the wall, then pulled chips of paint off the wall when my son tried to re-stick it somewhere else and I removed it.These will require me to repaint the room - very disappointed.UPDATE: I contacted the company and they suggested I use a hair dryer on the medium setting to remove the decals.  This did not help (I will upload a photo of the paint peeled even with the hair dryer).  At the highest setting, the paint was spared, but the decal left globs of glue on the wall that will need to be scrubbed off before I can repaint, which is now necessary due to this product.Also, note that my room was professionally painted in 2015 with a high quality paint.  This is not a paint issue.
