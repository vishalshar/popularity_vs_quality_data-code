Appearance is very nice and I have gotten compliments and my son does like to chew on it but I'm not in love with it because it pulls hair. Any hair that is within reach of the necklace gets trapped between the beads or gets wrapped around them and ends up getting pulled out. I even have to move it out of the way when not in use and my son is sitting in my lap with his back to my chest because when he leans back his head rubs against it and ends up pulling his hair. I think it might just be the nature of the round beads and how close together they are. I purchased another teething necklace by FAVEfemme that I absolutely love.
