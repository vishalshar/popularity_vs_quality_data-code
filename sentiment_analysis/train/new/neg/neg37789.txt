This carrier is quick and easy to put on, I love the clasps and it's not too hard to adjust. That being said it has no lumbar support and is very hard on your back. I had painful pinching in my shoulders and my baby is barely 11 lbs. Invest in a carrier with lumbar support, be it a wrap, mei tai or a carrier with the extra strap if you want to carry your baby for any length of time.
