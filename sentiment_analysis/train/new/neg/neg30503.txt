First tip don't wait 6 weeks to give you baby a bottle!!!  I did and now I am paying the price of her being 4 months and still won't take a bottle unless so very hungry (aka daycare) but she is adapting the wrong way and holding out all day (daycare) and waking up all night to eat.  When I was on leave she ate all day and slept for 8-10 hours at night.  I am lucky to now get a 4 hour stretch of sleep...Anyway...these nipples were too small for my breastfeed baby.  Plus the latex nipple smelled like latex even after boiling.  I'm pretty sure that's not something a baby would like to smell while eating.  I don't know if you could taste the rubbery taste, but either way she didn't like these and I bought 8, yes 8!!! different brands, the gerber, nuk, medela, mimijumi, Lansinoh mOmma, 1st years breastflow, advent, and tommee.  Tommee was the winner, she still doesn't like it, but it is the one that doesn't make her cry at the sight of it and she will "play" with it and drink something.  It isn't any of these brands fault, its mine for listening to the lactation consultant.  She is my 2nd baby, my first we introduced a bottle 2nd day of life and she never had nipple confusion and I nursed for for 14 months!Good luck!
