The canvases are really nice and will look good in the nursery.  The preinstalled hangars are a nice touch as well.  The only con to these canvases is that the corners look like they're either wearing thin or they were damaged during shipping.  Not enough of a con to send back, but it would've been nice to have a nice product all around.
