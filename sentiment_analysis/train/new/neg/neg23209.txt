We've had this for a few months now and already had to order two replacement toys. The spinners no longer make sounds and my daughter can pull the book right off. This is described as "rocking," but that means an active child (like my 8-month-old) can rock it right off its stand. She can't tip it over, but she can move it all over the place.That said, she does love playing in it for about 20 minute stretches. She especially loves the animal sound/ music box. She enjoys being able to move herself around and rediscovering each new toy. Standing up in it has made her legs and upper body stronger, too.The concept of these activity centers/ "exersaucers" is great, but they need to have extremely sturdy construction. This one doesn't have it.
