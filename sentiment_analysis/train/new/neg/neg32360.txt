I purchased these bottles after receiving one in the mail, trying it and really liking it.  The ones I received leak all the time.  I made sure the triangles on the side were lined up each time and it just did not matter.  My husband and I got so frustrated we stopped using them.  Recently my baby has begun to eat larger amounts of BM and formula so I pulled out the larger 8 oz bottles to give them a try.  They worked much better, hardly ever leaked.  Unfortunately they cannot withstand being heated in a bottle warmer or having hot water placed inside them.  Mine cracked and spilled water all over the place.  Very inconvenient because I was at a work meeting and had to run to buy a new bottle.  I'm finished using these bottles.  They are a nice looking bottle and a good idea, just poorly executed and need major adjustments.
