This rocker is very uncomfortable for breastfeeding. It leans back too far and even with a breastfeeding stool I have to lean forward to breastfeed. I am 5' 5". The armrests are way too low to do anything, you can't rest your arms on them. I have terrible back pain now and have to go to physical therapy. It was also a pain putting together. A piece of the leg broke. The company sent me new pieces. The chair looks nice but is not practical and I so wish I could still return it.
