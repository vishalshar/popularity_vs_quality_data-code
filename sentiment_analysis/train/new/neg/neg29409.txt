This product was perfect for us.  Having a color video with night-vision is awesome.  Saves you trips up and down the stairs, and lets you see what the baby is doing without having to peek in their rooms.However, the reception on these is not great.  They interfere with everything wireless.  The camera killed my wifi, and even changing channels on both didn't help.  I had to move my wifi around.  Everything from wifi, cordless phones, cellphones and especially bluetooth create massively annoying static.I hope to find a better product by my next child, because when they work properly they are very convenient.I will admit that I am a gadget freak and probably didn't have room for one more 2.4GHz wifi device in my house.
