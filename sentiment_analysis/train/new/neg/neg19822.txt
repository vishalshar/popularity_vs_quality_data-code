I originally bought these bags with hopes of using them to line a diaper pale in my home diaper changing area.  Unfortunately, I cannot even find something at the Container Store that these would fit. The medium is incredibly narrow and the large is incredibly wide!I would give them fewer than 3 stars, but they are advertised as "tote" bags. So, I guess I'm partially responsible for the disappointment in them not working as pail liners. However, I still have some problems with them even as tote bags.Mainly, they aren't actually that easy to open and close (like zipper wet bags are). You have to use two hands, and if you have an especially wet or soiled diaper, the inside rim of the bag becomes wet/dirty. You then get you hands in that mess. When changing a cloth diaper, who needs the extra mess of all the diapers that have gone into the bag before it?
