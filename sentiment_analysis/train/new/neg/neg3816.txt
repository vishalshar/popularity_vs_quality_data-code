Ubbi, your diaper pail needs to go back to drawing board because there are major design flaws. See photo. I have had many garbage bags fail in this pail from Ubbi bags, to Hefty ultra strong flex, and now industrial strength 30 gl bags.  The reason for this is the stupid lip this trash can has at the top for the seal and duel lid to act as an anti-smell capsule.  Every time the bag will catch on this lip and tears. Fail at least once a week now and I have 2 kids.  So if you're a dilegent parent that loves to take out diaper trash every other day, then this isn't your problem.  But if you're like me and only empty the pail once it gets full, then this pail is your enemy number one because you'll need to pick up bursted diaper bombs every time.  I've gone to the site to review their recommendation on how to remove and it's not helpful...at all!!  See screen capture.  Design flaw number two, eventually all of the rubber feet will fall apart. I've had this pail for few years now and age would be a given but it could be due to the excessive picking-up of the diaper pail and having to empty it out into an unbroken garbage bag many, many times.  Third design flaw is the lid which does not come off for child proof reasons. Since the lid doesn't come off, this makes it 10 times more difficult to dump out this foul soup smell hell.  In the long run, this diaper pail is just a trash can that holds in smell well. If a trash can gives you more stress on top of the parenting stress you already have, is it worth it?"
