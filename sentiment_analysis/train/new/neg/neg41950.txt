At first glance, the all-in-one bassinet, changing table and portable playpen was exactly what I wanted so our newborn could sleep in our bedroom before we transitioned him to the nursery.  However, once we got this home and put it together, we quickly saw that it is not practical for us:- difficult to assemble/disassemble, so this is really like a stationary piece of furniture rather than something you can move around your home (let alone travel with).- huge - we could not fit it through our doorways once it was assembled- not portable - wheels are not exposed once it's in its carry bag, so you have to carry the full weight of the playard rather than rolling it like a suitcase.  Other playards (Combi) pack up like a rollaboard suitcase, making them much more portable and convenient.- canopy and toys are super-cheap and not worth the extra money: looks like you're paying $90 more for these "upgrades" that are cumbersome, unattractive and poor quality (one velcro tab tore off during assembly).  Save your money and go for a more basic model.We are now returning this item and shopping for something that better suits our needs.
