I just unboxed this and plugged it in.  It's not very loud and the audio sounds like it's underwater.  I will probably be returning this unit.  It seems extremely cheap.  The units themselves are so lightweight they won't stand up on their own on a carpeted surface, and they don't pick up much ambient noise if you're trying to use it outside two bedrooms.
