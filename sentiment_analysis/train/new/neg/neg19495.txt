Right out of the box, this monitor never worked.  We installed the batteries, allowed the parent unit to charge for more than 24 hours, and it refused to pair with the nursery unit.  Going through the manual pairing process did not help, and in addition the parent unit's battery would never get fully charged, even after 48+ hours charging.Hoping this was just a fluke, we returned the monitor and Amazon quickly sent us a replacement.  Unfortunately this unit had exactly the same issues.  At this point I realized that this product is garbage, so I ordered a Phillips monitor that has worked flawlessly from day one.
