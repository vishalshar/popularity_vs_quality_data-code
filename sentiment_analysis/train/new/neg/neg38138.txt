This tub is exactly what we were looking for to take along on our trip to the beach. Very compact and comes in a box that took up very little space in our car.  Overall, I am happy with this product. My 10 month old son enjoyed bath time in it. I felt that he was safe and secure in the tub.  He did not slip and slide on the plastic bottom. If he wobbled, the inflated sides protected his head. And the sides are high enough that there seemed no chance of him falling out. He is about 30" and 20 lbs, and this tub was a good fit for him. Not nearly as much room for splashing and playing as his Primo tub that we have at home, but perfect for vacation. I would not want to use this as my primary tub though because it is smaller than what we are used to. The horn is a nice feature. My son fit just fine on the smaller end of the tub, and the horn kept him in place as he sat up. However, I did switch him to the other end of the tub during bathing so he could recline more. This helped me bathe his legs and bottom. Also, I prefer him to recline as I shampoo and rinse his hair.  I gave this product 3 stars for one reason:  one of the valves used to inflate the tub was defective. I had no problem inflating the bottom of the tub and the horn, but I could not get the sides to inflate. I realized that the valve was sealed shut. There was no way to blow air into it. I was about to give up and figured I'd have to return the product to the seller when I got home, but I decided to use a knife to poke a hole through the valve. I was afraid I might damage the valve, but I had no choice if I wanted this tub to work for me. Fortunately once I poked a hole in the valve, I was able to inflate it without any further problems. This is a defect that should have been caught by the manufacturer/quality control before being shipped out to consumers.  Other than this issue, I am happy with this product.
