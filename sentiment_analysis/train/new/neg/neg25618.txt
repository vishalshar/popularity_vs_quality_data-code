This is a very pretty floral crib sheet with striking colors and a pattern that would likely please mature tastes more than those that are infantile.  I find the pinks in this sheet to be a bit orange toned, making them a bit closer to a salmon pink than a traditional baby pink color.  It is made of 100% cotton that held up well under washing with no major shrinking or fading.  Like all cotton sheets, it gets softer the more you wash it.  That said, it is does not function in any way that is superior to other major brands of crib sheets.  It is interesting that thread count is not mentioned on the packaging, which is customarily advertised on bedding products in this premium price range.The slogan on the printed materials of this Dwell Studios fitted sheet says "Big style for little people.  Dwell Studio products are designed for real life."  At the current listed price of $40 for a single cotton fitted crib sheet, I confess to being a bit appalled.  Without mention of superior quality thread counts, I find this to be a bit overpriced for what you actually are getting.  It seems the  premium value is in the artistic design rather than functionality.It's "OK", if that's what you're looking for.  It'll look great in the crib at Grandma's house.Made in China.Machine Wash COLD!  (Another issue, if you ask me.)
