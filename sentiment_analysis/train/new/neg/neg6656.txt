Sometimes pacifiers aren't funny.Enter Mustachifier.The binky that you think will be hilarious but your kid won't want anything to do with it because it's like sucking on a rock. Also, compared to "normal" pacifiers, this one is smaller and my kids did not like that since kids often enjoy what is familiar. If they somehow manage to get past that, then everyone laughing at them looking like a little Mario or Luigi will surely get them to go back to a regular pacifier.Exit Mustachifier. Funny in theory, but one of those products that ends up in the trash after a couple laughs. Does not function well at all as a regular pacifier and it will be difficult to get your kid to stay with it long enough to even get a picture. Yes, I thought it would be funny too, but it ended up being one of those rare Amazon purchases that found it's way to the trash can. I'm sorry to say that as I certainly looked forward to our son looking like a little Mario or Luigi... but this is probably only best for the Wahluigis out there. Yes, that's a character now.
