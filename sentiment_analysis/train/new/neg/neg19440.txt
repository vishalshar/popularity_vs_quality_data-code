We absolutely LOVE our Orbit Baby system and cannot rave enough about it. We have the car seat, stroller, stroller seat, etc. We got this for our stroller seat because we live in the PNW and I knew I was going to need it more for the times it started sprinkling on our walks than I would for the sun, unfortunately. In my opinion, this sunshade is not really the same quality as the rest of the Orbit Baby products. It is rather flimsy and doesn't sit well in multiple positions. It always looks a little uneven to me, which bugs me. It also doesn't sit "halfway" very well at all, it essentially is for all the way back, or all the way forward, with one other position somewhere in there that semi-works. The canvas material is great against sun and rain, I like how far down it goes on the stroller seat, and the colors are cute, but I don't like the hardware aspect of this sunshade at all. I also think it's rather ridiculous that the stroller seat is so expensive, yet it doesn't even come with one of these, and a flimsy sunshade shouldn't be $80. The stroller seat should definitely come with this built in.
