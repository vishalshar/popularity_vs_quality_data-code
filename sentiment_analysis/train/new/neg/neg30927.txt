This toilet seat is not bad; however, I would not recommend it for the price unless you are desperate for one that fits an elongated toilet seat.Pros:Fits pretty well in my oblong toilet seat.Seems comfortable for toddler.Cons:The handle on the back hits the lid and prevents it from sitting totally flat.The device underneath to secure it in place does not fit my toilet seat.Does not have handles so my toddler seems slightly uneasy sitting so high.
