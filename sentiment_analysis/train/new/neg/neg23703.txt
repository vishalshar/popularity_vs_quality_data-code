I wish the pacifier I received was as vibrant looking as the picture. The sparkles are pretty much nonexistent, you need a magnifying glass to see them and the princess is written in a barely there silver tone that actually looks partially worn off... I am really sad to have to have to give my first bad review out of the many purchases I have made via Amazon. :(
