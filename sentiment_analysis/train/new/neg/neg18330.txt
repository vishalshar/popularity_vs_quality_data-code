My son was so excited to put this clock in his room. It looked great but that was only for about two weeks. The time was never correct, which didn't bother him(cause he's only 3)but after the hour hand stopped working my son got upset, even at this age he knows that something is not right. I found out that the whole clock movement needs to be replaced, which is about $10, I think I will have to do that cause my son really likes it.
