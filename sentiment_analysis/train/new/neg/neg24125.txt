Although these pads get the job done technically speaking I prefer other disposable changing pad products. The PeeWee pads are pretty small so unless your child is a small mess maker these don't cover the needed area. I have a baby boy that waits until you take off his diaper to poop...so I need a sturdier pad. These also wrinkle/ bunch up easy because they are so thin and they are only good for multi uses if you get absolutely nothing on them. However, now that my son is a little older and not peeing at me every time I change his diaper these are handy for the diaper bag. But again they are only big enough for his butt, not his whole body so I still lay down a blanket first when in public changing areas. My favorite disposable pads, although a little more pricy are the Munchkin A&H Disposable Changing Pad - 10 Pack.
