I'm disappointed in the durability of this mattress. I was taken aback when it first arrived because it had a terrible chemical stink. My husband assured me it was just factory fresh smells. So we let it air out sufficiently before putting it into the nursery. It fit perfectly in the crib, it's not excessively tight but just barely snug so it keeps the safety without squishing the mattress. When my three month old (who was only slightly above average in size) transitioned to using this more exclusively from the bassinet, by four months there was a noticeable dip in the middle of the mattress. I've tried flipping it over to see if the other side is sturdier; however, I'm not overly optimistic. I fear there are better mattresses for the money.
