I bought this on the go booster seat because we travel a lot to visit family but it was very disappointing.PROS:1. Easy to install2. Inflates without any effort.3. Compact and easy to carry.CONS: (which outweighed by a lot the PROS)1. Extremely unsteady. No matter where I installed it or how I installed it that chair could flip around with my daughter in it. It actually did!2. It doesn't fit well in every chair. Depending on the dinning room chair size you will be able to use this booster or not.3. After constant use the chair doesn't stay inflated.Overall, don't waste your money on this booster seat! Is dangerous for children who like to move around which I am pretty sure they are the majority.
