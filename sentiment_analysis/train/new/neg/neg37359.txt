It's a great on-the-go emergency potty for the car. I love the idea of using a diaper because you can easily throw it away. The only thing that makes me not give it a full 5-star is that it's not really secure. When you set up the potty with the diaper, the two parts tend to just fall apart as my little boy starts to sit on it. If they can make this so that it's more secure (maybe a latch or something to make it stay together), it would be perfecto! ;) It does it's job though, I just have to hold it still for him :)
