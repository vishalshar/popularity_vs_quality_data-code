I have never reviewed a purchase before but I feel like new parents deserve to know that this mattress might keep their baby from sleeping. We moved our baby to this mattress from her bassinet. At the time she was having some sleep disruptions. Over the course of a month her sleep got worse and worse until she would only sleep for 2 hours and often woke up 15 minutes after we put her down. We were so sleep deprived and it was traumatizing for all of us. On a trip to our in laws she slept eight hours straight, and when we got back home (after trying her on this mattress one more horrible night) we tried a different mattress and she slept eight hours again! The outer cover on this mattress doesn't fit snugly and creates waves on the top of the mattress that I think makes baby feel like she's falling when she sinks down into one of them. It also makes a loud crinkling noise when baby moves.I feel like this product has exhausted my poor baby and robbed us of a month of sanity.  We were considering sleep training which would have been just awful.All babies are different but there are clear problems with this mattress that could keep yours from sleeping.
