I went to Babies R Us and looked at all the covers they had - I liked a few of them, but I really liked this one best.  It provided both coverage over the face (yet still lets baby breath) and was so easy to put on - and I don't have to take it off each day.  They only had it in pink so I ordered it here.The one drawback (and I guess this is a biggie for me since I am now on the search for a different cover) is that it's so short in the feet.  Since I've gotten this, my 6 month old's feet are smushed inside.To help you visualize, just place a blanket or something over the carseat and pull it taught with the shape of the seat.  If your child's feet are longer (or if his shoes are on), he's kicking it.  It drives my poor son crazy.This may be very good, or close to perfect if you have a newborn, however, if your baby is a few months old at the beginning of the cold season, you may want to keep looking.PROS:  Cute, keeps baby very warm, does not get in the way of car seat operation at all.CONS:  too short
