This toilet seat reducer doesn't fit our toilet seat correctly, while the ladder is wobbly and the step is too narrow for my child to turn around easily. What I really hate about it is how bulky it is when taken off the toilet and folded, because the seat reducer is so deep. Nevertheless I am giving it three stars because my three-year-old daughter likes it and has been using it happily; it is light enough that she can take it off the potty and fold it against the bathtub when she leaves the bathroom. She learned toilet training about 9 months ago on a little frog potty.Other drawbacks: the ladder is barely tall enough to reach our toilet, which is not very high, so I don't think it would work at all for a high toilet. We have a common Bemis oblong toilet seat, and the reducer is too wide to fit it correctly. Finally, the little tongue that goes under the toilet seat doesn't seem very functional to me.
