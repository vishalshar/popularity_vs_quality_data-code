I have been pleased with a number of my other Munchkin purchases, so I decided to get this bottle brush to replace one that I have overused. Unfortunately, this brush is not useful for us. The blue bristles are so stiff that they cannot get into the corners of bottles. For some of the bottles, the brush hardly fits into the mouth of the bottle at all (4-5 oz storage bottles from the hospital, and regular Dr. Brown's bottles). And, there is no way this brush can be used at all on any pump parts. The white bristles are actually more flexible, but since the blue bristles are at the top and bottom, it makes it virtually impossible for the white bristles to get into corners. We have toyed with the idea of cutting off most of the blue bristles, but that is pointless.The "nipple" brush, which is at the base of the brush, is slightly more useful, but there is a bent over piece at the tip of this brush, which makes it slightly too large to fit into some parts. Also, these bristles are also quite stiff, but this part of the brush is still more useful.I would recommend getting another brush, like the Dr. Brown's bottle brush, instead. They also sell tiny nipple brushes. Both of these items are more useful than this Munchkin one.We have been using this brush to wash vegetables.
