I purchased one of these when Our oldest child was beginning to toddle around the house.  At the time I think I gave it one of the best reviews I've ever submitted for a product.  That was in no small part due to it's sturdiness.  Well, I finally managed to chip the darn thing and so decided to purchase a new one.  I wish I'd held onto the old chipped one.  This product has been redesigned (a fact that somehow escaped my attention when I reordered).  Rather than a solid piece of plastic for the shield, which made sense from a safety stand point, but which probably added to shipping costs.  They chose to introduce a two piece shield that must be joined together before installation.  This appears to have been a terrible blunder because the two pieces, even when properly joined according to manufacturers directions, seem determined to separate and therefore this becomes a useless, cumbersome and even somewhat hazardous piece of junk, constantly falling apart while you are trying to cook.To be fair, the manufacture clearly states that this device is not intended to prevent a child from burning himself when meddling around the stove, rather it is intended to give the parent a critical few seconds to react when a child comes meddling at the stove.  Those seconds allow the parent to intervene and prevent an accident from occurring.  The device is only intended to assist in the prevention of an accident.  That said, The old device did a much better job of deterring the child's reach, than the current model does, for obvious reasons.  Our shield has become so liable to break apart with the slightest disturbance that I have worried our children might accidentally upset it while walking past, and be injured by the falling pieces.I'm pretty disappointed in the changes that were made to this.  It was one useful, reliable aid when cooking with my kids nearby.  Now, I am just barely getting by without burning myself, while struggling not to distrupt it when preparing meals.
