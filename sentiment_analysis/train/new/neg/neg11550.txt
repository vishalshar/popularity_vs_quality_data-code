I hate this stroller.  The longer I have it the more I hate it.  I haven't owned it a year and one of the trays is broken on one side.  The seats are thin and hard. The back seat isn't really a seat and since it converts into the sitting seat it wasn't really made for comfort.  The back seat doesn't recline easily and if you pull on the drawstrings too hard they will detach from the stroller which is a pain.  The back seat doesn't fully raise to a comfortable sitting position which makes it very awkward and my toddlers can't sit it in long before they're literally screaming.  It seems so uncomfortable that I have to hurry up to get things done before my daughter has had enough and wants out.  Stress.  The front foot rest is a joke and detaches easily.  The canopies are short and useless and the front one doesn't stay open.  It is very hard to steer and I often find myself desperately trying to maneuver in and out of positions.  The latch is flimsy so every time I try to lock the stroller before lifting it, I have to do it over and over.  Stress.  When I take it out to use, it opens and can cause some kind of injury.  It folds easily and isn't really that heavy but it doesn't matter.  Don't buy it.  You will be stressed.  Now I have to find another stroller and it took forever for me to settle on this one.
