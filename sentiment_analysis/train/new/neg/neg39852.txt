I'm always seeking out alternatives to disposable/one-use products, so after hearing several friends rave about cloth menstrual pads I decided to give these a try. The designs are cute and the fabric soft and comfortable, but they really do not stay in place for me. They are the same length as my normal pantyliner, but since they slip and bunch a bit, they don't protect my underwear as well as the disposables. I've hung onto them in case of emergency, but they were not a good fit for me. I thought about buying a longer style, but instead went for Diva Cup Diva Cup #2 Post Childbirth, Cup and am very happy, though I would still like an alternative to disposable pantyliners.
