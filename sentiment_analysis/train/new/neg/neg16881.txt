These say dishwasher safe and microwaveable on the bottom, but after running them thru the dishwasher a handful of times, they all have that white damage to the plastic... I have tried scrubbing and it doesn't come off. I'm not sure if it's bad for the kids to eat out of them, but I'm not willing to find out. So, these will now be used for the toy kitchen.
