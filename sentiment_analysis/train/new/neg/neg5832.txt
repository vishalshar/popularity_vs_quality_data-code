I bought this for my 3 year old son and while it is very cute, it is already too short for him.The material thickness is about right for the price but the big issue is that the blanket that is attached ends about 2Inches before the already short mat ends.  It frustrates my son because it only covers the middle of him.I don't recommend the product mainly based on this weird design element
