I was so excited about a pacifier for 18mo+, but unfortunately it didn't work for us. We've been using the Avent pacifiers and the nipple shape is so different, that our son wouldn't suck on it but would just chew on it or try to suck on it upside down. Also a bummer that the color we received was purple. This would probably have worked out great if our previous pacifiers were a similar shape.
