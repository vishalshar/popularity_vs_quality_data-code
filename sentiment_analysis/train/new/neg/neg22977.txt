I was hoping it had more padding, but the padding was very thin. Also, the part where the shoulder straps are is not connected to anything - the part that goes around the backrest of the cart. The shopping cart seatbelt can't even be used, because there are no holes to thread it through.I can't sew, but I can make a few minor adjustments - I sewed the harness section to the back part, added more stuffing to the back padding and the seat cushion, sewed on some velcro straps so that instead of ties, the velcro can be used to hold it to the cart. I don't mind making adjustments to it, because I don't want to spend more than $20 on a cart cover. It folds a bit bulky now, but it's worth it if my baby is comfy.It is very well sewn and seems sturdy. I have not used it on a highchar yet. I think it's worth it. If you buy this, just stitch the harness section to the back section and you'll be all set.
