I really like these diapers, I love the way that they snap, and the snaps hold up very well.  My only complaint is that they aren't very absorbent compared to the other diapers that I have.  I use them when I know that we have a #2 on deck, though, because they tend to contain it very well, but I have to anticipate leaks if it's only fluid.  I have cloth wipes that I made from receiving blankets and I've taken to folding one as an insert to help these hold up better.
