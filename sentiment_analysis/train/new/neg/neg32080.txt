Pros:1.  multiple zippered pockets outside: 2 roomy zippered pockets on the front, one of which contains a cell phone pocket and a pager pocket; one small zippered pocket on the side of the bag; one vertical zippered pocket on the back; and one pocket with velcro closure on the back perfect for changing pad.2.  double handles on the top of the bag great for grabbing and go.3.  changing mat and stroller clips included.4.  Bag opens very wide, but still held together with out accidentally losing items.5.  Semi rigid structure:  Stands alone but able to be squished with out destroying the bag.Cons:1.  This exterior material looks very prone to rip.2.  The lime one has dark grey interior, making it possibly hard to find things.3.  Too few interior pockets for organization.  It has 2 bottle pockets and one large mesh pocket.
