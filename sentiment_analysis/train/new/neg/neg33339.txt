The handheld video part on this thing feels like a toy, it's so lightweight and flimsy.  After only a month the video "on/off" button stopped working!  So we are going to burn a picture into the screen at some point soon I'm sure.  I am so annoyed that all of their monitors work differently with the cameras.  We had the slim & secure for a while too and the video part just burnt a big black spot in the screen out of no where. That one felt a lot more like a real monitor and less like a little fake toy video.  So now I have 2 cameras and no monitor and they will replace cameras but not the monitors which is what seems to break so easily!  Very annoying, what a waste of money.
