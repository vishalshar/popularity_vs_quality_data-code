I bought this for my grandson when he was about nine months old.  He didn't start using it until he was about one.  He is now almost two.  Twice in the past week, while he was rocking on it, it completely flipped over frontwards, right over the top of him.  Luckily he wasn't hurt, just very scared and upset.  My son had to put it away, fearing it would happen again.  I thought it was an adorable rocker when I bought it, however something needs to be readjusted on the rocker to keep this from happening.  It says it holds 80 to 100 lbs., and he is only about 30.  I wonder if this has happened to any other children with these rockers?
