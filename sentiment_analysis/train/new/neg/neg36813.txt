Our two year old daughter, who is under average weight, tried to get into this seat and the side split. Isn't sturdy enough and a bit too soft. It would have been perfect if it would have been a little stiffer or wider at the sides. I wouldn't buy it again unless the design improves. Expensive for quality level.
