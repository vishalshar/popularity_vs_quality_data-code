I ordered these by mistake, I thought I was ordering the drop ins. That said, they work well once you get the hang of it. However, they only hold 3 oz even though the bags say 4 oz and I couldn't get them to work with the newest set of bottles that have the angled neck option, they would always leak. They worked well with all of the older versions of the bottles though. I had 3 different types from 2005, 2009 and 2011 and they worked fine with those, no leaking. Can't use them again because my little one has started to drink 4 oz and I'm still stuck with 200+ as I ordered 300. Sigh... What a waste of money!!
