If your baby is one of those well behaved ones that don't squirm as you try to position him/her into place, you may want to consider this swing.  My two star rating is due to the simple fact that the safety belts are infuriatingly diffult to clasp, especially if the baby is resisting your effots.  We've tried to use this twice.  Exasperated, we gave it away.
