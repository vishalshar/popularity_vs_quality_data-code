It was never mentioned that in order to expand this gate to its full extension you will need to higher a superhero. I have yet to be able to remove all the old plastic parts in order to replace them with the extending plastic parts, why they even come installed is beyond me. Seven hours later, I have every tool that was once in my garage, inside my house in what was once a lovely guest room, now filled with tinny bits of plastic and every size and type of tool that I own, including saws, flashlights and hammers and some WD40, it didn't help. It became a mission for my daughter and I, we have spent some lovely quality time together. And we don't give up easily, unfortunately we have not been successful, we have failed our mission, this product and all of its bits will retire to the garage, because it is no longer in returnable condition... waste of $ time and back breaking amounts of energy. I'm buying the electric perimeter fence for my dogs, you probably would need to rethink that if you intend to purchase this for an actual baby.
