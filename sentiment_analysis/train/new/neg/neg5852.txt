I was looking to replace the bins in our playroom IKEA Expedit book shelf. The ones we purchased at IKEA were cheap (in price and manufacture) and I was hoping to find something a little more durable, but with style too.  Unfortunately, these did not meet my quality expectations.  I figured that with the price being 4xs what the IKEA ones cost they would be more like a quality canvas fabric.  They're EXACTLY the same construction as the IKEA version (thin, not very sturdy sides, very thin fabric covering).  They are adorable - I'll give them that but I have a feeling they won't last much longer than the ones we are replacing.  They ARE the perfect size for the IKEA expedit book shelf, which can be tricky to find.
