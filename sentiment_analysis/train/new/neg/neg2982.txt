This pillow is too rigid and uncomfortable for my babies.  Who would design a nursing pillow that is hard with square edges?  Silly design.  I ended up folding my maternity pillow up (which is similar to a very long Boppy) and the babies love that instead, since it's much softer with no hard edges.  It's also more malleable so I can pull it closer to my body & make small adjustments, unlike this pillow which has a very large hole in it, and the babies are always falling in.  Small adjustments I would have to make with folded up blankets, which was a pain and took time.  All in all a poor design for babies, and twins in particular, since the sides go straight back, meaning babies' heads have to crane around to the front, very uncomfortable for them.  The sides should go out at an angle.  One pro - I like that the top is angled down towards me so the babies don't go rolling off, and the strap that goes around the back is a good idea though it really should be bigger & softer instead of a thin, uncomfortable strap.
