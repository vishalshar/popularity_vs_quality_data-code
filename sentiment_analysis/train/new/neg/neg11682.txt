This product was not as great as I had hoped it would be...Pros:Cute designDesigned to lastCons:Do not contain wetness any better than other underwear.A bit too tight in the privates for a boy.Hard for a toddler to pull up and down on their own.Very expensive for what you get. I bought these hoping they would contain an accident longer than regular underwear would but they did not perform in this way.**I bought Hanes Boxer Briefs at the same time that I bought these training pants. In the end I use the Hanes and rarely use the Blueberry Training Pants.
