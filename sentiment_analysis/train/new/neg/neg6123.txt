Well, I have had this set for a several months.  I generally use them every night in the dishwasher, but I'll be throwing them out soon.  There is a metal rod in the hinge that is rusting on the large mesh rack.  The small one has the same rod but for whatever reason, it is doing fine.Also, these lie flat in the dishwasher, taking up much room.  I prefer the Munchkin brand of dishwasher basket.  It is tall, and allows better use of space.  It also holds a lot more, and has no metal pieces whatsoever.
