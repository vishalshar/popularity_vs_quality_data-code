We had the Diaper Dekor Plus and it seems that I'm the only reviewer here so far that has had a terrible problem with it having a bad smell.  The first couple of months weren't bad, but after about 3 months or so, it really started to smell bad.  This horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on.We tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell-letting it "air out" outside, cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution, putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner, letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water...we even bought some scented disc type things (can be purchased at Babies R Us) that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse.We continued to use it, but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with Lysol or something.  Eventually we used it less and less, and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago-we'd had it for almost 2 years.  We knew there was no way anyone else would want to use it with that smell and knowing they couldn't get rid of it.  It was a real shame because aside from the smell, it was a great product.
