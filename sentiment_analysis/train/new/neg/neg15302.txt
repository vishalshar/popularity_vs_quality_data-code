I purchased this bag because I was flying with my infant, who would be sitting in his car seat in his own seat on the plane. We were taking a long trip, and I wanted my Bugaboo while we were there.  My options were to buy a snap & go just for this trip or purchase this bag to use for this and subsequent trips through the years. I went back and forth on what to do because of the cost and other reviews describing the size of the thing, but finally decided to buy it to protect our expensive stroller and I figured we would ultimately get more use out of the bag through the years than a snap & go.This bag is HUGE.  I was flying alone with my baby, and it was the first time navigating the airport with him in tow, so I literally practiced in my living room with attaching it to my stroller to carry (did it with two Mommy Hooks) and opening up the bag, breaking down the stroller, and getting the bag zipped up.Folded up - the bag is the size of a garment bag. With the stroller in it, the thing comes to hip-height. The airline workers at the gate scoffed at the size of it and I heard them grumble, "I can't believe this is a gate check stroller," under their breath.  Whatever - this is a nice stroller that is supposed to last me for all of my kids.I was able to quickly break down the stroller, and good samaritans helped me wheel it down the jetway since I had the car seat and diaper bag.  So, ease of use is okay. I deducted a few stars because of the size and price - but when you spend this much on a stroller, it's worth protecting. Plus, it will be great for storing in between children.  It DID work - my stroller came out fine at both ends.  However, I read on the Bugaboo website after I purchased that use of the bag is not guaranteed and if the stroller is damaged, it is not included in the warranty.
