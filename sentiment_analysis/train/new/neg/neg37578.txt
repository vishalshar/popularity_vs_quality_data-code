Such a cute costume and it looks so darling on my 3 1/2 month old but when I took it out of the packaging it smelled like cigarette smoke and these are a baby costume! So gross so I had to stick it in the dryer with tons of dryer sheets and spray it with smelly spray. So nasty that a company would want their name behind something that smelled so awful! Beware of it BEFORE you put your sweet little baby in it.
