The Pooh Bear is absolutely adorable, but I don't like the sounds at all.  There's a stream with birds, which is actually more wake-up music than go to sleep music.  There's also music combined with waves, but that just ends up sounding staticky.I'm going to take the sound part of a Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds which I love and put it in the Pooh Bear.Oh, and this is a pretty high price for this toy.  I got mine elsewhere for less than half the Amazon price.[Update 17 Oct 2013] Bumped up the review to three stars because I contacted Cloud B and they sold me the soundbox for the Sleep Sheep for just a sawbuck!  They were extremely nice and responsive, it's a great company.  I also ordered a new Pooh soundbox on the theory that maybe mine was messed up, but I don't think it was.  I'll update this in the future if that turns out to be the case [End Update]
