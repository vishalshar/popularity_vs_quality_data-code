First off, there was a chemical smell when I first took it out of the plastic wrap, but that eventually went away after a day or two. And once I put on the mattress cover, you could barely smell it. What I really don't like about this mattress is the indentations my baby's head and feet leave on it even from just a few nights in the same position. I always feel the need to rotate and flip it. But for the price, it serves its purpose.
