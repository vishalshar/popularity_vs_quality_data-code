These are super cute, especially the apple design.  They are also soft and seem to be well made. However they are very small.  Product description says they fit baby from 7-14 pounds.  Our little 12 pounder was popping out of them.  Could barely close the velcro with her inside.  Probably great if your baby is 7-8 pounds and below average length.  Any baby over about 10 pounds and longer than 21 inches is probably not going to enjoy being stuffed into these-- way too small.
