This swaddle wrap seems of good quality, however it did not help one bit after almost 2 weeks of use. The first couple of nights my 5 month old actually woke up more. His twin sleeps through the night and I am desperate to get him to sleep more too, which is why I wad willing to give this product a try.I can see how it could possibly work for some, but not for us. It has 3 pouches with small ball like fillings - one in the front over the chest and two smaller ones over where the arms are. The one on the chest to mimic the gentle weight of a hand on them for comfort, which did not help us.  The concept for the smaller pouches seems to be to help babies arms stay in place while sleeping so they don't wiggle their arms out. This also did not work for us.I gave 3 stars for quality and uniqueness coupled with the fact it didn't work for us.
