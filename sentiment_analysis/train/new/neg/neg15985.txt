I bought this product and thought it was AWESOME and it was....until I left it on the stroller, in the car, on a hot day.  When I tried to use it, the glue or whatever holds it together had heated up and the pieces fell apart.  Worse, the little orange pieces are smaller than a dime and could easily have choked my 9-month old because they fell off in my hand.  I guess if you're only going to use this in the house, good for you, but if it might get hot, don't buy it.  Going to contact the company and see if they refund my money.
