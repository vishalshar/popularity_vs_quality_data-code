I bought these upon recommendation. I read the description on Amazon and saw that they were "biodegradable" and "flushable." However, upon receipt it says on the pkg in fine print "NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SEPTIC TANKS." SO DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A SEPTIC TANK!! I wouldn't have bought them if I'd known and now I'm stuck with $20 worth of these...which I could return but then I'd get stuck with shipping again....which isn't going to be worth it. I guess I'll give them away. BLAH...........
