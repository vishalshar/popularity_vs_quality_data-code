We bought Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo for our main residence. Our baby girl just loved it from the start! She began using it when she was just 3,5 month old and couldn't even sit up on her own yet, so we put a little blanket behind her back so she could feet snug). As her feet couldn't reach the floor yet we put a few big books on the floor underneath. All this worked out just great!! Now that she is 6 month old she doesn't need blanket or books any more. She really loves her jumper and is fascinated by it's vibrant and cheery colors and toys!For our second home we purchased Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper (just wanted to try another jumper for a change). It was a little disappointing to us. Our girl still can not sit in it comfortably even at 6 months. The seat is very wide and shallow and there is nothing I can do to make my baby comfortable. Also the holes for legs are positioned very weird - they are located more toward the front of the seat rather than the middle and it makes my baby tilt forward way too much. She loves the toys on this jumper, but I can tell that she can't reach them very well because of the seat position. She can stay in the jumper for a maximum of 5 minutes and then wants to get out.She can stay in the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo for at least 20 min and always has a blast! It's a joy to watch her jump in it! I would definitely recommend this one for your baby! you will not regret:)
