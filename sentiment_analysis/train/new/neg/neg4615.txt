Not worth it.I searched for a tempered glass screen protector and instead I got a flimsy piece of this plastic paper. However, I am the idiot who didn't read the description thoroughly and assumed it was glass because that is was I put in the search box.$8 is a good price for a tempered glass screen protector. I am furious I paid $8 for a this. I feel like provides absolutely NO protection and worse, now I have to stare at bubbles on the screen.Do yourself a favor, get a tempered glass protector even if it's a couple dollars more.But, if you do want a flimsy screen protector, you could do worse than this product.
