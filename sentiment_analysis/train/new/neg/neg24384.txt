This car seat is a beast to install rear facing. We purchased it to replace the Graco Click Connect infant seat, because our 13 month old son had reached the height limit on it. My husband and I tried to install it in the backseat of my four door Honda Civic one night after putting our son to bed. We read the directions and used a rolled up towel to try and get the right level on the seats. My car has the latch system, but we just couldn't get the strap to pull tightly enough to keep the seat from wiggling significantly. After almost an hour, we gave up and put his old seat base back in. My husband called one of his friends (with two kids a bit older than ours, so he's an experienced car seat installer) to come over the next night. It took too grown men about half an hour of tugging, pulling and pushing to finally get the seat installed tight enough for us to feel our son would be safe sitting in it.Also, once installed rear facing the seat's tilt can't be adjusted, so make sure you have it set to the recline level you want before installing it rear facing. I wouldn't recommend this for an infant, because I don't think it reclines enough for a baby that can't support it's own head, even with the insert. (Unless you have miraculously flat back seats.) We have it on the most reclined position, but even with a towel the tilt of my rear seats makes it so that it's sitting almost upright.  Once installed, I've had no problems with the seat. It's very easy to adjust the height of the shoulder straps and to tighten and loosen the straps. Also, this seat allows the front passenger seat to go back farther than our previous infant car seat. I'd recommend getting a seat cover, to protect against any puking, accidents, or food spills, because trying to clean the seat itself is a nightmare. I look forward to when my son is old enough to sit forward facing, because I think this will make a much better forward facing seat than rear facing.
