The camera that we received was not the camera pictured here.  We needed to have the correct camera in order to pair it with our existing monitor.  Also, this camera was not packaged in original packaging.  We received it in a small box wrapped in bubble wrap without an instruction manual or sales invoice.  It is a newer version of a camera and does not work with our existing monitor.  Very disappointed in the item and sending it back.
