My son just turned 5 months old and as of now he doesn't really enjoy the book.  He chews the first and last "pages" but the book itself is rather stiff and hard to open, and keep open.  I think though that when he's a little older he'll get more use out of the book.UPDATE: This is suppose to be a teething book?  The front picture is paper, as soon as my son really started using it the paper started coming off. I don't recall if the other pictures are paper because i removed toy. I would not recommend this toy.
