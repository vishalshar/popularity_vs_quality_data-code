Was planning on using these for my two year old's lunch at preschool, hoping I could teach her how to open them.  They are very difficult to open and my husband and I struggle to open them ourselves. I will not be able to send them to preschool as I can't expect a busy teacher to sit there struggling to open my daughter's lunch containers! I will find another use for them I'm sure.
