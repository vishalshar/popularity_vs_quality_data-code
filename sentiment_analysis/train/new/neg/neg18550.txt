Loved this Stuff animal blanket love how it's a decorative iteam but also very handy when changing or keeping the baby warm!  One negative would be the size is very small... I got this for a 1 year old who is long for her size but she will most likely outgrow the blanket soon.. People with newborn -6 month would get longer use of it but then Again that's the Beauty of this item turning into decorative piece
