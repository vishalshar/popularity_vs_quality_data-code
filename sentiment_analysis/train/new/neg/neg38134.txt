Pros:InexpensiveEasy to inflateEasy to installWorks with a shower diverter knob on the end of the spoutCuteCons:Didn't last.  Ours deflated after a few months and will not stay inflated longer than a day now.UPDATE:If I could, I'd probably raise this to 3, maybe even 4, stars.Why? As I state in the title, it's cute and does the job.  It's also inexpensive.  When ours died, I looked around for something different.  Something that fit the spout well (like this one does), that stays clean inside (like this one), that works with a shower diverter knob (like this one does)... I didn't find anything decent under $16 and even that one was a gamble about fit.  In the end, I bought another one of these.  At the price, I can buy another if this one pops too.  In the meantime, it has everything I am looking for.
