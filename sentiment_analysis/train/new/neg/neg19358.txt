I was very excited when I ordered this product. I heard great things. When I received it though, it was just the handles and top; no bottle. I thought that couldn't be right... But used an avent bottle instead. It leaks and especially when I have the handles on. I don't know if it would be any different if I actually had the bottle that was suppose to come. If the seller sees this review, I would love for you to send it to me so I can write a 5 star review.
