Although not the fault of the seller, this product has been a constant disappointment. I used the heck out of swaddleme swaddles in the small size and I got really skilled at bundling my kiddo for bed. When he got too big, I ordered the next size up. They are absolutely not the same. The inside velcro is placed too low to hit the corresponding piece when wrapped naturally. The bottom flap of fabric that goes over baby first is way too short.  In my other (same manufacturer) swaddles, I could tuck a good deal of fabric under. With these, they barely close. My son in nowhere near the weight limit and already these seem too small. Very disappointed.
