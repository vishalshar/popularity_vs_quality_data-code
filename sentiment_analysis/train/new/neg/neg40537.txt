i purchased this on my registry for our new crib. I have one for my older son and loved the product. Unfortunately when it arrived I washed it immediately like a good nesting mama to be. When I went to put on the crib I realized it has no Velcro straps to connect between the slats on the crib, only a single strip of Velcro that runs the length of the pad so it doesn't actually connect and stay on my crib. I see now they changed the description so maybe it would be more clear, but when I purchased it there was no mention. Be carful to inspect before washing so you don't miss out of a refund like I did.
