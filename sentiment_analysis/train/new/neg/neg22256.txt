I debated giving this a 4 simply because I use it every day but there are some things that I disliked so I rated a 3.Likes:  Hands-free pumping!  I have a Medela freestyle pump and was able to walk around the house, do laundry, dishes, etc while wearing this.  It truly changed my life.  Prior to using this bra I had to hold the breast pump parts against my chest because if not, they would eventually pop off and make a terrible mess.  The product seems to wash well and doesn't take too long to hang dry.  I like that it zips up the front.  I think that you could probably use any type of pump/nipple shields and it would fit just fine.Dislikes:  The bra hurt my neck and wasn't comfortable to wear.  There were no instructions to tell me how to wear the bra, so I had to figure it out on my own.  After using this for about 2.5 months, I still don't fully understand how one is supposed to use the included straps.  The a straps.  As a woman with large breasts, I need the support of the straps to feel comfortable.  I ended up attaching the straps to one another, creating 1 long strap that I wore in a halter fashion.  This is what caused me great neck pain.  I appreciate the fact that the bra ties in the back so it will fit most any size body but I also think that when you have to readjust or tie it, it's a huge pain and very difficult to get the right fit unless you have someone helping you.  I have large breasts and ordered the size according to the size chart.  This seemed too small to accommodate my breasts when engorged.  There simply wasn't enough material on the front of the bra, so it only covered part of my breasts.Overall, using a pumping bra changed my life because I could get so much more done with a newborn.  On the other hand there were some major design flaws and fit issues.  For the price I think this is a decent/good purchase, especially if your breasts are small to medium sized.
