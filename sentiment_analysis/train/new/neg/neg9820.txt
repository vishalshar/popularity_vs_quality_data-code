I like the toy enough - though the sound is not like that of a relative whose daughter has one. But my major complaint is the packaging it came in. I wanted it to be in some sort of Fisher Price box like I see in stores. Instead, it was wrapped only in dirty looking plastic. I don't want to give this as a gift now and won't. I've already ordered it - a second one - through the Fisher Price site. So, no, I guess you could say I was not happy with this. It was not sold/sent by Fisher Price. I'm surprised, Amazon - and disappointed - which is a rare thing between you and me.
