I purchased these for my son's first birthday. We are doing a construction theme for our little "bulldozer" and thought these would be perfect to place on the tables as decorations and to later give away as prizes.  They are cute and we will definitely use them, but a few have smudged paint on them. They are also smaller than I had hoped, even after reading the description. Just be aware that some may have defects and that they are not full sized rubber duckies.
