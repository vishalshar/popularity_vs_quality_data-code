After agonizing I bought this and then had to send it right back.  It is VERY heavy.  Heavier than the other 4-5 carseats I have been through--so despite the fact that it folds I'm not sure how portable it really is. It also does NOT fit in my car (Mazda CX-7) rear-facing.  I could not get the rear-facing 30-45 degree angle right in my car without sacrificing so much space that it rendered the front passenger seat almost unusable.  It was impossible to place in the center or on the driver side rear seat.  Maybe this seat is wonderful for front-facing only, or people with huge cars.  Seemed like pretty solid construction otherwise.  It IS narrow (which is great if that is what you are looking for).  I ended up ordering and liking another carseat---Britax Marathon.  See my review there if you are looking for a GREAT rear-facing economy-of-space seat!
