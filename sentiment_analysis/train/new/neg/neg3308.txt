This seat is definitely cute and lots of fun!  However, it seems to be a little too much fun as my son has completely missed the purpose because of all of the distractions!Reasons I do not recommend this product:1) LOUD, unadjustable music2) Sensor for when your child uses the potty is much too sensitive; if your child reaches down the sensor blares music telling the child they used the potty3) The music that blares "You did it" then tells the child to get toilet paper...Then the toilet paper tells the child to flush...Good concept, but just way too much when the child didn't go in the first place!4) Unlike some other urine guards, this one is a small hard plastic piece; my son had a hard time sitting down into a position without catching himself on it and it hurt!5) Urine guard is too easy to remove; another fun distraction6) At 22 mos, my son seems almost too big for this potty.  He has always been tall for his age, but 22 mos is on the early end of the potty-training spectrum!We have had more success with a $[...] soft potty seat that goes on top of the regular toilet.  The Fisher Price Fun to Learn potty has just been an expensive toy for us.
