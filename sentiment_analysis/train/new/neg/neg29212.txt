This truck is cute, but certainly not worth the $15 that I paid for it on Amazon.  I later saw it priced at $5.99 at other stores--a much more appropriate price.  It's small and cute, and your infant/toddler can push it around.  I was hoping for and expecting an actual popping sound...this is a very weak, quiet sound that doesn't deserve the term "poppity pop."  To summarize:  cute toy, not amazing, and I definitely overpaid.
