Wanted something for my City Select stroller to hold my coffee.  I always have a coffee on me.This thing falls off even if a sippy cup is placed in it.I tried to tighten it a little better and the plastic part that grips started to crack.  This was by turning the little green knob with two fingers.  That is how little pressure was needed to nearly snap the thing in two.So good idea, but poor materials cause this to be a useless item.
