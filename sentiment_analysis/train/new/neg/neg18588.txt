I bought this chair to replace thje graco one I had for my daughter.  that chair had major drawbacks... difficult to keep clean, 5 pt harness that was not easily adjustable, and a tray that was too big to wash in the sink let alone the dishwasher.  It came with a vinal pad and cloth, but the cloth had to hang dry, and the vinayl didn't cover enough. to top it off the plastic seat had crevisis so food got stuck in it (fall thru pads).So when our son came along I knew I needed to find something that was easier.  I looked at several seats at B-r-us and this seemed to be the best.What I like... 5 piece harness that the shoulder straps come off the waist strap (easier to clean & adjust. ***down side, they don't tighten snug enough to fit my 5 month old**Vinyl cover, easy to wipe down, covers around edges, and minimum amount of 'holes' for straps and food to fall into  **down side, the ruffle is fabric and not machine washable, I know he will be smashing food into it and it wont wipe down.The seat is wide & deep - so a large child will sit nicely... however my 5 month old is hidden behind the large bulky tray, even with out the tray he is down low in comparision to the sides - makes it hard to get spoon to his mouth, over crotch piece (hard wide bulky piece of plastic that goes between childs legs to keep them from slipping down)I am keeping it for now since it was the best I had found, but why cant a manufactor try their chair with real babies?
