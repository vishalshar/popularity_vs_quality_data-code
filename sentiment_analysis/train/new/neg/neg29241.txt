Expensive and has an indentation where baby sleeps after only 2 months of baby sleeping in the crib. beung as you're supposed to purchase a firm mattress that springs back when touched, I would not recommend this mattress to anyone. Our baby now sleeps face down on her tummy (by her own doing) and I'm scared to have her sleep on this mattress.
