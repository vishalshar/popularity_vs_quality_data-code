I own the Maxi-Cosi Priori car seat and although it is very safe, and has some great features the fabric does not hold up well and is very hard to effectively clean.  The directions say to just spot clean, but when you are dealing with normal toddler activities like drinking, eating, or the occasional diaper accident it never seems to get clean just by spot cleaning it.  My car seat is in the cream and blue color so all stains and dirt show very easily and even with wiping it down it still looks very dirty.  Also the foam padding underneath the fabric collects a lot of dirt and crumbs and is impossible to clean.  It is like a complete germ haven in my opinion.  The seams of the cover are also coming loose.  I called Maxi-Cosi customer service to see if I could get a replacement fabric cover since I intended on using this seat for my second child and was told it only has a 12 month warranty (I purchased this seat from Babies R Us about 16 months ago.)  The representative was not very nice and told me that I should expect wear on the fabric.  I'm sorry but seams ripping is NOT normal wear after less than a year and a half of use.  This is the second Maxi-Cosi car seat I have purchased that had the same issues with ripping apart at the seams of the fabric and I only purchase them for their safety .  I WILL NOT be purchasing another Maxi-Cosi product after their terrible customer service and them not honoring their faulty products.
