- Really like the color, pattern, and the simple design - looks great on our crib- Would like double the amount of ties - it fits our crib, but the top isn't as snug as I would like- As other reviewers have said, the gingham part is a tad rough to the touch - not sandpapery, just not as smooth as some other fabrics.- Overall good quality- Does the job of "bumpering" very well for our extremely active 5mo old.  We haven't had it for very long, so I can't comment on whether or not she'll pull at it, or be able to get to the ties.- Have tried other bumpers, and this is the best of the ones I've tried, but there's always room for improvement- Opened up the package and a little part of the bottom seam was coming apart - I assume this was just a fluke.  I know I could have returned it, but decided not to b/c I just wanted to start using it- 3 stars b/c of the manufacturing defect, fabric roughness, and # of ties.  I wanted to love everything about it... I do love the appearance, but only like the functionality.
