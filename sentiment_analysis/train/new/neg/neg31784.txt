i used this pump while my newborn was hospitalized and i was extremely disappointed. the vacuum/cycles are really low and slow and left me feeling always full ( i would put it at the highest setting and stay on the pump for 20-30 mins both of which should be enough). i actually think it decreased my supply since it never fully emptied me.  i was surprised to find that my Medela PISA was much better (maybe I was already used to my pump - but I was more than looking forward to trying a hospital pump and was still disappointed). I was happy to finally get back home and empty my breasts. i gave it 2 stars because it did work to provide some milk for my baby for the stay.
