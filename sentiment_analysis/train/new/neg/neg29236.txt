We loved this seat at first. Our son is almost 4 months old and approximately 16 pounds (50th percentile on height & weight). After maybe 5 uses the soft mesh fabric stretched and now his back rests right on the pointy tab that locks the seat in place. (Picture included) He had red lines and a bruise. :( It only took one bath with him screaming in pain for us to figure this out. I just hope to save others out there from the guilt knowing your baby was crying from something you did...
