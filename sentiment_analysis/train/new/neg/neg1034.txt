this item is ok if you want to get all the stuffed toys off the floor and out of the toy bins... Great for storage of the stuff toys, but if have some favorites that are used every day, i would keep them out.. toys will spill out.. but like i said for storage its good.. i think some kind of rail in front would help the stuffed toys from falling out.....for storage of the stuffed toys - 5 starsfor every day use - 2 to 3 starsi can say i modified it to where i would give it 5 stars all day long... All i did was tied my own string from the middle of the net up to the center screw. ( for corner applications)if they start making it this way i want 10%
