Terrible crunchy plastic and very uncomfortable and itchy!!! My son cried while wearing them!!! We normally buy a different brand called Dappi and they are 100% Nylon and they work great and the material is not crunchy plastic also very comfortable!!! My son loves them but these Gerber ones don't waste your money they don't even hold the urine in!!!  I put these over his diapers when he sleeps, because he leaks out of his diapers at night and these Gerber covers do not help at all they leak but the other brand we use called Dappi works wonders and I don't have leak issues!
