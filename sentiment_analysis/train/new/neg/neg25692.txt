Easy to hold.  Brushes well.The instructions say to "Wash before initial use.  Wash in warm water using mild liquid soap."  When I did that, the brush absorbed water through the bristle holes, became waterstained, and cracked.The bristle holes are evidently not sealed during manufacture (should be done before or while the bristles are being glued in).Amazon sent a replacement.  The replacement had the same problem.
