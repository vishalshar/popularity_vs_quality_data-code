These nipples are just ok - I found that playtex nurses with drop in liners actually work better for us. As other reviewers point out, quite a bit of milk can get stuck between the inner hard piece and the outer soft piece of the nipple. As anyone who breast feeds knows, you don't want to loose any "liquid gold"! There are tabs that you are supposed to be able to pinch and get the milk to flow back into the bottle, however, this does not work very well in practice. If the milk does drip back into the bottle it is VERY slow, and sometimes it does not drip back in at all. There are also a lot of pieces to wash, which would be fine if the bottles worked really well.
