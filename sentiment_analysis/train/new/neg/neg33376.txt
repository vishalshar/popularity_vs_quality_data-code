The princess diary memory book has a nice paper texure and presentation. The book is in form of story of a princess. Overall the print quality, pages etc are good. The only problem I have with the book is that the printing color (ink) used on the pages doesnt contrast with the background pink color of the pages. A lot of times it is really hard to read what is printed on the pages. Disney could have done a better job at using color themes and contrasts in printing for the diary.
