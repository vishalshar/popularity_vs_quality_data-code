I purchased these as a baby gift for a friend thinking the bottles would come in a Medela box.  The bottles came in a flat rate box without any additional packaging.  All of the bottles have a plastic seal around them indicating they are sterile.  However, I don't want to send my friend a bunch of loose bottles.  I'm extremely disappointed in the packaging as this is not indicated anywhere in the product description field.  I do like these bottles but am upset that I can't send them to my friend as I planned.
