It worked great until it didn't. For 6 months it was accurate and the kiddo loved it. And that's about how long it worked. The battery died. When we took out the cylinder, there was mold in between that and the turtle. Per another review, we split it apart at the seam (which is clearly not meant to be done) and there was water inside. Buy something else if you want it to last.
