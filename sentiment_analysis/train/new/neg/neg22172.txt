A  friend of mine reciently bought this product and because of her severe allergies, was told to wash everything included. When she followed the washing instructuions it said to tumble dry on low. Her once beautiful bed set was now brown and crispy! When she took it back the ladies weren't surprised and gave her a word of advice. They told her that this happens quite often and the best thing to do is air dry only! They replaced it but she did have to air dry the comforter, bed ruffel and bumper.
