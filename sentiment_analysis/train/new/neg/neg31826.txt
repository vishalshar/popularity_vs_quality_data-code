Okay so I usually don't take the time to write a review. But I really want to warn people about this product...its awful so I had only had this for about a month and the hole time it acted like well my batteries are almost dead and there for a month I either always forgot to pick them up or something else always came up which left me with barely working batteries so I though then finally I bought new batteries. After putting new batteries in I expected this to just take off but nope it then wouldn't even come back on. So then by this time I had already had it to long to return it. Do not buy this junk I highly recommend the munchkins mixer I bought one in 2012 when I had my daughter which I thought was lost but my husband found it in the attic I got that sucker down cleaned it up real good and it still had the batteries in it from 2012 and it still worked like a charm. But overall folk I swear by my baby brezza bottle maker I don't know what I'd do without it
