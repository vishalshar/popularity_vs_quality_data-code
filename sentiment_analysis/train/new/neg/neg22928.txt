Straightforward installation. Works as expected.  The logo looks a little silly in my "grownup" car, but not terribly noticeable... I did see it in the pictures before ordering, so not suprised.Update - the thing is tearing. It does not even move, just stays strapped to the back of the seat. Seems to be tension from on of the straps or something.
