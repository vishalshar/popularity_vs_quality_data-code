This cover does in fact provide great coverage. Too much coverage, perhaps. Holy hell does it get hot under there! If you're looking to kill two birds with one stone and nurse while you hit the sauna, you're in luck. Otherwise, I recommend using an infiniti scarf (you don't need one specifically for nursing, either).
