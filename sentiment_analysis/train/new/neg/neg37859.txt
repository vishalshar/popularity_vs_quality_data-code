yes, these are cute. yes, my 2-yr-old daughter loves them and begs me for her "kitty-cat underwear." BUT. they are huge. HUGE. There is no real size chart provided and the sizing suggest XL for 18-36 months. my daughter is 25 months and as another reviewer said, these won't fit her till she's 6. the tag says 10 kg. not accurate at all, since my daughter is 10 kg and these are swimming on her. I hope the seller can post accurate sizings soon! weight-based would be ideal. as for containing leaks -- since these are huge the pee just pools up on the thin terry-cloth lining and then spills down her leg. but that helps her in potty training too. i like them a lot i just wish they fit!
