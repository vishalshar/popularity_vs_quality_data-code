I love that these are silicone and have a lid but the lid doesn't stay on very well and are not very secure. After making the baby food and putting it in the tray, the lid seems secure enough...but once the food has frozen and I'm popping the cubes out as I need them, the lid is hard to secure back on. If I were to invert the trays, I bet the lids would fall right off. I guess you get what you pay for, $6 as compared to the $15 trays out there.
