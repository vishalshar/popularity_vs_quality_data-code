The picture is slightly misleading.  That tub must be small and so are the toys.  This could barely hold half of my daughters toys.  Also, it doesn't stick to my tub sides.  It doesn't help that there were no directions in the box.  I tried to cleaning the area, wetting the area, drying the area, wetting just the suction cups; no matter what I did I could not get even one of these suction cups to stick to my tub sides.  It would probably stick to tile or ceramic, but like most American's I have that plastic substance as my tub surface.I guess you get what you pay for.  If you have tile or ceramic tub sides and need something small to store tub toys then this might work for you.
