What is great about it:The large screen*The fact you can move the camera around to see the baby*You can speak to baby*The range is awesome, I was able to go outside, in my front or backyard to let my older daughter play, while my baby napped.What needs to be fix:*It took me two days to get this camera to get set up, to sync with the monitor.*The monitor dies very quickly*The charger stopped working to charge the monitor*I get a replacement and it stopped working in two days.*You have to wait for a long time for a reply back from customer service, which you cannot talk to via phone, you have to call them, then give them your information, for them to call you back, once you get a call back, they then have you email them.  (annoying)*The lullabies are horrible, they have a screeching sound to them, so I never used it.End the end, after 6 months of me trying to get this to charge and work, I finally gave up and ordered a motorola one which has worked great for the last 6 months.  The motorola has a tinier screen, but to be honest after paying almost $200 for this one, I could not afford another $200 device.  I Had to pay $70 to get the motorola one.  Which doing the job and stays charged for a long time and it actually charges.
