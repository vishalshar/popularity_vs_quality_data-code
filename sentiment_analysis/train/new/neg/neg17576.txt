This pad would probably work fine on a crib mattress, but we have a 2 year old on a twin bed and this pad simply doesn't cover enough area to serve the purpose.  We'd need to use 2 at a time and I've found a sheet protector that is a much better option for a sleeper that moves all over the bed during the night.  Priva Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector 34x52".  Buy more than one!  It saves the day quite often and keeps Mom from having to change the entire mattress pad cover.
