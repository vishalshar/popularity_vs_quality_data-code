I am an avid fan of cloth diapers, they really are worth the bother and effort. So great for a babies skin :) We've just emigrated to the USA from the UK. We started off with one size pocket diapers such as Bumgenius etc, but I have super skinny babies (twins) who are very heavy wetters, and to prevent leaks they needed a well fitting absorbent nappy, which meant a sized bamboo nappy.Over there we used Bambooty cloth diapers [...] or [...]. Amazing nappy, they lasted longer in it than in a disposable, and their skin was far far happier. They also dry super quickly, have really cute prints, a great fit, and are really slim, the slimmest cloth diaper I've ever come across, helps cloth bummed babies fit in their clothes for longer.They grew out of their medium Bambooty shortly after we arrived in the USA. Bambooty aren't currently sold over here, so I tried looking for a cheaper alternative than having them shipped. Itti Bitti was the only one we hadn't tried, so ordered two to give it a shot. I could see straight away that they weren't as absorbent, wasn't as good a fit, not as easy to put on, the list goes on. Bambooty is far far superior. So if you have a skinny heavy wetter, and other cloth diapers aren't working for you, don't bother with itti bitti, order some Bambooty, a little more pricey, but completely worth it if your committed to cloth - you'll still save money over disposables! [...] will ship to the USA faster than Amazon's free super saver shipping will get it to you, so you won't even have to wait that long ;)
