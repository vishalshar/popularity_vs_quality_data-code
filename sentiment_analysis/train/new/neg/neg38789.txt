Came shipped in the retail box, with no protective packaging material.  The first one arrived damaged because of this and we had to request another one.  It was guaranteed to be delivered the next day, but of course did not arrive until the day after that.  It works with our Chicco KeyFit30 compatible carseat as advertised, but it's hard to see why this single piece costs $90.  We nearly did not get the extra base for our second vehicle (and were just transferring one base back and forth), but I got it just in case one of us accidentally left home with it installed but was not traveling with the baby.  Still, it's hard to justify the expense for just the extra base.
