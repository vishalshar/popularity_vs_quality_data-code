I purchased this high chair based on the reviews. I cannot believe that no one else has had the kind of problems I had. I put this together according to the instructions and it was extremely wobbly and the back of the seat wouldn't stay in the upright position (it would pop into place then I would place my 3 month old in it and the back would fall to the furthest reclining position). I did not feel safe placing my child in this so I returned it. Also a very annoying thing about this high chair is that there are only 2 wheels on the front which makes it very hard to move and if you do want to move it you have to tip it forward (which seems backwards to me)which means to safely do this you must remove baby. All in all I loved the way this looked and was sooooo disappointed with how shoddy it was. DON'T DON'T DON'T BUY!!!!
