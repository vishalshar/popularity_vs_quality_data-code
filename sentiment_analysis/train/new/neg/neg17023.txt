First thing is this company sold it as if it were new.  It wasn't. Box had been opened the monitor's safety plastic had been "restuck" to it and the box taped shut.  That irritated me. But I decided to try it anyway and I discovered that if the iphone and the WeMo were working the sound was lousy. There is also the other issue of connections. If it falls out of connections then the monitor doesn't work and it defeats the purpose of the monitor!
