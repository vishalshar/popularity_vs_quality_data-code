We have been using our swing now for 6 weeks.  This model is a space saver.  We have it stashed in the corner next to the window and are happy with the purchase.  My husband put it together in under 30 minutes with ease.  A couple of things are bothersome with this product......the vibration feature works on batteries and doesn't have a timed shut off.  So, the first time you leave it on the batteries are dead.  And the battery compartment is difficult to get to to put new batteries in.  the 2nd frustrating part of this model is that the bar holding the soft animals is difficult to move back and forth.  If you attempt to push it back (to get the baby in and out) the bar unlatches and can fall on the baby. And lastly, the musical feature on this model is somewhat archaic.  It's very loud and the songs are a little harsh......Overall,  I would purchase this model again for the price.  I love that I can pick it up myself and move it around the house.  The swing function is what's most important for us and it seems to work well for our little one.
