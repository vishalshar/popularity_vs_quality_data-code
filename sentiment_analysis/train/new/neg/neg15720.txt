This thing is a piece of CRAP. We got this to replace our angelcare monitor because one of the parent units stopped working, and our pediatrician said since our son is very healthy, etc, she doesn't think we need the breathing monitor. So we thought we'd get something cheaper. Cheap is right! I should've paid attention to the reviews, but I let my husband pick this one because he liked the way it looks. That's the only good thing about it! The fact they are rechargeable is nice but they don't hold a charge for long either.Yes the blue light is annoying, and sort of like a strobe while you're trying to sleep, but I could've gotten over that. The worst part is the CONSTANT static! The sound quality is horrendous and I agree with the other reviews that say the lowest sound setting is too low & the next one up is too loud. One of our parent units also drops in & out every second or so... and as I was typing this, it just completely stopped working at all, there's now no sound coming from the parent unit! We've had it for two days! There should be no problems but this is a piece of junk. I want my angelcare monitor back!
