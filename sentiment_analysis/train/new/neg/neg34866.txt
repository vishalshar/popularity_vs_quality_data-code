These are okay.  I wouldn't use them if my kid would take any other sippy top, but she won't...soooo.  They do leak pretty easy, she also can use her teeth to rip out the top super fast, so they are pricey to replace...because as soon as she does that, they spill like a spout.  Nuk itself doesn't appear to make a 6 pack, that is just how some sellers are willing to sell, so that too irritates me.  I can *almost* buy a whole new set for the price of replacement spouts & that seems like utter rubbish on the manufacturer's part.  I really regret ever trying these because I am sure we would have found another solution, but my daughter seems stuck on these now & I do not like them.
