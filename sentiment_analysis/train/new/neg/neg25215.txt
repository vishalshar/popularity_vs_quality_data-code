I have a 2 and 4 year old. There is a lot of rough play and running around (especially since we've been cooped up this winter). So there has also been a lot of door slamming. I bought these and loved them at first. And then my 2 year old slammed the bathroom door and realized it 'bounces' back so he continued to do so a few times (until I could get to him to stop him) and took the screws right out of the wall (from the door hinge). Of course, i want safe fingers BUT I also want my doors in tact. I will keep looking for a new solution.
