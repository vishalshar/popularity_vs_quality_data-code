So we bought this for our 2 month daughter and although the idea of a multi purpose system thatcan be used in different ages and at different situations sounded great for the price, the electronicsside of the equation was horrible!The swing should have (as described on the page in Amazon.com) a 6 speed setting. Well indeed thereis a small switch for 5 different speeds and the 6th being no movement at all. But the actual movingspeeds of the swing are practically the same!Our baby was discomforted by the rocking of the swing even at the lowest setting.I am waiting for UPS to come and pick up this item to be returned.There is also a minor issue with the sound it makes while swinging, but that is negligable.
