I was so excited to receive a PPB bag at my baby shower (Boxy backpack in the Evening in Innsbruck pattern).  Unfortunately the bag is lacking a lot of features that I feel like a high end diaper bag like this should have.  I didn't like how bulky the diaper changing compartment was.  When I put in three newborn diapers and the wipes case in here, it took up quite a bit of room and when zipped made the main compartment more snug then I preferred.  I also wish the changing pad was a fabric that could be wiped clean.  It's more like a cotton that needs to be washed when it gets dirty.  The inside of the bag is a bit cumbersome to get into with one hand and the velcro is very loud when you open the bag (magnets here would be awesome).  I wish the bag had a lighter lining color.  Black makes it really hard to find your stuff inside.  Lastly, the tall shape of the bag made it hard for me to sift through the contents easily (I'm opting for a lower, wider bag that lets me see the contents easily without having to lift and rearrange things).  I really really wanted to love this bag.  It feels so solidly built and is gorgeous.  Unfortunately it isn't working for me and I'm returning it.
