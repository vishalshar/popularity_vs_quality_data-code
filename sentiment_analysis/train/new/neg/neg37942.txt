I purchased these when our baby was just starting to sit up, to protect his head and face from our hardwood floors.  Unfortunately, they made said floor very slippery, so we couldn't keep them.  I don't know if it was our particular batch or how the cleaning products we use reacted with the mats, all I know is that when the mat slid around, where it had been was so slick that I almost fell a few times.The actual product is good--thick and soft and easy to clean each piece (though since the pieces interlock, there are a lot more surfaces for liquids and semi-liquids to infiltrate).  Maybe if you were putting the mat on carpet, it would work better.If you'd like an excellent, high-quality solid mat, which is harder to store but easier to wipe clean, try Dwinguler Kid's Playmat.  It's more expansive than the interlocking mat, but the lack of separate pieces means less places for babies to chew.Bottom line: This made my floor too slippery to be usable.  I got a higher-quality one-piece mat instead.
