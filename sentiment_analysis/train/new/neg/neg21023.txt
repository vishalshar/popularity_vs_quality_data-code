This is a good idea in theory. However, the problem of milk splashing out even if you don't fill it up all the way is still an issue. Placing them in the freezer to avoid spilling while pouring is also difficult because the freezer walls get in the way of your elbow or the container you're pouring it from. Especially if you have to scald because of excess lipase. The "lids" do not thoroughly seal the milk in the trays for the duration of freezing, and let's face it, there isn't a large percentage of women who have the money to dedicate a deep freezer solely to the purpose of freezing their breast milk, so there is lots of outside air getting into the freezer as it's being opened. So after you freeze the sticks, you then have to transfer to milk bags to seal to avoid freezer burn. That adds another step in handling the milk, which could possibly be unsanitary depending upon how clean you are about that kind of thing, if you use gloves, etc. I suppose this would be good for overnight, but most moms who pump at night for the next day can just put the milk straight into a bottle with a lid and keep in the fridge ready to go for the next morning/day....I ended up not using my freezer stash because I just didn't trust that the milk was uncompromised. I  did not trust the freshness of the milk after being in an unsealed tray while freezing. Too much milk was spilled and wasted. The sticks were just too messy of an option for me. I just ended up doing daily pumping from the time my baby started daycare and luckily had enough supply to keep up.
