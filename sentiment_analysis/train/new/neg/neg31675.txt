Baby Trend Expedition LX Jogging Stroller, Skylar I bought this stroller less then 6 months ago and now we are looking to purchase a differnt one. It was for our first child and we decided to buy the entire travel system. The car seat portion has been fine but the stroller itself has been a big disapointment.  First of all we were looking for a stroller that would work well in most terrain, as we are very active people. It is very tippy even on a regular sidewalk. Second, it is not ment for jogging or even a fast walk. It wobbles all over the place and is very annoying. If I were looking to purchase a Jogging stroller again I would definatly spend a little more money and get a quality stroller. This was not what I was looking for.
