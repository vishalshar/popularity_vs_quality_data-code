I ordered this bag to protect my brand new baby jogger city mini when I flew with it. Despite being advertised as the bag designed for the city mini the bag was too small and the zip was about to burst open once zipped up. The bag would have been perfect had it been an inch bigger. My husband and I tried putting the stroller in the bag several times in case the problem was with us but we still couldn't get it to fit without the seams looking like they were about to burst. We ended up leaving the bag behind and checking the stroller unprotected with our baggage.  I then returned the bag. And suffice to say my brand new stone colored city mini got ruined which left me rather unhappy with this bag. Do not buy.
