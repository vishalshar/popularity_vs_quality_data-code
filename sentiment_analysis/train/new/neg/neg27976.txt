I purchased two of these covers as well as the hook and loop  x-small Thirsties covers. I have to be honest and say the Thirsties covers are better and easier to use. The main thing that I do not like about these covers: when my baby pees the cover gets wet in areas (the tag, leg gussets) that requires me to have to change the cover out. This happens almost every first time he wets. It doesn't matter if I have him in a prefold, GMD workhorse, inserts, the cover has too many areas that don't repel water. I have not had any problems like this with our Thirsties.
