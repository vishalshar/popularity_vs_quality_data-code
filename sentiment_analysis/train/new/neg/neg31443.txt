I hate this stroller. When walking with the wheel unlocked, which is supposed to be fine, the whole thing shakes uncontrollably. Now before you say I put it together wrong, I didn't. I've put together about 10 strollers and followed the directions and all the troubleshooting tips to no avail, still shakes. It seems to be fine with the wheel locked as long as you are on a completely flat, straight surface, since that happens so often. You absolutely cannot run with this stroller. No shocks so every tiny bump will make your toddler cry because it feels like they're going to fly out. Shakes a lot even with the wheel locked while jogging. Moral of the story, you get what you pay for, the reviews that say this thing is good are a lie, and the description is completely inaccurate. Returning.
