I have always been a big fan of britax but the struggles I've had with this car seat have me questioning myself. The straps are slightly uneven. I don't know if this a flaw in just my seat or all of them. Then in 3 months 3 different things broke. The last one being a safety issue. First it was the soft foam when I took the covers off to wash. It just tore like paper. Then the hard foam ripped off completely (one of the side head support pieces). I was able to put everything back together but was upset because it was the first time I took it apart to clean. The last thing that broke was one of the click-tight plastic clips. The main reason I love britax is this feature of securing the car seat when you don't have latch. I have move this seat a total of 4 times and the plastic broke without the use of force. We contacted amazon and are getting a new seat but were told it was past the 30 days so normally they wouldn't. Buyer beware. I wouldn't buy this seat again if I had the chance to do it over. I'm giving two stars because my daughter has always been comfortable, the installation is easy, and it's design makes it easy to rear face even a larger child.
