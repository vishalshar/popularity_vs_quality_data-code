Bought this because it was cute and non toxic.  Upon arrival it looked just lie the picture but the wood was cheap and the screws were cheap and the holes to connect the tip and bottom red pieces do not line up so my husband had to redneck engineer it to get the screw through. Not cool for the price :(
