This is definitely a useful accessory for the POD, so I'm glad they offer it.  I've used it several times and it has kept the kids completely dry inside - even in a complete downpour.  The velcro attachment at the top is efficient and works quite well.However, the attachments for the bottom and bottom corners need some improvement.  They are plastic clips that are supposed to snap on to the POD frame.  But they don't stay on.  They easily slide off, which is especially problematic when it's windy.  The cover gets blown open because the clips won't stay snapped on.
