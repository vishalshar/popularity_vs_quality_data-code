Here is the problem, The frame of the bed is very easy to put together no issues. The sides of the bed where its supposed to keep the child from rolling off the bed. There is about a 2 1/2 inch gap with the mattress on it. Can be dangerous if child rolls over. So I said okay Ill just keep it against the wall. The wholes do not match up to keep the arms from moving. and if you have a similar toddler bed like one of these before you know that in the back towards the head board the arms attach like a hook to the pole of the head board. Welllllll... it is not an hook its literally half a hook so the arms literally look like a open and closing door, We used the box it came in to make a makeshift support.  I would say buyer beware and use caution because you do not want your little one getting stuck in the openings and chocking themselves. Even if you feel that you will be in the same room or its is against something be mindful of the dangers of things that can happen in their and your sleep! But it is a cute but dangerous bed.
