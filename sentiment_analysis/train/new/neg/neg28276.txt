I was excited about ordering this bag, but after reading the reviews I was a little hesitant.  My brother had this bag for 8 years.  Well I should have listened to the reviews.  The quality of the materials used have noticeably gone down hill since my brother bought his.  On the one I ordered, less then a months use, the inner divider seam completely unraveled.  It was big enough to carry everything I needed and then some.  So, it wasn't stuffed or over packed.  I am extremely disappointed, because the style of the bag was perfect for my needs.  I returned it with no problem.
