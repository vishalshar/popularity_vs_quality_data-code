When we brought this mattress home and put it in the crib there was more than 2 inches between the mattress and crib. It is recommended that you only be able to put two fingers between the crib and the mattress. I put the mattress pad and sheet on thinking maybe it will make it a tighter fit but there was still a gap. We took this mattress back and got the Sealy baby soft classic that seems to have the proper fit in our crib.We have a standard size crib so I have no idea why this mattress was not fitting properly. The people at BRU said they receive a lot of returns on this mattress for that very reason.I suppose the price of this mattress is about the only good quality. Be forewarned about this mattress...
