This is a very cheap product.  Cheaply made and looks cheap.  From any distance it looks like plastic.It likely only costs about $1 to manufacture.  And sells for an outrageous price.  After about a week the clasp would not hold.  My baby does not pull on it in a ridiculous manner.  Just some pulling and now it does not shut.It does not look elegant.  It looks like something you could pick up at the dollar store.  The beads still have rough edges and bits of plastic hanging off from the molding process.  Honestly, you could make this yourself.If it were more appropriately priced, it might be worth it.  Like $5.Don't believe the hype ... if you have money to toss away, go for it.The positive reviewers are ... I don't know ... getting a cut of the sales?  Have low expectations?  Enjoy wearing obviously plastic jewelry?
