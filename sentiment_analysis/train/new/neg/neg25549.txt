I wanted to love this, but it has a serious design flaw and makes me want to scream.  The first time I bought this, it seemed to lose suction after the first few pumps.  I thought I was doing something wrong, because I could only get an ounce or so, and it took forever.  But, I googled it and many moms had the same problem.  Some suggested it was a flaw in this tiny rubber O-ring that connects the pump.  Mine looked a little ragged, so I emailed Amazon and they replaced it with a new one.  I used the new one twice without any trouble and it was like night and day compared to the first one.  I got 5 ounces in No time!  But, after only 3 uses, I was having the same problem as before.  I took the pump off a dozen times and fiddled with the O-ring.  It will give me suction for 1 or 2 hand pumps, but that's it.  What a huge disappointment!!!  I'm sending this back and buying a different product.UPDATE:  instead of returning the second defective pump, I went to my local hardware store and asked if they sold "tiny rubber o-rings."  I bought two that looked similar in size, but a bit thicker and sturdier.  When I got home, I slipped on the smaller one and it totally fixed the problem!!  Don't buy Medela's replacement o-rings, they are crap.  It's worth the $.50 and drive to the hardware store.  Works great now!  See photos.
