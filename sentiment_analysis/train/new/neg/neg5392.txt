I have a couple of different types of cloth diapers--these, kissa's, fuzzi buns, and bumgenius.  This diaper works fine (no leaks so far) and the print is cute (I have the cherrylicious).  I don't mind stuffing the pockets, so having the inserts attached wasn't a huge advantage to me.  The velcro is very sturdy.There are two things that I really don't like about these.  I have them snapped on the lowest rise for my 4 month old and almost every time I put it on her, one of the snaps comes undone.  I rarely have this problem with my other one-size diapers.  And when I line dry them, the inside doesn't feel very soft.  I bought one of these as a test, and I won't buy any more.  I purchases more BGs instead.
