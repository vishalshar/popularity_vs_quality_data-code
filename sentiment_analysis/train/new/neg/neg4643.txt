I ordered this hamper for my 2 baby girls.  It was very cute while it lasted.  My walker pulled one way, and my crawler pulled the other way, and they pulled the froggy face right off.  The support sticks poked holes through the sides shortly after the face-off fiasco.  It lasted maybe 3 months.I think it would be great for older kids, maybe 3-4 +?  I think if we still had it now that my girls are a little older it would be alright, but it didn't work out when they were little.
