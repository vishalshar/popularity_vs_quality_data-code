I was hoping for something lightweight and easy to carry for potty training purposes. I definitely got what I asked for, but I didn't ask to get my daughter's butt cheeks to get pinched in the process! Aside from this seat being flimsy, the package was missing the "travel bag" it was supposed to come with. Needless to say, I returned it and got the padded travel potty seat instead. It's a little bulkier to have to lug around, but my little girl is so much more comfortable!
