This is my third diaper bag, after the first one wore out and the second ended up being too small for anything but short errands. It's roomy inside, the shoulder strap is comfortable and I like the colors. I like that one cup pocket on the outside is insulated, to help keep a drink cold.But the wipe dispenser, which is one of the main reasons I chose this bag, is shoddily made. I thought it was a small issue at first, but after months of thinking the dispenser was snapped shut, only to fly open because the dispenser opening and pocket opening on the bag don't line up, resulting in dry wipes, I'm frustrated and done with it. Also, the messenger bag flap closes with velcro, which again I thought wasn't an issue--except the velcro strips are so small, they never catch and the bag flaps around. Even if you carefully make sure the velcro is attached, if you have anything slightly bulky in the bag that pushes the flap out a bit, the velcro will come detatched again. I wish it was a stronger closure, or magnetic. It's too bad since I like the numerous pockets and the size of this bag, but it's not one I would recommend to anyone because over time, the wipes and velcro issue become very frustrating.
