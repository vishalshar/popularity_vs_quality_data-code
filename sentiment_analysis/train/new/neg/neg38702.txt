I have this 3 stars because I love the concept of a non toxic cup and the weighted straw is genius. My 18 month old had used this cup (we've gone through 4) since he was 5 months old and its the only "sippy" cup he is used to so we have stuck with it despite the issues. I used the nuby cups with my older kids and was looking for a similar straw cup without the horrid chemicals leaching into the liquid. This cups fits the bill. The two handle hold is great as is the weighted, flexible straw which allows you to actually drink all the liquid. However, it breaks incredibly easily so when your baby checks it on the floor or drops it, say goodbye to the orange part that covers the straw. I've made peace with that. However, the cup leaks like mad. If you get this cup, know that letting your child manage his cup without you isn't a good idea unless you want a puddle. We drink mostly water from it so that isn't the end of the world for me.
