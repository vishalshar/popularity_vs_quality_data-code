Have bought two Westwood design cribs and had hardware issues with both now when I try to convert it to a toddler bed a bolt installed from factory is stripped and I had to drill it and remove it with an extractor called company and was told 1 year warranty and I would have to purchase a hardware kit. You would never know this bolt was bad until you go to convert it. Horrible customer service from a company who does not care about their customers
