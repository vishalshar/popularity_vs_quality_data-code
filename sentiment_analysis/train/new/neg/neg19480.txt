We are still working out the kinks, the part that connects to the supply has a very small and poorly designed washer (washer doesnt fit the opening).  My husband really wants a diaper sprayer for cloth diapering so we are going to make a run to the "depot" to see if we can find some additional fixes.  The sprayer is great and I love how you can adjust the water level.  Only concern we are running into is that the sprayer drips a bt after use.  I think we sould be okay once we make some last min fixes.  Would love yo just have Fuzzi Bunz fix the washer issue.  I really think for the cost it shouldnt leak.Update, we located some addition washers as Home Depot and when my husband fixed and relighted all is working well...will keep you posted on its use..little man is expected to arrive in about 30 days !
