Mine arrived with what looks like a dead Chinese flea inside the packaging.  Needless to say, I will not be giving this to a friend of mine to put on the head of their newborn baby.  I won't even be opening the clear wrapper.  Right in the garbage.  Like another reviewer said, had I known this was shipped direct from Asia, I would not have purchased.  I would also add that even if it hadn't arrived with a dead insect, I would not have been impressed.  It looks cheap.  Buyer beware.
