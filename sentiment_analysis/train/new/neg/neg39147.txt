I bought this bag thinking it would be a great solutions for all my daycare diaper bag needs.  I was looking for a bag that could hold a lot of stuff and be carried in different ways.  At first all was great; it had room for me to throw everything I needed for a day trip for 3 daycare babies.  Unfortunately, this bag doesn't hold up to use.  One of the backpack straps has almost completely ripped off, the feet have fallen off, the shoulder strap cushion is ripping and now I have the magnets ripping out of the bag.  My bag itself looks brand new, no stains or anything but the fabric just can't handle regular use; poorly sewn together.  I have been carrying for children for 18 years and this is the first diaper bag to fail so quickly.  Only wish I could return it.  :(
