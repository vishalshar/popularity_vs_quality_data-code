We bought this because some reviews said it would stick even if bottom of tub is not absolutely and completely smooth. Well, that is not the case at all. Does not stick on bottom of tub if not absolutely and completely smooth, and even when we tested it on a smooth tub surface all the suction cups did not stick very well. The tub we wanted to use this with has very slight negligible bumpy surface and this did not work at all. It did not stick to the bottom in the slightest. However, It did not slide or move while our 3 year old was sitting on it, so we will keep it. Plus, he likes the idea of sitting on a frog, so that is another reason we will not go through the hassle in returning it. Good idea for a product, but again, just make sure your tub surface is COMPLETELY SMOOTH if you want this product to work anything like it claims to.
