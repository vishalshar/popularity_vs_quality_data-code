Upon reading reviews, which I did after I placed my order, I saw that some people had more than one "WINNER" per 24 pack. I freaked out a little. I am so glad I read reviews and just checked all my cards! I ordered 2 packs and each pack had 1 card wrapped separately which should be the 1 "winner" per set. One pack had 1 winner (packed separate) and all other 23 cards were non-winning. The other pack: separately wrapped card was a loser, THREE winning cards mixed into the deck. So in 48 cards I have 44 non-winning and 4 winners which is fine I can just use 2 winners and toss the other 2. I am giving this 3 stars because they are cute cards. Had I not checked each card and had 4 winners at the shower this could have really ruined a nice shower by not being prepared with the correct amount of prizes for games. It was easy to hold each card up to light and see the 3 images, SO GLAD I DID!! We haven't played yet but I am sure it will be a hit.
