My daughter was a preemie so colors and shapes were really important early on. These are larger than they appear, which is great considering how little babies can see at first (these were very easy for my baby to track with her eyes). They are sold as teethers, and they certainly have the capability of fulfilling that role. They each has their own texture to the disc and the zebra squeakes and the giraffe rattles. Biggest draw back, the yellow rubber tastes disgusting. The green has no taste but the yellow is super offensive, which is unfortunate since it has the dots that would be of the most benefit for babies cutting teeth. Over all I would recommend them, but not gift them.
