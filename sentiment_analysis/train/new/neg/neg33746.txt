I give this two stars because it is a nice frame, easy to use clay and it came out nice in the end..... but when it arrived it was broken, and i didnt have the time to send it back for a replacement as it was a gift for my husands birthday. with some tlc and wood glue i was able to make it look new again, but i wont be buying another (i originally planned on buying more for other family members) because i dont think i should pay that much for a broken item.
