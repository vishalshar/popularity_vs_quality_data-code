Just got this today and when I pulled it out of the box, my husband asked if I'd bought a used mattress.  It looks like someone has walked on it as there was a shoe print on one side.  I used Clorox wipes and it did wipe off easily, but when buying something new, you don't expect it to arrive filthy!Also it does fit very snugly into the cradle.  At first I thought it was too big, but we crammed it in there and it fits just fine.
