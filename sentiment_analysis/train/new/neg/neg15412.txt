I wouldn't recommend this as a stroller fan. I don't love it, but it works. I specifically bought it to use as a stroller fan. The output of air is a small square so a concentrated air flow is directed at the baby as compared to a wide spread air breeze.The "clip" isn't like a spring hinge that I was expecting. That in itself makes it hard to clip onto my stroller. If the canopy had flat bars it could hold, but mine are round and it doesn't fit well to hold the weight of the fan. The clip is a u shape tension (paper clip style). I wouldn't recommend as a stroller fan. It doesn't come with an arm band and isn't rechargeable unless you buy the extra battery. I guess I didn't read up well enough (although I thought I did and studied the pictures) or the details weren't as thorough as I needed for my product need. The fan itself works well, just not sure what I will use it for.
