First, the color of the backpack (river rock green) didn't match the ergo carrier (also river rock green), which tells me there is a problem with consistency in the color matches from the manufacturer and that quality control at ERGO is not addressing these issues.Second, the attachment of the bag onto the carrier is not at all simple or sturdy. I bought this item specifically so that I could attach it to my ERGO carrier and NOT have to use two sets of straps on my back (one for the carrier and one for the backpack). Yet, this is not comfortable the way it is currently set up and doesn't sit well with weight. I wished I had just continued to use another backpack that I already owned and double them up since the backpack I already owned is much sturdier.I think this product is a gimmick and not worth anyone's money!
