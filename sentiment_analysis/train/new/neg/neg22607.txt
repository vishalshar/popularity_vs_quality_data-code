This thermometer is way off. The first time I used it the temperature read 98 degrees so I placed my son in the bath water thinking it was safe. He started crying. I grabbed the thermometer I was using (a steak thermometer) pre purchase of the turtle to check the water again and the reading was 3 degrees higher. I would not recommend this item at all. If I use it at all it is for my son to play with. Waste of money as far as I am concerned.
