We though this ducky was super cute for our son.  Well the design is not great.  The cowboy hat that the duck is wearing is so top heavy that the duck doesn't float :(  Sort of defeats the purpose.  My son still loves splashing around in the bath with it, but it only floats on it's side.  Might want to rethink the design.
