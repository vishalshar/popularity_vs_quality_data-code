We bought 2 of these and for some reason, the one in my husband's car has a problem maintaining the angle that it is positioned at. Our son isn't big enough to reach the mirror, so I know it's not him messing with it. Also, be careful driving with the rear windows open. The strap that attaches the mirror to the headrest isn't stable enough to keep the whole mirror from bouncing around when being buffeted by incoming winds. It's also kind of distracting to see your child's head bobbing in and out of view like they're possessed.
