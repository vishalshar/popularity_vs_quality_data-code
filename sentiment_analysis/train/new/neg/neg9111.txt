Pay attention to the small print! Though it is very hard to notice unless you are looking for it, this part is listed as "for the newer Bees only". If you have an old Bee (with the solid wheels) this part will work but is very sloppy and loose. I can't find the correct part on Amazon, and so I ended up with this part without understanding the difference, and now I have adapters that don't really fit. I'm writing this to hopefully help others avoid the same mistake.Bugaboo, you should make this more clear, or better: Don't make and sell parts that are subtly incompatible... it just causes problems for your customers.Signed, a disappointed customer with a sloppy adapter.
