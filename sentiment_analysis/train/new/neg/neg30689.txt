My poor little girl started crying in pain after I gave her a bite of food using one of these spoons. Turns out the cheap things had little sharp plastic edges that cut her mouth. These spoons are pieces of junk and can cause injury so don't waste your money! If you do buy them, make sure you feel the spoon before putting it in your baby's mouth for sharp edges.
