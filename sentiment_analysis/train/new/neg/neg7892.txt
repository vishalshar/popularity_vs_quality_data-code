I could not be more disappointed with my new single Aria.  It is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PUSH.  It makes little difference whether my 18 pound daughter or 30 pound son is in it, it is impossible to steer with one hand, and often difficult to steer with both hands.  It frequently requires lifting up the front end off the ground entirely to change directions.  I have lived with it for a couple of weeks, hoping that it was just "tight" and would loosen up, but there has been no change and I am becoming more and more frustrated with it and really regretting my purchase and trust in Peg Perego's reputation for excellent baby products.  The only time it lives up to the possibly inflated reputation of Peg Perego is when we are rolling straight forward.  Any effort to turn or adjust directions is just that, an effort.I have owned 3 other strollers in my tenure as a mother so far: a Graco Metro Lite, a Chicco umbrella stroller and a Jeep double umbrella stroller.  All three of these have been SIGNIFICANTLY easier to use.  They have been nearly equal in ease of open/close mechanisms and have been much easier to push, turn and manuever, including my $79 double side-by-side Jeep stroller.Moreover, the cup-holder on the Aria is useless.  It is so narrow and close to the handle that it will not hold even a small cup (i.e. Tall Starbucks beverage) or sippy cup without risk of falling out.
