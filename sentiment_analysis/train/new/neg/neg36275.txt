I really wanted to love this carrier because it's easy to put on and use which I need because I'm disabled. However, it's stretched out so quickly that it just would not hold my baby in the proper position (lasted 15 minutes). Now I see why in all the pictures for this product the model is holding the baby while they're wearing them, because that's the only way you can keep your baby in the right position. I am returning this item and purchasing an Ergo instead. It would work if there was a way to tighten it, but there is not. The only plus is,  it is very easy to put on, but it doesn't do any good being easy to put it on if you can't keep the baby in the right position, because it stretches out so fast. (and yes I did get the right size.)
