85% POLYESTER?????This is NOT an organic product. Only 15% organic cotton is used. I have absolutely no idea how they are able to market this product as being organic - it's a rip off.I would return it but I live in Hong Kong and had someone collected my Amazon stuff from the US when they were there so now i'm stuck with it.The pattern on the exterior of the pad is also different from what is shown in the picture, and I hate it.Thoroughly disappointed.
