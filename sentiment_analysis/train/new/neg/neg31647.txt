I bought these for my children, who constantly have fingers, pencils and shirts in their mouths, especially since it's germ season. I have no idea why they are feeling so oral these days but it was getting annoying! So, I gave in and bought these.They reason I give them 3 stars is because they hold up well to constant chewing and haven't come off in pieces.....and the reason I only give them 3 stars is the squeaky noise of them is enough to make you crawl out of your skin!!! I literally can't handle it; it's like nails up a chalkboard. I would not buy these again just for that reason.If you have hearing issues and noises don't bother you, then by all means, get these! But if you are bothered by squeaking and chewing and slurping noises....run!!Ugh. Makes me shiver just to write about it.....
