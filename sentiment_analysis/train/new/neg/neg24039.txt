I ordered these diapers because the quantity that you get for the price is far more than you would if they were bought in a store.  So I actually ordered several boxes but found that they leak.  These same Huggies that I had previously bought in the store did not leak.  I also noticed that these seemed to be thinner than the ones from the store.
