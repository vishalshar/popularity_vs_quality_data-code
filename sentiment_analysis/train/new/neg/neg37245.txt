I ordered this to puree my infants' food. I like the ease of using the machine, yet there are chunks of food that remains. I have to try to use a spatula to push the food down and/or try to remove the chunks as I place the food in ice trays. When heating in the microwave, I smoosh all the food down, just to make sure the food has been mashed.
