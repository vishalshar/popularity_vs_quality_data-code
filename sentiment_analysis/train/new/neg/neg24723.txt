There are pros and cons to this little bag. The con: it is very little.  Granted it's made for a toddler to carry and it does fit nicely on my 22 month old, but if it had been designed just a bit better I could have given it a 5 star rating.  The mesh pocket on the side for a cup or water bottle is not large enough to carry much of anything -- we use playtex straw cups and gerber sippy cups, both of which will not squeeze into this outside pocket rendering the idea pretty much useless.  The large zipper pocket is just large enough for a diaper, a small package of wipes, and the standard sized sippy cup.  Unfortunately, this leaves no room left for a snack cup.  Just an inch more in width or heigth and it would be a great little bag.  The pros: easy to use. Seems very comfortable for my son to carry.  It snaps  in the front to keep it in place.  The parent strap is a plus and is about the only thing that fits into that side mesh pocket for storage.  Overall cute design.  A little disappointed for what I got with the money, but it seems sturdy despite the design flaws.
