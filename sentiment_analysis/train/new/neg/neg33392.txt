I have the Phillips pump and decided to use these to store my milk in the freezer.Pros:Fits into Avent warmerBPA freeConnects to Avent pumpEasy to pour into bottleCan be used for homemade baby food after milkCons:Takes up a lot of storage space compared to bags in freezerIf they fall out of freezer they chip and break and waste milk (happened more than once)I continued to purchase these even though they aren't perfect. My freezer is filled for when I return to work and I know that if it was in bags they would have been a fraction of the storage space taken. I liked using these for my first son because I could store home made baby food and they became multi-use. Grandpa also found it easy to feed baby with these and I didn't want to switch it up. I know they sell bags for Avent now and it is worth looking into. If you plan on making baby food after keep in mind that the plastic does take on the color of the food you make over time and needs to be thrown out.
