This mobile is really cute but it misses the idea of a mobile. Jthe music would last less then a minute so unless you stay close to relaunch it each time it stops or you better just call it crib decoration that is actually more interesting to adult then the babies. The view they have from the crib is not that interesting !I was disappointed by the product!
