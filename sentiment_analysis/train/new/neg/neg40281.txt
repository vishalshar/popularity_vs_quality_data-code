i like that this potty is tiny.  my daughter's in the 50% for height, and 10% for weight as an 18-month old.  it fits her perfectly and will for a while to come.  she ends up in a "squat" position that is perfect and healthy for having bowel movements.the only thing i don't like about this potty is that it slips around like crazy on the wood floors in our bathroom, making it difficult for her to get really good at positioning herself before sitting down.  so now we always put it down on the bath mat and that fixes that problem.there is a potty sold at IKEA for like $4 and it is the same design only slightly larger and it has a no-skid bottom.  wish i had bought that one instead, except i don't like supporting IKEA.don't think this tiny potty would work for a boy--pee might splash everywhere as it is not deep.  i don't know, never tried it with a boy.
