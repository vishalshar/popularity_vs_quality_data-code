This is a gorgeous stroller and the price on it is so sweet considering that it has everything you need to get going right the way even the car seat adaptor. The design is the same as Bugaboo's where the bassinet is supposed to become a toddler seat. Well, that feature never worked for us. I mean the seat was sitting up but not even close to 90 degree angle.The wheels also looked like they were about to fall off and the break was sticking quite a bit, I had to come up with a way that only I knew to make the break 'unstick'.We had to return the stroller after using it for 5 months as our boy was no longer happy laying on his back and was ready to sit up and look around. Hopefully with the time they will make changes to the stroller to truly allow you use it for 2+ years like it is meant to.
