i bought this for my son's nursery. it looks great on the crib, and it does complete the camp snoopy collection. the only problem with the item is the music, it's powered by winding action. the music plays for a very brief period of time, doesn't even seem to last 5 minutes. there is a possibility that i received a defective item, but i haven't even seen anyone else review the product, so i can't say whether or not the brief music playing time is the norm. for completing the nursery setup, a+, but for function - as far as soothing music playing goes, maybe a c-.
