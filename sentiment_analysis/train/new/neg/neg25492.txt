A little disappointed with this sling because it personally causes my shoulders pain. I chose this specific sling because I was in need of something that would allow me to get things done while nursing. It was helpful at times in allowing me to become Mobil being that I have a newborn,1 year old and 5 year old sons. The material made it a little difficult because my baby would get so hot and would need to be readjusted constantly.  I love the print and the colors. Also, my baby boy is a big baby and I think this Sling is better suited for a smaller baby. It was helpful while nursing and cooking dinner though. I think it's a great idea just not ideal for me. Hope this review is helpful!
