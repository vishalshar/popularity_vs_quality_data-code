I bought this despite reading reviews here about cracks developing in short periods of time, and I regret that decision. It's a good idea and much more affordable than the stokke version. I love that you can change out images underneath and it's general dimensions. So I decided to baby this tray to see if I could prevent it from cracking. When it arrived there was a small note attached that directed me to hand wash this in cold water only, which made me think the company knew there was a problem with durability. So I followed the instructions carefully and have only hand washed it in cold water. We use this for our older baby, who isn't rough with it at all. Still within two months a crack developed exactly where it was described to develop by others (about an inch and a half long, at the center of the clear part on the wrist rest part). How disappointing to have spent the extra time caring for this only to have it break down in a short time. We still used it for a month with the crack to see if it would get worse or stay the same. It has progressivey gotten much longer and isn't really usable after only 4-5 months.In retrospect I shouldn't have ordered anything that would have such fussy wash instructions for everyday use.
