I purchased this pump to replace my Medela Pump in Style Advanced, which I hated.  I had the original Medela Pump in Style so I decided to purchase the upgraded Advanced version with the new "let down mode".  It was horrible and hurt and did not have as many adjustments as my older pump...so, baby number 3 and another $300 pump.  So, I purchased this in July, but did not attempt to use until November, 8 weeks after my baby was born.  This pump was amazingly comfortable and efficient from the very first pump.  It got a lot more milk in a lot less time since you can tailor the pump speed and strength with no "preset settings".  Then, I attempted to get a second let-down after only 5 minutes of pumping and the handle snapped.  I could not believe it broke after only the first use!  I contacted customer service, nervous they could not help me because this pump was not even opened for 4 months.  The rep was great and is sending me a new handle.  I sure hope this problem is the only one I have because it truly is a wonderful pump.  I would have given it 5 stars had it not broken on the first use!  One other great plus for this pump - no milk can get into the tubing or motor, so risk of infection from condensation buildup or from milk entering the tubing is non-existant.  There are 2 suction disks that are attached to the bottle (on the horns), with no opening to allow milk to enter.  A HUGE plus (especially if you want to sell it later!).
