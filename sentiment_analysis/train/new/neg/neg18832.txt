i loved the idea of a paci that wont fall out. when i got the paci, i loved the toy and everything. unfortunately my son didnt like the soothie brand. i went for make-it-urself project and sew his old avent paci to the wubbanub. but he still didnt like it. he is a very ative boy, he waves his arms and rips the paci out of his mouth. the toy is good size for his little hands to play with and im really hoping he'll like it later, when he can reach for a pacifier and put it in his mouth knowingly, not by accident.
