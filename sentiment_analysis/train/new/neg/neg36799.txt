This hamper is so soft and cute, and the colors are much nicer in person! It's big enough to hold more baby laundry than you'll probably ever have to wash at once, and has a cloth flap on top so that the clothing inside isn't visible. This would work in a boy's or girl's room. However, after looking more closely at the hamper, I've noticed that the unfinished wood frame is full of "peeling" cracks and splinters. Some of the pieces of wood sticking out would definitely give a child a splinter big enough for a hospital visit to get the whole thing removed. It's definitely cute in my baby's room, but I will for sure be sanding the wood before he is old enough to get his hands anywhere near it! For the price of this hamper, I would not have purchased it knowing that I would have to sand it myself or risk injury to my child.
