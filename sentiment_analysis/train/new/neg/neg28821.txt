Getting ready to trash this mirror.  The mirror part comes wrapped in a plastic that needs to be removed to make the mirror clear enough to see.  I pulled back the edges of the cloth a little to see where to peel back the plastic and it was wrapped all around the back.  So to avoid scratching the front I wanted to take the mirror out and cut from the back.  I see it held onto a piece of cheap cardboard with plastic tie wraps so I assumed this was just to hold it in place in the packaging like every kids toy and I cut them.  Turns out the mirror being tie wrapped to the cheap cardboard is integral to the mirror actually being centered and fitting the opening. Otherwise it's too small.  Definitely cheap materials and I wish I had spent a few bucks extra the first time.
