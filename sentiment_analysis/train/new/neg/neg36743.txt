I bought this for my 3 month old in hopes of further developing his leg muscles. My son Is a pretty big baby and he still cannot manage to jump in this. His feet reach the floor but when he tries to jump this system goes no where. Although he has figured out how to turn himself around. I'd say this is more in the category as a stationary play system though at this point. I still ended up buying him a doorway jumper and decided to keep this as another option to play with for him. Although I'm not too happy with this systems bounce I am still very happy about how small the space saver bouncer is. It's not always in the way and is easy to move around with one arm. I am able to move this unit one handed with my baby in the other arm from the living room to kitchen in a snap. I also like how easy it is to attach your own toys for baby to bat at. The little chick on the top of the center is useless though. It always falls out and is mainly hanging unable to be played with.
