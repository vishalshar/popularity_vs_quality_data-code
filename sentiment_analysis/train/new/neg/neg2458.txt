Pro: for the price of less than $5, it may worth the price. It works for what I need, which is see my kid on the rear seat. The windshield pad sticks ok on the car windshield even though the pad is so thin and low quality. I have it on for 2 months now and it hasn't felt once. You may want to lick and stick it to the windshield to make it stay better :)Cons: The mirror is not very big but has a very wide view that you can't see image in details. It bends vertically at the middle of the mirror that make the image unnaturally thinner. If you love to see your kid face more than what the kid is doing with their hands then you will be very disappointed with this mirror.
