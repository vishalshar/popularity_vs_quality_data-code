The product itself is acceptable and the parents to be were delighted with it. However we did not recieve the one we ordered. We ordered the one in the picture with the green and brown so it was neutral for boy or girl and the one we were sent was blue and browns. There has been alot going on around here and I just haven't been able to get back to this to write up a complaint. I had seen the blue and brown ones at other sites for alot cheaper but the Shull's wanted the Green/brown so we spent the extra money for it and got the blue and brown. Is this the way the you do business, show one thing and ship another?I have NEVER ordered from here before and this really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Product was: Graco Pack N Play, playard with Newborn Napper, Lowery
