the Supermarket Play set did not meet my expectation whatsoever-.  Once it is constructed, it is impossible to take apart to return to AMAZON.  The Play set shows a 3-4 year old child behind the cash register, and in reality it is a lot smaller than what is pictured.  The Red shelves pictured on the front of the "counter" come right off.  Finally the directions are not in writing!  you have to look at  (faded, low quality) pictures for assembly.
