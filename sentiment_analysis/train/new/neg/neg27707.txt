This specific toy is not an original. The toys are plastic, the original ones are fabric. The tag that says "mamas and papas" is hand sewn. It also arrived from China. I had purchased it and after requesting a refund because the item is fake, the seller did not even question my motive, he issued a refund right away and let me keep the toy. That was nice, but don't call it "mamas and papas" when it's clearly not. Pay a few more dollars and get the original one, the difference is big.
