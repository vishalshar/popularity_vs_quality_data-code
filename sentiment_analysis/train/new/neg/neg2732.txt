It is not vinyl and easy to wipe off. I understand it fits most car seats but I think it'd have to be a small one. The material is similar to that of bed sheets you would buy at a dollar store. And how you secure it in place is by a push button that you tighten on a draw string.It also does not stay in place so I'm always having to fix it or pull it down.The picture of Elmo is correct and looks like the picture thankfully, my 2 yr old son only cares that he sees Elmo on his seat.So the design is what you get, but the cover is fabric and therefore can and will get stained is not vinyl and can not be easily wiped off.
