PROS1. Different firmness - one side for babies, the other for toddlers.  It is recommended that babies are in a firm surface to prevent SIDS.2. Affordable3. Lightweight, it will be easy to change the fitted sheets with this light mattress.CONS1. The material is water-resistant - NOT waterproof. Other mattresses are waterproof.  You will have to use a waterproof liner with this one.2. Packaging was horrible.  It was wrapped in plastic, as if it was just in the store. There were 2 fist-sized holes in the plastic - I assume this came from the handling - because there was no other way to hold the product.I'm debating about returning it - not because of the packaging but the material not being waterproof.
