While they are spill proof when the lid is on, they are most defiantly not when in use my the baby. My 8 month old would bang his upside down on his highchair and it made a huge mess. I was disappointed as I really like other Tommee Tippee products.Also, as others have stated, I ordered boy colors and got purple.
