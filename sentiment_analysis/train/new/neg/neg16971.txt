Poor quality, less then 30 second of use before the buckle broke, snapped apart and cannot lock back in... Also I will say it's made For older babies that already have their balance down and started taken steps, especially since there's no side support what so ever,  so unless u want ur kids falling down getting hurt wouldn't recommend using before then, my son is 8 months and hasn't started walking he pulls his self up and is barley starting to balance on his own so the fact that it's designed with older babies in mind could be why it snapped on me, not able to stand alone and balance puts more weight and strain on it,
