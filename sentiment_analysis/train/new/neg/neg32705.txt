I read the measurements but I feel like it's a little small. I had to really pull it to get it on the mattress and then it wouldn't go over the sides all the way. Serves it's purpose but definitely about an inch smaller than advertised. Very soft though. I did wash cold and dry low heat, but I feel that since this is bedding that shouldn't have caused shrinkage. I mean, how many people specially hand wash or air dry a babies sheet? Anyway, I like it but something to keep in mind.
