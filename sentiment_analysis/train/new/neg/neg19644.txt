This lamp shade was much smaller than I was hoping. It was difficult for me to match with a cute lamp base. The base I found that I liked did not work with this shade. It was for a small shade but this was just too small. I love the design and I wanted to use it for my son's Dr. Seuss theme nursery but we ended up having to go with a solid blue instead to match the color and size of the base I found. Now this shade sits unused. Hoping he will use it as he gets a little older and needs a small night stand lamp. Will have to shop at that time for a smaller base that will work with this shade. I wish it came with a base option, even white would have worked for us.
