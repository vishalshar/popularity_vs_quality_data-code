We purchased this pacifier this May and our one year old uses it at naptime only. We wash it in very hot water after using every time. These couple of days our son had stomach virus and terrible diarrhea, and this morning we just found out mold grow inside pacifier as water stuck inside. We don't know if it's related to our sons stomach virus but will not give these pacifier to him again.
