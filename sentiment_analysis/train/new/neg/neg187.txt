The crib is located upstairs, but most of our activity is downstairs or in the garage, so we wanted to not only hear, but see the baby to know for certain we need to attend to him, or if he's just playing/dreaming. This monitor does all of that for us. It's nice to turn the video off at night and use as an audio monitor, too. The screen is fairly clear, can be a little blurry, and sometimes when it first wakes up, the image tracks before settling; and it doesn't always settle perfectly.But we can still see the baby and that's what's important. I am really impressed with the nighvision, so that when the baby is sleeping in a very dark room, we can still see him clearly like the room is lit up. That is very impressive. The sound is good, too, it's very clear.Install is very easy and the monitor can go anywhere. Reception is great, too, picking up all over the house, even through two floors.Overall, this is a great monitor for the price, it's just the image tracking that isn't ideal.
