I got this bedding based on the price and all the pieces that comes with it.  The quality is not all that good, but for the price you get what you pay for.  With my son we paid a lot for his bedding for the short time he actually used it.  I would not buy the extra sheets from this company I got Kola Baby in different colors because those sheets are much better quality and for as much as they need washed I need good quality.
