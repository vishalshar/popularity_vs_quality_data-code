The actual console in this package is amazing. I REALLY love that it is insulated and holds more than any other console I looked into buying. The center piece is big enough for me to fit my compact revolver in for concealed carry on the go. It is VERY durable fabric, attaches easily, and stays in the position you place it in. Other consoles slid around or would flip with a water bottle's weight in them.The PUMP that came with this set seemed like a GREAT idea. Sadly, it is incredibly awkward to get this particular pump on the stem to inflate my tires. I have had my husband, a mechanic, and several other people try this pump on my stroller tires because I thought I was doing something wrong. Turns out, the pump and wheels just aren't that compatible (I have the 2016 BOB revolution flex). So, I was initially excited to have such a small pump to keep with me at all times in case I got a flat, but this thing is a nightmare to use. It really needs to be redesigned. I have to carry my large manual bike pump in my car to keep my tires inflated as this pump is a joke.Bottom line: The console is fantastic and worth every penny... I wouldn't recommend buying this JUST because it comes with the pump.
