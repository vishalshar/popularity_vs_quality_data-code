I bought these batteries and charger to use with my and my wife's dive computers to save a little money and avoid all the waste with disposable batteries.  They work as advertised, however the only thing which I have found that you have to take into consideration is that they do not degrade with use in the same way as the typical alkaline battery.  In my use I can get 5 or 6 days of diving with an alkaline battery and the voltage drops gradually with use, but the rechargeable batteries only last about 4 days and the voltage drops rapidly near the end.
