<Note: I didn't get the newborn size, I got the bigger size!> Our son didn't squirm and learned to love having his diaper changed (as soon as we learned to slow down and relax while changing him--our attitude makes a huge difference). This product came out when he was about six months old. It seemed perfect, because he was just starting to wriggle around a lot more when we were changing him. But the swaddle strip just isn't wide enough on this to help very much. He's a totally average-sized kid, across the board--height, weight, etc.--so I was really surprised that the swaddle was too narrow to keep his arms from popping right out above and below. I still use it, because he thinks the whole process is very funny, for some reason, but it mainly works as a distraction while I quickly wipe at whatever his hands might get into first. The width of the swaddle is definitely the problem--I tried making it tighter, but he cried, was visibly uncomfortable, and still got his arms right out. Once his arms are free, it does stop him from rolling over onto his stomach, which is helpful, but not as great as what Halo advertises. I don't think I would need this for newborns, unless the swaddle helped them feel more comfortable. Halo, if you read these reviews, make a SwaddleChange for bigger babies! Please!
