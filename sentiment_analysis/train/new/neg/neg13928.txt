On first glance they are so cute!! But the more I look at them the more I'm starting not to like them if that makes any sense.  The flowers are adorable but the band doesn't look comfortable for babys head (I havnt tried it yet,  baby isnt born yet)  hey have a metal clasp under the flowers that looks even more uncomfortable,  I'm going to hotglue felt over it since its covered by the flower and see if it helps,I don't think I'll be able to use them long but time will tell.  But they are cute so that's a plus.
