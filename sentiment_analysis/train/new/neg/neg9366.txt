The concept is adorable for this teether, however I don't think it works great. My 3 month old has been teething for a few weeks and most teething rings are too big for his mouth so I figured this would be great since it is more like a pacifier. But that's the biggest problem, it is too much like a pacifier that my son doesn't want to use it to chew on. I'm giving it 2 stars for concept and how it looks; but as far as usefulness, this is a dud.
