Ok, so baby does like the toy, but his germs-concerned-mamma does not.The red parts of the toy attract lint like it's nobody's business. also Lint sticks to it like a magnet, no way I am letting my baby near that!I tried all sorts of cleaning approaches until I had to SHAVE the darn thing.I wanted to return it but it was late so it now seats in a shelf, AWAY from the floor.
