I bought this as a gift and noticed right away that the quality is not as good as a set of similar bath toys that are in the shape of cars made by Alex toys.  The size of the dinosaurs are good, and the colors are bright but they seem slightly worn, as if the colors are already starting to come off in specks.  I bought the Alex brand bath toys for my own child and they still look brand new even after several baths.  In my opinion I'm not sure if these dinosaur ones will hold up as well but they still looked good enough to give as a gift.
