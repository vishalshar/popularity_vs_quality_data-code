I own a 2011 Toyota Sequoia. The seatbelt "head" or part you buckle into has a dome shape to it. This item does not fit properly around it since it has a rectangular shape to it and there is no room to adjust it. It can be forced onto the "head" but then you cant buckle the seat belt. I have an Autistic Son so I was really hoping for success with this item since he manages to remove the belt when I am driving. So, that being said DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE A TOYOTA SEQUOIA!!
