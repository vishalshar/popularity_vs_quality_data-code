I was excited to order this for my new baby but when I got it I was kind of disappointed cuase there were like black spots on parts of the bag. Also some of the words were mispelled. The part that said Snoopy was actually written Snooby and the bag had a wierd smell about it. Good thing I got another bag better than this one, I think I will just use this bag for everyday use and wait till it tears down and use my nicer bag for special ocasions or outings with baby.
