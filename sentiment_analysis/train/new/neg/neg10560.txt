I used to have the infant clipper from several years ago.  It seems like the quality has degraded with the new one I bought.  The metal part doesn't sit well into the plastic section.  Everytime I press to clip my daughter's nail, it moves out of place.  I don't think that is safe.  And the larger clipper doesn't cut at all.  I tried cutting my son's nails with it.  I had to revert  back to using my American Red  Cross brand.  I would have returned this product but didn't have the energy or time to deal with it.
