First of all the pasties are not satin covered. They are made of a flimsy paper tape like material and they easily tear when being handled. Secondly they are very transparent and nipples are still easily visible through white tops. Lastly and probably the worst thing is that they are difficult to remove. The backing adheres to the skin so hard that you have to rip the pasties into pieces when removing which leaves glue residue and pastie remnants stii on the skin a couple days later. I was very disappointed with the product.
