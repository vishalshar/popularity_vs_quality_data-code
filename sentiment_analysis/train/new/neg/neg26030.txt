I really, really liked the idea of this product!  So much that when it wasn't purchased off of my registry, I bought it myself.  Sadly, it has been sitting unused.  I only used it one time to try it out.  It works great for finely pureed food without any lumps.  I can see it not working if the food was lumpy.  I'll save it for my next kid - maybe I will use it then.
