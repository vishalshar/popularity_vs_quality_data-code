My daughter was so excited to get this tub toy and wanted to take a bath right away when it was delivered but was disappointed after trying to use it.  It's a fun little toy for a minute and then it falls off the tub wall after you put water in the top and won't stay put no matter what after that.  It will stay up for only short bursts of time and then falls down as soon as one ring is put on it.
