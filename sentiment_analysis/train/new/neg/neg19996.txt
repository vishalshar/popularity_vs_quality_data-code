I got these thinking they would really help with keeping the car cooler in Texas heat. But these did not work as well as I had assumed! They are extremely hard to put on the windows, and they haven't stayed very well once I finally got them on. They peel off and I'm guessing the heat and hot windows helps with the peeling process! Wishing I would have gotten a different type, i have used Munchkin brand EVERYTHING with my little girl, I stand behind the brand but these are not the best for the windows.
