I've never written a review on Amazon yet but I feel I need to for this terrible product. I made the mistake of buying 2 of these gates with extensions. The gates alone probably work very well but the extensions make them flimsy and they bend back and forth with the plastic male-to-male adapter that is needed to join the gate to the extensions.My photo highlights the bend in red. Because of the bend the latch doesn't seat properly all the time either.The 2nd one had a broken screw head in the handle/latch causing it to come apart. See additional pictures. On the one picture, you can see the bottom piece sliding down because of the screw being broken. I wasn't even able to use pliers to unscrew the broken screw to try and replace it. I now have to call them to request a new piece.The cheap wrench that comes with the set to tighten the nuts is just terrible. It's small, making it hard to get any leverage on it to turn the final few turns needed and the nuts even started to strip the wrench which I never thought would be possible. I then tried my Craftsmen wrenches but God forbid they give you a nut that is standard or metric size. The only wrench that fits is the one they give you which is only a cheap thin piece of metal that weakens before you can even tighten the torque all the way.If I wasn't in a bind and need these gates right now, I would return and never buy again!Please save yourself the hassle and AVOID buying this product at all costs!
