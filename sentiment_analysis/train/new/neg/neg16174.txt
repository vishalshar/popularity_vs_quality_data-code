I handwashed the jars and lids to make it last longer per the instructions. The black paint discolored and chipped anyway after only 3 weeks of use. The ladybug completely came off. Now the lids barely fit the jars. I cant even twist them on most of the jars. The quality is just not there. These were very expensive for what you get. The money went into the box they came in not the jars. I dont know why you need so much packaging.Update, feb 2013.i really want to like these jars.  i continue to use them because they fit perfectly into my dr. browns bottle warmer, so its easy to heat up the food.  I really don't like the lids though.  i struggle to get them to close properly and there is almost no more paint left on them.  i wish they had just left the lids stainless steel without the paint so i wouldn't worry about it getting in the food.
