I received my order today.  I boiled the nipples and washed them.  While feeding my baby, I noticed a terrible chemical smell.  It was the Dr. Brown nipple!  It's so bad I'm going to have to trash them and go buy new ones.  I have purchased this same product at Wal-Mart, and never noticed any kind of smell coming off them.  The smell is so bad, I'm afraid of what I might have done to my baby by feeding her from this nipple.
