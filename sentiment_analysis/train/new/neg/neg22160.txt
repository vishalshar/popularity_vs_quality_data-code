Agree with the other reviewer who has the leakiness problem... I think this is a great cup and my daughter likes it, but sometimes we wind up with huge puddles and wet clothes! What? How did I spend $12 on a leaky cup? I have tried to make sure the silicone ring in the lid is in place, and now shake the cup over the sink every time I put one together but STILL sometimes get the leaks. Argh!Addendum: I find that carefully screwing the top on so that the straw is directly above the numbers (the graduated bit with the numbers of ounces I mean) helps. Also, the thing just can't seem to handle changes in temperature very well--if the drink inside the cup is very cold, for example, the liquid seems inevitably to come up out of the top as it equilibrates to room temp. But if the liquid is close to room temp, I find that making sure the lid is screwed on right usually does the trick. So I never ever put the cup in the fridge anymore, as that seems just to be asking for tremendous leakage.
