We were very disappointed not to mention truly annoyed when the Davinci Changing Table arrived with three different pieces that were not completely pre-drilled, making it impossible for us to assemble.  The replacement process apparently is working as we were able to quickly report the issue via the website, and the company did send a very oblique response that something had been sent to us.  However, the email did not identify what was being sent, and the name DaVinci was not on it, so there was some initial confusion about what the email was referencing. DaVinci/MDB folks, you can easily customize your emails to customers making them a bit more personal and informative!  In any event, with our baby due any week now, delays like this become more difficult to accept.  We love our DaVinci crib (purchased earlier) which, although time consuming to assemble due to inaccurately drawn instructions provided, is a durable and charming addition to our nursery.  To sum up, DaVinci/MDB: you can do better!
