First, the picture provided is nothing at all close to what the real bag looks like.Think about 5 or 6 shades darker. It's more of a light coffee brown then the cream-ish color displayed in this picutre. :( I was very disapointed in this.I haven't used it, but will settle for it since I don't have a choice - my little one will be here any day.Definitely no where near what I was expecting.Also, shipping was ridiculous - like $20+!!
