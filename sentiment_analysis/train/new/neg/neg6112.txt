I was SO bummed to learn the new PPB bags came with magnetic closure AND snaps!  My PPB was the very first thing I bought (on sale) after I found out I was pregnant.  Of course, it was only a couple of months later they had the new design.  The velcro snags on my sweaters, A&A blankets, it's own straps - annoying!  When I heard about this product, I hurriedly ordered one despite the mixed reviews.  It just flat out doesn't work on a bag with any normal amount of items in it.  I tested it like the one reviewer wrote - upside down.  What a joke.  I emptied out the contents of my bag, one by one.  Basically, the bag has to be kind of wrinkly empty in order for the flap to stay closed.  This would have been perfect with the magnet PLUS the snaps on it, to make it like the newer versions of the bags.  OR maybe just with snaps.  Only plus is that our things are no longer being snagged.  Debating on whther or not to return it.
