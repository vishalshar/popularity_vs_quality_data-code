My 7 mo old has never really liked this teether, and I've been offering it to her off and on for the last 3 months. The ring part isn't that interesting to her and the mouth guard part seems very large for her little mouth- she knows what to do with it, but has trouble getting her lips around it to fit it in her mouth. I use a infant silicone finger toothbrush nightly to brush her gums, so she is used to the feeling of the little silicone brush. Will keep offering it, in case she decides to like it, but it's not looking like a winner.I think it's a good product, just not good for babies with tiny little mouths!
