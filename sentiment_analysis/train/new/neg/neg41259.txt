I bought this as a gag gift for some military coworkers.  We are a bit more vulgar in the office so when I read the other review I kind of blew it off.  I should have listened, the insults are just mean and uncalled for.  They aren't fun.  I had to put "for emergency use only" on the package for the christmas gift.  Some funner insults would make this toy a bit better.  Or maybe some YO MAMA jokes ;)
