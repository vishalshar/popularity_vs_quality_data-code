I really wanted to like this cup. I bought it because I read a good review on it. It does not leak which I really like however the straw does not reach the bottom of the cup to the cup has to be full in order to get anything out of it. Also there are so many parts to clean. And the water does not come out of the straw very easily. It would be good for a small baby just learning to use a straw but for my 18 month old girls I think they don't get as much water out as they want. And The lid is sometimes hard to screw on because the handles get in the way and the round cup is just so stout it can be difficult to do especially in a hurry. Anyway I bought this cup because I needed something that was leakproof and this basically is but I would not buy it again unless my babies were six months old and we could get more use out of it.
