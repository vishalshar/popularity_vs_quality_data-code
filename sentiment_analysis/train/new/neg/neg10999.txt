I bought these when we transitioned from our last "naptime" bottle for my two-year old. She is already fine with cups/sippies but this made a nice bottle-like cup to drink from at naptime so the transitionfrom her bottle was not as bad.(at this point the bottle is almost a lovey/go to sleep soother)For that task it was great, bottle sized and easy to hold.But, this is a weird hybrid. Not a sippy cup  - unlike sippy cups, it spills when turned upside down. (Totally NOT spill-proof, not sure why it claims that) For that reason, I can't see this being taken out of the house as its just asking for juice/milk everwhere. But also not a sports sipper - the nipple is more bottle-like than straw like, and it doesn't have a flip-top or anything. The spout/lid is just not well designed. We have a mini nalgene bottle (that is unfortunately BPA - *sigh*) but works much better as it has an actual straw, which this does not. Was hoping to use as a sports bottle for to-go drinks, but this isn't it.Overall its ok (did great for the bottle transition), but I'm not planning to buy more.
