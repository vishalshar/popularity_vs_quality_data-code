We have two of these camera's.  One for each of our daughter's rooms.  You can see and hear well enough, but the problem with these is the static you hear on the receiver's.  Our room is about 30 ft from our daughter's rooms and at that distance the monitors get a lot of static.  Even if we just move in our bed sometimes it makes it worse.  The camera itself allows you to see when it's light or completely dark in the room.  The light on the top of the camera isn't too bright.  As far as durability, the first one we bought died after about 18 months.  We'll see how the two we have now hold up.  We just bought another camera set because we already had two monitors and just needed to replace the camera which was cheaper than buying a whole new set.  If the rooms are fairly close to each other then these work great, if you've got a lot of walls or other obstructions between the receiver and camera, then you may have some issues with interference which manifests itself as loud sudden noises that could keep you up at night if you're a light sleeper.
