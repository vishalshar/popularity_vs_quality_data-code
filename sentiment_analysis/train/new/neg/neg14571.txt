This brush looked like it would meet our need for washing out bottles and small jars, drinking glasses, etc, in the kitchen. Unfortunately, ours broke within a month of use. The twisted metal wand that attaches the main scrubber head to the plastic handle snapped right in two. The plastic coating held it dangling on, but it was essentially endered unusable.  What a disappointment. Perhaps it would work for someone only washing baby bottles and nothing wider mouthed (I'm thinking the long slender bottles would relieve the metal twisted wand from any pressure of scrubbing). We saved the tiny scrub head that detaches and tossed it in the drawer with a much better scrubber we replaced this one with made by OXO (currently the number one best seller bottle scrubber on Amazon) which has a plastic wand, and fits just as well into narrow glass bottles. But, for this scrubber, it did not live up to even modest expectations.
