This item description is misleading.  There are three replacement lids are shown in the photo at a cost of about $7.00.  A whole new cup can be purchased for $4.00, if there is only one replacement lid why would anyone ever order just a single lid for twice the price?My issue is not with the product itself but in the messaging regarding product contents and/or the image.  The price is not competitive.
