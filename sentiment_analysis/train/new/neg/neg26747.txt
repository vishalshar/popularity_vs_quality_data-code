With my first child, I bought Dr Browns lace contoured nursing pads (don't know the exact name).  I really liked them, and was so happy that I didn't have to use a ton of disposable ones like my friends did.  I wanted more of those with my second, but they no longer make them.  So I started looking for a brand that I would be happy with.  I tried Philips Avent, they are small, so they don't hold much, and these.  They are alright for home use, but they do leak through, so if I go out, I put on a disposable one.  I think they hold a fair amount of leakage, but after a little while the leakage makes its way to your shirt.  If this had a waterproof outside layer, I would be a lot happier.  I guess the other reason I wouldn't wear this out is that it is thicker and not contoured, so it looks kind of funny under anything besides an oversized t-shirt.
