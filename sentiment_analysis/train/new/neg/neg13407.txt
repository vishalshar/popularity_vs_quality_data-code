I ordered this product and when it cam i was really excited and thought, this is a great stroller and it will be perfect! So not perfect since it was broken. Well it can happen right? So I contact the seller and they sent me a new one. This one was also broken, only a button but still I paid good money so I called and had them send me another, praying that there wouldn't be anything wrong with this one. When the third one came, it was also BROKEN (in the same spot that the first one was broken)!!! I'm feeling like this is not a coincidence!
