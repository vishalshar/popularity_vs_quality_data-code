Do not buy this! I bought this baby food cooker 2 months ago and initially loved it. It's quick and has a sharp blade to really mash any food you prepare.... HOWEVER: The other day I prepared potatoes in this cooker and realized that they looked somehow gray-ish and smelled funny. After further inspection, I realized that the rubber part or nut that holds the blade in place had somehow rubbed off or partially melted into my baby's food! I attached a pic here to that I took after I took out the cutting blade. It is really gross and extremely worrisome as I don't know how many times the plastic has melted into the food previously without me noticing.The worst part is that I contacted BEABA customer support immediately with pictures of the mess but until this day I have not heard back (email sent May 2, 2016). It is quite disheartening that they apparently do not care at all.All in all, I would not buy this product again - obviously.
