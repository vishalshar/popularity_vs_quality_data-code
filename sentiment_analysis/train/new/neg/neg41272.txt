Before buying this seat, we used a generic seat from a local department store that was padded and pretty flat, with a slight "pee shield" in front. It was pretty bulky and messy, so we looked elsewhere. The Bjorn Toilet Trainer is definitely more contoured to little peoples' bodies, which is great, but we still found it to be pretty messy.It fits our toilet great- it doesn't slip at all. Sometimes, though, it will stick to my son's skin after he's been sitting on it for several minutes, so it pops up as he stands. I can't really blame the Bjorn, though, as it seems to be just the fact that it is made out of plastic.I like that it is so slim, so it doesn't add much height to the existing toilet. It's easier for my son to sit down and stand up (with the help of a stool.) It's also very simplistic, so it is easy to clean.Speaking of cleaning, though, I have to clean it after every single use. I guess I was hoping for a basic seat that would act exactly like a normal toilet seat- the child sits down, the pee goes in the toilet, and you flush it away. Unfortunately, whenever my son urinates, even when keeping his parts pointed down, the pee gets everywhere! Maybe it is our particular toilet or something, but the splashing created from sitting so close to the edge of the toilet makes quite a mess. The urine gets on the toilet seat, between the bjorn and the seat, and on the bjorn itself- up under the edges.Honestly, I'm not really sure how the device could be improved to prevent this issue. I'd say- spend less money for a basic seat that you still have to clean up, but at least you'd have saved money! If you buy this seat (at least, for a boy), keep some wipes handy to keep your toilet seat clean for others to use!
