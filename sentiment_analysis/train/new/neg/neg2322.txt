we got that for our 15 months old daughter she love it except one of the button doesn't work. Tea pot button would not play any music and mirror would light up sometimes only.  We decided to return it.  She likes Mickey Fire Engine Team better because it is more colorful red, yellow and it has a voice recorder.  This princes ride on color and music doesn't grab enough toddler's attention.
