The wooden toys arrived with small, hair-like splinters around each one.  Even after washing it multiple times, the shavings did not go away.  Concerned that it might pose a risk for our baby who puts just about anything in his mouth, we returned the product.  The seller did not respond to inquiries and did not issue a refund several.  Would certainly not buy again.
