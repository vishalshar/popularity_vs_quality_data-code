I thought that this was a good, space-saving and inexpensive alternative to jumperoos.  The problem with it is that because the bouncing tray doesn't provide any sort of stationary support, my son acts as if he feels unsafe in it.  It will only bounce if he puts his legs straight down in the center of the triangle (which doesn't happen often, after 2 months of daily use).  If he puts his feet down near the edge, the tray just tips and his feet slide off, so he mostly just sits in it.  I understand that the tray is really not supposed to give stationary support, but it didn't occur to me that he'd feel like he was falling when he tried to stand up or bounce in it.  In a jumperoo, they have the floor to push off of, so there's the stationary support they need. With this, it's just tipping that might eventually lead to bouncing, if you're lucky.  I feel like I wasted $40 on this, when I could have bought a nice barely-used jumperoo of just about any type from a resale shop or Craigslist for the same price, or the Fisher-Price SpaceSaver Bounce 'n Spin Froggy if space were really an issue.
