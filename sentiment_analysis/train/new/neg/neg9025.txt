My husband and I ordered this glider because we are expecting our first baby in four months. We put it together with relative ease (except the pictures in the instruction manual make it appear as though you are supposed to place some parts upside down and we were shorted two screws so the ottoman cushion isn't fully secured to the ottoman base) and quickly tested it out. Unfortunately, it creaked VERY loudly from the get-go. We sprayed WD-40 all over it to try to get it to stop and it did not work in the slightest. I contacted MDB (the company that sells this glider) and received ZERO customer support. We want to send it back but it's rather difficult now that we have no packaging for it. I did not expect the same quality as a $400 glider, but for $130 I expected a product that worked. This one failed right out of the box. Incredibly disappointing.
