Pros:- Nice fluffy cotton- The curvature is good so it fits well around your shouldersCons:- Deducting two stars for how thin the middle of this is in terms of width, it's about 7" .  I'm a guy with shoulders.  It doesn't cover my shoulders when burping.-This could using several more inches of fabric in the middle so the coverage is better.  Shoulder width aside, it would be better to have additional width in as ours like to flop his head around side to side, he can have a spitup to the sides too, he's not going to just puke straight down my back!
