I have always trusted and loved my other Britax car seats, particularly the marathon and roundabout.  But I'm disappointed in the frontier.  I needed to replace my roundabout as my 4 yr old outgrew it (note: do not buy a roundabout - it won't get you through the car seat stage).  I loved the idea of the frontier which has a 5 point harness and is convertible into a backless booster seat (although I hear it is heavy).  But it has several terrible features:1) the buckles do not have a stop notch like the other Britax carseats.  So the buckles always fall to the bottom, even if I wrap it around the arm rest.  Nine times out of ten my daughter knocks it back into the seat as she's getting in.  So I have dig under her bottom to find it.2)  the belt slat on he buckle is too big - the buckle often gets twisted around the belt, taking a lot longer to get the right fit.3)  it's not comfortable - my daughter complains that it is not comfortable.  She'll go in it, but prefers her marathon.  Thank God this is in the secondary car.Bottom line - it takes way too long to get the right fit.  I'm anal about carseat safety, so this model is particularly annoying to me.
