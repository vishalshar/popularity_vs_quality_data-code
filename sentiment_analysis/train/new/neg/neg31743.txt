This does what it's supposed to. It stows away perfectly in the diaper bag for outings. I do hold it on the seat for my son, as it doesn't fit well on elongated bowls. It bends an awful lot when he sits on it, and he is tiny at 22 pounds. I don't expect it will last long, but it is essential for us as he won't sit on a big toilet when we are out. He loves that it has his favorite character on it. (Admittedly, the first one w ordered arrived completely broken in multiple places). I couldn't find anything like this is a store near me, though, and reordered another.
