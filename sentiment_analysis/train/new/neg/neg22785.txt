After looking all over for a winter baby carrier cover, this seemed like a great solution. You can keep your child close, utilize body heat, and both stay warm. What I didn't think about is that the baby's arms are completely restricted inside the Peekaru, and my daughter HATED IT. Maybe a younger baby would be ok, but at 9 months old, kids want some freedom of movement.
