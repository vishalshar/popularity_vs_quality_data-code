We received these bottles in a bunch of Medela bags that had been previously opened and then re-taped shut. The UPC sticker on the bags was scribbled on in black marker. This had me concerned, so I called Medela to find out what was going on. I was advised that black marker on the UPC represents items that were returned (for miscellaneous reasons) and should not be re-sold. They're supposed to go back to Medela.It's not worth the $16 I paid to return these, but I certainly won't use them, and I will never buy from this seller again.
