It was awesome - until we tried to fold it down to take it on a trip. We had been using it and loving it for months in our home. It's compact and attractive. Loved it.Then it broke the night before we were packing it to leave for a trip. Lots of other reviews day the same. But it if you plan to leave it open, forever.
