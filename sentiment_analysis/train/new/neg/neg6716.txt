This is adorable and makes the perfect light, but unfortunately I never have it on because it uses batteries too quickly. It came with 6 batteries (uses 3 at a time), and I burned through the batteries and spares in under 2 weeks. I got it hoping to leave it on at night in our bathroom, but that is just way too much "on-time." It's also not so simple to change the batteries, as you need a tiny screw driver to do so.It would be much better if you could just plug it in.
