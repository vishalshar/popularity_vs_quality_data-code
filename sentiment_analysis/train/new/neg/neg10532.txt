These diapers are terrible! I chose to go through Amazon because of the customer service through Alva is bad. These diapers do not hold pee at all! They leaked straight through the diaper within ten minutes of my son peeing in it, while it was double stuffed with not only charcoal bamboo(which is extremely absorbant), but with microfiber insert as well! The material feels like the same material my tshirts are! I have heard good things about Alva, so I'm wondering if it was just a bad batch, but I will not buy alvas ever again! My kushies, which are a tad big for my 3month old, hold more in them than these, and I have had no issues with any of my other diapers, only this brand. I tried stripping them twice just to be sure, but now after another pee incident they are being returned. This is a terrible diaper, and if I could give it no stars I would!
