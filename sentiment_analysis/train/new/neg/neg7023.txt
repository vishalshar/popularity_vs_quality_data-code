My wife and I purchased a mobile hoping it would help our son (4mo.) sleep better and give him something to interact with while we can't always hold him. I believe this mobile (and pretty much all of them) is overpriced. It's just a piece of plastic with four mini stuff animals...we kind of regretted not making our own DIY mobile. I do like the theme and details, but overall am disappointed with how short the period of music is when you crank it all the way. I'd like it to play longer so I'm not disturbing our son if he starts getting drowsy...I feel like it interrupts him to keep re-cranking the music.
