I have had more issues with this model of swing. The first one came and as we were putting it together noticed that the seat would not sit level, the frame was bent.  Amazon's great customer service allowed me to exchange it for another one since Graco does not have customer service available on weekends, and their email was not working. I've had it in use for almost 3 months now and the vibration function started to only work intermittently. I was outside of my 90 day return window for baby items, but once again, Amazon offered to allow a return since I was not getting a response from Graco about this. Graco did respond a couple days later and sent me a new seat. This one is doing the exact same thing, only immediately instead of at least functioning for a few months first. My 3 month old will only sleep during the day with the vibration to keep him from hearing other noises and looking around to see what he's missing. I've ordered a Fisher Price swing since they seem to have higher quality baby gear. Supposedly Graco will provide a refund, but I have to find a box to send this back in, and wait 10 days for the mailing label to get to me, and they only process refunds once a week....If it wasn't completely unfair to return this to Amazon I would do just that and once and for all be done with Graco and their terrible swing and service.
