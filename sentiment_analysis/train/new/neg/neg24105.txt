We bought these for my son's bed.  They've worked well for us.  They are a little on the small side, so if you're using them on a twin bed, you will need to double them up.  They have proven themselves waterproof.  I love that they are very quiet -- there's no crinkling with movement.  Be aware, they are "fabric" only in the loosest sense.  It's more of a thin cheap felt than a true woven fabric.  That hasn't been a deterrent for me.Pro's:Quiet - no "crinkle" with movementWaterproofCon'sSmall size - large enough for crib, but definitely not for twin bed.Cheap fabric
