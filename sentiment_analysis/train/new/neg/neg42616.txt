The concept of this mat is really cute - getting the baby to play the piano with his feet, but there are quite a few drawbacks to this mat.Cons:1. Your kid has to be tall enough to reach the piano keys with his feet. My son is a little more than 2 feet tall and even now I can't keep him on the mat in a position so that his feet are touching the piano and his eyes are maintaing a good distance from the overhanging toys (I want to maintain some distance between the toys and his eyes). So looks like I'll have to wait a bit for him to enjoy this mat fully.2. Converting this mat to use for tummy time is a bit cumbersome... you need to remove the entire arch and reposition it.3. I think I prefer a wider mat for tummy time anyways... if I first put him on his back on the mat and then roll him on to his tummy, he is already at one edge of the mat... that doesn't really leave much space for him to roll back on his back if he wishes too.4. Picking the mat and moving it with one hand isn't easy... you can easily lift it with one hand, but when you put it on the ground, you have to bend over to straighten out the mat (the mat is limp and folds over when you pick it) - this is tough to do if you are holding a baby in the other hand.Pros:1. The mat is machine washable2. The quality of the overhanging toys is great.3. Everything comes apart, so its very easy to take with you if you are traveling somewhere.4. My son definitely has fun with just the hanging toys - they are low enough for him to keep batting at with his hand.Overall, I'd use this as a travel mat, but its not something I would recommend buying for regular use at home.
