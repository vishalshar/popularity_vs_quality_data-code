This is definitely a great buy. I got it last week and made yogurt over the weekend. It was so nice and easy. The little jars are so so cute :).We are two of us. But I think this is good for a family of 3-4 also! Each cup holds a little over half a cup yogurt. I kept it ON for 8 hours and the yogurt came out exactly like store bought one, I used non-fat milk but added a little extra dry milk.Updated review after a few years:Product is very cute and nice and I used it only 2 times I think, this is one of those things that you will buy and fill up teh kitchen and will hardly ever use because buying yogurt is much easier. Don't waste your money!
