Overall this is an ok product.  Unfortunately there are some major issues with it.  Not too upset since I purchased this for under $30, but I would have been hugely disappointed if I paid over $40 for it.Pros:Good small design, looks great and is simple to use.Comes with informational pamphlet on sleep for newborns.Classical melodies sound okay.Auxiliary input is great in theory.Cons:Sound quality is horrible as they definitely skimped on the speakers.  The unit is very light so the speakers provide no depth of sound, I swear my iphone sounds better.I planned to use this largely with the auxiliary input to stream Pandora and Amazon Music but the line in cord is literally 4 inches long (see photo) making it very hard to use if you don't purchase an extender.The nightlight is very dim.The "white noise" sounds aren't typical they are more geared to mimic the sounds the baby hears in the womb.  But as the pamphlet suggests, regular white noise or music is good to use once they get a little older.  The problem is the "white noise" options only include one sound that is closer to the classic white noise we all know, the rest are gurgly and slushy and not pleasant for anyone other than a newborn to listen to by themselves.
