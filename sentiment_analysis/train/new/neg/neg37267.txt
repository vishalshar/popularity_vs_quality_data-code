I really REALLY wanted to like this shell and this brand.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the diaper inserts by Alva- amazing.  The shells, however, are less great.  My daughter peed once, and the whole back of her pants were soaked- I don't think the shell material is waterproof... Also around the leg holes, there is a single elastic whereas other diapers (Best bottom) have 2.Again, great diaper inserts, but i'm going back to my Best bottom shells...
