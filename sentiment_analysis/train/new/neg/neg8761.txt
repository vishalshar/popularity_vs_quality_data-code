It looks like a good mattress (our baby is still on her way, so we haven't used it yet). Feels firm and well constructed. However, it doesn't fit our Stork Craft Stage Crib, Lenox... about an inch too small, both length and width.Here's my advice. If you are not sure about the fit of a mattress after purchase, test it with your crib WITHOUT OPENING THE PLASTIC BAG. We opened the bag, so the Babies'R'Us store we purchased from does not take it back. Now, we have to look for a filler....
