Like I wrote on my other review of the medium ones:  oh, how I wanted to love these fabric bins!  The colors are whimsical & bright, and the larger size is great for us - big enough for books & balls & trucks & stuff.But there's nothing supporting the bottom of the box, except a flimsy piece of fabric.  Every, single time my little guy tries to pick up the bin, the bottom falls out & the sides collapse.  These desperately need to be improved, with a piece of cardboard or fiberboard shaped & stitched on the bottom between two pieces of cloth.They're okay if you're not going to move them around at all; but if you have a "helper" who likes to drag stuff around, these just don't cut it.
