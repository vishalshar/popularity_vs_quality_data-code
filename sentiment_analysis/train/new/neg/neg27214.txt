I purchased two of these - one for our house and one for my parents.  We have boys, so of course, thanks to Murphy's Law, one of the ones we got was pink (although the other was plain, so I guess Murphy didn't totally screw us over).  While this works great at my parents house on their "round" toilet, it simply was not stable on our elongated ones at home.  Frankly, I think that it slipping is part of the reason that my son was so freaked out about using the toilet for as long as he was (this was only remedied when we purchased the Kohler Transitions toilet seat).  My son is tall for his age (at 4, he's about the size of a 6 year old) and when we use it at my parent's house, the seat seems a bit on the small side for him, but it does work with no slipping.
