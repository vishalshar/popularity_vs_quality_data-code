This product will not stop a determined chewer, because any baby mobile enough to reach the side of the crib, is able to easily push the crib protector aside. My first child chewed a whole larger than a quarter in diameter, and about an eighth of an inch deep during one nap. She mentioned this even though I had crib protectors on all four sides of her crib. It was not a deterrent. The product encouraged her to chew near the corner, instead of the middle, but that is hardly on improvement. I have a picture of the damage from the distance. Amazon inadvertently deleted my old picture that focused on the damage. (Boo, Amazon). My second picture here shows my retro-fitted crib protector. I took crib protectors on all four sides (which by the way, cost over $80 for the four--not a bargain), and I then sewed burb clothes on each corner. To change and wash it, I had to cut the burb clothes off each corner and then re-sew them, but it finally worked.How did this product get some many positive reviewers? It is a mystery to me. Perhaps, it is being purchased by people who don't really need it. My second child never needed these, although I already had them, I didn't bother to put them on. She was uninterested in chewing. So, this is definitely not a must have product for every child, but it is also a flawed product for children who actually need it.
