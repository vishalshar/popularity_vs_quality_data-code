The light is pretty faint, it lacks lumens.  It can toggle between the various colors (green, blue, red, purple), or you can set it to be one color all the time.  Since purple, blue, and red are poor on the visible light spectrum, the amount of usable light from those 3 colors is almost useless.  You'd be able to tell if someone was in the room and moving, and it makes the room so it isn't pitch black, but other than that you can't detect or see anything else with those lights.  The green light was okay to be able to see some things, but it has only a small fraction of the amount of usable light compared to a common warm or cool white light (even a 4 watt bulb).  If you're looking to do anything of purpose with this night light (read), then look elsewhere.  The dinosaur we got is pretty difficult to place on the charger, and it is easily knocked off.  The dinosaur light is actually fairly heavy and durable, however the charger is extremely light and cheap.  After having seen and used this product, I wouldn't give this as gift to anyone (unless it's a gag gift), and I wouldn't purchase one for any of my other kids again.
