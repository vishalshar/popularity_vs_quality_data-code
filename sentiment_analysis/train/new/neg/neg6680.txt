I didn't think about it when I ordered this, but as an afterthought, wished I had ordered one with a fabric cover (for baby's comfort & because he kind of slipped & slid all over this one).  The tray just pops onto bumps to hold it in place (not very sturdy).  My son likes the little things to play with on top, and it keeps him interested and busy while I make dinner, but other than that, it is just "okay."
