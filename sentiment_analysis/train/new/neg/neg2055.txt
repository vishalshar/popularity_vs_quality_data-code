I purchased this for my grandson for Christmas. My daughter & I had seen it in Target & fell in love. It was $60 at Target, so I got it here on Amazon for $50 w/ no shipping.I don't normally spend that kind of money on something like this, but as I said we fell in love with it from the pic on the box.It's a bit bigger than I expected, which was good. (I didn't really check out the dimensions before purchasing.) However, the canopy top does not stay all the way up as it is pictured. The little arms are floppy & the top where the music & light box is & where the toys hang down from winds up 1/2 laying down. The only way he can see the light on the box or the toys is if his head is all the way at the top almost touching the top part of the mat.I'm not sure why they would not make the canopy arms out of plastic & make them adjustable to click into different positions. That would make the most sense. It's not like it's a cheap item. At $50 - $60 retail I don't see why they needed to cut any corners & not just do it right. When I spend that much money I expect a little more!Also, as another reviewer said, the material the mat is made of is slick. Makes it good for wiping down, but my grandson is starting to try crawling & every time he gets his knees up, they slide right back out from underneath him!
