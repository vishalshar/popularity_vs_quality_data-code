I was really excited to get this cup as my son has not quite grasped the concept of having to lift his sippy cup himself to actually get the liquid and this design looked very promising.  I put the juice in, tipped it upside down to check for leaks...so far so good.  I gave the cup to my son.  He was able to hold it and drink from it without any problems at all.  The problem came when he stopped drinking.  He held the cup upside down and drip, drip, drip came the grape juice...all over his sweatshirt.  I made sure the cap was on tight.  That was not the problem.  The valve in the cap didn't seal after sucking. There was nothing I could do to stop the flow of liquid out of the cap. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this product!
