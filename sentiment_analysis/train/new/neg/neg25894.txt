1. The quality is poor. Shame coming from Lamaze. Actually, is it a true Lamaze? There was a lame sticker with the brand's name, that's all. And it looked as it had been printed on a home printer...2. Toys are well balanced and they always stop at the same position, which is why I think the kids get bored so quickly.3. Does its job, if not used too often.3 stars, even though it was a disappointment.Cheers.
