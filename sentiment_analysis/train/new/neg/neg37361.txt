I DO LOVE how it folds up into itself with the attached pocket. But I DO NOT LOVE that the fabric was almost see through, the wire never really stood out on it's own, and that the wire started to poke through the fabric and scratched myself and my baby. Not happy after that and sent it back. Amazon was fantastic for the returns, but buying JJ Cole may be more of a question now.
