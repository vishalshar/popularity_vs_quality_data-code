These are stiff and not very soft. They curl up in the wash easily and are even more uncomfortable because of this. They show in your clothes and aren't as good as other brands when it comes to leakage.Spend the extra money for Baby Kicks or FuzziBunz.... they are more comfortable, absorbent, and don't show through clothes as badly. Of them all, Baby Kicks is the only one that has not leaked during the night.
