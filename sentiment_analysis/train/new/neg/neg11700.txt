The white crib is true white & it matches all white cabinets & sofa things in my house! I like it a lot!It's easy to assemble it even for a 36 week pregnant petite like me (4'10") to do alone! :)1) update:today my baby is almost 10 months old & I converted the crib to become a toddler bed. I raise the level of the mattress to the level of our bed's mattress & push her toddler bed side by side to my bed. That way, I can be right by her side without sharing my bed.2) I am looking for the kit to convert this crib to a full-size bed but don't see any. Even Da Vinci website doesn't mention "Summit crib" soI emailed them & am waiting for their response: http://www.davincibaby.com/contact & here is their answer:Ruth Sutton, Sep 04 10:34:Hi ...!Thank you for contacting us regarding the full size bed rails for your Summit crib. Our bed rails are not designed for this crib. You will need to purchase a generic (full size) metal bed rails. You will then attach only the headboard of the crib to the rails.With our bed rails you will need to attach both the headboard and footboards of the crib. Because you only use the headboard from the Summit crib, our rails wont work. But any generic full size metal bed rails should work with this crib.I hope this helps, please let us know if you have any other questions.Thanks again,---How frustrating! They should mention this in the crib description! If I had known it, I wouldn't buy it! I looked at other crib converting to full-sized bed & thought this one would be that easy! Any way, now instead of giving it 5 stars, I give it 3 star! So if you don't want to go through this frustration, don't buy this crib!
