I was very excited about this product and was happy about spending the money on it however this product didn't function. The singing function skips and the sensor doesn't pick up the food pieces. Also its really annoying randomly turns on. Its freaky! The off button is inside so you have to pull out the guts to turn off and on. Waste of money. Return shipping is $50 back to the company!!
