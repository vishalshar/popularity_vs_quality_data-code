I bought this for my new little granddaughter. As others have mentioned, it didn't go together as well as it should. One of the drawers is a little lopsided and the quality is not as good as it looks. However, it does the job and they will be able to use as a dresser after the baby no longer needs it as a changing table. The pad that was included was too thin so I ordered a thicker one that fit well with it. For the price it wasn't too bad.
