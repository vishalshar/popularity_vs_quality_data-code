Love the concept of this (thus 2 stars) but the quality is horrible. The clasps broke off within 2 months of using. I used it for my son's snacks and kept it in the diaper bag. I hand washed it and took good care of it but all the parts kept cracking and breaking to where it wouldn't close or stay together anymore. I ended up having to throw it in the trash, pretty upset after spending $20 on it!
