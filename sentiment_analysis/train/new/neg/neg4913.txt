Was so excited to get these based on the reviews.  They seemed to be perfect the first few times I used them, but now they leak terribly.  I check and re-check that they are correctly assembled, and they are.  Maybe they were ruined in the dishwasher, not sure.  It almost seems like it is the seal of the screw cap, that when dropped, it opens a bit and the entire contents spills.  I have to stop using them.
