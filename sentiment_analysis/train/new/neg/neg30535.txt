As a bassinet, this product has been great! My two and a half month old has slept in it almost every day since birth. As a playpen, it also has been amazing. However, the mobile is kind of flimsy, and uninteresting to my little one, so I removed it. Also, the changing table attachment doesn't lie flat when attached, so baby rolls towards the inner edge. Overall it has great basic functions, but the add-ons are lacking.
