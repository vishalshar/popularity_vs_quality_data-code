Its a very cute concept and perfect for gift-giving...especially since I needed a gift quickly and didn't have time to run out and find something. I was disappointed that the "weathered bucket" it comes in was bent, so for presentation purposes, I'm bumbed. I also researched the company "Baby Aspen" and they pride themselves on their high quality, soft bath robes. I figured this same soft/luxury-feeling material would carry over to this set (towel and washcloth), however, they feel like any other bath towel and washcloth for babies.  I also noticed that their are plastic pieces holding the bath towel town in certain places and one of those plastic pieces had already ripped through the fabric, creating a small hole.  Its pretty noticeable. I would return based on this alone, however, as I said, I don't have time to run out and find an alternative. I most likely won't be purchasing this product again for future gift-giving.
