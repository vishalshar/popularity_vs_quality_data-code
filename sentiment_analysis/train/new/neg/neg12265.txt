I purchased this for my 6 month old because I think Graco is a quality brand and I really liked the folding feature. My son is a big baby and the bottom part of the seat is not long enough. I planned for him to be in this until he was ready to sit at the table, but he'll outgrow it within 6 months. I also don't like the attached tray. I don't see the point of it. This is my 4th child, so my 4th highchair and I'm just not impressed with it.
