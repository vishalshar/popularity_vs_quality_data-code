I purchased this stroller for my 14mo old daughter. I purchased it based on reviews and price. One of the important features for me were the cup holder, tray and fabric cover over the strap buckles. My daughter gets rashes with polyester buckles whenever she wears shorts, dresses, or when her shirts rides up a little, she gets rashes on the sides of her stomach. When stroller arrived, I was able to assemble it in 20 minutes, very easy. The only thing that was missing was the fabric piece (as pictured) in between the strap buckle. I contacted the manufacturer, and they sent a short email saying, "Unfortunately the restraint straps do not have material can cover them", those are the EXACT words! So annoyed that they sell something and its not as pictured when it arrives. This stroller does have a smooth ride. The other thing that is really hard to attach is the front tray, which I still havent been able to put on. I will keep the stroller for basic strolls at the mall.
