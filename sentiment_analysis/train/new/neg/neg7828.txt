We have been looking for a setup to use as a baby monitor. After finding limitations with all of the products sold specifically as baby monitors (with camera and parent units) we decided to broaden the scope and evaluate products like this one (Loftek Specter IP Wireless Wired Camera, remote pan/tilt rotate) since we have enough technology skills to give it a go.This is a nice camera - it seems well constructed and sturdy. I love the range of rotation, pan and tilt; as well as the quality of video feed during the day and night. The camera has a built-in microphone and speaker that seem to work well enough. The camera is quiet enough when being rotated that my little one has not noticed it while awake and lying quietly in her crib.The camera takes some technology knowledge to set up so this product is not for everyone. If you are comfortable with setting up devices to work through your router then you should be fine.Provided device support is where this product disappoints for our purposes. All of the functions are available when using Internet Explorer (IE) browser with ActiveX or VLC plugin enabled. This is fine if I am sitting by my PC. However, I want to be able to use my other, more mobile, devices such as my Android smartphone and Kindle Fire. These devices are the ones that are on my bedside table during the night and my mobile phone is usually in my pocket or nearby no matter where in the house I am during my little one's daytime sleep. The camera functions are limited when using anything other than IE on a PC. I have found it difficult to control the camera's rotation/pan/tilt on my handheld devices - the clickable area is small and requires a series of taps to move the camera instead of "holding down" on the clickable area to move the camera faster in a particular direction - and features such as audio and talk are not available. There is no app by Loftek for this product. There are third-party apps on the market but the permissions they require give me pause. I would much prefer Loftek to provide apps for using their camera.There are some bizarre items in the owner's manual. In particular, upgrading firmware is strongly cautioned: "Please don't upgrade the firmware freely. Sometimes, your camera may be damaged if wrong operation during upgrade. If your camera works well with the current firmware, we recommend you'd better not upgrade it."*****************************This review was updated 7/7/2012.I'm changing my rating from two stars to three because the quality of the camera has been good enough for us to keep and use with third-party apps. My major criticisms are the lack of apps by Loftek, the clicking sound it makes when cycling nightvision on and off at dawn and dusk, and the fact that it resets itself every now and again.
