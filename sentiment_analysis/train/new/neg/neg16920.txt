I purchased this toy for my son and was very disappointed in the durability.  He grabbed onto the dancing monkey to many times and now it makes a horrible noise and doesn't always spin.  He still plays with it because he likes the music and the lights. I just keep it in a room that he only goes into sometimes because the noise is so annoying because it is broke.  Toys for children should be more durable.
