Easily the worst cover I've ever purchased. It is ridiculously huge on my daughter, and with only a single row of waist snaps does not stay closed around the legs, leading to leaks. It doesn't help that the elastic in the legs is extremely flimsy, and there is no additional leak protection. The prefolds are disappointing as well, as apparently they are not made to fold, but rather to trifold and lay in a cover. Not what I expected, as I fold my daughter's diapers. The prefolds are soft, at least, and make good nighttime diapers when angel-wing folded around a microfiber towel. Overall, I would not recommend this purchase to anyone, especially newcomers to cloth diapering!
