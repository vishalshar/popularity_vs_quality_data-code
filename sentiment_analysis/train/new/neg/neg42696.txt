The First Year's Newborn-To-Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat was so hard to recline. The tabs on the side are hard to push in and then to adjust the seat was almost impossible. Once you assemble the product you can't take it apart. Once we attached the back to the seat it will not come apart which makes returning the product a challenge, Thankfully Amazon was willing to allow it to come back in any packaging, and printing a return ticket was easy. I do not know if the item I recieved was damaged and thats why it wasn't functioning correctly. I did own the same seat when my son was younger and I loved it, that is why I purchased another one for my daycare, but it didn't function smoothly at all.
