My son has quite a few bath toys and this one has never really peaked his interest much. He tends to prefer simple, small toys like a classic rubber ducky, or toys that can scoop up water. The snail is rather large, too large for a 1 or 2 year old to move around and play with easily. Putting the rings on provides brief entertainment but it's not much of a challenge, my son prefers stacking nesting cups - placing 3 rings in order appears to get old pretty quickly. And the sunflower thing that comes with it is completely pointless. However, my son first got this at about 18 months, perhaps a younger baby would enjoy it more. Other than the silly flower thing, there's nothing wrong with this toy, it's not very interesting to my son and I have a feeling most toddlers would agree, but maybe not.
