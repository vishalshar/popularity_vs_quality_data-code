The seat is great and my son seems to be comfortable in it. My only complaint is that is a complete pain to install tight enough. The cup holder also does not fit and will not switch to the other side, which is inconvenient because we put the carseat behind the passenger seat. I guess when the seat is forward facing the cup holder will fit, though. The way the seat installs is just really ignorant, though, because you have to pull the seat protector up to pull it and then try to adjust it back on afterward. Do not buy if you will have to change the seat often.** Update **I came back to update my review. I would not recommend this seat to any friend. The straps are constantly getting twisted and it's a complete pain to get them to twist the other way. It's still such a pain to install. I never feel like it can get tight enough.
