I am just not sure about the quality of this booster seat. It just seems so flimsy to me and I have no way to know how it is going to hold up in the long run. There is not enough cushioning and since we travel a lot I can only hope that my son will be comfortable. I was also disappointed to find that this one did not have the reading lights. It would have been a plus to have them since we travel so much. On the plus side, it has two cup/snack holders which I am sure will be helpful. It is also easy to move from one vehicle to another since it is not secured to anything. I know it is a booster seat but I wish there was a way to secure it to give me peace of mind on our travels. I also though that I was getting the booster seat that was tested by consumer reports but not this one unfortunately.
