This is darker than it looks in the picture, but it is still really pretty.  I love the size of the changer.  I was afraid it was going to be short, but it's a perfect height.  I don't have to bend over to change my baby.  I love the changing tray too.  My only complaint is that my husband said it wasn't the best quality and that putting it together was kind of a pain.
