I bought these because my daughter will only take a NUK paci, so I figured she's like the nuk bottles. She's a little "meh" about them. I think she gets confused about how you can't turn the nipple around in your mouth like the medela ones she was using previously. I primarily breastfeed, so it's not a big deal when we use these from time to time, but if I were bottle feeding only, I think I would go with a different bottle.
