Okay, I will start with saying this is exactly what I was looking for as far as material is concerned. It is just like the old fashioned flannel sheet savers or whatever they are called just a bit thinner. I wish it was available in the cute ecru animal print like the bassinet pad instead of just white or frog.  I got the frog and it is pretty cute but not as cute as the ecru animal one.  Anyway, the reason I am only giving it 3 stars is that  it got all fuzzy on the top after one washing. I washed it with baby sheets and blankets on warm and put it in the dryer an it came out all fuzzed out on top (both of them, I bought a bassinet size and and crib size). It is still usable, soft and cute but it looks like something that has been passed down through a few kids, not something that is brand new. I would have given it more stars if it didn't fuzz out. I expected better quality but I still use it every day.  It has been through the wash a few times now and has not gotten worse than the first washing as far as the fuzzy top goes so that is good.
