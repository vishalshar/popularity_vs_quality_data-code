I'm very disappointed with the purchase of this mattress. I have the Dream On Me lightweight 2 in 1 folding portable stationary side crib and this mattress is too small, there is a gap of approximately 1" between the long side of the rail and the mattress, and a gap of 1/2" on the short side. The product description is not true to size.  Now I don't trust the measurement of other mattresses because of this.
