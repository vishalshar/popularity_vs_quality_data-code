This car seat is overarchitected and incredibly complex to use as compared to the cheaper Britax Roundabout.1) The side wings on baby's torso always get caught up in the belt, so I don't trust anyone else to buckle him in,2) The top wings and side wings make it impossible to put him in rear-facing in my sedan - I can barely squeeze him in between the door and the seat,3) All of the coverings on the shoulder harness (rubber coverings, cloth coverings) jam up against my little guy's face,4) Britax is currently replacing my shoulder clasps but they melted in the heat because they stopped clasping together and/or got stuck together (which my husband's Roundabout has never done),5) Even the little things like two latch attachments (instead of one like the Roundabout) and the adjustable head rest make it much more difficult to use,6) It is so heavy as to be completely awkward to switch between cars so instead we just bought another seat.It certainly may be great in an accident but it is too bulky and awkward to be usable. I wish I could get my money back and by the Roundabout instead.
