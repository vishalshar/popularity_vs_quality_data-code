No doubt this is a great seat, but it isn't made for infants, no matter what the description says. Even in its most inclined position, it isn't comfortable, legs are at a 90 degrees angle which is horrible for a newborn, and the baby's head is never well supported.Better buy a Maxi Cosi or an other infant seat !
