I gave this 2 stars because it does not stow anywhere on the pack, it sits too low over my sons head and limits his view. It also seems like the attachments weren't thought through very well. The shade attaches in the front ok, but once the rain cover goes over it, it pulls the shade lower and prevents him from being able to see very well. It didn't keep him dry, but I feel this could have been designed better for how much these things cost.
