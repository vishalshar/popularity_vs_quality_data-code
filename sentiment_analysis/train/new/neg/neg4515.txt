These were my favorite sippy cups for my daughter. They do a great job of not spilling and don't have too many parts...however, after time the valve on the inside starts to smell. I tried both handwashing and washing in the dishwasher. They still smelled funky. I maybe could have boiled them again. But in the end, I just threw them away and used the cups without the valves.
