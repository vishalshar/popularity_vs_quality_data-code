After becoming grandparent parents we discovered our 2 year old loves to give his "Hug Bear" baths just like he takes except....he dunks him in the toilet. After reading the rave reviews for the Mommy's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lok, 2 Count we ordered a pack to secure the lids nice and tight. Once they arrived I opened them immediately. First item I noticed is the device feels cheap and plastic. Like made in China plastic. I installed following the manufacturer's instructions. They were both easy to install and the instructions are more than adequate. Ten minutes after installation I found unit # 1 lying on the vanity. I asked the better half why she took it off and she commences to tell me that she tried to open it and it just came right off. After reinstall the unit did not fit any better at all. With the lid locked down there is still enough play to open the lid and easily insert a phone, toy, even a small Kindle. I did more research and found these:http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-XTRAGUARD-Count-Action-Latches/dp/B007A2ZSZ8/ref=pd_bxgy_ba_img_zThey work better, are more secure, and very easy to open for an adult.  But I digress. To summarize my reviewPros: Easy installationCons: Do not fit wellAllows lid to come open 2 to 3 inchesFalls off easilyI do not recommend these as they don't work as well as we would like
