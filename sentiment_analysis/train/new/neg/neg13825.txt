First off, I wanted to love this but I can't. It's so cute and fluffy and my 1 year old fits perfectly into it and loves rocking in it. When it was delivered, you could hear the music going off and we had to immediately unpackage it just to get the music to stop. There are four little shapes you can press that play music and they did play fun little songs both my 1 and 4 year olds liked. 9 days after receiving it the music sounds very strange and only plays the first few words of each song. This thing did not come with any instructions on how or where batteries are. I'm assuming I have to charge my drill up to unscrew the bolts at the bottom so I can fully unzip the zipper and find the batter pack. I've read anther review that even changing the batteries doesn't help. I'm hoping that it will but for now this is a 1 star in my book. The hassle of having to get this thing taken apart to find the battery pack after only having it 9 days is silly to me. For $100 it should be packaged better so that batteries can't wear out before use.
