The frame is excellent and was delivered quickly without an issue as previous reviewers had mentioned. It was packaged very securely with LOTS of bubble wrap. That being said, it's frustrating that it's not a "photo mat" but it's actually the pictures shown exactly as on the screen on one very thin piece of paper (think the fake family page when you buy a frame at the store). I am still going to gift it, as I glued my photos on top but definitely doesn't hide the imperfections of my cut the way a "photo mat" would. For the price, not sure I'd recommend it but I absolutely know my father (the grandfather) will love it. I don't not recommend it but I wouldn't tell friends to buy it either unless they asked.
