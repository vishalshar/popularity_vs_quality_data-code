The product description called it a cuddler, or that it had security blanket styling, but I did not find this to be true. I was hoping it would be snuggly so my daughter could hug it while in her bouncer but I found its too small, and its too flat to be a doll. It was about half the size of her other cuddler blanket. The size is similar to that of a washcloth.The body is soft, yet flat, but it unfortunately has two sharp tags on it. The only part that has stuffing is the head. I do think it is made from probably the nicest, softest courduroy Ive ever seen, and the burlap medallion on the chest gives an interesting texture to touch and chew on, but other than that I'm not sure it provides that comfort we hoped it would. The burlap medallion is also rigid, preventing it from easily crumpling and bending. I think it would be much more functional if it were bigger.
