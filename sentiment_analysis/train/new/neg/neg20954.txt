We received this walker as a gift and my son loves it! He is almost 7 months and kind of rough so he hasn't had any problem pushing the dinosaur to get it to play music and light up but, they definitely could have made the music much louder, you can barely hear it. The height could also be an issue with younger babies, they definitely need to change the age on the box or add a lower adjustment because it is just right for my son now and he is way above average in height and 3 months older than the 4 months stated on the box. Otherwise, this is a great walker. My son loves the toys it came with and I like that I can open the tray and give him his snacks and unlike other walkers and bouncers with fabric toys, this is so much easier to clean when he slobs on everything from teething.... you just wipe it right off. If you plan on purchasing this item, see if they have an in-store display first, just so you can make sure your baby is tall enough.
