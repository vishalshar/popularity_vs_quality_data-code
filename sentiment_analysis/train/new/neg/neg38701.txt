I really wanted our daughter to like this toy - it was very reasonably priced and adorable! We got it when she was about 4 months, and at first she liked to smack it to hear the rattle.  At around 5 months, she figured out how to pull it on her own to make it jitter.  But out of all the toys hanging on the play gym, she would rarely play with this one. I put it away for several months, and got it out again just after she turned 8 months old.  I hung it up and pulled the hippo down to show her the jitter.  I don't know what happened, but she instantly became afraid and cried!  My husband and I laughed about it, but we have put it away for good now.
