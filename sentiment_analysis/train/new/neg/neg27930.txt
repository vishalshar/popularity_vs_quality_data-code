This was not at all the quality that I expected. The separator is corrugated cardboard covered in very thin cheap cotton. One of the buttons immidately fell off when I tried to attach the separator, and there's no stability in the walls at all. I'm baffled why this has such a high rating...I think it's way over priced for the quality and I definitely wouldn't buy it again.
