We returned this item.  It is not as the picture shows.  No traction in the wheels.  The wheels are all wooden with a raised wooden ridge in the center.  They need a rubber tread to work.  The toy just "dragged" across the floor and carpet.  The pull string is very short even for a toddler.  This was very unfortunate since we are giving a first birthday party with "The Very Hungry Caterpillar"  theme.  It would have been wonderful if it worked.
