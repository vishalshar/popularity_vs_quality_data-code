I liked it but I found two issues with this clip.1) my little one (4 months) can easily manage to take the clip off by pulling which defeats the point of having the clip to avoid the pacifier being dropped on the floor2) I wish the clip was plastic because my daughter always likes to put the metal clip in her mouth and chew on it.I like the Nuk clip much better since it has silicone on one side and plastic on the other and comes off much harder.[...]
