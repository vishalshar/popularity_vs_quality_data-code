I love the crib itself- it is cute and the South Shore furniture is very nice looking and generally good quality for the price. The problem is that if you have an issue with your order, it is impossible to return. One side of the crib had significant chips, so I contacted South Shore to get a replacement part. They directed me to contact Amazon directly since South Shore can only send baggies with hardware (not actual parts). Amazon refused to help me unless I shipped back the entire crib in which case they'd send me a new one- but the packaging the crib arrives in is impossible to put back together once it's taken apart. It arrives on a wooden pallette that's stapled to cardboard so there is no way to put the box back together, and new packaging  would be at my expense. Not to mention the item weighs 80 lbs or so and shipping would be at my expense. We've opted to live with it because we have no other choice.
