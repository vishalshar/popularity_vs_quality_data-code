I know stuff happens but my package is delayed.i don't understand how or why.since Tuesday my tracking has said my package is in IL.today is Friday and it's still saying IL.last night there was a 11pm update saying it has been delayed but if they updated it last night saying delay why is it still saying the package is in IL? That means they been knew for four days that my package wouldn't arrive on time.
