This mobile is colorful and the music is great and peaceful, some people say it is too loud, honestly it didn't seem so loud to me. I would not recommend it for night time though. The blue light is strong and the sound of the ladybugs of the zigzag is distracting. It is great to keep the baby distracted for a 20 minutes while you get some things done. My baby has fell asleep with this mobile a few times but sometimes the zigzag noise wakes her up. The awful awful thing about this mobile is: BATTERY LIFE...I probably used it with lights 20 times and by that time, the light didn't turn on again, and it started playing the music a bit slower and the movement was slow as well, I thought it may be a defect and was thinking of returning it but, I changed the batteries and surprise it worked again.So please...Tiny Love company: IMPROVE BATTERY LIFE it is so very dissapointing. (The remote also consumes an incredible amount of energy of the batteries and fast!) I would not buy another Tiny Love product knowing this issue.
