This product has spring loaded wheels on the back. When a child sits in the product, the wheels are pressed down by the spring loaded action, forcing the rubber wheels to rub against the wheel enclosure making it very difficult for the child to push themselves around. This was disappointing to find out after spending the $75 + on this product. As a work around, you have to wedge something in between to prevent this from happening (I chose a broken chop stick) after which it still seems a bit cumbersome. Also, the height adjustment is a bit difficult to get to. I think they over designed this product. That being said, it is safe and stimulating.
