I didn't check good enough.  I used the size 1 nipple.  Got it in, sterilized them,  and when I went to use them,  realized they were not size 1, but size 2 instead.  Can't return since I opened and threw away packaging,  so I'm sick with 4 nipples that I don't need,  and have to try to buy the size 1 nipples again
