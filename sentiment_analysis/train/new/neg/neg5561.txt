In 2010, I bought two of these to use in our pet grooming salon.  Back then, they were all black and looked very classy.  They can be permanently mounted, and that was what we were looking for.  Pressure mount is not good enough for heavy full-time use with dogs.  With the permanent mount, he durability is great and if they hadn't changed the color, this would be a 5 star review.  When we expanded our salon, I needed a third, so I just ordered one without looking too closely at the color.  I wanted them all to match and since it was the same gate, I assumed they all would.  I was quite surprised when I opened the package and the formerly classy all-black gate had been changed to black with a gray door and cartoonish-looking blue plastic latching hardware.  Now, instead of having three matching gates, one looks stupid.  Now one of the all-black gates needs to be replaced after 4 years of heavy use (completely understandable), so I'm going to have another weird-colored gate.  All black is very classy and looks great.  Think about it; an all-black Corvette looks awesome, but picture that same black Corvette with gray doors and blue door handles.  How many of those would sell?  That's what they did to this gate.  Dumb idea.
