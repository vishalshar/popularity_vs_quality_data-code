This was a gift for my 1-year-old who loves ducks. I wanted a big rubber ducky made from safe materials particularly because she is still putting things in her mouth.The duck is cute and makes a hearty squeak when squeezed. It floats in the tub.Three stars because the coloring seems to be slowly flaking away - it arrived new this way, but has definitely lost a but of color already. It hasn't been played with all that much to warrant the color loss.It is a bit pricey, but I would definitely spring for it again as a gift.
