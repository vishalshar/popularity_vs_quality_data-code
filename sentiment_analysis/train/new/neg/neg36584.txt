I have used Nuby products before and really like this 3 stage system.The nipple is very soft and pliable.  Handles are great for little hands.  The spout is easy to figure out and easy to clean.  It's a great trainer for babies transitioning to sippy cups.  I love that it has a lid and that the handles are removable.  When I travel I take off the handles so the cup fits easily into my diaper bag pocket.  Great colors and design.The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the lid does not fit securely against the spout/nipple.  If the cup is inverted or left on it's side, it tends to leak out liquid since the lid doesn't block the spout/nipple.  Leakage is a big issue for me, so this was definitely a big down-side.
