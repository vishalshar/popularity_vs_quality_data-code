This product has so much potential.  I ordered two for my twins and was extremely excited to take them to grandparents for dinner as well as on vacation.  However the VERY FIRST TIME is strapped my baby in, the clip on the strap that is supposed to hold the seat to the chair popped open and my baby went flying head first into a table!  I tried to re-fasten the clip however it pops out with NO TROUBLE at all.  I received these items today and they will be going back tomorrow.  So very disappointed.
