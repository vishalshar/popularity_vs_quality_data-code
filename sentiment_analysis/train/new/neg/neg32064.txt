I first saw a similar product on my travels a few years back.  My BFF had a plastic one purchased from a British company.  I should've bought one then but was short on time to make it to the market.  Fast forward a 15 months and I have a rambunctious toddler who dislikes getting soap in her eyes.  One would think that maybe organic soap was a little bit less annoying then normal soap, but the screams all sound the same.So I ordered this lovely product in kermit green and waited for it to arrive from somewhere in Asia.  And I waited . . . and waited. . . and waited some more.  One day a plastic bubble mailer envelope arrived on my doorstep.  I opened it up to find a flattened, wrinkled foam, statue of liberty-type contraption- wrapped in loud plastic.  If only. . .if only it was a bit more statue of liberty like.  It was flat, floppy, and wrinkled!  I didn't think it could be the same product that looks so 3-dimensional in the picture.I tried it, a few times even, despite the first impression out of the package.  I had to slip it over her head onto her neck and then pull it back up.  There is, inevitably,  a portion that ought to be shampooed that finds it's way below the ring.  It could still work but it doesn't.  Imagine trying to maneuver this thing on a child's head up and down. . . up and down. . . trying to position it perfectly.  And heavens forbid that you try to do that while the kid is already in the bath.  The foam just doesn't hold it's shape well enough.  I'd look for a harder plastic type visor that holds it's shape and maybe one has an adjustable mechanism that allows you to easily put it on the child.I've seen the visor concept work and this isn't the product that you're looking for.
