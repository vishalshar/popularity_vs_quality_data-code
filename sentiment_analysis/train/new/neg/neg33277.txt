Our Baby is 6 mos. old and I have yet to use this. The concept is great, but design is lacking. The changing pad is sort of a tough plastic that doesn't seem like it would be comfortable for a kid to lie on. Limited storage is the other drawback. There was barely enough space to stuff a pair of size 2 diapers and no room for ointment or powder, just the wipe container (included). This would work better if you were absolutely positive your kid wouldn't crap up more than two diapers.
