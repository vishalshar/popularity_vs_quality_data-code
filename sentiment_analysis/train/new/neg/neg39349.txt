2 stars for their cute Candy & Robots pattern, but everything else. Not soo much. Should I be comparing them to other brands? Not sure ... On their own; mine pilled after their first wash and only got worse until they just stayed a certain way. They aren't soft whatsoever, reminds me of rough raw cotton muslin/canvas. Not the soft kind. So, these are Just used as Sun Guards on car seats and strollers.If one wants the softest and doesn't care much on $ or that they're really not "natural", try A+A Bamboo. They're unbelievably soft, but did wear after 2ish years of constant use. The graphics get rough and hard, so if anyone doesn't mind getting them without pictures, that'll be your best bet. A+A's regular lines are much better than LLC in my opinion. They withstand so much more, I still have a few from 3 years ago that are like the first month of use. Which tells me a lot about their cotton quality.Now, Swaddles Designs makes the perfect balance in my mind as far as price/quality etc are concerned. Their "Marquisette" line is soft and nothing different than you are paying anywhere else, they do have great sales plenty of times through the year. Their softness and prints won't deteriorate like the others. Just consistent with their regular use! I loooove them because I know what I'm getting every time. Great for gifts. They're prints seem to update quicker too, so it's great one Mommy doesn't have the same as so and so.
