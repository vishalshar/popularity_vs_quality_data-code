I only purchased this because it is the only pad that fits the AGF Daphne Crib.  However, it is horrible!  It arrived it such a bad condition.  It was wrapped around with scotch tape and I was not able to flatten it out.  There were indents on it everywhere.  It is extremely thin and cheap.  I returned it right away.  Someone recommended purchasing the LA Baby 30" changing pad which should fit on the Daphne Crib so I ordered that instead and hoping it will work.
