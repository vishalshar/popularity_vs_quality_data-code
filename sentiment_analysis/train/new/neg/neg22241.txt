My son liked the music of this toy, and would bat at the toys on the bar, but I couldn't get him into and out of his car seat with it attached without bopping him on the head.  If the handle of the seat was all the way back, the toy was resting on his head when he was only three months old.  He would cry every time I put him in the car, and I finally realized that he hated the feeling of the toy on his head as I put him into the seat.
