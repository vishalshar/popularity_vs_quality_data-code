These would probably be perfect for a child who doesn't put things in their mouth. Mine unfortunately does, he's almost two and I still haven't given these back to him to play with. The coating of each is a paper/cardboard like coating so it denigrates when it gets wet--which isn't ideal when you want to use them in the kitchen on the fridge! The upside is that the entire back of the letter is a magnet so they are much sturdier than the plastic letters you usually see.
