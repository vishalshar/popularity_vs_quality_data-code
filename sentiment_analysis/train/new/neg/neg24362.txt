Ok...this product is great because we keep it beside our bed.  It is easy enough to carry or roll to another room.  Word of caution....if you buy this, good luck finding sheets to fit.  This style requires a very specific size sheet.  Babies r us only has 4 of the same boring color.  Often different colors are sold out online.  As much as babies spit up you need to buy multiple of these size sheets if you can find them.  The mattress is not really comfortable either.  I wouldn't want to sleep on it.
