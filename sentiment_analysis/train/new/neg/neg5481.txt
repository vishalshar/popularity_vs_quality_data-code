I looked for a long time before chosing the right diaper bag, and finally decided on this one. A few issues make this a VERY over priced bag and had i known about the 30 days return policy earlier, i would have sent it back. Issues:1. Its too small. I have a 3 month old , and without even needing to carry around solid food and snacks yet, its already packed with just the usuals: diapers, xtra set of clothes, bottle, changing pad, wipes, paci, other nicknacks.2. It ALWAYS slides down the shoulder..annoying.3. The strap is connected too low on the side, so what that means is that when you carry it either over your shoulder or over the handles of the baby carriage, it wobbles around.4. its so soft that it doesn't stand on its own, it always falls to one side.I would NOT recommend this bag at this price, it should be priced inthe $60 range, thats it. I regret that i didn't return it right away, waste of $140.
