My son loves everything cars so I bought this add a potty training tool thinking it would help...it can be totallydisassembled and my toddler loves to take it apart several times a day so there's the first downside to this one.it leaks everywhere and splash guard is useless.as a stool it does the job but it's still a bit short for our sink.should have read the reviews hopefully I can save someone some money, don't buy this.
