I got the Grovia Hybrid system for my daughter. Though they say the Hybrids  can be used from birth I was very skeptical they would fit a little newborn - so I got 6 or so of these Newborn AIOs so I could do cloth from birth. My daughter was 7 lbs so the Hybrids were definitely huge and these AIOs fit perfect. However they leaked - often. I had to chance her clothes every time I changed her diaper. By one month old she was big enough to move into the Grovia Hybrids. If I could do it over I'd skip these and have done disposables for a month.
