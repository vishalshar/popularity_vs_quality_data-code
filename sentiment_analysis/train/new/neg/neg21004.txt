I baby-proofed every sharp edge in my living room with this tape, and it does the job. It's a bit difficult to apply, and the adhesive is not super-strong, which is good if you don't want to permanently baby-proof your furniture, but bad if your baby decides it's a fun toy, because they can pull it right off. Also hard to put around corners, but I got around it by cutting a slit where it went around the edge.
