I needed a lightweight stroller that was easy to load and unload and it appeard from all aspects to be just that.  And it was cute too!  A week after I got this stroller, we were at the beach on the vacation that I purchased this stroller for, when the front wheel fell off.  I checked to make sure I had put it on correctly and I had.  This happens all the time and so I never use the stroller.  I was very disappointed, I should have followed up and had them replace it but I hate sending things back and had already thrown away all my information and packaging.  Bummed.
