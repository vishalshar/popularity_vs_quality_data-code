Unfortunately this product did not live up to its reviews. I wanted a set of cups that the lid would stay on and would not leak as The First Years sippy cup lid tend to move if dropped and then leak. These said twist lock and "leak proof technology" which sadly neither were true. I received the cups, checked for wash instructions and placed them in the top rack of our dishwasher. Upon first use and usage of all the cups in the pack, the seams don't line up so I could not get a 'click lock' on any cup. Then unfortunately, twisting tightly but without really aligned well, the liquid would leak out of the threads if tilted in a high chair cupholder or if on it's side in the play room, it would leak out. I just submitted a return to Amazon and will be sticking to the First Years sippy cup as they do not leak when on their side.
