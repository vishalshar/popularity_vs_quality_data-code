I left this toy in my daughter's play pen when she was about 6 months old. It came with the demo batteries in it, so we didn't bother changing them before we let her play with it.When she woke up from a nap, I walked in to see the back off of it and batteries in her bed!!I felt terrible thinking that I didn't tighten the screw on it!I collected it up and screwed it in well. I didn't give it to her for a long time. We were cleaning up a few days ago and I came across it again. I felt of it and the screw was in tight, so I gave it to her. I found it the next morning opened and batteries scattered again.I'm not a happy mom over this toy!It would be 5 stars if the screw stayed in the battery cover! It's a really cute toy!
