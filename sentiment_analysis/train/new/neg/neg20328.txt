It is great when it works. However, the body broke when I put in the battery. It is very easy to over tighten, which cause the body to split along the seam. It works if you hold the body tightly together. I'm giving it such a low rating because it is too fragile. The thread doesn't have a firm or any stopping point. It just breaks. I didn't ask for a replacement because I bought it long before using it.
