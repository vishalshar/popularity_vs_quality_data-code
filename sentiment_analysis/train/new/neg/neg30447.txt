I bought this on a whim because I wanted a highchair that I could strap to a regular dining chair. I have the space but I hate the idea of having this high chair taking up space when I have four dining chairs that my child can sit in. This summer infant was on sale (I believe $20-$30 at the time) and for the amount of things you get its great. Then you have a kid that hates it and it becomes this huge waste of space. Lucky for me, my son liked it for a good amount of time and it wasn't that bad. The assembly is pretty easy, but you do need a screw driver to get some of the parts together. The disc part comes off and it's pretty hard sliding the thing on and off. I ended up taking the toys off of the disc thing and letting my son play with it by itself. My son had this habit of chewing on some of the toys and it became really hard to clean the pooled up drool in the bottom of the toy. As for the "high chair" capabilities. This thing is crap. It could barely fit on a chair. The base is so big and believe me, it's not my chairs. My chairs are wide enough. The straps are pretty crappy too. If you look at it, it's like it'll come off in one pull. I would never put this on an actual chair and I would suggest just leaving it on the floor.
