I was really excited to buy this item thinking this would also allow the legs to open up to be used on an adult toilet seats as well, but only after I ordered and received the product had I realized this particular potette does not serve multiple functions, but only to be used on the ground as a portable potty. And I came back to this webpage and realized it didnt' have a description that the legs open up to be used on a toilet seats also, which is a feature that's only on potette 'plus'... which I also realized after reading some of the negative reviews on this page which I missed when I was purchasing it. Wish the product page had some sort of warning or clearly written statement to notify customers how this is different from potette plus..  Since this one skids and only serves 1 function, I'm amazed to see so many positive reviews but perhaps they were from the customers who bought this item before the potette plus came out. As the other customer with negative review mentioned, I don't know why the company even makes this version anymore.. which just creates an extra hassle for them as well as customers returning the item unhappy due to wasted time and having to order the 'plus' one again..  'plus' one seems to be a good product, but it is a lot smaller and seats low on the ground than I had imagined.
