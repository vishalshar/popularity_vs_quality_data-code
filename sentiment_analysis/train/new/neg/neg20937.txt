I revived the wrong item. I spent $40 on this product because I desperately need my baby to take a bottle, so I may return to my college classes. The frustration I have been feeling over this was increased when I revived the wrong item. Instead of the medium  flow latter orthodontic nipple I received a slow flow latex natralatch nipple, which I have already tried. I am also able to buy this item for under $10 at my local Walmart or grocery store. I e-mailed the company and they have yet to get back to me. It hAs been over 24 hours and is a work week. I will update my review if the situation changes.
