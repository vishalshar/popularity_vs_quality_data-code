This was a beautiful play yard. The only thing is that we were expecting to get the color shown on the advertisement (Blue with black & gray). Instead we received a greenish-blue color, almost like a teal but not as bright. I posted my own pictures so people can see what they will really get. In certain lightings the play yard is blue and black, but in reality it's tealish with chocolate brown. It is easy to set up and easy to wheel around the house as well. The canopy part is a little hard to fold up and down. All of the music is cute, but the volume control disappointed me. The lowest setting in the volume control is actually still pretty loud, so I don't even use the higher volume...you would need to have some serious hearing issues if you need to turn the volume on this play yard up past the lowest setting. The vibration feature needs some work, you can't feel the vibration as well unless the vibrating base is positioned close to the baby. The music, vibration, and control buttons runs off a base that hooks onto the play yard. The changing table works well, flips away for storage, but isn't leveled. When I change my son he starts to slide to one side, so that part needs to change. It has an MP3 input, which is cool but I haven't tried it out yet. It has a pretty big side pocket for extra storage, a place store diapers, wipes, and two more pockets for whatever else. We decided to keep the play yard because it still looks nice and sophisticated, our needs are met when it came to keeping our baby safe when we need a break from holding him or to get something done, besides that we live overseas so it would cost way too much to ship it back. When I called Amazon about the issues, they handled my complaint very well and refunded us a discount for the confusion about the product.
