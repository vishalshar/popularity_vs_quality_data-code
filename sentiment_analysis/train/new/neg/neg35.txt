I usually do not review and I give this negative a  review even more rarely.  Two reason I did not like the product -  1) They are not peel and stick kind, you have to rub, rub, rub...I rubbed for about 25 minutes. And still there is no 100% Guarantee of success. (Wait for my photos of the actual stickers on wall) - Although I did realize that it was a personal preference sort of thing and there might be people who actually do not mind the transfer stickers. 2) Biggest disappointment was the amount of Stickers - when they say 29 Stickers , please know that it means 2 Big, 4 Medium and rest of them tiny flower stickers. For my money I got  very little to show for it. Also, the picture they are using - which is what attracted me to this product - would take 12 Packets OF Stickers. I know now, because I counted the big flowers in the picture and since each packet has only 2 big flower - you do the math... So basically to get the design pictured you will need to spend 7X12 = 84 Dollars...I am filing this one in to lesson learned and buyers beware category :-)
