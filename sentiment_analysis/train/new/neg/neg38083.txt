While the item works as described, it smells.  I've had this for a month already and it still smells and will transfer the smell to your hands when you use it.  I might put this into the washer to see if it removes the smell, but I am afraid it might ruin the product.  The wife refuses to push the stroller now because she doesn't want her hands to smell.If I were to do it over again, I would purchase the original rubber replacement or find one made of real rubber instead of this smelly neoprene.
