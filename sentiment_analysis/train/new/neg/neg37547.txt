My husband and I bought the First Years EAsy Comfort Manual Breast Pump while I was pregnant with out first child. We couldn't afford an  electric breast pump and we were not sure if I would be an over producer or not.After I had our son, we realized I was an over producer, which meant lots of clogged ducts and having mastisis repeatedly. When suffering from that, its best to pump and feed on the side you are having issues with.At first I was using the pump to help with my fast let down, I would pump wait for my let down to slow then breast feed my son. However with the repeated clogged ducts and mastisis from over production meant that I started using the pump more and more. The issues were not from the pump but from my sons bad latch, I was a young new mom in the middle of no where which meant I couldn't see a lactation consultant and really didn't know what was happening.I began pumping before feeds, pumping when swollen from clogged ducts or mastisis until the swelling went down, and pumping before bed so I wouldn't wake up engorged. With all the excessive pumping this hand pump didn't last a chance.The handle of the pump stopped working, it would go down but wouldn't go back up, which meant pumping times took longer and suction wasn't as great because of it.I believe this pump would be great for someone with a low supply or only needs to pump occasionally, however if you are looking for something to use a lot this is not the pump I would suggest. Electric is way better for over producer or women pumping and bottle feeding. The suction was great when it worked and my nipples did not get sore from using it.
