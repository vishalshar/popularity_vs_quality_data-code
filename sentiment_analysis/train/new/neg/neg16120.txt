I really wanted to love this carseat and we ended up going with it because it was supposedly light. We had a chicco keyfit for our first child and loved it. We now live 2 flights up and thought this would be lighter. Somehow the design of it I actually find more difficult to carry than the Chicco and it is MUCH MORE difficult to use. So hard to clip in and take out, hard to move the handle back and very awkward to take the baby out.Not to mention my kid sweats profusely in this thing, even after just a few minutes his whole back is wet and we keep the car cool with AC. It is so uncomfortable for him he hates being in the car. Very disappointed as this was well reviewed.
