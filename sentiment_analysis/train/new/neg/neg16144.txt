We purchased this on July 14th and received it about a week later.  After less than a month of usage, the snuza already needs a new battery again.  The original battery that came with the snuza lasted about 3.5 months and we have not changed usage (9-10 hours overnight).  I'm very disappointed and will not be buying another battery through this seller on Amazon since the battery and shipping cost is so high.  You don't even get a discount on shipping if you buy more than one.  If you need a replacement battery, look up the snuza facebook page and find a list of other retailers that sell it.  The retailer I ordered from sells for half the price and have much cheaper shipping.  I wish I would have found them before buying here.
