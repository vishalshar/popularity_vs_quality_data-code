I got this product because of the mirror, but my baby isn't that fascinated by it. He loves the mirror in our bathroom and can't stop staring at himself, but this one is almost like a fun house mirror so I think that's why he doesn't seem to like it. However, he enjoys the music (though the battery died pretty fast) and I really like the bag aspect. It's great for storing his smaller toys. And, the colorful giraffe that came with it was a bonus. It's easy for his small hands to grasp and we take it everywhere with us. If you're getting this product because of the mirror (like I did), you might want to look at another product. However, if you want a cute bag for storage and a little toy, this is decent.
