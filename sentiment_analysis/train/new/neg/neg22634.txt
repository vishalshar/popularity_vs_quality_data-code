I purchased this blanket due to the high reviews. My son who is 5 months old seemed to like chewing on the orange studded "foot" of the alligator. Upon inspection of just a few uses, the plastic studded textured parts seemed to have eroded off! I was very concerned since I did not realize that this could happen, and have let my son use it as his teething toy for over three months consistently!Although I really like how cute the blanket is because of the colorful parts, I do not recommended this product for your baby. I am still concerned as I know the plastic eroded parts have ended up in his stomach!
