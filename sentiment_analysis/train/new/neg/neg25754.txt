CONS: I wish it were curved to fit around the body. Snacks still end up in the car seat on the sides.  I also don't like that there are two velcro pieces on the bottom that are meant to hold back the pockets when using as a carrier.  The velcro is 'scratchy' when kids are wearing summertime shorts. It comes with two extra velco pieces to 'cover' these areas, however, the edges start to roll and that becomes bothersome too. Further, the buckle on ours doesn't stay snapped very well. PROS: I like that it has a 'rim' around the edges to keep things from sliding off, I love that it has a cup holder, and wonderful that it is soft - as anything plastic would be very dangerous if ever in an accident. So, pros and cons for me.  Still searching for the perfect tray...
