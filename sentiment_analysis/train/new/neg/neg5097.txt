Several things were wrong with this item for me:1. It came in packaging from Ross's which stated price about 10% smaller than I paid for the item on Amazon. Now I know for sure how Amazon makes money, and have to shop around the internet every time I order an item from Amazon to make sure I am not overpaying.2. There is a nice multi-collor picture on each square. This picture consists of several pieces of foam, and my children like to take these pictures apart, and the pieces get lost. I have another foam mat that only has one large piece imbedded into square (just a letter). It is much more manageable since it is harder to misplace a large letter than small pieces of multi-piece picture.3. It appears that the quality control for this mat is low. Our mat has pieces (squares) of different sickness, which makes the end-product very uneven and presents problems for  small child who is studying to walk.
