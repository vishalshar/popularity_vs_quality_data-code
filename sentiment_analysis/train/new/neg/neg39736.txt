Item came in a thin plastic bag in a box.The item itself is good quality. The fabric is soft and the stitching it tight. The size is perfect, not too small/big. Holds the bottle tight ( can use short or long bottle). The item is machine washable and looks durable. However. I give it 3 stars because my baby did not like this product. I think the he did it like that the holder was around his neck and rested on his chest. I have tried a variety of theses products. The bendy arm did not work either. So far my baby likes the "enjoybaby hands free bottle holder" the most. This product is good quality but you need to test and see if your baby likes it. All babies are different and I'm my experience everything is trial and error with baby items.
