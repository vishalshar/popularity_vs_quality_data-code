This is a great concept and love they everything is out of the way. The only down fall to this product is the wipes compartment. I tried every type of wipe packaging and it about impossible to get the wipes out. it defies gravity and the weight of the wipes will not allow you to pull them from the bottom. This would be wonderful if only it worked to its full capability.
