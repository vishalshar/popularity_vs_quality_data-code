I was so excited to receive the product but once I started assembling it, I couldn't get two parts together.  I tried everything, even had my husband try.  I finally had to use pliers to squeeze together the plastic to get it to go through.  Now that that part was complete, I could put it on the spigot.  Another issue.  Couldn't fit the blue ring around it tight enough.  It was leaking! Once I kind of figured it out, the water pressure seemed to be too much for this cheesy plastic mock shower that I had to turn the water on super low for it to actually work.  I began to fill the tub using only the shower head and after 10 minutes, the bottom wasn't even full! I had to take it off and haven't used it since!  I would not recommend this product to anyone!
