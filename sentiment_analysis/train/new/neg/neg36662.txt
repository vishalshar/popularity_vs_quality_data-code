I purchased this because I like the quality and the material.  Unfortunately, following the instructions I boiled it for the requisite time.  I then pulled it out with metal thongs.  I believe the thongs made an indent in one of the pacifiers which bothers me that sterilizing it causes the material to soften so much so that it gets damaged that easily.  Also, this is too big and does cover my baby's nose but it doesn't look like its obstructing his breathing.  That being said, my baby seems to love it.  He can easily grasp the pacifier handle and pull it in and out of his mouth.  Its also easy for me to hold onto when I am cradling my baby and can have the pacifier hanging from my finger.  I will probably use it way more when he is older and it isn't covering his nose.
