I bought this to measure fertilizer dosings for my aquariums. If I pull the up too quickly (to fill it) it pops right out and whatever was inside falls right out. If I push the plunger down (to dose the tank) too quickly it spurts out whatever was inside in this crazy sudden pressurized blast. I eventually got used to these quirks and learned to be very slow when dealing with it.The other problem it has is that the last milliliter or so will not go out even when the plunger is down all the way. I have to stick it in the fish tank and suck up some more water and plunge it back down again to get the last bits of ferts out. This is probably not gonna work for someone using it for actual medicine.
