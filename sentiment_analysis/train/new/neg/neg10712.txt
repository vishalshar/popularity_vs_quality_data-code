I wanted our 6 year old daughter to have a camp chair like her dad and I do, and I thought this was was perfect!  Until I received it, and I realized how small it is.  It's really made for a 2-3 year old.  I can't imagine a 5 or 6 year old being comfortable in this chair because it's so low to the ground.  Our daughter isn't very tall, but it was way to short and small for her.  It looks to be a well-made chair and the color is lovely, but if you're looking for a chair for a bit older child, keep looking.  I had to return it.
