What a disappointment! I'm not sure what brand of water sling the mom in the photo is wearing, but it definitely isn't the one I received! The rings are not aluminum as shown, but a cheap, clear plastic that I'm sure has never been safety tested. Of course, you can't get an answer about safety from this China-based company who definitely isn't following even the basic safety laws of the US. (Ask them about the CPSIA and if they have done any testing) The rings are sewn to the sling by a weird x-box job that I've only ever seen on mei tai & soft structured baby carriers. Definitely not a comfy or safe sling shoulder option. The "instructions" are 1 page of small photos of a woman who has the baby already in the carrier, with no details about how to get to that point. If it weren't for YouTube and other baby sling makers who actually give good info, a new babywearer would not be able to use this properly. You get what you pay for, but I would not trust this made in China cheapie to keep my precious baby safe. Beware other sellers on Amazon selling this exact sling with different photos. They all appear to buy from the same factory in China. At this price, you can rest assured you will support slave wages.
