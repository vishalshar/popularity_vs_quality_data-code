My 7 m/o absolutely hated it. The first time I put it on, I was so excited to keep his little noggin safe from bumps. It was big on him but he kept it on for a few minutes, and then started screaming as he was trying to crawl around with it on. He ended up pulling it off himself and would not let me put it back on. He cried just looking at it. I ended up returning it just a few hours after it arrived in the mail. I was very disappointed that my son wouldn't wear it because it appears to be well padded and good enough construction to protect the baby's head from little tumbles. I think the chin strap could be made from a softer material also because the velcro appeared to scratch my son's chin. Maybe one of the little white snaps would be better. The strap is stretchy enough that if caught on something (which would be rare if you're actually watching your child, but I've read some concerns), the baby can pull it off or can slide out of it with little difficulty.
