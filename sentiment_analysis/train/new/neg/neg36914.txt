First the suction cups wouldn't work at all on the textured tiles we have. Wish I would have read the other reviews more closely.  Second, when I put it in part of our bathroom where the tiles are smooth it still didn't stick to the corner. Too bad, because the basket is really cute and would have worked well for the toys we have!
