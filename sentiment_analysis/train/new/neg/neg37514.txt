I've had this carrier for about 2 months now. Some background information. My baby is about 17 lbs and 27 inches long. I'm a medium build person. I mention this only because a larger person wouldn't be able to get this on easily and have room for the baby too. The pros: It folds up nicely and I can store it easily. It's also super easy to put on and put baby in. It's great when I don't want to lug the car seat into the store, I just slip baby in and we are good to go. The cons: Depending on how big you are the baby leans out of the carrier (so I have my hand on the babies back just to make sure baby doesn't fall out. It's a huge pain trying to put baby in the back position (it is possible though, but depending on how steady and big the baby is they will lean backwards. Also if you carry the baby in this for a long period of time it will start to hurt your back because there is no back support about the waist. I wouldn't recommend this product because its so expensive for what it is. I think there are better carriers out there that would address alot of the cons.
