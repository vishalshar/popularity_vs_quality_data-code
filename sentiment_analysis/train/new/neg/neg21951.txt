We bought the newborn flow (level 1) for our newborn, but immediately noticed that the flow is a lot faster than expected--he would choke whenever he ate because he just couldn't keep up with it. I still had some bottles of a different brand from my older child and when I compared them, this was more like a medium-flow. After a month of struggling with the speed, we switched him over to the other brand and he's doing great.Overall I was happy with the quality of these nipples, and very well may switch back to them when he's a bit older, but they didn't work for us in the birth-to-1-month window.
