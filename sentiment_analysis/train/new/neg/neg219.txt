This carrier didn't work out well for us at all. When my son was a tiny infant he seemed to slip way down in it and cried continuously until I took him out of it. When he got a little bit bigger, we were able to face him out in it, but we found that the material flap didn't stay down, and also he still seemed very uncomfortable in it. We also found that it really hurt our backs and made us uncomfortable too! All in all we only used it about 3 times, because it was so uncomfortable for us AND the baby! I suggest that instead of wasting your money on a baby carrier, that you invest in a good sling instead. My son loved his sling and seemed to be content in a variety of different positons. Find a sling that has a solid set of rings and thick enough material, and you'll be set from the time your baby is born up until they are 30 lbs.. Here is a link to the lady that I bought my sling from. She lists hold postions right on her web site, and is willing to work with you on size and color. I bought one on Ebay and the quality was far less superior to hers. It's well worth the money spent, and is no more than this carrier! [...] tml P.S. After baby is too large to fit in sling, you can use it to keep them secure in shopping cart, use as a tether so they don't run off on you (and no one can take them from you), and a variety of other uses too!
