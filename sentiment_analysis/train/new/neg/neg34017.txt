I bought this tiara to replace a tiara my son broke of a friend's daughter that she had for a long time. I even bought extra for my son. It looked like the one I was replacing but it was not the same quality.The stones started falling off as soon as the product was out of the box. The stones kept on falling off. I have no idea what they used to glue them on but I don't think it was glue.Within a couple of days both the tiaras were snapped in more than 2 pieces just from putting them on heads. You might say that they were too rough but I managed to snap one of them from placing them on one of their heads and I was being gentle. My friend just waved her hand around and said don't worry about it and threw them in the trash.So even though it looks super cute, save yourself some grief and small children tears. It is not worth the pain or landfill.
