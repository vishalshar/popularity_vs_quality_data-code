The item was a disappointment. It says "X large" but make SURE to read the dimensions(I hoped they were wrong) and don't go by the picture!!! They make that look really tall, going up the whole wall. Not even close. BTW, the colors are either not accurate in the picture or I'm colorblind on computers(pretty sure that's not the case!) The birds ended up being pink, and the branches purple. :/ In the picture, the branches seemed to match the trees(by my observations they look brown and tan) but like I said, purple. And the birds looked orange to me(but like I said, in reality, pink.) So be very careful in your decisions to buy the product. As for as installation, I have no clue how that was because I'm currently returning. Good luck!
