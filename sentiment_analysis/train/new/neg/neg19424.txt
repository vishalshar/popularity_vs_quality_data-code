THIS SET DOES NOT COME WITH THE ROUND HAT BOX.  It comes with a square gift box that is not as cute.  This listing is more expensive than other Amazon listings.  If you want the square hat box, look for other Amazon sellers who have it listed cheaper.  Amazon customer service would not credit me the $13 difference even though the item I received is not as described or as pictured (the only reason I paid more is because I thought I was getting the hat box).  I was told that there was nothing they would do (other than refund the item) and that they would pass my frustrations along to the "right people."  Cute item but frustrating process.  I'm not happy...
