This crib had been great for well over three years.  My oldest son slept in it for 2+ years and my youngest has slept in it ever since.  However, we recently converted it to a toddler bed (great option!) and encountered our first problems.  I have ZERO complaints about it as a crib.  #1 When we installed the toddler rail it created a large gap between the drawer and the bottom of the rail that just frankly looked bad.  It was nearly 2" and was unsightly.  It could easily fit lower but the holes were drilled in a way that would not allow me to put it any lower.  We have the recommended cardboard between the mattress and metal grate that holds the mattress up and it stuck out and looked awful.  We put a blanket there to cover it up but that rendered the drawer useless.  Oh well.  #2, the screws included for the toddler rail were too long for installation.  When screwed tight the rail moved quite a bit as did the sides of the crib/bed.  I further tightened it down to stabilize the bed and the screw split the back of the crib because it was too long.  Now I have a toddler bed with a non-functioning drawer, a loose rail, and a split side.  However, this crib was perfect and we had no issues with it as a crib.  I am contacting the manufacturer.
