These dividers are nice because they are made of strong and sturdy plastic.  However, they were too tall for some of my drawers (like top dresser drawers for socks, etc.)  Also, it is sometimes difficult to make the button that "locks" these dividers into the length you've chosen stay "locked."  Instead, if the divider is not angled just right, the botton keeps popping up and making the divider fall over.
