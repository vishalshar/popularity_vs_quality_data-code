Hate this walker. Everything on it is digital which is not very engaging for my 9 month old. I wish I had purchased something with physical toys attached to it (similar to what comes on an Exersaucer or Jumperoo). It's also very high off the ground, even at the lowest setting. It was a month before my son's feet could touch the ground. The mp3 player is useless.  The buttons are perfect for cramming snacks & spit up in the crevices. There is no where to put small snacks (like Puffs) and my son wants out of it as soon as I put him in. It's much larger than some of the other walkers I've seen and doesn't turn corners well. He gets stuck. A LOT. Don't waste your money.
