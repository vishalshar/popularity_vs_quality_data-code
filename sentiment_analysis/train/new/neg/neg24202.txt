I'll start out by saying that I do think this is the best suction bowl you will find.  I have  2 kids and I've tried them all.  Most suction bowls just don't stick.  Don't know if I can mention other specific brands in my review- but trust me, I've tried them all- at least 4 other major brands sold here on amazon.com and they are all worthless...  may as well just be a regular bowl.I have one of these exact bowls from when my older son was a baby (in slightly different colors, but same manufacturer) and the old one is the ONLY suction bowl that I have that actually stays stuck ALWAYS.  So I was very excited to find these- hoping they would be just as great as my old one.  BUT they are not.  The suction does not stick as well.  It is easy to see why- the suctions on the new bowls that I just received are slightly irregular around the edges, creating a space for air to get under the bowl and release the suction.As I said in my title, the suction is pretty good on the bowls I just received- but the bowls can be lifted by the baby.  I am lucky- however, in that the bottom suction removes from the bowls and my old suction bottom works perfectly with the new bowls creating a super strong child proof seal.  So overall I am happy with my purchase.  And I must mention again- even this new version that is not absolutely perfect is better than any other suction bowl that I have found.One last tip- never put your suctions in the dishwasher!!!!  Even if the manufacturer says they are dishwasher safe- it ruins any suction ability the bowl once had.
