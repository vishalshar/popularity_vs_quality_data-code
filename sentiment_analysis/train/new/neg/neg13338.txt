I was looking for something with a vibration mechanism that didn't shut off after 20 min like our current one did... so in that respect it was perfect... but the chair was seemingly uncomfortable for my daughter and was muuuch more difficult to bounce than the other one we had. we ended up Cannibalizing it for its vibration device and put it on our old chair :) works great! plus it only takes 1 D battarie and it lasts weeks of seemingly continuous use. I just wish it was slightly cushier and had a bit more spring.
