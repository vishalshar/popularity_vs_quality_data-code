i had to return this product as soon as i received it. it's a great idea, to have your little one learn how to sit in his own little chair, but the reality is, it doesn't offer great support. it states that it's for children as old as 3 months (i'm not sure if this one stated that it's from birth), as long as they're able to support their heads, as it will teach your baby to sit. the back of this chair is way too low, so even if your 3 month old could hold up his little head, it doesn't offer back support, not to mention, the seating isn't very spacious, and then when you add the tray to it, there is less room for your little one, especially if he has a little belly on him. this is definitely not for slightly bigger babies, had i to choose again, i would go with the bumbo.
