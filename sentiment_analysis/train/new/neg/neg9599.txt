I found that this product was difficult to put together. You have to perfectly align the tube in the base to the straw before snapping it in our it won't work.  If not aligned correctly your child will suck and suck and not get any liquid out. You also have to snap off the click cover in order to get the straw through, which is also not easy to figure out.  Liquid will also leak through the top of the straw after your child puts the cup down.Overall this cup is not worth the expensive price. You can get cup at half the price, like the Nuby, that are a lot more convenient to clean in use.I would not recommend this product.
