Looks like I drew the short stick as well and got the neon green ones. The brown ones in the picture look nice. The neon green ones are hideous. I don't know why Amazon doesn't let you pick the color like the other products.Other than the color, the fabric is soft and it does the job.Update 4/25: I bought the Sunshine Kids Soft Wraps Car Seat Harness Pads, Grey/Ivory instead and they're wonderful! It feels thicker and softer than the munchkin ones, and the color is a nice charcoal grey. It blends in just fine with my black stroller.
