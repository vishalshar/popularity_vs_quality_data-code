This growth chart is very cute, however, it is difficult to make marks on the fabric when measuring your child because it is a little fuzzy.  Also, it is hung by hanging the loop on a nail, but it really needs to be fastened more securely.  My son pulled on the growth chart a couple of times and it stretched out the loop, which throws off where the measurement markers fall.  It wasn't accurate anymore. It's an ok growth chart, but if I was doing it again I'd buy one that was laminated or thicker paper that can be marked on and rolled up and kept when the child grows up.
