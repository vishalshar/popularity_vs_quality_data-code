Do not wash this rattle in the washing machine.  If you do, it loses its rattle function and effectively becomes a stuffed toy that baby can wear on her wrist.  Cute but not what I had in mind.  I did not receive any care instructions and only AFTER I washed the rattle and ruined it did I bother to look on the Angel Dear website where I discovered you should surface wash only.  For a toy that will probably go into my baby's mouth, that is not sufficient.  I want this thing clean.  It is cute.  It does match my Angel Dear blankies and teether I have but we do not really use it because it does not "rattle".
