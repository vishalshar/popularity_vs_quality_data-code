I thought this was a good product. It installed easily and looked great, until my daughter accidentally touched one of the decals with a damp hand. It instantly smeared and turned white. I contacted the seller, and they told me it was my fault for not protecting the decals, and there must have been some detergent to cause it to do that. I tested another area with a clean paper towel and a dab of water and it did the same thing. And since it was "my fault," they will not replace it. Who makes a nursery decal that can't be touched by a child?
