I am 5'4'' and about 140lbs. My chest size is 36C. I had twins at 36 weeks and the pillow did not work out how I thought it would. I had to hold each child to my boob in order to feed them since they were so little. It was not comfortable. Also I could not burp them as all the other reviews said they could. I now use the pillow for double feeding with a bottle or for the little ones to sit in. I would not recommend the pillow.
