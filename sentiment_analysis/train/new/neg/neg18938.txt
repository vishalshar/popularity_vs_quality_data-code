We purchased this crib in December because it is so beautiful and the drawer was an extra-added bonus.  When we opened the boxes, the wood was split down the middle of the headboard and the legs, and there were scratches and cracks everywhere.  We had it shipped back and they sent us another one.  There were very minor little flaws on the wood, that I was able to look past because I loved the crib so much.  My husband put it together and the drawer would not work because the tracks were not close enough together, I decided to look past that as well because again I loved the look.  Yesterday I was in the nursery looking at everything like I do everyday, anxiously awaiting our little guy to get here in April or May, and noticed that now the headboard has a 6 inch hair line crack splitting right down the middle!  The baby isn't even here yet, and we haven't even had anything in the crib besides the bedding on it!  Nobody even goes in that room!  We're in the process of getting a refund and buying a new crib.  There is a "Madison" crib at Babies R Us that looks similar and doesn't seem to fall apart from the reviews that I've read.  It's too bad that Storkcraft can make such a beautiful crib, but such low quality!!  Thank goodness we have a bassinet for the time being.
