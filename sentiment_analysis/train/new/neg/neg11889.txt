I like that this is so versatile. We don't live near my parents so I sent this to them for when the we bring the grandchildren to visit. It is nice as a deep bassinet and as a rocker for a slightly older baby. Haven't tried it as a toddler rocker yet.2 complaints: 1) The toys on the toy bar are made of HARD plastic and when my son bats at them with his little flailing arms I worry about him hurting himself; 2) The rim on the bottom edge is a metal bar covered with the vinyl/cloth of the seat but it has no padding so it is HARD. My son kicks like a madman and when his heels get to the bar I have to cover it or keep adjusting him. The seatbelt could theoretically keep one's heels above the bar, but at some point kids are not big enough to sit like a toddler and too long to be belted and have their heels above the bottom bar.However, for the price and versatility, and for something the kids use a few weeks of the year, I say it does the job. And it's adorable.
