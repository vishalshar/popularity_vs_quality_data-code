The holes are not even, on some of the letters they are higher, on some they are lower. On the letters that have more than one hole, one of the holes is a lot higher than the other one and the holes don't coincide with the holes on the other letters I purchased. The only way I was able to install them was by placing them on a piece of wook and nailing that to the wall. I was very disappointed since I really liked the letters when I got them. Installation is a nightmare! They do come with ribbon to be used for hanging that way but it was not what I wanted. I ended up by donating them to the local Goodwill which is a shame...
