For the price it's not worth it.  I was really trying to find a walker with all swivel wheels but I guess they don't make them anymore.  Only the front wheels spin 360 degrees while the back ones only go forward/backward.  Kind of hard for babies to understand the mechanics of his first car, I mean I told him it was going to be a 4 point turn to get out of that corner but he didn't "get it".Also, there are indentions in the back of plastic where you can imagine the rear of the car having lights, etc.  Well they don't even provide you with stickers (like they do on most plastic toys) and also on the rear view mirror, they could have a cute mirror like silver sticker on it, but they just leave it black.  how boring.  If it's because they are afraid the babies will get it wet or peel it, they do have one sticker on it already on the little play tray so why not give more?I returned this walker for a refund and looking for an alternative.  I also received a black car instead of red.  The red looks cooler.
