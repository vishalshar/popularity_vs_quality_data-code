I had something similar to this for my daughter and so wanted one for my granddaughter.  One of the sides of the table came with gouges in it and one of the strips that go around the table top cracked slightly when screwing the pieces together.  It looks nice and I am sure it will be fine, since it does not get used everyday.  Overall, it could be better made.
