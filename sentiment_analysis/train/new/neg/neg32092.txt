I love that you can detach the paci, but I thought I would be able to use it with other Soothie pacis but you can't.  It seems this is they give you the only paci that is compatible.  I don't like this as much as Wubanub because the animal is stuffed too much and seems to push the paci up too much on baby.  It just doesn't hold it in as well as the Wubanub.Wabunub: 8/10 Stars.  A+ for design.  C- for washability. But the design, fit, and comfort make up for the lacking pacifier detachability.  Because it is so much more superior than other paci animal holder I put up with the inconvenience cleaning.  I wrap a paper towel around the animal and wash the pacifier alone. Then put the entire toy in my germ sanitizer.Paciplushie: 0/10 stars.  F.  Design terrible and flawed. Doesn't stay in babie's mouth.  The sewing on the animal to paci has no flexibility so it sits up stiff in baby's mouth. As soon as baby moves their head even the slightest it comes out.  Also doesn't work with soothie or nuk pacis.  It rubbed my babie's nose raw using the Soothie.  Stiff animal with too much stuffing.  Paci can detach from animal but if the paci won't stay in baby's mouth what good is that?Pacimal: 5/10 stars.  Better design and fit than the paciplushie, but still not as good as wubanub.  It can detach to be washed but you cannot fit other pacis on it.
