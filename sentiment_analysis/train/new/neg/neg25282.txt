I thought this product was a great idea.  I was so excited to be able to keep an eye on both kids with one quick look.  When adjusted right, it's great.  It is difficult to keep in place though.  My visor is just the wrong size for it to sit correctly and not be in the way of the mirror (01 Chevy Impala).
