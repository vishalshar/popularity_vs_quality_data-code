The inserts that connect the gate to the extension are plastic. For a short extension this might be okay but for a longer one it should be stronger. If you lean on the gate with the extension and plastic fittings, the gate bends at the fitting. It doesn't seem very strong and I am betting its susceptible to breaking. On a pressure fit gate the break could cause a very serious injury.
