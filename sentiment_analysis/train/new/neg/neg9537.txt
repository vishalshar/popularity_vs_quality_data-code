Finally, I've come to the point that I could be 100% confident to say that I know this product very well by now. I am a father of 5 year-old and 3 year-old boys and I've used it for them for more than a year now.Pros:1. It doesn't feel thick. It feels cool and leaves shiny, thin layer of the sunscreen on the skin.2. EWG Rating of 1, which is really good because this product doesn't use harmful ingredients.3. Very water resistant.BUT... that's all about it....Cons:1. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE and the price is not stable. The prices range between 8 to 17 USD per 3 ounces bottle.2. TOO OILY. That shiny, thin layer doesn't go away no matter what. It will make your face shine for a good number of hours. Not only that this doesn't fade away easily due to its strong water resistance.3. TOO PAINFUL to eyes. I have to take extra care to apply it to my sons' faces. This gets very tricky especially if you have active boys like me. Even more than 8 hours of applying it, it hurts my eyes so bad when I take shower.4. DOES NOT PROTECT YOU FROM GETTING SUN BURN and/or TAN. No matter how many times and how much you apply, you will end up with nice brown tan. Even applying generous amount of this sunscreen with frequent application, it did not help me or my children avoid getting tan or sun burn.Bottom Line:If you're not so much considerate of getting 100% SUNSCREEN, which in fact it is made for initially, and you're more concerned about environment and your/your baby's health, get this. BUT be careful not to get this into your loved one's eyes.If you want to get maximum sun-blocking feature as well as environmentally and dermatologically safe product that does not hurt you or your baby's eyes, please look elsewhere.I am researching again and found Adorable Baby product more appealing. Please suggest me if you found anything better. Thanks.
