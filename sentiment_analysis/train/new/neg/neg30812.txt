Until now, I have been an OXO brand loyalist, having been thrilled with all of our many household and baby item purchases. That said, this product is AWFUL! I bought this to replace my Aquatopia mat, which eventually got moldy. The short version is, this pad is a rock hard thick material ... as in, literally harder than if I just knelt directly on my bath mat over tile. It's as if no one tested this product with actual humans before producing it.I am a very petite 5'1"Â and this was far to narrow for my legs and actually left marks on my shins from just a few minutes of use. I couldn't return this fast enough. I'd rather buy and replace additional Aquatopia mats, since the kneeling area is substantial and the foam is quite comfortable.I can only guess that the positive reviews were from purchasers who have no basis of comparison with foam that is actually cushiony.
