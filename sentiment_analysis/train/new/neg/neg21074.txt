While I do like that it has buckles instead of velcro the buckles kept me from tightening it as much as I would like. As a result it swings a little more than I would like. Also, the cup holders are small. I cannot fit my insulated cup (yeti) or theme park cups into the holder. I have to utilize the middle compartment to hold my drink. I like the hooks that came with it a lot. The velcro keeps them in place and I haven't lost one yet! Overall it seems to built well I just wish the drink holders were a little bigger.
