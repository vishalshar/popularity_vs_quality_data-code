I hate to give negative reviews because this item is really cute and it works fine... but the material is something that really lets mold and mildew stick to it. My son LOVES the images on this, but I have had this for about 3 months and I have tried cleaning it and then soaking it in bleachy water and it is covered in mold and mildew. I have to say that this is a waste.
