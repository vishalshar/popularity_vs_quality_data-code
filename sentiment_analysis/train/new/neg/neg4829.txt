I love all the other items I received from the Curly Tails line so far however this one isn't the best.  It's very simple and cute, but the music is pretty bad.  First of all, there is no way to run the mobile without the music on.  The music starts out ok, but it goes really slow and almost drags.  It makes the notes almost stop and when they do play they are really out of tune.  I'm keeping it because I didn't set it up in time to return it and it does look cute but it's not the best functioning mobile.
