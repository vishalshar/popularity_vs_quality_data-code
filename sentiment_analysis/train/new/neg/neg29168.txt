This cart is indeed small. As long as you recognize this then you won't get a shock as one reviewer did. I wanted a smaller cart so this fits the bill for me. The cart looks and feels sturdy and does indeed come already built (always a big bonus) The basket is great for a dolly or any toy that they can squeeze in there.  The shape sorter is functional although my daughter gets a bit frustrated when she can't find them after putting them through the holes.  They do slip back under the basket so she can't see them but it's not a big issue. Something age will sort out. The colored beads on the poles really have now where to go so they are just for twisting around really.  The wooden circles move smoothly (on mine) around the tracks and back. I have two negatives.1) The cart has no wheel friction control (I thought it did, my fault for getting confused with another wooden carts features) This makes it a little too quick for my beginner walker even with a deep pile carpet.  I am currently having to put my foot on the front to stop the cart running away with my little miss.  Obviously a little further down the line it will be fine.2) This cart will tip over if they pull themselves up using the back and side together. It is quiet a light cart, hence so easy to pull it over but in time this will be a bonus as kids can get frustrated when they can't turn the carts.  This cart can easily be tipped up slightly to allow a slight change in direction. I'm just hoping my daughter doesn't outgrow it in height before she can manage it on her own safely.
