This product was a great idea since I didn't want to keep putting up the separate cushy seat when my baby needed to go. I have a standard toilet but the screws in the installation part of the seat just barely fit, but it worked. My husband liked the seat because it was a little longer than the standard toilet lid; however, my baby seems to be quite the coddled princess because she preferred the cushioned seat she had been using. Trying to put her on the hard plastic seat was like trying to get a kitty in bath water. I thought, "great, I just bought a 30 dollar seat and my kid won't even use it." But, luckily (unluckily, if I had wanted to keep it) the seat broke on the second time I used it. The plastic hinge pin broke. I am only 150 lbs, so I wouldn't say that I was the problem. So, if my baby had liked the seat, it would have been terrible that it broke on the same day I put it in, but since she didn't like it, it was fortunate. I think if she had liked it I would have tried the MDF or wooden seat because the idea is still a great one.
