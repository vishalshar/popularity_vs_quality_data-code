I'm a bit OCD about my hangers...these are one of maybe 5-6 types of plastic hangers we have for our son (and we have multiple velvet ones as well).  I used these for about 2 weeks before giving them away.  The reason being - they're just too big & bulky.  They're twice as large as the hangers we use now, and much larger than the regular standard plastic ones you'll see at the store.The ones I prefer are the Delta hangers.  Available on Amazon for $6.99/10pk.  I just bought a bunch more & finally getting rid of all the other hangers we have.If you're trying to hang a lot of clothes (& don't have unlimited space) - these will not work for you.
