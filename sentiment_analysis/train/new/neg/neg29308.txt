I have experience with both the Ameda and Medela pumps, and I have to say that I vastly prefer the Medela flanges both in terms of size and ease of use. This Ameda set of flanges for 28.5 and 30.5 mm is very poorly designed -- in order to use the 28.5 mm flange you have to use the insert for the 30.5 mm flange. Why?! Why not just sell both sizes as standalone flanges without all this inserting nonsense?! It ends up being more parts to wash (always a pain with pumps!) and it's not easy to use. You also can't really see the milk flow easy through two layers of flange plastic.It's frustrating because if you need this size flange and you have an Ameda pump, you're stuck with this situation. But it really is a poor design. Ameda, if you're reading this: REDESIGN THESE FLANGES.
