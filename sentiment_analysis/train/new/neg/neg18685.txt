Not a fan on these. I was really excited to get organic washcloths for wiping my daughter's face after meals. These aren't very absorbent (the water repels off at first.) They don't get clean when they go through the laundry. (There is avocado and banana crusted and stained onto them, and it just does NOT want to come off!) And after the first time I washed/dried them, they won't lay flat anymore. They roll themselves up into a tube.Maybe they were only intended to be used strictly in a bath tub... But I still love Under the Nile!
