The Phillips Avent digital baby monitor has a very good range, clear display with excellent night vision & the sound clarity is wonderful BUT the on/off switch is faulty after only a few hours or days of usage. We are returning our SECOND unit in less than 3 weeks & can only hope that the next replacement has some longevity to it. The only reason I'm not giving this unit a really low score is that when it works, it IS a very good unit. Amazon's return/exchange policy is the best (thanks Amazon!) but I sure hope not to have to use it again with this monitor.Update: Amazon wouldn't ship us another unit to replace this one as they thought that the 3rd unit would also be faulty & so they refunded our money in full & very promptly too. So again, top marks to Amazon for customer service BUT they are STILL selling the units even though they think they are likely to be faulty out of the box! Not very good Amazon, not really the way to proceed in my book. We did buy another unit from another vendor & had the exact same issue with this monitor. It seems that Phillips has an issue with these monitors & for the sake of a ten cent switch, someone could potentially have an injured or otherwise hurt baby. Isn't that worth more than 10 cents? Pretty poor business practices on both Amazon & Phillips for not at least investigating & maybe recalling the units but I guess that's the way of the world these days...... We eventually & reluctantly went with a Samsung product from Sam's for less money & it works well, at least so far. We shall see.....
