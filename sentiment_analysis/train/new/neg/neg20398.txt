I decided to try these after several good fiends recommended, hoping to save money, especially since we don't pay for water at our apartment. Returned it to Amazon yesterday, after about 1 week of use.... and a shelf full of wet pants, onzie's and blankets every day, I decided to return them. Here are the reasons:1) They leaked all the time! Even with two pads inserted every other diaper change, my 1-year-old would have wet his pants! I finally got frustrated. I understand that many people don't report any leaking whatsoever, but that hasn't been the case for us. By comparison, disposable diapers, being much cheaper per 1 ct., are far more absorbent than the FuzziBunz pads. I never experienced a single leak with Pampers Sensitive.2) When tried on our newborn daughter, with straps adjusted, I had to keep her legs apart due to the bulk of excess fabric and padding. When tried to wrap her up, she would get fussy and apparently uncomfortable. Never happens with the correct size disposable diapers.Overall, great idea and I would give them 5 stars had it not been for the above cons. That's been my experience with them so far.
