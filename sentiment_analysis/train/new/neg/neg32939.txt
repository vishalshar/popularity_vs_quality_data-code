Just received this yesterday and wish there was another way to do this.  My son (2 months) loves the mat and toys but the light/music caterpillar does not work. I tried two brand new sets of batteries and it won't turn on.  I'd like to just return the caterpillar for a functioning one without having to return the whole mat.
