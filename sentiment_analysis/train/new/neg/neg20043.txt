I have a child with sensory integration disorder that is particulary soothed by vibration. I bought 2 of these bears, one for home and one for his day care.I love the microfiber fabric, very soft and plush, and a little less allergen holding than some other stuffed animals. Pretty easy to clean too. Size is also good, not too big, not too small.I wanted this bear to work when my son hugged and held it. I took the first one out of the box, followed the instructions for set up, and the vibrating unit was way too sensitive and would stay on despite being put down. Thought it was just that one, but the second one did it too- although it was a little less sensitive. Again, I put in the vibrating piece as instructed, and then in other ways, but this problem kept persisting. I still use the bears for my son, but I did end up having to replace the batteries sooner than I thought. Nevertheless, I still think it was a good purchase. I did think the heart beat feature in this bear would seem soothing for an infant and make for a great newborn gift.
