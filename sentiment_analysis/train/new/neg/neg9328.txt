I ordered the Inglesina umbrella twice for y daughter's stroller. When the first one arrived I loved the red color, the quality of fabric, its design and size.However, my excitement didn't last long because the umbrella was broken. The metal part which connects it with the plastic clip and is wrapped with a spring for flexibility apparently snapped way before it was sent to us. At first look I didn't see it because the spring covers it but as soon as I mounted it on a stroller it wobbled and didn't stay in a desired position. I returned it.Then I ordered another one in dark blue (red wasn't available). It arrived untouched and new and I was happy to use it for 6 weeks (not every day obviously) until it broke in exactly the same spot as the other one.I'm so disappointed with the quality of the product especially that there aren't too many stroller umbrellas to chose from. It didn't even last one season.
