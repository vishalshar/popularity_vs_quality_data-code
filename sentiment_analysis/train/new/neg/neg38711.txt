I was honestly disappointed in this product.  I purchased this to have on hand for a family camping trip, and it did come with some first aid essentials, I had planned on adding a few things to the kit (a small bottle of Tylenol, itch cream etc) it's a bit awkward to open & close, and there is not much room inside the case for things.  The whole upper portion had little sections to I assume put additional items in, however, the "shelves" are basically U shaped causing what ever you are putting there to not fit, keep the lot from closing, or it falls.  I attempted to put things it and it's like a trap you have to attempt to close before what ever you put in falls off or out.
