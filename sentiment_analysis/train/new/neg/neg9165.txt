The measurements on these bottles are very inaccurate. We use baby bottles to dose medication in a distilled water solution, so we need them to be accurate. I imagine parents using formula also really need accurate measurements. Also, the little cap that goes with the ring is flat on the bottom and does not dip down into the bottle at all, so it always flies off when I open the bottle. I really regret buying these and would not recommend them.
