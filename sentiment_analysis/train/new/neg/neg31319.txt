I was looking for a baby book for my third child and was dissapointed by how few pages their are in this book.Here are the pages included:All about mommy/daddyMy family treeBaby on the way - heard heartbeat, felt moveShower pageBirth day infoBirth announcementHand prints/ foot printsThe world around me - two pagesMy favorite things - toys, songs, etcMy firsts - smile, laugh, steps, etcGrowth chartSpecial moments - holidaysFirst birthdayNo pages for any information about teething, first foods, how we told people, how we prepared for arrival, month by month milestones. Not enough room for pictures and pages are thick and glossy so pictures won't glue down very well.I thought I would like this book because it was a little smaller and I don't have as much time to fill out this baby book since I have other kids but there is really not enough room to include everything that should be included.
