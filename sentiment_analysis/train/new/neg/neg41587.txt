The doll is so poorly made. The hair is matted. The vagina is *really* odd. The consensus among my friends is that it's a red mouth and line you'd see on a teddy bear's face. It looks nothing like an actual vagina, and it's not even really between the doll's legs. My daughter wants nothing to do with this poor, ugly doll.
