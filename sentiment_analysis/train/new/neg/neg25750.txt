I BOUGHT THIS NOW BECUASE IT WAS SUCH A GOOD PRICE. IT WONT BE USED FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR, SO THAT IS WHY I GAVE IT 3 STARS. I HAVE HEARD FROM FRIENDS WITH BABIES THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THE BEST WHEN IT COMES TO MONITORS, AND I KNOW THAT EVEN THE CHEAP ONES ARENT AS CHEAP AS THIS ONE WAS! I HAVE NO WORRIES ABOUT ITS QUALITY THOUGH.
