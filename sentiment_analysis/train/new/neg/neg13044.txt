Front wheel is fixed so it's very difficult to turn. Veers to left as other reviews mentioned. Only way to turn or prevent veering is to push down on handle constantly to cause the front wheel to lift. There is essentially no point to the front wheel as its use only causes problems. Lifting front wheel is an arm workout but I should be forced to do this and that is only a solution for a woman of average height, a taller person or man would be too tall to push the handle bar down far enough to fix the tire problem.
