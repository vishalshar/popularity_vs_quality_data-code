I bought this about a year ago for when I got my new car. I got my new car in March and put it in the front seat. In 6 months, the spring has popped out of the bottom and today the top tore. We have 6 diono car seats, 2 back of seat storage/kick mats, 2 seat covers and a storage tote that all have held up substantially better than the trash bin. I was expecting more. I am pretty disappointed in this product.
