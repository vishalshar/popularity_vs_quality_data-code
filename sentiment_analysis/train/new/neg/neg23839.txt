I bought this recliner for my son's nursery and loved the look... However the chair is terribly made! The back has fabric with Velcro on the sides to attach to the chair (for access to the under components) but the fabric is too small and doesn't even reach the chair... So I'm left with fabric hanging off the back of the chair. The fabric is also very cheap and thin. The reclining portion is poorly made and I feel like it's going to break when I use it. Of course I bought this shortly before my son was born and had all intentions to return this ASAP but the time flew by and now it's too late to return!!!! Now I'm stuck with this chair that I have to keep next to the wall so you don't see how terrible it really looks. It's so sad. I thought I could rely on the reviews because most of them were good. I never write reviews on products but I didn't want anyone else to be in my situation. Don't buy this chair!
