Worked fine in a high chair at our house for my 2 year old who is incapable of transmitting ketchup covered food items from the plate to his mouth without getting it on his shirt. Also great for tomato soup when we have grilled cheese. He doesn't try to pull it off as others have mentioned, so we haven't had that problem. Only complaint is it is a little too long, so it either has to get tucked between him and the tray, or it lays on top of the tray.
