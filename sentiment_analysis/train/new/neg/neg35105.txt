I really wanted to like this bassinet as a cheaper alternative to buying the halo bassinet. However, this turned out to be too low to the ground and my back hurt every time I went to pick up my baby. I am 5 feet 2 inches. Also, during the winter time being lower to the ground made it colder for my baby as opposed to if it were at my bed level.
