Loved the look of this and thought my son would love the animals over him, unfortunately the cross pieces for the mobile can not be attached once you but a sheet over the mattress.  I don't know about you  but when my baby was small enough to use the bassinet I needed a changeable sheet in there.  Other than that it has been great, very little problems folding and unfolding, and the rolling wheels are convenient for traveling,  however if I where to buy again I would not choose this one as the one feature that sold me I didn't get to use.
