I really wanted to like this bag especially since it has such a cool and fun design. However there are several flaws that have caused the bag to be stashed away for only occasional use.Flaws:* Zipper - This has been mentioned by other reviewers as well but I thought it wouldn't matter that much. The zipper for the wet compartment of the bag is very flimsy and small compared to the overall size of the bag. It is difficult to open with only one hand and once you have several diapers inside it's difficult to zip shut if you have it hanging by only one handle, which is necessary in order to toss in a dirty diaper. I'm surprised the manufacturer didn't put in a larger heavy-duty zipper.*Wet Bag Insert - The wet bag plastic is only attached to the outer bag by the zipper. At first I thought this would be good because I could ensure that the inside got clean and it would dry quicker. Much to my surprise I discovered that the bag holds water on the inside between the liner and outer bag. I learned the hard way when I pulled it out of the washer and soaked my floor. I've had trouble being able to squeeze all the water out of the bag so it can dry. The insert also doesn't fit back into the outer bag well and my bag is now a little lumpy and difficult to fold flat.*Outer Fabric - The outer fabric does not seem to hold up well after multiple washings.I still plan to use this bag for overnight traveling because it zips shut but I will not use it on a regular basis.Side Note: I love my smaller Planetwise wet/dry bag Planet Wise Wet/Dry Diaper Bag - Owl which holds around 5-6 pocket diapers, it's great for daytime travel and I haven't had any issues washing it.
