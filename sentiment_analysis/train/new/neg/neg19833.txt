I first saw this product in California when my cousin wheeled her baby in.  It really appealed to me because it was lightweight and small enough to maneuver around in between crowds of people (and therefore small department store aisles).  My cousin raved about how great the Snap N' Go was.  I had to have it and immediately bought it as soon as I returned to Portland.  This product has been well-used, however, if you're thinking it will last for more than one child--it doesn't.  When my daughter was about 9 months old the stroller frame gave out where the handlebars were attached. If I want to use it I have to stand on the handlebars while the frame is folded so they can be bent back to the shape they are supposed to be at. A friend of mine has the Kolcraft model and it appears to be strudier. We definitely got our use out of the Snap N' Go however, I plan to buy Kolcraft for our next baby.
