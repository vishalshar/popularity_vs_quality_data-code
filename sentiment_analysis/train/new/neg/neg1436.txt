I usually love cloud b. We have a bunch of their products and have given them as gifts. This one missed the mark.First of all, the little loop meant to scrunch the pillow into a pet immediately broke loose. This wasn't a deal breaker as I figured I could sew it back into place myself. Unfortunately, there are a couple more flaws.I love the lavender pouch. It smells great, but it's placement is terrible - right on the top middle of the animal's back. You can feel every little grain in there! I can't even imagine trying to sleep on it. Again, I thought I could easily remedy the problem by turning the pillow over. However, the underside of the pet is simply left open without any sort of clasp or zipper. So is the holder for the lavender pouch. I'd assume the pouch would come out in the middle of the night with my little energetic sleeper bouncing around.The deal breaker was when I noticed the black line running the length of the ladybug's back is really rough - not something I can sleep on, let alone my kid with sensitive skin.There's no way to win. It will be returned ASAP.
