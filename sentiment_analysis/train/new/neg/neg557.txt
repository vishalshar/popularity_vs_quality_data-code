Let me be clear about one thing: This is a good product.  Unfortunately I have to rate it poorly because of Amazon's page.  Now, I also understand that people are going to comment on this review and say "You shouldn't rate the product one star because of an issue with Amazon."  I agree with that, but the only way I'll get this review to be seen by customers, Amazon themselves, and possibly the company and get the issue fixed is by rating it one star.The page for this item states that "You will receive either an arch-top or flat-top gate."  What it doesn't tell you is that the flat-top gate is the only one that comes with the knee pushpad so you don't have to knee the metal bars, and they also don't tell you that it's also the only one that comes with the ramp so many people rave about in the reviews.  Furthermore, the biggest thing they don't tell you is that The First Years hasn't made the flat-top gate (the only one with those two features) in several years, so if you're buying this because of the ramp, you're not getting it.  There should be some indication that there is a material difference between the two gates, rather than just making it should cosmetically different like they do.  Amazon, you're my favorite company, but you screwed this page up big time.That being said, this gate is a good product, and easy to install and use, but it's very disappointing not getting the product you thought you were paying for.
