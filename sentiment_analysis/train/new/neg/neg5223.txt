3 stars only for the convenient of the small package when we need to bring something to cover shopping carts and/high chair.  But it's really non existence for covering high chair.  On a regular restaurant high chair which is the wooden stool, this cover will not stay in place even though our child does.  The slightest movement will uncover the chair completely and will bunch up around our child.Shopping cart standard, not sure what is standard these days with plastic and metal, etc... but this will not fit the Target/Plastic shopping cart.  It barely fit the standard metal shopping cart like the picture Skip Hop provided.  When we go shopping, most of the super market provide smaller shopping carts, and when we put the seat cover down, the backing of the cart will not fully recline.  If they size the seat cover a bit bigger it will be perfect because it's much easier and more convenient to take this cover out than the padded ones.
