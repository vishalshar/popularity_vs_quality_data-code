I had high hopes for these when I accidentally bought pants at a Mom 2 Mom sale that were too big for my son.  Unfortunately, they fell off his pants a few times.  Even worse they distracted my two year old son horribly.  He was always trying to play with them or check to make sure they were there.  The designs are nice looking but beyond that there were not many positives.  We only used them three or four times before I was overly frustrated with them.
