I thought it would be great because we buy a lot of OXO stuff and are always happy.  This plate just feels like a plastic plate.  It scratches extremely easy (the first time we used it with an oxo fork). Size seems ok.  Fits well enough on tray. Love the green color, just not well made compared to the other oxo stuff.
