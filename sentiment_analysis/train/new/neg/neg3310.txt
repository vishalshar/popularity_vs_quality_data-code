Could be better but for the price and the times the little person plays with it, it's OK. The Tiger is the one that opens 80% of the time and half of those times he flies off and I have to re-attach him. When my 1 year old get's tired of hearing the tiger pop open and sing I can't help but laugh. After a few times of the Tiger popping out my son, who is only 1, slams the door shut and huffs at it. I do like that he can get it to work on his own though so that is a plus.
