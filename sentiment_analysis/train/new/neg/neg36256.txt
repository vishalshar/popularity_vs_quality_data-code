These mittens are okay for us...as first time parents we knew we would need some mittens for our new baby in the hospital and afterwards to protect her (and us) from those sharp little nails! I like that these are all white and pretty thin. Since babies can't sweat, I like that I could use these in all seasons without worrying about baby's hands getting too hot. However, I don't like how big they are! They are huge! Granted, our baby girl was small (5 lbs 12 oz) but she's grown since then and they are still so big on her! They constantly fall off--which obviously prevents them from doing their primary purpose. The upside about them being large is that the elastic is not super tight, indenting the hands. I had read about tight elastic on other reviews and was worried about it. Overall, I'd rather have mittens that are too large than ones that are indenting baby's soft skin--but I still wish they were smaller!
