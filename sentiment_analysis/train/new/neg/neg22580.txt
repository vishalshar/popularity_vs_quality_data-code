Loved that the seat could be folded up and the seat itself is attractive and takes up little space.  However, contrary to original description, there is only one recline position and my 3 week old (10lbs.) looks a little awkward in the upright position.  Believe they have revised since then, but older reviews from Prime state the 2 position recline, so don't be confused.  Only use it if I watch him the whole time.  (i.e. Wouldn't take a quick shower or turn back to him) Once he has more neck control should be better.  Friend bought Fisher Price Zen Bouncer and it is muuuch more secure and felt more comfortable with NB in it.  Baby stayed content longer in that bouncer.  Wish I would have bought something else.
