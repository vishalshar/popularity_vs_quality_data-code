I was recommended this product by my sister because she loved them for her daughter.  She said they worked great!..but the quality must have gone down the last 2 years!  They do not stay closed!  I was expecting to be able to just grab a few cubes and throw them into my bag, but after they defrost they leak EVERYWHERE!  When I told this to my sister she said she did not have this issue!  I am very upset and wish they would stay closed!  I also worry about them getting freezer burn since they donâ€™t stay closed.  I want to make a couple of weeks worth of food, but feel like they will get freezer burn too quickly. Very unhappy and wish the quality was as good as it was 2 years ago.
