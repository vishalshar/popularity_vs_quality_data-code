I am so disappointed that these bibs are fraying and pulling quite a bit after only 3 washings.  The binding is not overlapping the main fabric enough on one of them, which is already making a big 1" gap that is fraying. The tags are fraying, and the terrycloth has many "pulls" where the yarn loops have pulled out to 1/2" and 2" long strings, making the once adorable bibs look very scrappy.  I have washed with the Velcro fastened in regular cycle warm and tumble dry on medium heat.  I'll give 2 stars because they are so cute and soft.
