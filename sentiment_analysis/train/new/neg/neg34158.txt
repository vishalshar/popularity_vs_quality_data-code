I have all the carriers: from the Guatemalan o-ring sling, to the Moby Wrap, Snuggli and Baby Bjorn. The Ergo is good when the kiddo is older, but I don't like that the kiddo can't face outwards unless on your back (which is hard to get into during those early toddler years, in my opinion).  Also, I found the infant insert a bit difficult to manage on top of trying to adjust the infant to be sitting in it, in the first place. So, I say, meh.I prefer the Moby wrap for it's versatility.  Just practice wrapping it onto your person a handful of times and then it's like riding a bike: becomes easy peasy.Or, my fav for the baby (not newborn): Baby Bjorn!  Get the skin on skin closeness as with the Ergo, but with an easy on-off carrier and you can face the kiddo outward or in-.
