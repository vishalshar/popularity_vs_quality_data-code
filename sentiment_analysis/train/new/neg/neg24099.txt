This product is poorly made. It only holds 3 feedings worth of formula. It's bulky and the lid is poorly made. Not only does it turn and spill pre-measured formula into the other slots, but it also doesn't snap shut securing and pops open spilling precious formula all over the diaper bag. Waste of money.
