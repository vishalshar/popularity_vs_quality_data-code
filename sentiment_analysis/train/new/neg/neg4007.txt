I love this changing pad- except one thing (which I should've researched more before purchasing). The foam is made out of polyurethane foam."Polyurethane foam is made from petroleum and is highly flammable. Depending on how itâ€™s processed, polyurethane foam may contain various chemical additives, including formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and other well established toxic chemicals." That is NOT something I want in something that I use for my baby!! Had the type of foam been disclosed on the product details, I would not have purchased this changing pad. If you aren't worried about the material, then this pad has held up well and is great. But the toxic material is just too much of a concern for me.
