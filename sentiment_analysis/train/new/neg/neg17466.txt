I have been pleased with the quality of Britax (we had the Boulevard from day 1 and then upgraded to the Frontier 85).  I have the same complaint as many other reviewers:  the bottom seat pad does not stay attached.  Almost everytime my 3 1/2 year old climbs into his seat, I have to yank the seat pad out from under him to re-secure it to the bottom of the booster.  The small hooks for this purpose are just that, small.  They don't hold the fabric securely.  It is enough of a daily frustration to make me search for another booster to use in my car.  My husband can deal with this nonsense on the occasion he drives our son somewhere. ;)
