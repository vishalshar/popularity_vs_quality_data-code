baby loves jumper, we have a double wide doorway we keep it in. only problems is that it is hard to put her in the jumper and remove her from it. and she seems to always be tilted to the side. other than that she loves it. also we have an older house and most of the doorways are to big for the jumper to attach to, so i would make sure that you can use it first.
