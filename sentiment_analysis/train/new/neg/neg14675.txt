I have had this for about five months now and initially I loved it and thought it was the best thing ever. Every night before I put it on my little one I would test it on myself either by holding my breath or putting it down on the counter. We have only had two false alarms and that was because it came off that happen once he started rolling around more. But as of recently it has started to act a little funny. One day it will beep and tell me the batteries low and then for weeks the battery light says that it's good. Last week the alarm went off in the middle of the night I looked at his video monitor and saw that he was in the same exact position that I had put him to bed which means he didn't move to make it fall off so I panicked. Turns out he was fine however the next night when I woke to change him the  alarm was not attached to him and was down by his foot in his footie pajamas and it never went off which was cause for concern. It has gone off any time it has fallen off of him and was not rising and falling with his chest so how come it didn't go off when it was by his foot? Initially it gave me great peace of mind like I said I would test it every night but since it's been acting a little funny I don't trust it at all which is unfortunate. I also find when I'm changing him in the middle of the night lately and I put it down on the dresser it doesn't go off after 15 or 20 seconds of not being on him like it used to. I could try changing the batteries but the battery was suppose to last a year with a lot more use that he uses it for according to their website. I think it's a great added measure but like I said it cannot be trusted 100% not that you should ever rely on just that to watch monitor your baby.
