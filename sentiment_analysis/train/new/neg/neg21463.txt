Though I still think this decal is adorable, I must say I was very disappointed in its inability to stay on the wall. The decal is very thin and though appears to be sticky, it lifts around the edges and eventually falls off. I must add that my walls are swirled plaster and has a higher gloss paint, I don't know if that was part of the issue but a different decal for my daughter's room sticks great so that attested to the difference in quality. Whatever you do, I recommend thoroughly cleaning your wall before applying any decal.
