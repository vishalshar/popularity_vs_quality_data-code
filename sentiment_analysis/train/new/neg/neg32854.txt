i recieved this swing as shower gift and thought it was great the music is so peaceful and the fishes on the side swim along as it swings i couldn't wait to use it!! we tried putting our 2 week old in it after all the product description does say &quot;features deep cradle support for baby's head&quot; that is a lie the swing is way too upright and has no support for a newborn. i was really diappointed but figured we would still get plenty of use out of it when my son was older. well he is now 4 months old and i tried using it again and although he sits up very well when propped the swing offers no support on the sides and the fishes that dangle encourage him to lean over in an effort to grab them thus putting his head between the bars that swing together. well luckily i was sitting right there and saw the problem immediately even thogh he still got a couple of mild bumps on the head. this was after he'd only been in it for a minute and a half ! he didn't spend half an hour working his way over! well i'm sure their arguement is that you shouldn't leave your child unattended but to some extent isn't that the only reason we buy these things so we have a safe place to set our babies down where they can be entertained while we wash the dishes or do laundry or whatever. i would never leave my child in a swing unattended for a long period of time but i would expect to be able to go across the room without him getting banged in the head!!!
