My twins ended up loving this bug bead necklace. But I sort of had mixed reviews about it. I didn't like how hard the bug beads were, I expected them to be a little bit softer. Also the bugs looked like some parts were possibly painted or it could of just been the poor quality of the product. But we still kept this in their highchair toy bin, because sometimes they like the feel of the hard necklace-they enjoy banging it, touching the different textures, and looking the little bugs. I just tend to monitor-keep a close eye on them when they have it.
