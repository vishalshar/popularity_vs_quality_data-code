This security blanket may turn into a child's and parent's worst nightmare.  Children can and do get their fingers into the loops and then proceed to twist them.  Often times they twist it so tightly that not only can they not get their fingers out without adult assistance, they cut off circulation to their finger in the process.  This requires immediate medical attention.  In fact, there is a manufacturing law that prohibits looped tags on children's clothing, accesories, and toys due to the health issue and the danger involved.  I wouldn't want to see anymore children loose fingers over this severe safety issue.  RN in Virginia
