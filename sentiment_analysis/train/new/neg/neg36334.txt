I also own the Medela Pump-in-Style, and wanted a smaller, quieter, more portable pump to travel with.  The Harmony pump worked great - the let-down feature is especially helpful for me.  Often I found that the Harmony expressed more milk than the electric pump.  However, after just 3 months of "occasional" use, the pump suddenly stopped working.  The part that connects the handle to the rest of the pump has become loose, and there is very little suction now.  I tried going to the Medela website to get a customer service number to call, but could only find email contact info.  The price isn't bad, so I suppose I can just get a new one, but I would have liked to use the pump for longer than 3 months...
