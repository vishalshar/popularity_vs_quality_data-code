July 3, 2012I agree with almost every review until today, both positive and negative. Overall, it seems to work reasonably well. Our 15 months old child likes it and can hold it very well with one or both hands. It is very good size, versatile, resistant to repeated drops on concrete and it is advertised as being "chemicaly-friendly". We do not have problems with the alignment of the lid.It is, however, sensitive to colored vegetable or fruit juices (e.g. carrot, beats etc.) and I would not use it for those, unless one does not mind the staining. The handles are even more sensitive to staining but for us it is not a problem. The lid is not really snap-on and comes off too easily and needs to have its three little pegs carefully inserted into the matching holes in the spout or it will not hold well in place. This could be improved in the next version.Stages two and three; please see the others' reviews. Also, stage three lid forms a lip between the lid and the cup wall where the fruits can get stopped instead of coming out into the toddler's mouth.The most important drawback is the 8-shaped valve. The child learned very early that by biting the soft spout, he can dislodge the white plastic valve by pushing it backwards inside the cup (he does not do this that often, though). When this happens, the water will spill out unrestricted through the spout holes if/when the cup is turned upside down. The designers could easily improve this detail, by adding a snap on feature for that valve. Currently, even by pushing it more inside its location, it will eventually be dislodged through biting or if the cup is dropped on a hard surface. As the child gets older, he will learn not to do it, hopefully.I give it a 3+ stars because seems to still be better than many other similar products on the market and we are happy with it after almost 3 months of usage.
