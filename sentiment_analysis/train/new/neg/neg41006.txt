I was SO Excited to have finally ordered this mattress. When I opened it out of box, it was sagging! This is supposed to be Natural Mat's TOP crib mattress - AND their firmest! This is NOT firm, sagging and way too soft. For safety reasons, crib mattresses are supposed to be firm and this was more like a plush pillow top that sagged in the middle. Maybe I received an off product (i.e. used or defective). But it is already on its way back. I really wanted to love this as I heard amazingly good things about this company and their products. Too bad I got a bad one...
