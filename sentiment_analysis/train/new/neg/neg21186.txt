I love HALO SleepSacks.  I needed x-large sacks for my two year old who has started shoving her legs between the narrow crib slats and getting stuck.  As I used HALO exclusively when she was a baby, I was excited to  see they offered them up to 36 pounds.  I ordered 5, and paid to have them overnighted.  However when they arrived, the package stated up to 18 months.  The dimensions were different that what is listed on the website, and while petite, my daughter had no leg room.  These SleepSacks do not accommodate up to 36 pounds as my daughter is only 22 pounds.  I sadly had to send these back and ordered Wee Urban sleep bags instead.
