I purchased this Levana unit and the Infant Optics DXR-5 because I wasn't sure which one I wanted. Even though the Levana is up to 50 dollars more I think the Infant Optics model is a better buy for the following reasons.1) The range on the Levana unit is abysmal and seems to have a lot of interference issues. I had the monitor about 50 feet from the camera and it constantly had connection issues.2) The screen quality is very poor and extremely laggy. Similar to when the original web cams came out in the 90's and there was a one to two second delay with every movement. The Infant Optics unit is perfectly smooth and the screen quality is better despite being 1" smaller.The key benefits of the Levana unit is that it has pan/tilt, two way audio and lullabies built in. These are all great features but if the key function of the camera doesn't work well then what's the point?
