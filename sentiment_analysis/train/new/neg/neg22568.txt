I love the idea of this product. I used to babysit for a family that had TotLok and always imagined I'd have them in my own home one day. HOWEVER, installing the system myself proved to be way more difficult than I anticipated, and I consider myself to be very handy. I wasn't willing to risk ruining my cabinet doors trying to save myself from the other hideous-looking childproofing options out there. I'll be purchasing something that doesn't require drilling into my cabinet fronts. :(
