Video quality was good, PT worked good-worked better with tinyCam Monitor PRO (android).  Night vision mode was pretty exceptional.  If those are your only criteria, go for it.  It came with one of the best setup guides I've ever seen for an IP camera.The sound...  Horrible to nonexistent.  Constant low grade hum, occassionally accompanied by clicking, echoing or feedback.  IMO its not functional as a baby monitor for that reason alone.  Tried all kinds of suggestions I found on google, including tilting the wifi antenna to the left of the unit and all that.  The only time I got any useable output out of it was monitoring from my gaming computer where I could fine tune the sound-and put enough power behind the pathetic microphone's input to hear my son.  Even then (I had to tweak the sound heavily from my computer) he sounded like something out of jurassic park when he cried.My other issue:  I'm not sure why, if I can specify that I want a white camera, ostensibly to blend in with the decor in my baby's room; it would come with a short, black adapter with a brick on the end.Realistically, if you want to see a clear view INTO your baby's crib, the camera will be above it.  Our crib is about 3.5-4 feet high at the sides, an electrical outlet is typically 12-18" from the floor.  So with a 4-5 foot cord, I'd have to run the cord vertically, within 3 feet of his crib to get a clear view inside the crib.  So I wound up running an extension cord up my wall to meet the power block and get the camera up high enough to see into the crib while keeping the cords too far from the crib for a determined and clever one-year-old to grab.Acceptable for basic home surveillance, due to solid day/night video quality (I could see my boy's fingers moving in the pitch black with it) however I don't feel it should be marketed as a baby monitor.  Too many drawbacks that don't serve it well in that capacity.
