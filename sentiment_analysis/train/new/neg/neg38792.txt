This scoop is perfect for draining toys and storing them as well. However....it doesn't stick to ceramic tile (well it did for maybe 2 weeks). Then I replaced the 3M strips with command hook strips and that didn't work either. Suction cups wouldn't work either because of the tile being grainy. I'll try more command strips again. Other than that- this works perfectly.Update-- I did find that using a command hook to hook the scoop on rather than using the hook that it came with work much better! Just make sure to get a hook that holds up to at least 10lbs. Works like a charm! It's held for over a month now!! SCORE!
