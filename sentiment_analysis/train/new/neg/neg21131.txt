I have a two year old and a newborn and wanted to use this so I could keep an ear (and an eye) on both during the night.  The video quality on this is excellent, even at night. It was very smooth and had good detail.  However,  the 8-second scan feature, essential for monitoring both kids at night, was really annoying.  When the monitor switched between channels there was a loud static crunch sound, like on a walkie-talkie.  It was better if the sound was on the lowest settings but then I couldn't hear what was going on in the two rooms.  The static crunch every 8 seconds was really disruptive when I was trying to sleep.  Also, after using the monitor the first week, I noticed that it would shut off randomly.  I use AC power and battery backup, so I'm confident power failures weren't the cause.  The bottons were all still in the on position but the video and sound wouldn't be working. I had to turn the reciever unit on and off a few times before it would resume operation. Needless to say, I've returned it and am using one from Summer that doesn't make noise when it flips between the cameras.
