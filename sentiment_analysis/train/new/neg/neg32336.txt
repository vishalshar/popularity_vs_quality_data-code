I got these the other day at the local Wally-World because they were out of the Lansinoh ones! :(Anyways, first off.  IF you DO actually like these, I would suggest opening the box in the store, as they have a .50 off coupon right in the top...  Just a little savings there for you...I read the reviews for these and they seemed really well, so I thought why not try them.Here is my problem's with them...They do not have the little sticky tape on the opposite side.  I do not use this on my nursing pads, however, in the middle of the night when you're nursing your baby and take the pad out to put back in afterwards, countless times I am putting these in backwards and they FAIL...  this is really a design flaw, as you cannot really "tell" which side is which... I often do this even when just using them fresh out of the shower.They also are not perforated as the others are. Its just nicer how the lansinoh's have a certain type of cupping to them.  I am REALLY large busted.  A 40G to be exact.  Yes, G like GEORGE...  lol!I have found them to be soft, which is nice.  However, not more absorbent as the Lansinoh brand.  I will use them until the box is empty, since I have a box of 60 of them... but will never buy again...ALSO ladies, SKIP the Medela brand, they're like a cheap version of the Lansinoh!I might even just keep the rest and use them as coasters since they're flat and work well enough for that, but for their purpose, not so much.The price on amazon for these is NO deal... they were the exact same price in the stores, sorry amazon... I love you, but this time, this isnt any deal or discount off...
