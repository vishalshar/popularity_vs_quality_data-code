I was disappointed in this. The pieces are made of really thin plastic and the weight of it is similar to cardboard. The pieces are attached to each other with nice thick quality ribbon and the patterns are nice; my daughter seems to enjoy looking at it when in her stroller, but now its all sad and lop-sided looking because we have already lost 3 of the plastic pieces (we've had it for only 3 months). Not because my daughter has pulled on it, but because when the breeze hits it, the bottom horizontal discs turn and then slip off the vertical discs. I know its supposed to come apart so you can flip the cards for a different pattern, but they have to figure out a better way to attach them.
