My daughter's are always having runny noses. My 1 y/o has chronic RSV. I bought this in the hopes it would suck the snot out to help keep her from having or lessening her chances of RSV. Sadly this product has not worked. It does not have enough sucking power to get the job done. I have not been able to suck any snot out of their nose with it.I learned from the Doctor. To saline one nastral then suck from the other and switch. This product did not even suck out the saline solution. The $5 ball suck did a better job.I am giving it some stars because the music distracted my kids from what was happening.The other reason is the nasal piece is comfort fit. They did not squirm or have issues with that.
