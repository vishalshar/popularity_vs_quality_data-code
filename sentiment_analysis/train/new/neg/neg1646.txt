Its Ok for support in 3rd tri.  The added heat/cold pack was helpful too.  Couldn't really wear it under clothes but around the house was fine for the added support going up and down stairs.  Fits a bit larger, I'm normally a 6-8 ladies and the belt I got was Sm-Med and felt a bit looser when I tighten it around, velcro was almost at its tip end.  I could have maybe used a Smaller size perhaps.
