Useless.I installed this and adjusted it according to the instructions. The adjusting mechanism and the opening/closing mechanism are the same set of levers and gears with some safety switch between them. The switch is supposed to be depressed when adjusting/setting the width and left untouched when simply opening or closing the gate.The problem is that the gate doesn't release enough to open with the lever itself. When applying enough pressure on the lever to release the gate to open, the adjustment switch fails and the gate ratchets one notch tighter. This happens every time the gate is opened. This has the effect of locking the gate in place, unable to open after two uses.I tried this several times and had other people in the house try as well. No one was able to open the gate without pulling hard enough to override the adjustment switch and locking the gate down tighter.Moreover, I don't think it's a problem with this particular unit. It just looks like a bad design with cheap construction.
