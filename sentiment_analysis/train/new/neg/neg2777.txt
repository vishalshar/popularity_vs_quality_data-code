I ordered two of the extension kits from the seller.  One arrived in an unopened box in new condition.  The second one arrived in a previously opened box with scratches and some paint peeling off the gate.  I contacted the seller to settle the issue but did not get a response.  The extension kits works OK with the gate.  I have some problem lining up the extension kits perfectly with the gate and therefore the gate does not close as smoothly compared to when I did not use the extension kits.  I guess a perfectly opening and closing gate is hard to achieve when the opening is so big and requiring 2 extension kits.
