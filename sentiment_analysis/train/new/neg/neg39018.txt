I ordered this item because my daughter will only eat puree foods from pouches.Here are my thoughts regarding this product:PROS:1. Easy to clean2. Easy to fill3. Basically does the job and has saved me in a pinch when my daughter won't eat finger foodsCONS:1. Because the body of the container is not clear, it is hard to tell how much food is left in the pouch2. The cap is sometimes hard to screw onto the body3. The body is too squishy which can make it inefficient when it comes to squeezing out the food
