VERDICT ABOUT THE SLANTED TRAY:I personally spoke to a customer service rep at OXO who then spoke to the engineers who designed this chair.Verdict: YES the chair is slanted and YES it was done on purpose to be easier for the child to reach food.Personally, although the chair is of extremely good quality, sturdy, and very cute the slanted tray was a deal breaker.Please note this before you purchase. The chair is great, but the tray is quite slanted, slanted enough that things roll towards the child. I found it very annoying. Caveat emptor, it is also a huge pain to put back in the box, so make sure you're ok with a slanted tray. Again, the rest of the chair is wonderful.
