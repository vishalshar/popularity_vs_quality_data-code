I got this for my son when he started potty training to use to get on the potty and help him reach the sink. I was disappointed when I got it because it is so short. I'm sure if I had read the specs carefully I would have realized but I feel like for most kids, it's too short to do much good. There was only about a six month window where he was tall enough to use it but not tall enough to stand on the ground. I was much happier with a similar (and twice as tall) stool from IKEA.
