I have this pump which I got through my insurance plan for free.  I purchased it as a backup to my PISA http://www.amazon.com/Medela-Pump-Style-Advanced-Breast/dp/B004HWXCJS/ref=sr_1_1?s=baby-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1395322760&sr=1-1&keywords=medela+pump.  I have to say it's not as good.  The motor looks the same, but it's not the same.  I know it's not the same because the power adapter is different.  I have to turn the vacuum up higher and pump longer on this one than the PISA.  The higher vaccum level is uncomfortable.  If you're choosing between this one and the PISA, go with the PISA.  I'm on kid #2 with the PISA and it's still going strong.  I barely use this one (model 57065) and I prefer to carry the PISA around even though the bag is bulkier, the motor is better.
