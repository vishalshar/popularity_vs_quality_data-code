These toys kind of stand up, using plastic stands. Within 2 minutes of our first use, my 9 month old had already broken them off. She's not particularly rough with toys and this is the first one she's ever broken. The plastic should be more bendable for babies. It's a great toy otherwise and is very interesting to babies. But, if it breaks when you first use it, there's no point in having it.
