I ordered 2 of these diapers after reading so many great reviews about them. The only problem I have is that they leak ALL of the time! It starts on the inside of the legs and eventually the whole front bottom of the diaper will be soaking wet on the tye dye part. I've tried adjusting the buttons, making sure that the inserts were flat, and using different inserts or an extra newborn insert. I still end up with the same problem no matter what I do! The tye dye part will be wet, leaking on to my daughters clothes and when I pull out the insert, half of it is still dry. We do not have any leaking problems with any of the 4 other brands we have (unless I was careless and left them on her too long).I gave the product 3 stars because I love the colors, they are very pleasing to look at and quickly became everyone's favorite diaper. They are a little on the large side (like my happy heinys), so I'm thinking they will last a long time. But, they have turned into house-only diapers and I have to keep checking to make sure my daughter isn't sitting in a wet diaper. I just do not feel comfortable leaving her in these diapers. Might try to swap them for some bumgenius or blueberry diapers.
