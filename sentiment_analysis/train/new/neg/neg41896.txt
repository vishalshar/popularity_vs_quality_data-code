The Ulubulu Personalized Pacifier Clip (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007IERGBW/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i03?ie=UTF8&psc=1) works well with the Avent Soothie pacifiers but I didn't like it because the clip worked too well.  The clip was way too hard to open.  Every time it was like prying the jaws of life open.  Always almost or did bent or chip a nail.  It made it impractical to use regularly at home.I also bought the JJ Cole Pacifier Clip as a replacement for Ulubulu Personalized Pacifier Clip.  I also thought this one was ok but a little better because the clip was easier to clip on and off. But the clip was VERY shallow and I know once my little one is able to start grabbing and throwing things, the JJ Cole Pacifier clip would not work very well as it can be easily detached.  But it will work for now.  The JJ Cole one is good for home use because if it does get detached, I can always just wash the pacifier but in public it's not very practical.But I have to say that the Ulubulu Personalized Pacifier Clip had a slightly better elastic loop for attachment to the pacifier than the JJ Cole.  The JJ cole elastic wasn't stretchy at all.
