We were hoping this chair would be rugged and easy to clean.  Unfortunately, the rubber cushion that forms the seat and back curled and warped within the first two weeks of owning it, and months later it has never returned to its original shape.  It is still certainly useable, and everything under the rubber is fairly easy to hose off and keep clean, but this was definitely a disappointing purchase.
