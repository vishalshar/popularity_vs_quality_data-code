The concept of this chair was ideal for what we were looking for our 8 month old son.  The chair quality was great and it worked well for a week until I noticed he was getting uncomfortable and would cry whenever we would set him in it.  While he is well under the weight limit for this chair (chair limit 35 lbs.), the leg openings were too small.  We removed the inner layer of stitching to 'open up' the leg spaces more and the stitching holding the center came unraveled. (Pic attached is after we tried to make more room for his legs.)  Knew that was a risk when we tried to make more room for his legs and sadly, the chair has been thrown away.  If your baby has chubby little thighs, grab a tape measure to make sure they're not 11" around before purchasing this chair.  If they are, or are even close in size, would recommend to continue looking at different chairs.
