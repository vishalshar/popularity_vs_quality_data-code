Nice and soft if you roll on them, but not at all durable.  With regular use (getting in and out of bed), my very light toddler was able to cause the seam (somewhere) to rupture. And no, we did not overinflate them at all.  In fact, I feel like they were underinflated.  Didn't even come with a patch for me to fix it.  I did however, contact the company and they sent me a replacement.
