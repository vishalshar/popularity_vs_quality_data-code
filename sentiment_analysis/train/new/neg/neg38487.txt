I purchased this to replace a Baby Bjorn potty seat. Mostly to save money. The Baby Bjorn last us through 2 kids so about 4 years. It finally got a cracked handle so it was time to junk it.My son is 3. He knows how to use the potty all by himself. This includes putting the potty seat down, climbing up and down on his own, etc etc.This seat comes with two plastic pieces that slide onto the seat to adjust to the size of your toilet seat. They are extremely loose and when I tried to adjust it to the proper setting to keep the seat stable the plastic pieces moved to the next setting.I came to the reviews and read that you have to squeeze it to get it on but this would not work for my son. He has past the age of needing help with the potty so I shouldn't have to go into the bathroom each time he needs to go to put the seat on the toilet.I also read the review about the plastic piece getting stuck in the toilet! You seriously would never consider this to be an issue unless you have had to replace a toilet because something was stuck. We have and it isn't fun or cheap! When I saw how loose the pieces were I was really concerned that my son would drop one into the toilet and flush and we'd have to buy ANOTHER replacement toilet.So I sucked it up, returned this one, and paid the extra for the Baby Bjorn. It has no loose pieces. It has a dial that you can adjust to the size of the toilet. Plus it has a handle that is perfect for hanging. I recommend the Baby Bjorn over this seat!
