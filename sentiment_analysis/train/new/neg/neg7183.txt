We love this little bug! The colors are thrown beautifully across the ENTIRE room. Baby girl loves watching how she can change the shapes on the wall by moving it. It makes a fantastic night light (goes off after 45 min.) And because it's somewhat cuddly, we bring it into the bed.Downsides*If you catch one of the pin pricks of light on your eye it is blinding (as I tried to capture in the photo). I worry about my little ones eyes and watch her while she is using it. I also try to keep it on the red setting as much as I can because that is somewhat less bright.*It was also delivered with defects - a dent and a mottled/spotty paint job - which had been covered up by a sticker that it came with.
