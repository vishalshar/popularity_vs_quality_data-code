I thought I was losing my mind when I opened my box from Amazon and inside was a "waterproof bib with sleeves" since I knew I had ordered an "art smock."  Well, turns out, the art smock they're advertising is the EXACT SAME THING as their waterproof bib just with a different name.  Misleading at best.  The "bib" does not serve the purpose for which I intended it.  I wanted an art smock which, in my apparently erroneous vision, covered my daughter's entire torso.  Since this was billed as an "art smock" I didn't even think to look more closely at the picture to see if it wrapped all the way around.  Well, it doesn't.  Cause it's a bib.  *sigh*  So when my daughter is doing art projects with paint or glue and she puts her hands down at her side, all that stuff will still get on her clothes since this only covers her chest and belly.  Am disappointed.  Will return and buy a true art smock.As a bib this would be great though which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.
