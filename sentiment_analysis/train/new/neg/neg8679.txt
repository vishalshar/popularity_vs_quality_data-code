This is probably geared more for transporting wet stuff locally- like on the way home from the pool or nearby lake.  I purchased a couple of these to use on a scuba diving trip, thinking I could use them in case I needed to fly home with wet stuff (bathing suit, dive skin, microfiber towel, etc.)  But on the trip I used them to stuff my wet dive skin in to put in my beach bag- the exterior fabric of sealed wet bag was wet from the moisture of my dive skin inside the bag within a couple hours.  It did keep my whole beach bag from getting drenched, as would have happened if I had just put my dive skin in without the wet bag, but some other items in my beach bag did get wet anyway.It's a good product but didn't work out for what I had planned to use it for.
