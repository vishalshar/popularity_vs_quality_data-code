I tried it on my baby. She just did not like it. Part of it is just the way she sleeps. Ever since she was born, she always raised her hands above her head. If I refused her of doing that in her sleep, she got fussy and woke up. Also, she did not like going to sleep in it. It was tough for me to have her sleep in it.IMO, it is just one of those baby items that may or may not work for your baby. There are tons of those types of baby items.
