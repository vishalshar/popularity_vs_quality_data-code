It does it's job of blocking our cable box, but our daughter (14 months at the time we bought it) was able to get it off within about 3 minutes.  Once she lost interest in pulling it off it does seem to deter her from pushing buttons though.  Although she may have stopped pushing the buttons anyway, hard to say.
