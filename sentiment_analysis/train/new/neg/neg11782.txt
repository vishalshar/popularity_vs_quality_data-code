I love the bumgenius products, but this item caused some trouble for us and I ended up exchanging it for the regular 4.0 diapers.  The prints are adorable, but the tag on the but would end up leaking out pee.  Cotton babies was wonderful and took back my 2 used artist prints in exchange for 2 4.0 pocket all in one diapers.
