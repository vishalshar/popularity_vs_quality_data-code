This gate is perhaps the best looking and best designed gate available, but I had to replace mine right after the year warranty expired.  For the first year, I had no problems.  I even recommended the gate to several people.  Installing the gate was easy, and I was happy it had a small profile.  With a little practice, the gate is fairly easy to open with one hand.  Two hands are needed though to close the gate or to open it without making noise.  The gate makes a loud noise if the release button is not held during opening.  To avoid the noise from opening the gate, I usually just climbed over the gate.  Finally, I like the gate's sturdy build.  There is no way my kids are going to get past it.Unfortunately, the gate broke after 14 months.  The spring inside the gate suddenly came loose and made a loud noise.  If the gate would have broken in the middle of the night, the noise would have woken up the whole house.Even with this problem, I am buying the same gate as a replacement.  I can't find anything else better, and I just hope that the next gate lasts longer.If you do buy this gate, use a credit card like American Express that offers an automated extended warranty.  I am using the extended warranty to pay for a replacement gate.
