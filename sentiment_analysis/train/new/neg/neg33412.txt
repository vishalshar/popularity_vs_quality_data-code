I bought these bottles in addition to the glass agent bottles I recieved for my baby shower. I love that they are glass since a lot of boa free products still leach estrogen or other things int of the food when they are heated. I love the way these bottles look and I like the shape of the nipple. I gave it three stars because I have 2 major problems with these bottles. Number one is that the bottles leak from the screw tops. Also when the milk is warm a lot of times the kids won't screw on tight they just keep popping as I spin the lid. My second problem is that I use the slowest flow of nipple and my daughter still drinks way to fast and chokes. Since buying these I have read a lot of reviews and apparently the flow of the nipple is a common problem. Still these are the best glass bottles that k have encountered so I will continue using them.
