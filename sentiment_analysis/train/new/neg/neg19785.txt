I am very sorry that I am very unhappy with these deodorant "cakes".  First – the smell is almost unpleasant – not at all like delicious fresh oranges or citrus – and secondly they are so ridiculously thin like the size of quarters – have never seen anything like it – I plan on returning them as I will never use them. Very disappointed
