when i found out baby number 3 was a girl i wanted something cute but not too over the top. i got this because it seemd like the best buy. it is very soft. and came in a nice small box. i honestly didnt know what to think when i got such a small box. the only thing i can complain about is the pillow ripped and one of the tyes came off on the bumper. i use the pillow on the changing table the "toy" holder is actaully on the side of the changing table and hold the termomitors and pacifiers and such. the diaper stackers on the other side of the changing table hold almost 2 packs of diapers. havnt put the valance up yet. i like how you can use pink or purple or yellow or green sheets and it all works. and how soft the blanket actually is. nice weight to it too for the colder months.
