UPDATE: baby is now 7.5 months.  these socks almost fit him!  they are still a little big, but he has pretty chubby legs, so i'm glad these are so big.  They look a lot bigger than other socks for this same age range, but most of those are too small anyways.Original review:My 3 month old is average size and he is quickly outgrowing his socks that are supposed to fit until he is 6 or even 12 months.  So I ordered these and they are huge!  I wonder if I was sent the wrong size?  There is no way an average 6 month old will be able to wear these.  I guess I will just put them away until he is big enough and I will be ordering more socks...
