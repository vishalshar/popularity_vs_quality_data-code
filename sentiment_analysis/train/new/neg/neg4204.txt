We bought the City Savvy and the infant carrier because I liked the idea of a smaller travel system, but it really was a waste of money.  My son grew out of the infant carrier after about a month and a half, granted he was a big baby, but still - not that big!  Even in that little time, the fabric got very worn where he would kick his feet and his ankles rubbed.  So we just used the stoller on its own after that which was a nightmare.  It is definitely uncomfortable for anyone over 5'7 (I am 5'9 and my hubbie is 6'3, so really a pain for him).  I travelled with the City Savvy internationally when my son was three months old and that was a huge mistake.  It takes two hands no matter what to fold this stroller and the lock is so complicated it is impossible to explain how to do it to anyone trying to help.  Impossible to steer with one hand also.  It won't fold unless the front wheels are aligned all the way back, so you have to tip it back to get it to close properly.  Again, impossible with one hand and very frustrating.  The plastic lock is pretty flimsy too, so if it isn't closed just right, you'll bend the plastic.  The City Savvy is still fairly bulky once folded and the bottom bin is worthless because a plastic bar runs under the stoller blocking you from putting anything more than a small purse inside.  I did give it two stars because I liked the color, the stroller fabric is actually pretty decent, the carrier strap makes it easy to sling over your shoulder, and the recline is fully adjustable making nap time easy.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS STROLLER IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE IT WITH ONE HAND the description is competely false in that regard.  If you want reclining light weight stroller, there are much better options out there!
