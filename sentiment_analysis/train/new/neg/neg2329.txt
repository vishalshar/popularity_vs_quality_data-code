I love this toy and so does my 4 monthly old daughter. It keeps her occupied in the car and easily distracted while we are driving (she is not a huge fan of being in the car). I gave this such a low rating because the loop on the sun suction that is illustrated in the picture which allows you to connect the caterpillar to the sun was not there! There was NO WAY to attach the mobile to the suction arm! I had to rig up a way to connect them with some durable string and while I was able to get it connected and put in the car for my daughter to love its still pretty lame that such an essential part was missing... If I were to see this in a store and could be sure that all parts were present I would buy this toy again and would recommend it to friends... but don't buy it online, go to Target and get it there instead.
