Our son would not take a bottle and some of the other reviews had luck giving their babes milk from this cup vs. a bottle. We tried several times around the 7 month but no luck. As soon as he would knock it (and lacking the control that a baby does, this was basically all the time) the milk would come out. Might be a fine product for toddlers, but it didn't work for us for this purpose.
