These aren't worth $20 for defective pieces. One of the flanges leaks and doesn't work properly. There isn't an option to exchange them and even though I want to return them, I can't because I'm starting work and need to pump. I'm just going to use the one that works and figure out an alternate solution. Don't want to spend anther $20 for defective parts.
