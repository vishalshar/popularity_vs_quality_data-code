The customer service is terrible although the design of the product is great! The quality control is poor as another user commented. My City Mini was delivered to me on 8th March. Just couldn't believe that one screw is flat (no thread at all) and dropped off from the canopy connector. I phoned them and a guy asked me to send him email but never got reply. I phoned them again two days ago, they tried to connect me to the same guy, but no one picked up the phone. I phoned one more time and asked someone else to help, same story, asking me to send email. But the email can never go through from my gmail account. I got another number from their website, and sent email to their customer service, finally got through, but was replied: Your email has been received. Please allow up to 3 business days for a response. We are travelling soon. Its totally a nightmare!
