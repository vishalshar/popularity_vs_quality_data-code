This is great for night. Super soft and the insert is absorbant. My low rating is only because if you used the duo wraps only you'd have to by a lot...BC once they get wet you have to change the whole diaper. I like the plain wraps because I find it easier to chang the insert. But may get note for nights...not as bulky as some or having to use two inserts
