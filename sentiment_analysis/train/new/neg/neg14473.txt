We have enjoyed the boon bath products in our tub for about a year.I figured I'd try these because my little one didn't have an toys that squirted water & you can take them apart to clean them. I've noticed it is very hard to find squirting toys that can be cleaned easily.  The only reason I didn't give this product more stars is because they are very hard to squeeze to get the water to squirt. Since I have a hard time my little one can't do it by himself.These are great for little hands to grab, have different textures, & eas to clean.I would probably buy these again.
