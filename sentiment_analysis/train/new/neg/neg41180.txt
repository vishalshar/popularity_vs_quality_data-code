Let me preface this by saying that the concept is great but the execution is a complete and utter failure. I have a 10 month old that is pulling herself up, tripping and falling all over the place. I desperately wanted something that would protect the edges of the coffee table but I didn't want to buy those adhesive types of guards in fear that it would damage the wood on my coffee table. I thought that this might be a great solution! OMG - what a waste of time. I should have listened to the other negative reviews on here but thought I'd give it a try. The amount of time and money I wasted on this was staggering.I diligently measured my coffee table per the instructions, to make sure I ordered the correct size. The first one i ordered was too small and I ended up ripping the damn thing trying to get it on and then the second one I got was clearly WAY too big. Although it indicates a 141-192" span, the damn thing sags and most certainly does not offer any sort of protection for an unsteady baby. My daughter was able to pull the thing off when she pulled herself up! This product might work if you have the perfectly sized coffee table but who knows what that actual measurement would be. I would never recommend this product and unfortunately I'll be turning to those adhesive strips that I was looking to avoid.
