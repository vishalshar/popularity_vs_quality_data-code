Mine delaminated after 10 months of regular washing. I emailed their customer service and was told they wouldn't replace it or issue a refund because they say it should only be washed in cold/warm water. That's ridiculous.PUL (polyurethane laminate: the waterproof fabric used for cloth diapers) should be able to withstand regular hot washes and only defective PUL delaminates. Kissaluvs customer service told me their pail liner fabric is "very different from other pail liners so it may react differently than another brand". I don't know if that means they used a fabric other than PUL, or just an inferior quality PUL.I also noticed it seems to be sewn with the stretch going from top to bottom so when it's hanging from the top of a diaper pail and the bottom is full of heavy diapers, the knit side of the fabric stretches and puts extra strain on the laminate side, especially around the top, which is where the laminate started cracking and flaking off on mine.
