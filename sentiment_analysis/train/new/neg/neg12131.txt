Similar to what other reviewers have mentioned, the material is extremely thin.  After the first wash, it feels like it won't last very long.  It however, did fit my bassinet mattress.  So I'm willing to give it a try in hopes that a waterproof quilted bassinet size fitted mattress pad cover underneath it will help with more softness.
