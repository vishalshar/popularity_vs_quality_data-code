This storage box is huge! My 4 year old loved the design and immediately started storing things in it. Unfortunately within the first 2 weeks the stitching on the lid came off and now it's hanging half way onto the box. Luckily we know our way around a sewing machine and will stitch up the portion that has came off and probably give it some reinforcement where it hasn't.
