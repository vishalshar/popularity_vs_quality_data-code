I bought these bibs and the Bumpkins Jr. Bib for my 2-yr old toddlers at the same time. While this bib is fine in many cases, I like the Bumpkins Jr, bib much better. Both wash easily, wear well, have easy velcro closures and have pockets to catch food. The big difference is that these bibs are so lightweight that they don't always stay in place well. So, when eating a messy meal, we'll often end up with some food on the clothes these were supposed to protect. The Bumpkins bibs have arm holes to keep them in place so they protect the clothes better. (I also have a pair of long-sleeve Bumpkin bibs for really messy meals like spaghetti and baked beans.) I keep these green sprout bibs as back-ups for when my other bibs haven't dried from their last cleaning or for less messy meals. Also, the Bumpkin bibs have designs that my kids get excited about, which helps get them to wear bibs.I'd recommend these bibs for younger kids, less messy eaters and travel.
