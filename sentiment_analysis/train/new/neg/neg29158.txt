I have tried various cloth diapers and these are by far the WORST! They leak, the plastic part is a separate layer inside the pocket - and it has come apart in less than 6 months of use. There are no leg size adjustment snaps. They are terrible. I contacted the company with my complaints and they said all they could do is refund me  $3 out of the $35 I spent on their diapers. RIP OFFI regret buying these diapers. The customer service just ignored me and I was too late to file an A to Z claim.Buy Alva diapers instead. $4 - $5 a piece, 1 cent shipping, and a lot of items ship from California, so you only have to wait a week for your diapers, not a month and a half from China.See my photo.
