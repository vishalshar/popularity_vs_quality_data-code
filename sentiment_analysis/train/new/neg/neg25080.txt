Well I received these today. After opening the package and using the snaps once, I have already broke one of the snaps to alter the size of the rise. The part on the inside of the diaper broke from the snap part on the outside of the diaper. I doubt these will last very long, but I guess you get what you pay for. I would classify them more as gender neutral, except for the purple color; it is close to a royal purple. I have a boy on the way, and this shade is a little feminine (I will still use it though). I wonder if the gender neutral colors would be more for a boy.  I will be taking the others that I added on my baby registry off now. The quality is definitely poor, and for a little bit more money per diaper there are better options. The inserts however, feel like they will be absorbent: they have a towel-like texture to them.
