This rain hood is a great concept but the cheap plastic tears easily with normal use. Ours lasted about a week before the Velcro ties ripped off. The corners should be cloth, not plastic, in order to withstand stress. Otherwise, it protects your child nicely from both rain and wind and fits snugly over the Expedition stroller.
