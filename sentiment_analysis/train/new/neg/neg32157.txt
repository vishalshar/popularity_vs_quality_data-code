As with many other reviews, one of the tassels fell off on the first night. My granddaughter wasn't overly distressed, but I couldn't be bothered to send the pillow back, so now feel obliged to buy some pink thread and sew all five tassels on, tight. Other than that, it's cute, and perfect for those baby teeth.
