First off, I like the light weight material it's soft, very thin almost like parachute fly sheet material, and very durable. The workmanship is excellent, very very well stitched together and does not look cheap. (I also have Econobum and Flip covers and those look cheap by comparison). The style is very well thought out, I like how the gussets around the legs are designed to keep messes within. However two very big hangups I got. First the velcro is horrible! I thought Applix is bad enough this is worse! It's weak and does not stick no matter how firmly you've pressed them together. I've used Kushies Lite diapers for my elder child and this Kushies diaper cover velcro is not the same as the Lite as I thought it would be. Secondly, the fit is completely weird. This Kushies Wrap will fit a baby around 14-15 lbs (I'm reviewing for the 10-22lbs small size), average height, big round tummy with skinny legs. Come on which skinny-legged baby will have a rotund belly, it's highly likely the one with rotund belly would be chunky all over including legs.Another thing I noticed is that with a prefold or with a fitted diaper it tends to bulk up a LOT. Ideally if your baby has chunky thighs, try using a slimmer soaker like the Flip insert. The trouble with slim inserts is that it tends to bunch and twist out of place because like what the other reviews mentioned there aren't pockets or flaps to keep it intact.Will not recommend nor will I buy again. The super low price of $7.49 IS JUST NOT WORTH IT.
