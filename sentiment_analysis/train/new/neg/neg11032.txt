I truly wanted this carrier to work for us, but it simply did not.MAJOR CONS:- At 5'4" with a petite upper half, the straps are nearly cinched to the max. This should be an issue, but it causes the straps to bunch and twist regularly. In order for even the basic positions to be comfortable, I have to readjust and fuss with the straps ALOT. It's ridiculous. I'm not that small of a person, although that would be nice. ;)This seems to be a design flaw. Since the straps must be repositionable for the different positions, they are attached by lacing the foam-filled straps through sortof... backpack heavy duty strapping. But, they don't really snap or tightly secure down the length of the foam strap, so they twist and the security strap gets misalligned. Again, I have tried to include a photo to better explain.- The side position is as or more painful than simply carrying my son on the hip on my own. It's a joke. And my son loves being on the hip, so I was really really hoping this would work.- As another reviewer mentioned, the instructions, both paper and video via website are almost laughable bad. I wanted to make sure my straps were not mixed up because I thought, surely, something must be my fault that these are twisting and so frustrating, but the photos and videos are not detailed enough for me to verify.I have read no reviews mentioning the issue I had, but it seems to be a design flaw, so I figure many parents just toss this aside when it doesn't work for them. Or I am just terrible at this, but I really dont' think so. I spent a good month with this carrier and fussed with it over too many baby naps. Too much valuable time has been spent on this already.
