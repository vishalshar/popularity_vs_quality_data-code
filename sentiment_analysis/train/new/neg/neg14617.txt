These things annoy me pretty frequently because of how flimsy they are.  Maybe it's by design, but its just weird getting things to snap back together.  Its just cheap feeling... very cheap feeling..Also, one of the containers have this compartment that folds out from the bottom... which is also annoying.  Its made worse because you're doing all of this snapping and swinging with wet parts spilling all over the place.  It's messy and awkward.The round thing seems to waste a whole bunch of space, I assume its the perfect design for something specific, but I have not figured out what that is just yet.We bought this item to help with Dr Brown's bottles, and it does very little to help.. nothing fits anywhere and I'm always just rigging stuff in there.Save your money..
