I purchased these for our newborn since she was using the soothie pacifier.  These were the first bottles she used, and I loved how convenient they were.  We took a long road trip and the little canister that attaches to the bottom and holds the formula made bottle making so easy!  Unfortunately, these gave our baby bad tummy aches.  She had extremely frequent gas as well.  We decided to try a different bottle, and within one day her issues were gone and she was the happiest baby.  She still is!  Also, the nipples are so large, they rub on the babies nose while feeding.  So, for convenience, they are wonderful, but for the little bellies, not so great.  I would not recommend them.
