I have purchased many of the Dr Browns bottles.  As others have stated, these purple bottles tend to leak.  I discovered it is because of the white piece that fits into the tube as part of the vent system.  Luckily I have extra of those pieces from 4oz bottles that we used.  Using the other pieces seem to help solve the dilemma.
