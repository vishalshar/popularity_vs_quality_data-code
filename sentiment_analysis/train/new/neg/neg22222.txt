I bought this item and the Miracle Blanket - Periwinkle Blue at the same time. Initially, I thought the SwaddleMe looked easier to use and was clearly was cheaper, but I find that I am using the Miracle Blanket almost exclusively. The two velcro tabs on the SwaddleMe are harder to manipulate than I thought they would be, especially with a struggling baby, and swaddling several times a day. In my opinion the Miracle Blanket is overall simpler to use.  The Miracle Blanket accommodates all sizes, so it can adjust to baby's growth, and may be a better purchase/gift if you don't know how big the baby will be. Both of these items leave room for baby's legs to move, which is good. (Supposedly, restricting leg movement puts the baby at risk for abnormal hip development.) Don't forget Dr. Karp's DVD The Happiest Baby on the Block - The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Baby Sleep Longer (DVD) because swaddling is only one of several steps to calming your baby. This is my second baby and so far, it's been a much better experience than with my firstborn. I didn't know about these techniques back then and my first baby's constant inconsolable crying made me absolutely miserable.
