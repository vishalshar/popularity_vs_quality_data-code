I bought this carrier concurrent with a Maya Wrap Ring Sling.  I learned how to use the Ring Sling with great results, but could not get the hang of this.  Obviously, many people love it, but I wanted to put my two cents in that I didn't love it.  I found it extremely uncomfortable and difficult to use.  I just could not find my stride with this thing and it have snaps all over the place and adjustments everywhere that just make it more confusing and bulky.  I think I got it on properly once as it felt quite nice, but then I could not find that groove again.  Unfortunately, I missed the window to return this item and now I am stuck with it.  I'll probably just donate it to the local baby carrier chapter and hope someone has better luck with it.
