I purchased the Thermos FOOGO Phases Sippy Cup (stainless steel), as well as the Safe Sippy Cup (stainless steel), and the Kleen Kid Kanteen stainless steel zippy cup for my 12-month old baby. Of the three cups, I'd rate Thermos as #1, Safe Sippy as #2 and Kleen Kanteen as #3. Here's why:- Handles: the Thermos and Safe Sippy both have handles, which makes holding the cup so much easier for my 12-month-old. The Kleen Kanteen is the hardest for baby to hold. Kleen Kanteen doesn't have handles or a rubber coating on the outside (like the Safe Sippy) and the Kleen Kanteen is a bit too wide for my baby to get a good grip. Plus, since the Kleen Kanteen has that awkward ring at the top of the spout, I feel like I have to hold the Kleen Kanteen upside down for baby to get a good drink.- Spout: the Thermos has a soft silicon spout while the Safe Sippy and the Kleen Kanteen have hard plastic spouts. Especially for babies just transitioning to a sippy, I think the rubbery spout is nicer.- Lids: Neither the Thermos nor the Safe Sippy have lids, so they leak all over the diaper bag (and I think Safe Sippy leaked the most in my bag). The Kleen Kanteen does have a lid, so it doesn't leak in my bag, but the lid is a small, clear cover that doesn't stay attached to the cup (like many other Kleen Kanteen caps do), so I'm sure I'll lose this cap in the near future.- Leaks: they all leak, especially when they hit the floor at warp speed after being flung from the highchair.
