This Phillips pacifier copies the Children's Medical Ventures pacifier design, the one given by hospitals after a newborn is delivered. We purchased the Phillips pacifier in case our newborn rejected other types. But we can already say, the Phillips pacifier isn't the same as the one issued to us by the hospital. The Phillips pacifier does not have the cutout in front of the nose, and even the slightest amount of extra plastic makes it heavier. Also, we are big on clean air and always monitor our CO2 levels. Poor CO2 levels is something that could easily cause SIDS. While the Phillips design doesn't make it drastic, it does increase it. The blockage of CO2 completing escaping the pacifier before inhaling is something we think about, because infants inhale and exhale so rapidly. This pacifier would be used as a last resort. The original overall hospital design is the one to consider, as our newborn gagged on other pacifiers after delivery, except for the hospital type.
