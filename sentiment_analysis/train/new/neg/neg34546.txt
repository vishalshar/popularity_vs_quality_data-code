This is too small for a normal adult sized toilet seat. It has a hard plastic ring on the bottom to keep the child seat inside the normal seat, but there's too much room and it slides around.  My 2 year old shifted her weight and fell off the toilet a couple of times.  The seat is vinyl over a foam core and is not very well made.  After a few months the top of the seat has cracked in two places where her legs would rest.
