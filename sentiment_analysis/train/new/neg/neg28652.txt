I determined to get this one as it's organic. the cotton come off easily.Not only my daughter got some in her mouth,but also cotton is left all over the carrier. I got a Beco black carrier. As you can image,the carrier ended up looking kinda nasty with cotton all over. it's definitely not worth to pay for this.
