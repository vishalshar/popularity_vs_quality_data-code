This booster seat is nice and soft and sits at a good height.  Believe what you have read - the straps really are oddly positioned and easily come out of the holes they slide through. Considering how expensive this is, I would have liked the straps to be better attached.  Also, I recommend a darker color. We purchased the aqua color and you need to wipe tomato sauces and red/orange jellos, etc.  off quickly to avoid discoloration as the soft rubber is porous.  But it is cute and modern looking and if you clean it quickly it works very well.
