I purchased this mattress through amazon warehouse deals.The condition was new.  However,  the sticker on mattress says foam is made of 92% urethane, 8% rayon.  There is no mention of plant based oils, if any, used to manufacture foam like the description for the item says.  The only indication the cover is organic is a cardboard sign.  There is no stitching on cover that states it is organic.Very disappointing since I waited seven days to receive the item and then I have to send it back.
