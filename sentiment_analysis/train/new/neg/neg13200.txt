I was debating between a Maclaren Triumph, Uppa baby G Lite and a Chicco lite. I wanted a stroller that reclines because my baby loves to snooze during rides and something in the $200 budget. At the store the recommendation was for the Maclaren because it came with a lifetime warranty and was more durable.When I came home, I realized I couldn't open the buckle with one hand and even with two it was too hard.I am planning on returning it and buying the G-Luxe in the next few days.This is the first time I am writing a review. I appreciate so much the reviews I read here before purchasing something especially ones for my baby. So it is my turn to share my thoughts!
