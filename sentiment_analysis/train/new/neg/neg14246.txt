Who on EARTH designed this for an infant, toddler, or a preschooler?Our baby is now 9.5 months old - and she STILL doesn't fit in this chair.This chair is for a CHILD who must be something around 10 years old.  For a GIANT.  You need about 6 inches - NO KIDDING of more height for the child seat relative to the tray where they eat!Who would design this.  This is terrible.  It does adjust.  That's great.  It adjusts - so when your kid is old enough and tall enough to sit in this chair - you can remove the tray and adjust the height of the overall high chair to fit up to your own table - what ever table height that is.  Unfortunately - I really really hope that if you kid is old enough to fit in this chair - he/she can SIT in a real chair right at the table.It does also recline... great for a 1 month or younger ... but 1 month or younger babies - are not eating solid foods.  Hello!  So it DOESN'T actually sit perfectly straight up either!  So your child is always sort of leaning back... this is TERRIBLE for a baby who is learning to eat finger foods.  Ideally you would want your infant who is learning to eat finger food to lean his head forward not backward and spit out the food.  Don't get me wrong - I don't mean that the kid should be able to lean forward and fall - but a permanent lean backwards is undesireable in a high chair.Don't be like us, don't waste your money on this horrible design.
