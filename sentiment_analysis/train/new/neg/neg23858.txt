With my first I had a stackable formula dispenser; each piece comes apart and you can stack up to five. I thought that it was a little big in my purse so I decided to try this one instead.Pros:- Easy to clean- The top swivels easily.- Holds enough formula for an 8 ounce bottle- Doesn't take up much room in my purseCons:- Not all the formula comes out at once and I'm constantly tapping it to get the formula out. With the stackable one I didn't have that issue.- The siding is green, so I can't always tell if all of the formula has come out.I do like this formula dispenser, I pre-measuere the formula and have it ready to go when my little one is ready to eat. However, the only downside is that with the stackable one has the hole is in the middle and all of the formula seems to come out at one time. The formula for this one gets caught on the sides.I'll keep using this dispenser at home, but when we are out and about I'll use the stackable one.
