I use the head piece in the car seat and in our rocker/bouncer chair to provide additional head support, so I like that it's two separate parts. It's been pretty warm, so the body support part is too hot for the car seat in the summer time (the head support is really too hot as well, but the infant support that came with the car seat is not sufficient to keep the baby's head steady).
