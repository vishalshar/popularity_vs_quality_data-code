It is a very interesting concept, but is not an ideal piece of luggage. There is nothing in the case to make things stay in place on either half of the case. Also, if a kid decides to ride it, it has a tendency to tip forward despite the little protrusion that is supposed to prevent the tipping. Also, if you are a family of more than one kid, do yourself a favor, either buy one for each kid or do not buy at all. The last thing one needs on a long international journey is two kids fighting over a piece of luggage.
