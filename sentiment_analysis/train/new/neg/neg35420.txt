My husband and I bought this gate to keep our small dog in the kitchen and out of trouble while we were at work. I liked the fact that we could pressure mount it since we rent our apartment, and we wouldn't have to put any holes in the walls. Well we tested it out yesterday, when we went out to dinner, and came home to find this... Our 15 lb. miniature pinscher had broken through the gate at the joint and wreaked havoc on our carpet. (He did a number on the trash too.) This gate may have worked well without the expansion piece(s), but with them, it's just not sturdy enough to fend off an escape artist such as my dog (or presumably a smart toddler). I will be returning this item in exchange for a kennel.
