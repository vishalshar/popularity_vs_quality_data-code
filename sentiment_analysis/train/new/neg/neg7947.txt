We got this for our 2.5 year old son when we had baby #2. He will ride on it which makes outings much easier without having to whip out the double stroller which is much heavier and more difficult for me to get in and out of our SUV.  Can't do something like Disney with this but for an outing to the park or lunch with friends this works fine. There's a little clip to raise it out of the way when not in use.You do have to raise the handle on the stroller all the way up to allow room for their head to poke through. This meant getting rid of the parent console so there's no where to put a drink or your phone. And yes you can't do a full stride with this since the board is taking up some of that space. But I'm only 5'5" so not a big deal for me.The more annoying part is that one side keeps coming off, not while my son is riding, but while it is up not being used. So I have to constantly fix it. Also, it doesn't allow the stroller to open and close as smoothly. Once it even got stuck and the stroller came landing down hard on my foot. I did have a hook attached to the stroller for holding shopping bags, etc. and that's what it got stuck on.So overall, it does what it sets out to do, it gives my toddler a place to ride while pushing the baby in the uppababy. You just have to be tolerant of the little annoyances that go along with it
