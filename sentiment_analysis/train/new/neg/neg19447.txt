I have ordered these in the past and was pleased.  In the past, the filters were shipped in original Red Cross boxes (pictured) appearing as if they came directly from the company.  This time I ordered 5 filters expecting the same outcome.  However,this time when I ordered, the product arrived in zip lock bags without any Red Cross affiliation or packaging. It appeared as if someone had cut the filter to the appropriate size, placed it in the plastic bag, set it in a brown shipping box and charged me for it.  I returned 4 of the five and kept one just to try.  It did work, however I was not comfortable using the filter based on how it had been packaged.
