We have bought a lot of the First Years products because they seem well thought out and a good value.  The bassinet is very attractive and the light, sounds and vibration features are great.  There are three drawbacks for parents using this product mainly as a bassinet: 1) it could be a safer design 2) it takes some time to put together and you must read the directions very carefully 3) the bassinet while portable, is rather heavy.1) The bassinet sags because it folds in the middle and is supported by two pieces rather than one.  I feel this is very unsafe.  I'm not one for jerryrigging things but being exhausted and not necessarily wanting to dismatle the bassinet after taking 2 hours to put it together, I had my local hardware store cut a thin piece of plywood that I put in the bassinet for added support using the mattress pad as a template.  This solved the sagging issue but First Years needs to fix this problem.  It's probably an easy fix by doing something like I did in plastic so it is lighter.  Also, I wish they had used the mesh "bumper" for the entire bassinet rather than the top third.  I am always having to position my daughter just so to make sure her head is in the mesh part.2) You must read the directions.  Spend some time looking at the diagram of all the pieces and where they go before following the directions.  If I did this at the beginning, it probably would have only taken me about and hour to put together.  Also, it will go faster if you have two people since there were a few places where it would have been helpful to have someone hold the pieces in place while I screwed them down.The bassinet is about as heavy as a car seat but less compact.  I would say it is probably 12 to 15 lbs with my 8 lb newborn in it (sans plywood).
