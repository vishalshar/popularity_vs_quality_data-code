We got this for our daughter and took it to the hospital when she was born.  It is cute and you can take the sound box out of the bear, which we did, and attach it by velcro to railings such as the baby bed at the hospital.  It sounds great but it won't stay on.  It lasts for about ten minutes and then it stops, usually right as you or baby are almost asleep, leaving a deafening silence.  Then you have to reach over and bump it to make it come back on, over and over.  Tedious!!  Also, the batteries ran out after less than a week of use and as they dd it just got quieter and quieter. We found much better results for the same price when a friend gave us the Homedics sound maker and projector:Homedics SS-3000 Soundspa Lullaby, WhiteThis not only plugs in, wth NO automatic shut-off, but also has several sound settings as well as beautiful and colorful discs that project wherever you aim the device (wall, sofa back, bassinet cover, etc.).  Our baby has watched it since she was three weeks old. I  highly recommend this instead of the bear!!
