I really love this product when it works - I bought four of them and it seems like a puzzle to try to get a top and a bottom that go on the bottle correctly.  I have even resorted to numbering them.  Shouldn't this be universal?  I have had it stick several times and it gets messy.  That said - it is an awesome product when it works, great for travelling or on the road dining when you do not have time to deal with the mess.
