Nice concept and it reminds me of the character Toad from Mario Brothers when my son wears it, but unfortunately my son hated it. He tears it off at the earliest chance and even when I distract him he will only keep it on for a few minutes. Overall product is not bad but don't bother if your child hates anything on his/her head. You can adjust the strap under the chin and the cushion is quite thick so I would have confidence in my son walking around. But since my son hates it and he just about mastered walking steadily, I don't use it any more. Overall, the product is good but not useful for me and it doesn't appear like it is easy to wash.
