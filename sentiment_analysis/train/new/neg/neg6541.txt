I've been hunting for a new diaper bag, something a little sleeker, nicer, but different, and MESSENGER style -- yes, I've been looking for months. I finally found this Eleanor line and love, love, love them.  The bag arrived today and I was surprised by how large and bulky the bag is.  It's the largest diaper bag I've ever owned.  It's very nice, colors are great, strap seems sturdy and strong.  But I'll likely return it b/c it's just more bag than I need.  If I were just starting out with a new baby, it would be great.
