The waterproof part melted in my dryer. Dried on low heat as recommended and came out scrunched together and when I tried to pull it apart it ripped all of the waterproof backing off.I recommend air drying if you don't want to risk this. In my opinion, who has time to air dry crib mattress covers when you may need to swap them out ASAP!?
