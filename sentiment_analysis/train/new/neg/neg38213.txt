I would definitely NOT recommend this bouncer to anyone.  The feet do not stay in place and will twist out of place every time the bouncer is moved.  The wire frame feels flimsy and the music unit presses up through the seat directly under where a babys legs would be.  The toy bar will detach with the slightest pull, so it is not possible to carry the bouncer around by holding the toy bar when the baby is not in it; you have to lean down and pick up the entire thing.  It is difficult to adjust from one position to another, and the lowest position leaves a baby almost laying completely flat.  The music unit is very difficult to insert and keeps falling out of my bouncer.  The fabric is thin and feels cheap.  The bouncer itself is very lightweight and cheap feeling overall.  I would not feel comfortable leaving a baby over a few months old, or one that can move around, in this bouncer as the bouncer could easily become unstable with the feet out of place and the wire frame is so light that it practically just gives way to the slightest weight or pressure.
