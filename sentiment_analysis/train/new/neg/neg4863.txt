Necklace came quickly and looks great on my son.  Unfortunately it hasn't helped his teething issues.  I went through his 1st two teeth coming in without the necklace and now his next are on their way, and his symptoms seem the same.  Lots of drooling, fussiness and harder to settle to sleep at bed time.  I've left it on 24/7 even in the bath and when he sleeps, but doesn't seem to be helping him. I'm still going to keep it on him, as you just never know, plus I want to do everything I can to help with his pain and discomfort. But looks like teething tablets and baby tylenol will still be on the menu.
