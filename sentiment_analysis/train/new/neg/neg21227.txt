I bought this item for my 4-month old to use for summertime sleeping.  Size small fit appropriately, I liked the lightweight material and the pattern (reptiles), and I liked the option of the zipper pulling down from the neck or up from the feet.  BUT, when I tried to take it off of my son, the upper zipper stuck - I was fortunately able to pull it off by pulling the lower zipper up to get his body out before pulling it over his head.  One of the teeth on the zipper was broken, so I sent it back to amazon for a replacement.  Unfortunately, when I pulled the replacement sack out of the packaging, the zipper was jammed and wouldn't even unzip.  I returned it again and purchased a different brand.  If the zipper had worked, this could have been great purchase.
