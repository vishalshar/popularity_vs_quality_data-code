I just received the snuggle bub wrap. I ordered the small size for my 8 month old baby and immediately tried it out in our stroller with him inside. His feet were almost touching the bottom of the wrap! He is regarding his lenght in the 85th to 90th percentile. If you have a long baby spare yourself the hassle of returning and go straight for the larger size. Here on the amazon site it says size small is for up to 2 years but on the actual packaging it says up to 18 months. I also imagined the lambswool to be softer and the outside fabric attracts a lot of fuzz (petowners beware). Since the quality is not so nice I would recommend getting this item on sale (a real sale, not the 5-cents-of-the-original-prize kind of sale). It does look nice though. Will return mine for a larger size.
