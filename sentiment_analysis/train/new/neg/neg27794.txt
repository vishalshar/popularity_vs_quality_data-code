These are double sided and one side is 100% organic cotton as advertised. The other side is 100% polyester which is mentioned nowhere in the product description, about product section or photo. This seems to be intentionally misleading. The quality is fine but I was not expecting a polyester wipe. Fleece can be made from many materials including cotton. If you refer to your product as "organic cotton double wipes . . . made from luxurious certified organically grown cotton" the expectation is that these are all cotton.
