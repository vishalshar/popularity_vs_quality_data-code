I could not be more disappointed with this stroller.  The design is great, but the quality is very poor and the company's warranty service is very slow.  We experienced the following defects, all within the first year of ownership:- Broken buckle- Defective wheel axle locking mechanism- Broken brake assembly (sheared rivet that made the brake non-functional)Each defect required a replacement part to be shipped to us, and because it was under warranty, it was free of charge.  Customer service was great, and it was easy to process the claim.  However, there were severe delays in the arrival of replacement parts.  One item shipped pretty quickly, one item took three weeks, and one item still has not arrived after over five weeks (the comapny cited problems with their warehouse as the cause of the delay; I've been told to expect a further delay).  Because I bough this 'lemon' from a retailer and not Phil&Teds, they won't give me a refund.  Anyone that needs a double stroller can ill afford to go over two months without their $600 investment, and because of these issues, I strongly regret this purchase and would warn anyone to stay away form this brand's products.
