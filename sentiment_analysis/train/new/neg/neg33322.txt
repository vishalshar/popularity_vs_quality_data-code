I purchased this waterproof flat portacrib mattress pad to fit over the Naturepedic minicrib mattress (I have a Dream on Me 3 in 1 mini crib).  Even after washing and drying (as per instructions), the mattress pad is still too big, so I cannot get a good fit with fitted sheets, which causes the mattress pad to bunch up, which isn't safe.  This is a pad, too, so there are no elastics to hold the pad to the mattress, so you need to have it fit well to keep it in place.  The quality of the pad is good, cotton flannel and mid-weight, but I cannot give it more stars because it really doesn't fit on the mattress well.  This is surprising to me, because you would think that the pad and mattress would go well together, since they are from the same company.  I have a regular size Naturepedic crib mattress and waterproof mattress pad, and they are great.  I  wish the quality of their mini crib mattress and pad were the same as the standard size crib mattress and pad, but they're not.  Unfortunately, I can't even return the mattress pad because I have already washed it.  I suppose I will have to use it as a changing pad, just to get some use out of it. Update: I contacted Naturepedic, and they offered to send me a new mattress pad cover, because it is supposed to shrink to fit. But, I think the real problem is that it will never fit well due to the lack of elastics, so I'm not going to use the pad on the mattress anyway.  They should just redesign the pad.
