I guess you get what you pay for... The outer polka dot cloth that these are covered in is extremely cheap and thin as well as rough in texture (sorta burlap-ish), inside solid green fabric reminds me of those disposable blue paper-cloths that hospitals use (but not as soft)...exterior also looks a lot more faded in color than the pictures show. The piping on the edges was brighter; more lime green and doesn't quite match the outer/main polka dot fabric. Inside seems to be cardboard pieces.Things I did like: they fold nicely, they have a stabilizing insert for the bottom, said insert had a tab/loop to make it easier to pull out and collapse again if needed, for a set of three the price was right!FYI: These are graduated in size. They match reasonably well with Summer Ultra plush changing pad color in green (#92330?) and with lighter green color in Skip Hop Tree Friends Crib Bedding.All of that said, I am waiting to see how they looks on the nursery changing table before sending them back. Also other similar looking cubes I've found online run $15-20 EACH...forget buying 3 pieces at those prices! Not sure how much better the quality of the more expensive ones are...I'd be interested to see one in person for comparison purposes.
