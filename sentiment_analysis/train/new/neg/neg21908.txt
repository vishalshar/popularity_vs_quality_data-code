The pink flamingos arrived without legs.  I did read some of the reviews and at least one mentioned that his also arrived without legs but I just chalked it up to an isolated incident.  I now believe that this outlet is unfit for further business and suggest Amazon take action.I'll be constructing some legs with scrap metal lying around the house.  Mine will probably be better quality anyway.I'd suggest you buy from someone else.
