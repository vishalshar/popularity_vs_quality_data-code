I was very excited to order this product，ordered two 6 pc sets. And today finally we received them ，as soon as my husband opened one of the package，one “foot ”of a piece fell out of the box already！ We had to take that piece off，and then it means we had to take another piece off because if not，they wouldn't connect as there was an “extra ” piece！ （they were both screw driver pcs ）While we were working on it I found that again another piece 's got a broken “foot ” too，other than it wasn't  “disabled ” .I didn't bother to return it or for an exchange，just disappointed.
