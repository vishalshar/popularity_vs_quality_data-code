I was excited to receive this item for my daughter, because it seemed it would be a great transition from bottle to a more traditional sippy cup.  I also liked the detachable handles and lid, as these would both be great for on-the-go use.However, we had a somewhat frightening experience the first time we used the product, and have since returned it.  After my daughter had been drinking from the cup for a little while, she smiled at me and I noticed a large red chunk of something on her lips, and another in her mouth.  I immediately wiped off/fished out the stuff, and discovered that it was pieces of the soft rubbery coating from the lid!  Apparently she had been chewing on the lid and the coating came right off, in little chunky flakes.  I'm sure it's unlikely that a single piece would come off large enough to be a true choking hazard, but it's possible.  And choking hazard or not, I certainly don't want to worry about my daughter ingesting this rubber stuff.If your child isn't prone to chewing on things, maybe this cup is fine; it definitely has some great reviews from other parents.  But for my teething daughter, it's not worth the risk.I'll try to upload some photos so show the damage.  By the way, Amazon was great in accepting our return (they always are).
