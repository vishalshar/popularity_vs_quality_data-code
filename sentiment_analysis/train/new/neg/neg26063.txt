The appliques are supposed to be "repositionable". They stuck to the wall nicely and looked great. My son decided to move a couple of them to change the scene and they peeled off nicely. However, they would not stick back on the wall. This was only the first time we have tried to move them.It's perfect for a one time use. But if you decide to move it, you're out of luck. It won't stick again.
