My impression of this rocking sleeper is colored by the fact that I purchased an earlier version in 2014. I decided to buy a second to take to daycare for my second child and I've noticed that it is no longer collapsible. Perhaps this is for safety reasons but the earlier model hasn't been recalled so maybe there's another reason for it. It used to be able to fold flat for storage and in fact the box advertises that this one does (while simultaneously cautioning that what's in the box may not be the same as what's pictured on it). Also in the previous version there was an insert/pad for the baby to sleep on. This made it easy to toss it in the laundry if it got soiled. This version doesn't have a separate body pad/insert, the cloth part is one big piece plus the pillow so in the event that it gets soiled, you have to put the whole thing in the wash. I'm still giving it three stars because I imagine if I didn't know about the previous version, I wouldn't be bothered by the way it is set up and I imagine that it is very similar to other bassinets on the market and it's decently priced.
