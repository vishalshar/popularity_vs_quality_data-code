I first discovered Best Bottom diapers and liners when I purchased a few sets at a local brick and mortar store.  I decided to order a few more of the inserts from Amazon, and I was disappointed when the inserts arrived and I discovered that they are much lower quality than the ones I have been using.  These are *very* thin, less than half the density of the others, and the cloth on either side has a loose feeling, whereas the inserts I purchased before are very plush, thick, and there's no wiggle in the cloth.  Honestly, I'm not sure if the manufacturer has completely cheapened up their process or if the seller sent me a set of knock-offs, but I won't be ordering these online again.
