I am embarrassed to admit the amount of research I did before purchasing a car seat for my 7 month daughter who has already outgrown her infant carrier. It finally came down to this seat or the Britax Boulevard, and we chose this to try in my SUV. The material is wonderful and my daughter seems to enjoy riding in it (we did an all night drive recently and she slept the entire way in it) and it has good padding. I feel that she would be safe and protected in an accident, but the seat is frustrating. The straps twist and are difficult to get on correctly over her shoulders. Further, it requires a lot of strength to get the straps tight after she's in. I feel like I'm crushing her because I'm pulling so much on the strap to tighten the straps on her shoulder, but when I check, the straps are still incredibly loose on her. The seat was also difficult to position in my car, but I don't know if that is a problem specific to this seat or my car. I have a GMC terrain and the back seat bench isn't flat, it angles down to the back support so there was a large gap under the car seat that we had to stuff with a rolled towel (again, I may have this problem with all seats, but I don't know since I've only tried this seat). I didn't have this problem with Chicco keyfit base for her carrier. Finally, the install was much more difficult than anticipated. One of the latch straps is twisted in the clip so it's impossible to tighten or loosen it to get in installed. It took 2 of us together pushing on it to get it latched in tightly and if you use the teether, it causes the seat to tilt to whatever side it's tethered just ever so slightly.  As a result of the frustration, we did purchase the Britax for my husband's car a few days ago,and I'll provide an update after we install it if I have a preference for that seat.
