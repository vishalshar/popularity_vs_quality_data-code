I used to love these but now I can only give it 3 stars.  In fact I think I have about 4 or 5 sets.  It is great to keep spares in the diaper bag and in my purse but the worse thing about it besides babies being able to squeeze things out and make a mess, but the silicone also stains.  It's a good cheap alternative to the more expensive ones that don't stain and it is also safe to leave at daycare and not worry if it gets thrown out.
