I was on the hunt for a plain, white crib skirt and this does the trick. However - I have never spent so long ironing something in my life. It was incredibly wrinkled. Not a few wrinkles that could be steamed out in the dryer, or ignored. It was a wad of solid wrinkles. Ironing was horrific - for every wrinkle I ironed out, I ironed two in. Wrinkles were very resistant, I had to have the iron on the "linen" setting and dampen the fabric to make any progress.  I am pretty sure that if I don't make it to heaven I will be in a place where I have to iron this bed skirt over and over for eternity.
