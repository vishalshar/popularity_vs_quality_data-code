Terrible replacement valves. They slip out of place which causes the cup to leak. We have older sippy cups and a few newer. In the newer cups, these valves stay in place longer but they still come loose if the toddler tosses the cup. Our older cups leak regardless. The older style of valve was excellent but are no longer sold at reasonable prices.My best suggestion for cups you use with these valves is to put in the least staining liquids like water or light colored juices. Be attentive to dairy and avoid chocolate milk because one good fling of the cup by your toddler and the liquid will start to spill.
