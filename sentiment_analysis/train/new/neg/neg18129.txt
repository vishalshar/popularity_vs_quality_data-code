I bought this for everyday use for my pub height dining room table. It is light weight and folds semi compactly. I thought the toy seemed cute, but it gets boring pretty fast. I have used different toys on the table with no problem. The tray is small, which is fine, and would fit in a dishwasher. I like the fact that the "crotch guard" (I don't know how else to describe it) is not huge like on the Fisher Price Space Saver. Seems to give little boys "more space." The only thing I don't care for is how small it feels. My son is 7 months and 23lb and hopefully he will thin out and be able to use this longer...
