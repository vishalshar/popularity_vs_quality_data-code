This seat is so big. I have a Toyota Highlander and I didn't think space would be an issue since my backseat is pretty big. Every time I buckle up my daughter, I have to move the seat so I can find the buckle under this booster. I recommend measuring your seat width and comparing with the width of this seat to make sure it will work - I wish I had done that. It is a nice booster, I feel my daughter is safe in it, but in hindsight I wish I had gotten a booster that was a little more compact while still offering great safety and support.
