Love this stroller but was recently told theres a recall.  They can't send me a new one for another 3 weeks so I've either got to use this defective one, buy a totally new stroller or go without, which is not an option.  They actually want me to send in my existing stroller first before they send another (in 3 weeks) so I'll certainly be without for, what, a week or two?  Crappy customer service.But the stroller is great.  Shoot.
