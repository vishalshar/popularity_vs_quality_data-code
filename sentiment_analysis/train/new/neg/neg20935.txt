We've had this since September for my then 3 month old. Since then we've probably replaced the batteries every 3 days and decided to go to rechargeable ones because it's pretty ridiculously expensive. This last week (4 mos) the thing just stopped working if the remote was outside the door - since the remote stays lit that's pretty disruptive to his sleep so we have to hide it under pillows. Since yesterday it's also been randomly turning on when on cry mode and randomly turns on which wakes him up. This is pretty awful since he normally sleeps through the night and this is actually waking him up at night. 4 times so far!!! So we figured out what the issue was and finally took it out of his room but it's a real bummer since he's become used to falling asleep to this thing. Hopefully this company will replace this but as of right now I'm really not a fan of this product.
