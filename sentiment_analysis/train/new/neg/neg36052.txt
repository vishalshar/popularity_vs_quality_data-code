I love this bedding set! When my husband and I found out we were expecting, we wanted to buy something neutral since the sex of our baby would be a surprise. Also, we would like to use the set again, since we plan on having at least another one or two kids. This set is perfect! It's so cute! The boyds bears are perfect for either boy or girl. BUT, one thing I didn't realize until after we bought the set, was that the bumper pad only ties at the top and not the bottom. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, and thought it would be no problem. I was wrong!! I'm realizing with a 6 month-old baby who likes to roll around and grab things, that it just isn't smart to have a bumper pad that only ties at the top! My son is CONSTANTLY pulling at it and on it, which is normal for a 6 month-old to do, and now I'm worried that he may hurt himself or God forbid, suffocate!! I'm not exaggerating! Several times already I have found him sleeping with the bumper pad OVER his head, or his head was nestled in the corner under the pad, which isn't safe AT ALL!!  I love this bedding set otherwise, but they really dropped the ball when making this bumper pad. It's not even functional! Why have a pad that ties only at the top? My son has woken up crying and scared because he was able to lift the bottom part of the pad and hit his head on the side of the crib. If his head is still able to hit the side of the crib without any protection, what's the use in the bumper pad? Isn't that the whole point of a bumper pad to begin with?? This bumper pad is not safe. I will be forced to use another bumper pad that totally clashes with the rest of the set, that someone gave to me in case I needed it. I would rather have this set not match than risk my baby's life and possible suffocation because no one had the forethought to sew ties onto the bottom of the pad where they normally should go!  DUH!!!
