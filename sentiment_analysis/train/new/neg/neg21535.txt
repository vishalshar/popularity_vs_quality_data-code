As always, A++ service from Amazon.comOK ... I think Evenflo does a miserable job in their manual explaining how to tighten and losen the straps.  I finally had an "Uh DUH!" moment and discovered that the straps pull up from the BOTTOM of the seat.  All along I had been tugging them to come loose from the shoulders (like the Graco infant seat).  I re-read the manual, but it's just poorly written.All in all, I do LOVE the seat and so does my son.  It fits well in my 2003 Ford Explorer with one exception - the latch strap sort of blocks the knob/lever on one side.Otherwise, I'd recommend.
