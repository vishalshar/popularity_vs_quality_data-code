They say it works from 30" to what ever the maximum is.  It tried to installed in on a 36" opening and it does not work. It only works properly when near it's maximum width. You can not lift the gate up far enough to open it at 36" wide. I had to hack it up in or to make it work but it no longer works right. I would not recomend it unless you have a VERY wide door opening.
