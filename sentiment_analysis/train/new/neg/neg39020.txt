I ordered these since I like the idea, and my baby's socks were always working themselves off, with or even without her help! But if you have a squirmy baby like I do...you'll understand that dressing time is enough of a battle, without having to put another piece! I guess they do what they are supposed to do, her socks have not come off when she is wearing them. But I find they bunch and kind of roll up, rather than staying nicely in place on my baby's feet. I guess in the end I just would rather keep an eye on her socks than have to put another thing on her! I only use them occasionally when we go out.
