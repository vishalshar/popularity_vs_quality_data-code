It feels sturdy and looks nice, but there are a few points where it is lacking. It is pretty hard to spin when loaded with books on all shelves. The bookend pieces that keep the books from falling out of their shelves are only secured on the bottom edge with a dowel and a screw. They are not secured on the side that meets the shelf partiotion so they tend to loosen up quickly if any books are leaning or pushing up against them.
