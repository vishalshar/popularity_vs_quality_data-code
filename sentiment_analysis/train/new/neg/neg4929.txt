I revised my review to lower it from 2 stars to one star. From "Opening is not wide enough to fit over door", to, "Save your money". This "Lock?" does nothing but damage the doors while wiggling loose. It may be suitable for a one year old but any walking child will quickly figure out how to break into the closet by rocking his/her body weight against the door. It is too short to be useful. The leverage that the doors can apply to the "Lock?" is magnified by it's shortness.Opening is too small to fit over hollow bi-fold door. The fit is tight causing door damage when trying to slide the lock from locked to unlocked. The only way to get it to work was to remove the locking plate from the inside. Then it fits with a little slop. Poor engineering.
