I used this for my daughter.  While I liked the removable tray (for cleaning purposes) I found that it was really too large, took up too much space, and was a pain in the butt to get truly clean.  Eventually, I got tired of cleaning the cloth cover, and things got "ugly" after that.  I threw the entire thing away and opted for a seat that attached to the dining room table instead.  Less furniture and easier cleanup!
