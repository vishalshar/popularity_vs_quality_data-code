I ordered the city mini baby jogger because I was looking for a light weight alternative to my inglesina zippy. The baby jogger definitely delivers in terms of being light weight and easy to close. It has nice features, including a full coverage sunshade with uv protection. The cons are that my daughter who is an average size two year old can't sit in a really upright position. The stroller doesn't have a fully upright position. I added the snack tray to the stroller and my daughter holds on to it so that she can sit upright and look around. Other negatives are that when the sun shade is up my daughter can't see out the sides of the stroller and she doesn't want it. Also, you have to pay extra for cup holder and snack tray. The stroller is ideal for neighborhood walks and I can get it in an out of stores easily and can push it with one hand. Overall a good purchase but if they could provide a more upright position for toddlers it would be much better.
