Where do I start wholes did not line up the instructions need more details like blot sizes on it ...the edged are chipped up and a corner on the top is cracked ... its easy to put together once you have the correct bolts in the correct place and your not double working ... i dislike that it is made of particleboard  wish i would of know before I bought it .... its 100% assembly ... it will serve its purpose sadly i was wanting it to last a while longer than a few years... the fit and finish is disappointing
