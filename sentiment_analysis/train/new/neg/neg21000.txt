Do not buy! I bought this toy for my nephew for Christmas going against the other reviews. Well all of the other reviews were right. The toy will not seal because top and bottom do not fit perfectly together. I had to completely seal the toy with glue all the way around at the seam and in the three screws and the three holes described in other reviews. Do not buy, do not waste your money. If you do, make sure you factor in a 5 dollar tube of flexible waterproof glue and you will never be able to replace the batteries.
