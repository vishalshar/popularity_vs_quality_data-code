This hamper initially seemed like a good one, the problem is that it fell apart pretty quickly. Of coarse you should not expect much from a wire framed hamper since they are usually for light use however this one started to bend toward one direction pretty quickly and doesn't stand right anymore.The long pockets at the top where the included stabilizer bars insert for more support unfortunately became torn at the seams as they are not sown together well. This item just seems very flimsy. I will say that it does have nice built in handles on the sides for carrying. Two of the sides are made from a breathable mesh which haven't yet torn.Ultimately if your looking for a good solid hamper for your newborn or child that will handle much use along with the expected wear and tear, I would look for a more solid hamper. If however your looking for quick a cheap hamper that you don't plan on using again after another year, then maybe consider this one ? Just don't do what I did and buy it just because of the cute monkey !
