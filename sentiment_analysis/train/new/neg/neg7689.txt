For the sleep-deprived parent of a toddler who constantly leaves their room:At the time I bought one of these for the first time, my 2 year old daughter was coming out of her room 10-15 times a night. She would come into our room, cry for us, we'd tuck her in, we'd leave, she'd come back into our room 5 mins later, etc etc.We paid hundreds of dollars in doctor bills and sleep specialists bills. She didn't want us in her room. She wasn't having night terrors. She wasn't scared. She couldn't sleep. Period. No idea why. We tried for months to help her.Finally, we caved and bought this. We explained it to her and told her she was locked in (which is no different than when she was in a crib). She was completely OK with it. Until she woke up the first time. She cried and stood by her door for 15 mins. After that, she finally started sleeping again! It literally took 1 night. She would wake up in the middle of the night, but she knew that there wasn't a point to get up. Finally, after a few days, she just stopped waking up. This was the answer to our prayers!!3 stars because:We're on our second one because the first one broke.It baaarely fits our door. We have to pull it really tight and use 2 hands to get it over the molding.The price.It has been nicking our door and pulling the paint off.Regardless, if this one breaks, I'll be buying another one. Sleep for my girl and the rest of the family outweighs all the negatives.I did feel guilty at first, but I surely don't anymore. She doesn't mind it at all and is finally well rested!
