Great item but shipping is way too expensive. Makes it almost not worth the purchase even though the door stopper itself is great. I bought it for my classroom as all my students were always kicking the wedge out of the door. With this, the door remains locked (and ready to shut when stopper is removed) at all times but ajar so students may come and go with ease.
