Structurally, it's solid and thick enough to do the job of protecting the seat. However, it's too short for many (most) seats and could do with being 3" longer. Also, the inner pad is attached to the outer ring you see in the picture using a single stitched row with a rolled seam that points to the inside. That leaves is exposed to abrasion from the child's shoes. Indeed, in use for just a month or so, that seam is now disintegrating along the bottom side. This is a fairly significant design defect and I expect that this pad will fall apart there in the next 2-3 months, resulting in 3-4 months of usage from this product. I expect better.
