Don't buy this! My son is 24lbs and the very first time he put any weight on it the plastic ring that attaches to the strap broke in half and caused him to fall on his face which resulted in his teeth bleeding. The parts need to be make of metal not cheap plastic! I'm very disappointed In this product.
