I like the idea and my son seems to like it too but, the fact that it has such a strong chemical smell turns me off. Im not like most parents who are worried about bpa free, etc toys but one whiff of it made my stomach turn. So if i cant handle the smell im pretty sure my son cant either. Also theres some type of rattling noise in the ball and it mentions nothung about a rattle inside so i wonder what it is. Skip this teething toy all together.
