If you're reading this review then the first thing you should know is that this is not a 'tote messenger bag'. It is a diaper bag. Rather than built-in padding to protect a tablet or notebook computer, it has a removable changing pad. Now that we're past that bit of information, I can also comment on this product's utility as a diaper bag as I do have a bit of experience in that area as well. This bag is just about half the size of the diaper bag that I used when my daughter was young. There is no way of fitting diapers, wipes, a change of clothes, and a spare bottle or baby food in this bag unless you remove the changing pad. If you did manage to fit everything you needed inside, the added stress would tear it in no time. It appears to be made of very thin nylon encapsulating foam and (maybe) cardboard. I haven't torn it apart to find out. Finally, the flap secures with only velcro, and there isn't much of that. I will end by saying that this is a very cute bag. If you don't need to carry anything very heavy, then it would be a great tote. Don't buy it for a laptop or text books though.
