This product is not durable at all. After only having this product a few months, in a bedroom that is not yet occupied, it had a small white spot on it so I rubbed it lightly to get the spot to remove it and all of the finish came off. Now my brown tree has a ridiculous looking white streak in it. I spent the extra money for the fabric tree and the description clearly states it is durable. Don't believe it. I've used plenty of vinyl wall stickers and they are twice the quality of this. Extremely disappointed, as my forest themed nursery, looks like a joke
