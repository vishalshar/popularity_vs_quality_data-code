My sister swore by this so I bought it.  Unfortunately, I wasn't as much of a fan so I didn't complete the whole process.  I didn't always remember to use it but when I would go to the corresponding sound for the week, the sounds got increasingly more rapid and loud.  It felt jarring for me so didn't really feel like subjecting the baby to it either.
