It is not worth the price that i paid esp. the shipping price, I guess i should have bought the bumper and sheet only. The bumper and quilt were d only two things i really liked. I hate the fact that the pillow case doesnt fit the pillow its too small. The bag set was okay.The sheets and other items were very thin. Nevertheless they look great in babies room!
