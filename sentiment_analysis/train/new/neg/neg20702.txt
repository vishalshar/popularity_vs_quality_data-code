For what it's worth, I like it.  We had something similar (sterilizer/dryer combo) when we were living abroad in Asia.  I actually liked that machine moreso (it was cheaper and fit more items) except it wouldn't really be convenient as most US electrical outlets are for 110V appliances.  At any rate, the Wabi does what it's supposed to do - sterilizes then dries bottles.  I'm not quite sure how this fares against the Baby Brezza Sterilizer/Dryer or the Babymoov Sterilizer/Dryer which are actually more affordable than the Wabi but fit lesser bottles.  The Wabi was actually the only sterlizer/dryer I had seen at the time while I was preparing my baby shower registry.The sterilizer can hold SEVEN Philips Avent BPA Free Natural 4 Ounce bottles comfortably.  I have not tried using the 9oz Avent Natural bottles with this.  The "Natural" line of Avent is awfully wide to begin with so I'm a bit scared about how many can fit.  I did squish 11 4oz Avent Natural bottles in without the upper tray.What I don't like about the Wabi: The upper "nipple/pacifier tray" can ONLY hold 4 of my AVENT nipples/bottle caps and they need to be positioned in an inward angle so that the lid can close securely and tightly.UPDATED 05/02/14 From four stars to TWO STARS!!!:The Wabi can hold seven Avent Natural 9oz bottles.  You need to take off the upper tray/nipple rack though.The laminate film on the buttons portion of our WABI is somewhat peeling/bubbling off.  There's a noticeable bubble around our "AUTO" button which I often press.  This is disappointing because I only started using the Wabi on the second week of January 2015.TIP: To make descaling easier ,one can use distilled water to steam/sterilize.  It's more costly but there isn't much residue left on the stainless steel portion of the sterilizer.  The residue only comes from whatever water is left in the bottles when I wash with tap water.
