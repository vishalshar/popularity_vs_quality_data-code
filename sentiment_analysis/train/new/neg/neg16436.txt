Medela Pump In Style Advanced Starter (model 57081) vs. Medela Personal Double Pump (model 57038)Buyers beware; or in this case, mommies beware. It is important for a mother who is in the market for a breast pump to know and understand the differences in pumps, even pumps from the same manufacturer. Below are two insurance grade pumps manufactured by Medela, that look very similar but as you look at the pumping features, there are key differences.There are many durable medical equipment providers that provide breast pumps through insurance; some provide the 57038 model while Aeroflow Healthcare provide the better 57081 model.I WAS NOT PAID TO DO THIS: I personally was confused about the two pump and did my own research. My insurance allowed me to have order either one but I was not sure about the difference.I am glad I went with the 57081 model which has better features... I have colleagues that use that model and love it!The two pumps look very similar but as you dig into the details it is importance to notice the Personal Double Pumps (model 57038) does not have Medela's 2-phase expression technology which is proven to get 18% more milk when double pumping (based on Medela research).The Medela Pump In Style Advanced Starter (model 57081) also has fully adjustable vacuum/speed setting to allow the user to customize the best pumping experience!I hope this review helps someone make a decision!Thanks.
