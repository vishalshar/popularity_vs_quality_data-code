Having begun potty training my 2 yr old son (our 2nd child) this has got to be the worst potty chair - especially for a boy. Even with the "front splash guard" built into the removable cup it is not good enough to prevent a boy from urinating over the front of the toilet. Personally the lid on the toilet is more of a pain than useful as a step stool when closed. My son rarely uses it for a stool and the lid is annoying. He has fallen over backwards onto the lid while sitting on the potty - and he was not happy about it. The sound box is not worth it either. With the toilet on the floor (and sound box underneath) you can hardly make out the music or your recorded voice. My son has had no interest in the bells and whistles. He is just proud of himself overall and wants to show us that he is a big boy! We are throwing it in the garbage and purchasing the Baby Bjorn toilet with the raised backside. It has much better reviews. I also wanted to add one more thing that we just did for our son. We purchased new boys briefs for him and had them delivered (he got to open the box as a gift to him). He was excited and ooohing and aahhing over the underwear and he knew what to do with them right away. It is more of an incentive for him - and he is eager to wear his new undies when he is ready!
