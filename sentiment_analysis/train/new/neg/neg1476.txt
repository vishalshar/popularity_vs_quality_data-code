Keep in mind, I'm an experienced pump user. I have a daily-use electric pump that I've had great success with, pumping twice a day while I'm at work, five days a week. I bought THIS pump to keep in my bag as an emergency back-up, etc. I never got a drop out of it. I checked every connection. There was some suction, but it was the equivalent of a mouse sucking through a coffee stirrer. I suppose if you're incredibly engorged and leaking through your shirt, you might not need that much suction. But I try not to let myself get to that point, so it didn't work for me. If that's your thing, try hand expression. You'll get more.
