I purchased this gate to replace a Kidco Elongate.  This was the closest gate I could find to the Kidco Elongate.  I ordered the Regalo Super Wide Maxi Safety Gate #1190.  When it arrived it was labeled Carlson.  Why do I mention this?  I needed to purchase 2 extensions for this gate.  I went to the Regalo manufacture website to order them because Amazon does not carry the Regalo Extension.  They list only 1 type of extension that fits the Maxi Gate.  It is Item #1124EW.  It is $25.99 plus shipping.  I ended up ordering the extensions at Moore Pet Supplies.  This was the only place I could find that offered the extension and listed it as Regalo and fit the safety gate model I purchased from Amazon.  When the Extensions came in, they were also labeled Carlson.Compare Kidco Elongate and Regalo Super Wide Maxi Safety GateIt is about a 1/2 " taller than the Kidco.Regalo Super Wide Maxi Safety Gate Opening is not flush to the wall, there is a small section of bar then the gate.Kidco Elongate Full Gate could swing out from the one of the attached walls, like a giant gate.  The Regalo Super Wide Maxi Safety Gate is snapped into place on both walls.Kidco gate opening could swing both ways.  The Regalo Super Wide Maxi Safety Gate swings only one way.Regalo Super Wide Maxi Safety Gate door opening is smaller.  If you have a wide frame body, this is not the gate for you.Kidco Elongate gate opening locked into place and had two stoppers at the bottom of the gate.  A pet or child could not push the gate.  You had to lift the gate up to swing it either way.  The Regalo Super Wide Maxi Safety Gate has a stopper on one side only and the bottom of the gate can be pushed out by a very strong pet.  There is no option to reverse the stopper location unless you place the opening near the opposite wall.  Cannot in our case.Very easy to Install.I am not thrilled with the purchase but it was the best I could find to replace a 8 yr old gate.
