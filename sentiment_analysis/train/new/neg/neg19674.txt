I purchased this product because it seemed like an awesome concept - an organizer and a seat protector in one... what more could you need?  But in actuality, it's not as great once you get it in the car.  I mean, it would probably be perfect for a small booster but it runs a little small for a typical convertible car seat.  I use this with a Graco Nautilus, and the seat protector isn't wide enough to be used with the storage tote properly.  I was able to get it to connect with the velcro tabs, but the tote leans to the side and without the support of another seat next to it, it falls over. I suppose you could off-center the seat protector a little, but then that throws the non-slip backing off-center and it leaves some of the seat exposed, which in my opinion defeats the purpose.  I also have a Britax Marathon, and run into the same issue when I tried the seat protector with it too.
