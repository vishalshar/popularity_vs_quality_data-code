I'm chagrined to report that none of these cables provided any kind of charge.I plugged in my iPad Mini with 10% power last night before going to bed (around 9pm).  I woke up this morning, to find it around 20% power.  The original cord that came with the Mini would've had it charged by midnight.I don't know if it's poor craftsmanship on the cables, or if not enough power flows through the wire, to the device.  I originally purchased them because Apple charges $15 for their cable in retail, and I wanted at least one for traveling, and one that stays at home.I've contacted the seller for an RMA.  I saw 17 other reviews, and the majority are negative - I hope the seller is paying attention to feedback.
