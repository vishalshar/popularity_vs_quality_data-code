The bottle warmer has 3 settings, but the manual only talks about setting 3. If you use it as described in the manual, then your baby milk will be way too hot. Every time I used it according to the manual, the milk was too hot and needed to be cooled down again. I now just put some warm water in a pan and put the bottle in there.This product has no decent temperature control and the explanation in the manual covers only 1 setting. If that's the case, then just give it only an on/off button... Sent back quickly, not to buy again or recommend to anyone!
