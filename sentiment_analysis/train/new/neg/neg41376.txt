This product would have been perfect however the clips used to attach the shade are made of plastic and broke after 1 use. Skip hop informed me that they can't do anything about the products flaw (one that they receive plenty of calls every week). They won't replace the shade or are able to replace the clips.If you do purchase this item, be very gentle when using the clips.
