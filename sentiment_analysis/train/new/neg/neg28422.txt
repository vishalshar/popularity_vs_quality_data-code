I just bought these items, I just hope they will give me option to choose what color I would want. I have 2 girls and the colors that shipped to me are orange(this is fine) and blue(how I wish this could have been pink).First of all, I love the flexibility of changing the spout into nipples and use the handle to other avent bottles. It all fits so I can interchangeably use it. The girls love the spout because they love biting it with their gums, its really soft so I don't have any worries about it. The problem is with the valve, they cannot drink if it is placed. If not, they will get wet. Now I have to figure out how to help them drink using the valve, or drink properly without the valve.
