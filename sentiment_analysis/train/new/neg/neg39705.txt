This is a great gentle cleanser, but we just can't stand the 'fresh cut grass' smell.  It's the same scent that most of the Mustela baby products have.  My daughter hates the smell too - it actually makes her gag as soon as she gets a whiff.  I hate to give it such a low rating, but the scent prevents us from using it, so it's completely useless to us.
