Do NOT buy this monitor. We purchased this, excited that we would be able to monitor from anywhere on our phones. And all other problems aside. The app is TERRIBLE. Since we have purchased the monitor (2yrs ago; we're monitoring our second child), there have been at least two separate extended periods of time where the app has crashed. As in NO ONE  has been able to use the monitor as they cannot sign into their account to view their child. Besides those times, whenever I sign in it is hit or miss if I will be able to sign in on the first try. It often gives me error messages as I sign in and I have to keep retrying. I'd be better off with just an audio monitor than this. I can't speak for other Summer Infant products, but save yourself some time and money and just purchase a better quality product.
