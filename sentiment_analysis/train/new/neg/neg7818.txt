Disappointed.  After receiving the first cup where the flip top lid had already disconnected from the handle, and I was unable to get it to stay on (the little peg that it swivels on just falls out every time you move it slightly.  Which defeats the point of having a lid that stays connected so you don't lose it), I returned it and received a replacement.  The replacement has the same problem, although not as badly, so I planned to keep that one.  However, the lid wouldn't stay snapped on the top of this one!  It is warped and does not snap down on the top.  So I scavenged parts from both cups and assembled one cup that mostly works and am returning the faulty parts.Cue the next morning where I give my 14 month old some Cheerios in the freshly washed cup.  3 minutes later, he has scattered Cheerios all over the floor because they are too small and fall through the slots in the lid.  They don't all fall out at once, and it takes a little shaking, but he is a shaker and a mover, so I now have Cheerios scattered through my entire house instead of in just one pile.  D'oh!!!I'm sure this would be fine for larger things like goldfish or crackers, but his favorite snack is Cheerios so that's a deal breaker for us.  Why didn't the manufacturer test this out ahead of time?  Seems like that is a fairly common snack.  Grrrr, back to the drawing board.
