This product isn't terrible but it looks so different from the product pictured. The face is sewn on oddly, the ears are on the side of his head, and the mane is uneven. It's surprisingly soft given that it's a terry cloth material. I was so excited to open this little lion and am sadly disappointed. For almost $13 I expected more.
