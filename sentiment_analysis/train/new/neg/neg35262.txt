We decided to give these liners a try because of their lower price point than the other brands. When I tore the first sheet off the roll, I instantly understood why they were cheaper.The sheets are smaller and they have a tendency to bunch/creep which means they only catch about 1/3 to 1/2 of the "output". Most noticeably, they are extremely rough...I honestly felt bad about even putting them up against my child's bottom. He has never had diaper rash and is almost one year old, but he has developed a rash since using this product. I had taken him to the pediatrician earlier this week due to illness, and while I was there, I mentioned the rash. The doctor looked at it and said that it is most likely caused by friction/rubbing. With these being so stiff and scratchy, I wouldn't be surprised if these liners were a contributing factor as nothing else in our diaper routine has changed.I am extremely disappointed in this product and will certainly never be purchasing it again. If you're looking for a good liner, stick with Bumkins flushable liners (100 count for $7.99). Bumkins are very soft, larger, stay-put, and completely serve their intended purpose. They are well worth the (very minimal) additional expense.
