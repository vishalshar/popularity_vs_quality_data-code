I'm really sad because I normally LOVE Sassy products but this one is not the high quality that I have come to expect from the brand.  The ring shapes are cute, but the plastic is really lightweight, which means it's difficult for a younger child to hold the pieces and get them on the ring because everything is always falling over with just the slightest touch.  At the very least, the bottom should  be weighted so it doesn't get knocked over so easily.  The other really annoying thing is that the middle bar is not tall enough.  It is not even tall enough for the rings to fit - it falls inside the top ring, whereas it should be slightly taller because this makes it really hard to get the top ring on. Remember, we're talking about babies and toddlers - they don't have the greatest dexterity in the world, so this makes it really difficult to play with the toy.  Overall, I regret buying this toy and would not recommend it.  I am now going to have to get a better and more sturdy ring stacker for my baby.
