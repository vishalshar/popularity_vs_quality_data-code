I wish i could give this 5 stars. The pump works well for what i need it for, but definitely doesn't work as well as a hospital grade pump. Its really loud, so i can't use it during the night, or it would wake my husband and 2 kids. I wish it came with extra pieces on the off chance that some were lost. My pump was a couple days late getting to my house too. I kind of expect something to be in my possession on the day i am told i will have it.
