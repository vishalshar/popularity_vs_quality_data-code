I got this bag 8 months ago when my 3 daughter was born.  It is a super cute bag but very stiff.  It didn't hold as much as I had hoped.  The bag is also starting to come apart where the straps attach to the bag itself.  I expected a lot more for the money.  All the reviews I read shared such praise about the bag but I would not recommend it nor buy another one.  Only 8 months old and I already have to buy a new one.  I cost me about $12 a month for this bag.  I am not rough on bags in particular either.  I just don't think this bags is worth the $100 price tag.....
