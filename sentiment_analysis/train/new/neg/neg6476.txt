Got this pump for its high ratings and portability, trouble is, it loses half it's suction when unplugged. Also, the silicone cups tend to get pulled off the edges attached to the bottle while pumping which also causes a lot of lost suction. For the price, I give it 2.5 stars and a b+ overall.UPDATE: around the time my little one turned 6 weeks old, I got so frustrated with the lack of suction and how much time in was spending pumping (or at least attempting to pump, as most of it was spent taking it apart and putting back together several times per session), I gave in and bought a new, higher rated (and less expensive!), pump. I have to say in comparison the Spectra S1 is above and beyond my expectations compared to the tommee tippee. It is soooo much quieter, more portable, less parts/easier to clean, doesn't lose suction when on battery, and overall wayyy more efficient. I spend half of the amount of time pumping twice as much. No joke. I give it a happy 4.5 stars (loses half star due to the difficulty of fitting it into my pumping bag!) Tommee Tippee has been pumped down to 2 stars and a C- grade.
