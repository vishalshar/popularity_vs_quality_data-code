I had been using a half-way broken baby monitor for almost two years before I got this one. I couldn't put up with the old one anymore. This new baby monitor is pretty good. It's small and plugs in with the option of using batteries. My only problem with this baby monitor is that it isn't very loud. I sleep with a fan on in my bedroom and have trouble hearing my son when he cries even when I have the baby monitor turned all the way up.
