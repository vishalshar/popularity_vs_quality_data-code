Had to return the item. It is plenty spacious and it's cute. However, the bow pulled out easily (and once it did, I saw that it had not been properly stitched together, so I would have to sew it myself to fix it. Also, the changing pad lining came unstitched after one wash (air dried). Just not well put-together, but maybe I just had bad luck. Even if these problems hadn't happened, there were a few flaws that kept me from truly liking the bag. First, the handles were more suited to go over my six-year-old's shoulder than mine. Second, there is plenty of storage, but not many useful ways of dividing things up so they're easy to find. Lastly, it was a little narrow and tall for my preference, shape-wise. I did like the outside zipper pocket and metal feet to stand on. Those were nice features to have.
