This rain cover is expensive for what it is. If I didn't have a toddler running around the house I could easily sew one for much less.It does, however, attach to the stroller easily and work well. Or, it did, until my 15 month old decided to put his feet up against it and the plastic promptly ripped away from the piping. I'll do my best to repair it with duct tape, because I can't face spending another $35 on a sheet of plastic.Ultimately, I feel that this should be better constructed so that it doesn't come apart so easily, or better priced ($10 at most) so that you don't feel bad about replacing it.
