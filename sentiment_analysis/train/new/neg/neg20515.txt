This bag is ok, but beware the description is not completely accurate.  At the time of my purchase it is called "Prince Lionheart Car Seat Check Bag" which is exactly what I wanted to do - check my car seat.  When it arrived however, the packaging described it as "Gate check bag", which was exactly why I had avoided other similar bags.  I didn't want to haul a car seat AND a stroller all the way to the gate.Nevertheless the bag seemed sturdy enough and I decided to go ahead and test if my carseat would fit inside.  This is when I found the drawstring to close the bag was missing.  It was the day before my flight and not enough time to order a replacement.Alternatives: so trying to think of some other way to protect my car seat, I remembered it originally came in a pretty sturdy plastic bag which luckily was still in the original box.  This became my replacement for the unusable Lionheart bag.At the airport I also discovered they provide large clear plastic bags for car seats and similar large items.  These are thicker and more sturdy than the original plastic bag from the car seat.I returned this product for a refund due to the missing drawstring, but in the event I'm glad I did as the free airport bags do a great job.My recommendation: avoid this bag and save yourself $20.  Use the original bag from the packaging of your car seat or pick up one for free at the airport.  They will provide at least equal protection and even shield your seat from rain and moisture.
