If you are looking for a half-decent cup that does not drip this is good.  The closing "click" is good - especially when you want avoid cleaning a liquid mess in your child's bottle/lunch bag.  But I will admit I paid too much previously - $18?!?  The current price is more reasonable.  Like others have said though, don't fall in love with the pictures on the cups because you might not get what is shown.
