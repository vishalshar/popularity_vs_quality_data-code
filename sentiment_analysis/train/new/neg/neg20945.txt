Really cheap plastic and the music is very loud and sharp. No way it will soothe a baby. The music sounds off key and kind of creepy. When putting the mobile together, it felt like i was going to snap the plastic at times because it's so poorly made. The only reason I'm keeping it is because it matches the Nojo Crib bedding. I looked around and couldn't find anything else to match the colors. If you can find something else to match your baby's bedding, i would suggest that.
