Ok, not good. Definitely not great. Cheaply made and the zippers are just terrible. It holds our stuff but we wish we got something bigger.After 10 months of use we are currently looking for another bag. The zippers are all broken.Yes, you get two bags, but the second bag is tiny and isn't practical.Would not recommend to others. We should have gone with a more expensive, high quality bag.
