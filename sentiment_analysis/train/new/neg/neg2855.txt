I really like this travel system. I love the way it looks. The price is very good.I feel like the car seat is very sturdy and my child is safe riding in it.Important note-- if you have a smaller car, you should NOT buy this. We had a Chevy Aveo and I could not put this car seat anywhere without moving seats way up. Even in the middle, I had to move BOTH of the front seats up. We settled for putting it on the passenger side and whenever someone was sitting there, they had to sit way forward with their legs scrunched.We now have a Blazer and the seat fits just fine. So it's great if you have a bigger vehicle.Another point-- the car seat is pretty heavy, so probably not the best option if you plan to carry your baby around in it. We didn't do that, so not an issue for us.Some people have said the stroller was unsafe. In my experience, it's perfectly fine. We admittedly don't use it that often because I wear the baby most of the time, but when he was very small we would put the car seat on top and it fit perfectly, always heard that reassuring "click," no problems with the wheels or the shade or anything.And the storage is nice and big.I also love that my 5 year old can comfortably ride in the stroller.Bottom line: I WOULD recommend this travel system, as long as you don't have a small car.
