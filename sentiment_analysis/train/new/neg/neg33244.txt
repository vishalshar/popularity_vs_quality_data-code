I have a 5 month old, who we're trying to get used to the chair before we begin feeding solids, right now, he's just using it to play with toys on the tray (mostly just dropping them on the ground though)Cons: The tray sliding mechanism doesn't work smoothly when you try and pull it out to create more room. It clicks on the first  couple of adjustment slots, but then it just slides the rest of the way without clicking and locking, and you have to try to maneuver it just right to get the rest of the settings to lock.  The leg doesn't lock into place when you're folding it. So unless you're going to lean it against the wall backwards, it's going to keep falling down.  The wheels are in an awkward place. It would be nicer if they were in the back somehow, because it doesn't roll unless you roll it from the front, and to do that you have to tip it forward. Again, a minor annoyance.  There's no screws or directions that the pole caps on the back of the chair need to be screwed in. There are holes for screws and the caps fall out when you fold it up. You can get a couple of screws and do it yourself no big deal, but I thought it was weird how loose they are on a children's product, as it's a choking hazard.Pros: The straps are smooth plastic and are easily wiped clean. The fabric is easily wiped clean as well. I know this because of course we've already had a blow out diaper in it. Fun right?  The seat adjusts back nicely so the baby can drink a bottle comfortably.
