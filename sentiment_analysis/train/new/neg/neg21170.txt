Bought 4 different nipple shields in order to find the one I like best, I put up a picture so everyone else can see what I'm talking about:Nuk: I would not recommend but it wasn't my least favorite; Pros - thin and large holes so milk goes through easily; Con - nipple part WAYYYY too big and the little flaps have problems sticking even with breastmilk which is frustrating if you have a LO upset and hungry, also the little flaps occasionally will get in the way of feeding depending on the position I use, only comes with oneMedela: This was my second favorite, would recommend; Pros - thin, allows contact w/o problems; Con - again nipple part is way too big and thus my LO gets frustrated if he's super hungry and/or fussy which makes things harder, also only one per purchaseLansinoh: my favorite; Pros - thin, allows contact, comes w/ carrying case and there are 2, nipple not too big; Cons - this does have a tendency to stick less as you use it more plus the cloudiness in the picture is from the lanolin I had to use a lot when I first started using the shieldsAvent: horrible, would not recommend; Pros - I thought I would like how much contact this would allow but for some reason I just couldn't get the wings to stick so less surface made it harder but could just be my problem; Con - plastic wayyyyyy too thick, nipple area wayyyyy too big, won't stick at all
