The toddler toothbrush isn't as soft as I expected. Probably better off getting a baby toothbrush made by OralB or some other brand that actually makes toothbrushes. The gum stimulator and infant toothbrush are useless.... I don't get their concept personally. I'm only using the fingertip toothbrush out of this entire set.
