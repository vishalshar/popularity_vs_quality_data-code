I've used Halo sleep sacks since my son was a baby! Was so happy to find this 2T size!! It fits perfect. My son is an average size 2 year old. The only complaint I have is the foot holes. Sometimes both feet get stuck in one foot hole when he's going to bed and kicking around. I don't really see the need for them since the sleep sack is too bulky to wear around the house anyway so wish they'd make one with no foot holes this size. Other than that it works great and my son is happy in it.I can see how other reviewers found the fleece one too hot. It is very thick fleece.  Only used this a few times due to the feet getting stuck in the foothole. Pajamas are a better option I think.
