I purchased two of these, one of which is still in use. The other one came apart the first time I used it and my two year old took off running through the airport. Not fun. The stitching wasn't tight on the back loop, so when she pulled just slightly, it came loose and off she went, through the airport in Mexico, and I had to drop all 5 suitcases, pull my 5 yr old along, and go chasing after her. After this incident, i reinforced the stitching on the second harness, and it is still holding.
