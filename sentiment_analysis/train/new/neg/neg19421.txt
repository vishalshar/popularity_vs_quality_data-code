I thought this would be a great toy for my kids, and while they love it I had a minor problem with it. I had to throw out the squirt bottle and sponge because after several uses they got yucky mildew gunk stuck and I couldn't get it all the way clean. I made sure to empty the toy of water after each use but with all the baths at our house it never really got a chance to fully dry out in between uses so the yucky gunk got stuck in the water bottle and in the fuzzy sponge. Since my girls put everything in their mouths I got grossed out and threw away those two pieces.
