I received this at my baby shower, and loved it at first, because it's bright and colorful and has cute toys. However, like the other reviewers have said,1) It's hard to put on. It requires hooking the velcro straps together in order to secure it onto the cart, and my baby is screaming and wiggling long before I can get it on.2) It doesn't cover the whole cart. My baby loves to mouth the whole handle bar, and you can see even in the picture, that this cover doesn't reach the corners.One more thing . . .3) The toys hang down the front of the cart on the outside. Once my baby is seatbelted into the cart, she can't reach them!The only thing this is useful for are small restaurant high chairs, where hopefully other people can distract/hold your baby while you attach it AND to play with in the car on baby's lap, (while sitting in a car seat).Infantino Cart Safari w/Microban
