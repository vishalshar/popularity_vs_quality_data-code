I have a 4 month old and a 2 year old. They both got a cold at the same time.***This is much better than a bulb because:(1) You can see what you are getting(2) I can get out more goobers than a bulb since I have more air(3) Easy to clean - enables me to see that it is clean with no germs left lurking around(4) Convenient plastic carrying case for travel bag***Difficult because:(1) Sometimes based on the snot consistency, the mucous tube dribbles into the air vacuum tube (not really a problem because you can see it coming, but it will gross you out)(2) Requires additional arm (one for baby head, one to hold aspirator to nose, one to hold baby arms down - you can hold the aspirator in your teeth)(3) Fairly intuitive  - if not, good luck with the Chinese***Better answer:(1) For travel, this is the best(2) For home use, get the Baby-Vac Nasal Aspirator.  Sounds crazy using a vacuum cleaner attachment - and it will freak out your mother-in-law, but it is fantastic and it does not suck out brains as you might think.
