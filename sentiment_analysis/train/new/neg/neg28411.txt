I decided to give this a try after reading the other reviews since it was so much cheaper than some of the other dolls.  I found it very difficult to use...when you fill up the little water bottle and try to place it in the dolls back it leaks so the doll ends up having an "accident" while your trying to get the underwear off.  Kind of defeats the purpose...
