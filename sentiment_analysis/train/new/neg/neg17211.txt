It's not something you can put up in a "pinch" so forget trying to install it w/ your toddler around.  Have to adjust the length then "fine tune" it for a tighter fit on all 4 corners.I bought this for my 3rd child so it's not like I'm "new" at this game.  I'm returning it ... and I can't even get it to fold all the way down like it's suppose to!:o(
