My son is a drool machine. I have to keep bibs on him all the time. I have purchased dozens of bibs in the last few months. I have several packs of bibs with the plastic backing like these. I have washed them all the same--cold water, dry on LOW heat. I read the care instructions on these bibs and did as asked. UHHH....so they shrunk and melted together in a big hot mess. I had to throw them way. Oddly, the RED one survived the same conditions that killed the others. The GREEN one suffered the most, I'm afraid. It was about 1/3 the size and the plastic was all stuck to itself. They were super cute and I had high hopes but it was not meant to be.
