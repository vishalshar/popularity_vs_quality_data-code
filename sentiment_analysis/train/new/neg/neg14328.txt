I sent this item back once already and now it is starting to seem like it is defective again.  When the song plays it sometimes gets stuck on one note and I have to turn it off and then back on again.  I changed the batteries a million times and it's still doing it.  My son loves it, but it always sounds like the batteries are dying and sometimes Elmo gets stuck below and I have to turn it off and back on again.  Not worth the $$ in my opinion.
