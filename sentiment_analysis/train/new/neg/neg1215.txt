I purchased this diaper bag after doing a lot of research on quality, size, and functionality of various diaper bags. I have a friend who has this bag, in the dark brown, and absolutely loves it, so I decided to go for it when the bag came down about $30 in price. I ordered it in the olive color, and I was so excited when it arrived. It's a beautiful bag, and seems very well-made, but, unfortunately, I had to return it due to one major flaw (in my opinion). The shoulder straps/handles are extremely stiff and do not fold down (notice there are not rings/loops to allow the handles to fold down) when you have the bag on with the crossbody strap. I really wanted this to work, since the style, size, quality, and functionality of the bag were all wonderful (lots of pockets, top zipper, etc)., but I found it very awkward to have the stiff leather should straps sticking up to my chest while I had the crossbody strap on. If you don't plan on using the crossbody strap option, then I definitely recommend this bag. Otherwise, it might be a bit cumbersome for you.
