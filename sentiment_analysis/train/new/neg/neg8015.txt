Everytime my 2 year old falls asleep in his carseat his head tilts to the side in a very uncomfortable looking position. We were looking for some kind of a neck pillow and tried this to keep his head situated up. When attached to the seatbelts, this will keep his from rolling from side to side but his head still slides forward. He ends up with his chin on his chest. I tried to take it off of the belts and place it so it holds his chin up, and it didn't really offer much support for his head. It would probably work great with smaller children though!
