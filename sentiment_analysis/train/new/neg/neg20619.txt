This carrier felt like it was well made and had a lot of handy features. I liked the fact that it only weighed 0.7 lbs and could be smushed into itself and easily tucked into a diaper bag. It was comfy for my daughter (9 months) and she loved being close to mom. It was really easy to get her in and out and onto my back, which hasn't been true for other carriers I've tried to back carry with.I really wanted to love this carrier, but I couldn't.I'm only 5'2" and I felt like I couldn't quite get it adjusted so both of us were comfortable. The chest strap sat too high and just dug into my lower neck. The straps were not padded, which makes it more portable, but after 10 - 20 minutes, the straps digging into my shoulders and back was not so comfy anymore. I needed something I could wear for longer periods as this baby is #4 and we are on the go a lot and I need to pack her with me for everything I have to do in my day.In the end, I returned this. But, it was a good carrier at a reasonable cost. If you were taller than me and you need something more portable for running into a store or a shorter errand it would probably be great. Just not a good fit for me.
