THIS PRODUCT IS RUBBISH!-horribly made-potential choking hazard-leaky straw-leaky top-an extremely hard to open topWhen i saw this in stores i thought... "Wow!" and had to have it. My son really likes this cup but, and it was the only cup that he was able to train on.. now he can drink out of practically any sippy cup. (i believe it was the straw that helped him) after 3 weeks of owning it i am still leary about letting my son have it.  The top is hard to get off, especially if you screw it on after you have put it in the cupboard. liquid... you will guarantee to spill if you have a hard time opening it while it has liquid in it. The straw traps liquid halfway so the tiniest nudge of the straw will make that liquid end up on the floor, your clothes, your babies clothes, whatever is in the general vicinity of the cup. The worst thing is... My son after two weeks started chewing on the colored grips on the side and i didnt find out until i noticed they were missing!!! good thing he didnt swallow these, i ended up finding them on the floor. i tore the rest of the grips off so i wouldnt have to worry about that, but the fact that its on there could cause another child to choke on it. Overall i just wasnt enthusiastic about the cup.. the sad thing is i need to find a better straw cup for my son that isnt this brand.. i'm not having luck with Nuby and i need to just still to what i know works. Until i can find that cup i just watch my son carefully just to make sure nothing else goes wrong.I would love to take time and make a video review explaining this but i'm too busy to do so. hope this is detailed enough. i only want to warn mothers and fathers that there is a potential danger and to use extreme caution! i'm a mother and i wouldnt want anything horrible like choking on a sip[y cup that you believe is safe but learn in a tragic way that it is not.
