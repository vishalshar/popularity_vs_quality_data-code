I was kinda disappointed in this purse as I LOVED the first Skip Hop diaper bag I bought. This ones quality didn't seems to be so durable, it has a silky material that shows snags... it has strings that start coming out pretty fast, it's very narrow inside not making for a very practical diaper bag which us moms like to stuff things into. The pockets on the outside were very big openings which easily allow everything to spill out with you bend over... I used it for over a year because I tend to use things I buy to justify the money I spent (even if I don't love the product) and when I finally went back to my old skip hop bag I realized how much I loved it and wished I wouldn't switched so long ago... It's just hard to find that extra time (even just to switch a purse) when you're a mom :) I wouldn't recommend this one.
