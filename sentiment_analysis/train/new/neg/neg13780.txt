I got this car seat for my 13 month old daughter who was outgrowing her carrier.  The only time she is in my car is when I pick her up from daycare which is a whole 2 minute ride home.  For that reason I did not want to spend an arm and a leg ( have a Recaro Proride for our primary car ) for this seat.The seat came in a really beat up box and it wasn't even covered in plastic bag. Kinda weird...The manual was very well laid out and I had no problem using the latch system.  Since I'm tall, I had no choice but to put the seat in the rear passenger location ( middle location would not fit ).My biggest gripe is the harness knob.  As few others have mentioned, this seemingly great idea does not pan out when used in the rear-facing mode at the side passenger locations.  The natural curvature of the seats will be too flush against the "outside" knob making it difficult to turn and to release the tension.  Of note, unlike most car seats, the tension of this one will tighten from the leg ( not the shoulder ).  So remember to "pull up" on the harness at the legs as you tighten the knob so as not to hurt the babies legs.Overall, for the price I paid, this works for my daughter.  It will only get better once she is old enough to face forward.
