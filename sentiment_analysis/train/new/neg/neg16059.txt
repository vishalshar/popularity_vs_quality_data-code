Just looking at the pictures this paci holder looks larger than it really is.From top to bottom the Caterpillar measures 5 inches and is a little over an inch wide,I have the Infantino Lamb Binky Buddy and wanted something similar that loops and velcros on the end of any pacifier.But needed a larger binky holder, so when baby loses her binky at night she could find it easier.This Caterpillar was a BIG disappointment. I should have bought Bunnies by the Bay and still might.
