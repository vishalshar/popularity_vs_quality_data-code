So I have had the original bundle me in the past with my older son, and I LOVED IT, when looking online I noticed this one which looked nicer and I loved the hood feature, although there was only a few reviews, I ordered it hoping for the best.  When it came I was very pleased with the quality and I loved it!  We started attaching it to the car seat, and it didn't fit properly.  I have a Chicco car seat, and the back of the bundle me does not lay flat on my car seat so it puffs up and the velcro that closed around your car seat straps pops open all the time because it doesn't lay properly.  Also as a result of it not fitting securly the part that you buckle your straps into falls back underneath the Bundle Me ALL THE TIME, and it is so annoying when I am trying to grab it to buckle my son in and I have to try and stick my hand into this little slit in the product and feel around for it.I also noticed that it is almost TOO warm.  I live in MN and it hasn't gotten FRIGID cold... yet, but it was like 30 degrees so we have been using it, but my son gets hysterical in the car if we don't take it completely off him, the other day he was screaming we pulled over and I felt his leg and it was WET with sweat from how warm this thing is.  I thought I would love the hood feature, but I don't, when I put my son in there, it almost closes in around his head, and he HATES it.So, I am very sad that this doesn't work out for us, because it is ADORABLE, we get a lot of compliments on it, but it doesn't fit properly and it seems to be more of a hassle... now I am debating whether or not to try out the Urban or just go back to the regular Bundle Me... :(
