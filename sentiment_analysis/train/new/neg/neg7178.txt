I'm not sure how to utilize this belt correctly and efficiently. It looks easy and friendly when I saw from Amazon, before we bought. However, it's a little confusing on how to connect/snap the buttons. We need to twist the belt to make it fit on our daughter's pants, which is inefficient and maybe uncomfortable.
