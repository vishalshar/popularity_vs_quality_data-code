I thought that it would be a bit more sturdy. It has no closed off bottom, just the drawers and not much supporting the top surface. We bought this with the intentions of using it as a changing table. Fingers crossed it doesn't bow too much. I'm giving this 3 stars because it is fairly cheap and looks beautiful. However, I almost think that something from IKEA might have been of better quality.
