We bought this at BRU for much cheaper than amazon, but got it because it was the only one that had height adjustment.  Our son has short legs like his daddy.  The in-store model was setup to what appeared to be the highest setting and I couldn't change the adjustment because it was broken (clue one).However, when I got home, I realized there are 3 height "adjustments".  1) Fully collapsed, wouldn't myself consider that a height, but the product does.  2) 95% height, and 3) 100% height.  To be honest, adding 0.5 inch of height from second to third setting is useless.  Based on the other reviews here, I'll be returning it.  I would have rated it maybe 2 stars if not for the misleading advertising.
