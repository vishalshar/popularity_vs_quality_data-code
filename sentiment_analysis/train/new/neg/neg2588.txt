The first one had a seam come apart after I had only used it twice. Buggy Bagg replaced it with a new one. On the replacement, one of the belt straps started to fall off, again after only a couple of uses. Buggy Bagg didn't have any more in stock, and I was tired of wasting my time with this cover, anyway. I got a refund, but after the shipping costs when buying and returning it, it was hardly worth it. It was also very bulky and a pain to carry around. It has a strap that fastens in the back and elastic around the sides and front. My toddler could pull up the cover and touch the cart. I now have an Eddie Bauer cover that has ties on the sides, so he can't pull the cover up. It works great. I will not recommend Buggy Bagg brand to anyone.
