I received this shade for free when I bought other products from Babies R US.  My windows in the back have a curved edge to them.  You have to place the shade high on the window in the straight area.  Well you miss the whole lower corner of the window.  The sun shines in through this lower corner.  When I tried to move the shade lower on the window I could not fully close the window.  If you can get it for free, get it.  Do not purchase this item.  I just recently went out and purchased new shade for my car to cover the corner this shade misses.
