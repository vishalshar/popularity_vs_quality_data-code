Not good value for the money. It is ok and I will keep it but it would be better if it were taller. The height doesn't support my whole back which is important to me while breastfeeding. The other issue is that it does not come with a slip cover and doesn't state that it doesn't. Given the option of colors I assumed that it did come with one as usually a pillow on its own is not decorative. The big problem here is that the cotton cover on it is not removable, so if my daughter is sick while I feed her I can't put it in the washer I have to someway hand wash it and then I can't use it while it dries and if it happens numerous times it could cause a smell. This is my first child but I would have to say anything for new moms/infants like this should be able to be washed simply because it is likely it will be soiled. It is also very firm as several reviews make note of but I feel that's helpful for me. The case does seem cheaply made and it gives me pause on how long it will work for. My picture shows the sewn seem of the cotton cover that seems both cheap and impractical.
