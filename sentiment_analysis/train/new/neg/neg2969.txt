If I could I would give it 2.5 stars. First I love the way the mat looks. The built in pillow and blanket is a great idea. What  is very disappointing is the actual mat that my 2 year old has to lie on. He may as well be sleeping on the floor. There is very little cushioning. I did not send it back. I bought a different  mat to place this one on top of. In the end there was no savings  because I ended up buying two mats when I only needed one.
