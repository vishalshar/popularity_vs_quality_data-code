After first wash the backing peeled off.  I would not recommend these bibs.  Additionally, they are not "waterproof."  My little one's clothes were soaking wet from the baby food that soaked through the bib while feeding her.  Terrible.  I used some others with my son that were a different brand and they lasted forever.  I bought them at a discount store so I am unable to purchase them anymore.  I wish I would have kept them.
