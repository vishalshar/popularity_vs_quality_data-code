I bought an Urbo 2 and a newborn cocoon from babies r us recently and used it for the first time this week. My daughter (9days old) slept fine in the cocoon whilst we we out to lunch but when we returned home we experienced one of the most scary incidents -- our baby wouldn't wake up. Her body was catatonic and limp. She was unresponsive and her breathing was barley there. We had to perform CPR on her almost lifeless body 2x and revived her by the time the ambulance arrived. She was admitted to hospital for tests and observation over 2 nights. She was pumped with antibiotics as a precaution until the test results came back. The neonatal unit couldn't find a single thing wrong with my daughter. (She was born full term and had no issues at birth.)The SIDS rep said it might be the pram and cocoon that caused her episode. I am very worried that you might be selling a cocoon product that isn't safe for newborns.I suggest only buying the bassinet carrycot.
