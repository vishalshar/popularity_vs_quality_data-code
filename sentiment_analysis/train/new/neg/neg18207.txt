This book is like a simplified version of  Lamaze's Peek-a-boo. The picture is almost the same. The main difference is it contains some components that issue sound. If you have their Peek-a-boo, don't waste your money on this one. Very redundant.The book itself is ok. though my son is not quite interested in it.
