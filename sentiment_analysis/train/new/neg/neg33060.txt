Soft but waaaaay too much fabric. The fabric almost feels like light sweatshirt material (it is super thick/heavy). I was overwhelmed by it. I wish it was thinner stretchier fabric (t-shirt type). Also the color is a little odd, it is kind of the color I imagine a bodily organ to be, like a lung. Sort of pinkish/mauve/brown, I was hoping for something more jewel toned and bright.
