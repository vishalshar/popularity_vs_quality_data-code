TERRIBLE quality and that's not even the worst part... TERRIBLE design as well. It's so short that it can't drape over your shoulder on both the front and back of your shoulder. I'm petite (5 feet)  and skinny (100lbs), so it's not because my shoulders are too big. The middle section is so thick that it doesn't fold over your shoulder, instead it just sticks straight out. After the first wash it formed so many lint balls that it looked like I had been using it for years. I only gave it one star because I had to give a minimum of one star otherwise it deserves zero stars!
