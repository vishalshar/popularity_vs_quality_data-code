I bought this pouch topper for my 6 month old who loves eating pureed Foods I put in pouches butt all the pouches have a hard nozzle that can be uncomfortable on a baby's gums and teeth. It attaches pretty well two different sizes and types of pouches I haven't seen any leaks yet and I've had it for like 6 months. The only downside I have is that it doesn't have a restriction to how much food could come through it's a pretty wide hole. So if he sucks hard a lot of food will come through sometimes he coughs I pull it back and he's ok. I wish they just made it with a little bit of a restriction or that they had to suck harder to push more food through. Now that he's way older it's okay that the whole is bigger because he could handle more food coming through it holds well as I wash it with cold water and soap and I haven't seen it Staind at all pretty pleased with the product
