This was our first pack n play purchased for our 3 month old after much research and deliberation. We intended to use it as a crib when traveling. I picked the Graco Pack'N'Play Element with Stages because of the 'stages' which I hoped would mean that our daughter could sleep higher for longer - this pack and play offers three levels, the first supports up to 15lb, the second up to 20lb, once your child weighs more than 20lb you have to use the lowest level.PROS:Overall impression is of a very nice and sturdy item.It was relatively straightforward to assemble and dismantle.CONS:BEWARE SAFETY ISSUE - I carefully checked all weight bearing seams holding the bassinet together after reading another reviewer's comments that their Graco pack n play had torn at the seams. I found a seam which had not been effectively sewn and as a result was coming undone. This seam was one of the main weight bearing seams that formed the fabric channel for one of the metal rods which held up the bassinet - meaning that if this seam continued to come undone (which it did with the slightest pressure) the bassinet and your child could fall. This fault is clearly a manufacturing defect and I am in the process of getting a refund from amazon.IF YOU BUY THIS ITEM, CHECK ALL SEAMS CAREFULLY!Aside from that, it was not clear to me why one bassinet level could support 15lb and the other 20lb as the 20lb stage is merely an extension of the 15lb setting, it is not further reinforced in any way. The only thing I could think was that a larger child may be more able to climb out of the first stage, rather than the bassinet not being able to support their weight. Although since mine was already falling apart before we used it, who knows what weight can actually be supported.
