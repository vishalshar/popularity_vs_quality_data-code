This bag is very lovely, nobody would know it's supposed to be a diaper bag from just looking at it. I've used it for 5 months now and i have to say that somewhere along the way i stopped using it as diaper bag and kept using it as just a nice lady bag. It has million pockets inside and outside, but they are all hard to access with one hand or sometimes even with two. The inside of the bag is very messy, without really straightening the bag and looking into it, it's hard to hit the right pocket or folder you're looking for. The outside side pockets are nice a spacious, but they can't really be opened with one smooth motion, the zipper is too stiff for that. So again, you have to hold the pocket with one hand and pull the zipper with the other, or else you risk damaging the zipper. This all gets very tiresome and annoying if you're balancing the baby on your hip and trying to find wipes from the bag with one hand. I did like the extras that came with the bag, like the diaper changing mat (pretty small, the baby will grow out of it fast), the thermo bag for the bottle and even a nice little clutch bag. Can't say i've used any of them much, but they seemed like a nice touch. So all in all, very cute bag, quite well made, but not an excellent diaper bag. Too soft shaped to be convenient for fast access and precise action. Plus if you stack all those pockets as they are intended, the bag will look fairly bulky and not so lovely anymore.
