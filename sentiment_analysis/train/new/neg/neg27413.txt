There are less expensive exersaucers that have a greater variety of toys/gadgets on the tray, so do not spend the extra $20 or $30 for this model.  The objects on this model's tray do little and are repetitive.I was disappointed with this purchase and wish I had exchanged it for a less expensive but more interesting model.
