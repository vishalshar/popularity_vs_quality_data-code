Although the picture shows Graco filters and the product title says Graco filters, these are NOT Graco filters.  Graco filters typically come each in an individual box and look like the ones in the picture, they have a white plastic looking mesh on the outside and have a bluish tint to them.  The ones received were not Graco and I didn't really mind too much as long as they fit and work.  They do fit in the 4 Gallon Graco cool mist humidifier but once they get wet the smell terrible.  The smell was bad enough that my wife thought something was left in the diaper pale.  I had to remove this from my daughters room immediately.  The seller admitted to having this issue before and offered a refund but wanted me to pay shipping.  Amazon immediately stepped up and corrected the situation though.
