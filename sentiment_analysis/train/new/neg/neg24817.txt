Took about 7 hours after attempting to install it in (4) separate locations.Unless you have a hardwood or tile floor (we have wall-to-wall carpet), it is extremely difficult to use the flimsy paper measuring guide they provide to determine where the mounting screws on each side need to be, since the guide needs to rest flat on the floor. Something that wouldn't seem like too big a deal were it not the case that if your measurements are off by even the slightest amount (e.g 1/8 inch) and the gate isn't level, it won't close securely. Which, of course, defeats the point. This is also a problem, by the way, that you can't test/asses until you have gone to the trouble of assembling the entire contraption... drilling in both the "hinge" and the "bar" sides, top and bottom;  connecting the front gate to the rear gate in (4) places, etc. A workout that takes about 30 minutes. This baby's heavy and cumbersome.Also, unless you have flush mounting surfaces (or at least wall surfaces that don't vary greatly from the top to bottom - e.g. a baseboard that protrudes more than an inch, as ours does throughout the home), it is - again - difficult to asses where the mounting screws need to be since the paper guide does not lay flat. Moreover, as it did in our case, the top and bottom varied to a significant enough extent that the screw for the top wasn't long enough to reach the wall, even with using the spacer they provided.I've instead mounted the hinge side to the "front/outside" of the top of our staircase (while the bar side is mounted inside the frame). As a result, it closes on an angle. It seems secure, but I wouldn't recommend others do the same. It took a lot of manuevering and retrofitting to figure it out.Now I'll spend another hour or so patching up all of the drill holes that didn't work out. Good times.
