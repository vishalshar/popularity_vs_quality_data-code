My son likes this book, but doesn't LOVE it.  It was kind of a bummer that the "squeeker" bulb that's in the 3rd page isn't "kid friendly".  He can't squeek it himself because he doesn't even know that it's there.  It's inside the fabric of the book.  I bought it as a teether book, but he didn't seem too interested at that age either for some reason...  All-in-All, not too exciting for my 11 month-old son.
