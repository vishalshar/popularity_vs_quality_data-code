i got this pack because it looked more padded than the others at babysrus. it is. the padding is great. it is super comfy.the built in sun shade is nice.i didn't expect the chest strap to fit me, they never do. i simply don't use them or expect to use them. no biggie.in general, it is a great pack. HOWEVER, you will need another adult with you or be able to rely upon the kindness of strangers. the legs will not open or close when you are wearing it. they are locked into place (both open and closed) with a latch that is at the *top* of the V on the *outside* of the rail. in other words, the latch is *behind* your child at about his/her head level. now, maybe someone with really long arms and/or a contortionist can reach the latch *and* make it work, but, sadly, i cannot.since i got this pack to use in the airport by myself, the latch problem is a non-starter. i will be returning it. it could be the most comfortable pack on the market, and i would return it for this one issue because it is a big issue.i want to be able to put my child in, secure him, then put the pack on while it is still safely sitting somewhere (chair, table, bench, whatever) legs out. i don't want to have to put it on while it is not supported. nor do i want to have to take it off with the legs in. i want that support there as soon as i take it off. but as it is, i have to fold the legs in before putting it on and unfold them after taking it off. NOT SAFE. (or i need to have that other adult around to help me do it.)i would give this item a higher rating but the support legs are a big issue in my book.
