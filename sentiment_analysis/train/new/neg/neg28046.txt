Unfortunately I ordered this product a little too late. My son has been teething since he was 3 months old. He is now 11 months old and has 10 teeth. Within the last few weeks, I noticed there were many bite marks on the sides of his crib, and on the front it looked like he thought his crib was corn on the cob and chewed it back and forth! I wish I thought of buying something like this before he ruined his expensive crib.I had these in my cart on Amazon for a long time, and I finally purchased them. I was not as happy as I thought I was going to be. They seem very cheap! In the picture, they look like they would be very nice and fluffy. Mine are flat. I have a Delta Crib from Target, and the front crib cover doesn't fit all the way to the end of the front. There is about a 2 inch gap. I am not a fan of the ivory color.. I immediately washed them when I got them in the mail, they just look dirty to me and they also collected alot of lint that I can not get off - they way I describe it is how sweatpants get where your thighs touch (IF they do LOL) and those little balls of cotton come. Yes, this product will get the job done and prevent MOST of his crib from being ruined, but I could've saved a few bucks and just made my own rail covers out of a towel and some tape, velcrow, or pretty ribbon. Save your money.
