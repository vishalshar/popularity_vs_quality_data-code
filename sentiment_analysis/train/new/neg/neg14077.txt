It was created in the USA but the actual production of the blanket is from China.  I was disappointed as I thought the entire line by SwaddleDesigns was made in the USA.  The item itself is a very light woven blanket and will be great for my friend's baby in Florida during our warmer months.  Still, wish all products were made in the USA by SwaddleDesigns.  I paid the extra dollars with that thought in mind.
