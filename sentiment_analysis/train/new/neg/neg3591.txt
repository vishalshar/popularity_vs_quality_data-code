although I read all the bad reviews for this product I purchased 2 of them.live and learn.it's an extremely flimsy product that either doesn't work (one of them didn't close at all) or works too good (now I can't open it anymore and am afraid to break it, if I do it to forcefully).I would try to childproof using other products!Another downside: it's pretty expensive!
