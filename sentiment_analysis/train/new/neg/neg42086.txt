Very soft and comfy! Quite absorbant when it's just normal leaking, although during heavier moments with my milk supply it soaks up easily. I have to do laundry everyday though, so I've been alternating with these 3 pairs just fine in between drying times after a bit of practice. I like to throw in a dirty pair or two in my zippered mesh laundry bag along with other delicates for washing, then the dryer on low setting after. They still don't dry all the way after that, which is the biggest con I've had with these nursing pads-they take a long time to dry! I don't feel like wasting money in buying another set since I'm only breastfeeding til 6 months, so I choose to just place these in front of my space heater in the room after an incomplete dry. Overall, I'm happy with these because they are very comfortable to wear and they do a decent job.Update 3/21 - Black mold! At first when I saw a black smeared looking stain, I thought I accidentally rubbed my mascara on it one day when I had a mishap. But I was wrong... the next few days the black stain kept getting bigger and it spread horribly! All my pads got affected and I've done all I believe I could to save them; lemon juice and salt paste, baking soda paste, oxy clean paste, hot boiled water, vinegar, drying it in the sun, etc... didn't even remove one bit of the mold :( I really loved these pads too...i guess I wore them too long a few times while they were drenched with breastmilk, and I already do daily laundry! Too much time,  hassle and money for me to give it another chance. I've opted for cheaper organic cotton breast pads now and even though they don't absorb as well, they're much easier to clean and haven't molded. Reverting to 2 stars from my previous 4 stars.
