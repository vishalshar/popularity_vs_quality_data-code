Wish it worked as well as it looked. Suction cup does not hold all the time. Because the center swivels, you have to have the same amount of weight on 2 arms in order for it not to swivel and dump your items off.I bought just for swimsuits in the summer and it has been disappointing. Arms could be a tad longer too. Great concept though. I will likely return.
