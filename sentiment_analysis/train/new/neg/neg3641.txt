Even after reading all the reviews with most of them complaining that the seat was too high for the average baby, i decided to get it anyways.  Some reviews said it fit their baby fine, most said it was too high even on the lowest setting.  I thought my average twins (6 months)would fit, because we have a different walker already and they fit it just fine.  This one leaves their little feet hanging a good three inches off the ground! My boys are of average height too.  I should of listened to the reviews, but i went with my own gut.  Now instead of going through the trouble of returning it, we just prop a pillow underneath and hope one day they will actually be able to touch the floor, hopefully before they start walking.
