I'm just adding in here that while I love neoprene lunch bags for their washability, I'm very confused by the GIGANTIC size of this bag. I bought it for my preschooler but it is at least 25% bigger than my Built brand adult lunch bag. All of the black material you see in the image is basically not usable space- it just functions as the handle. The blue part is where the zipper is but in practice you are only getting access to the bottom half of the bag- it's very awkward to get into. Then, unlike my Built bag, this doesn't have a 'bottom' seamed in so it doesn't stand up very well. I wish Built brand made kids designs because the functional design of them is much, much better than this one.
