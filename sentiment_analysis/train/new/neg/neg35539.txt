Well priced, and fairly sturdy car seat for my 26 lb.18-month son (we have used this car seat since he was 12 months).  Our son is still facing backwards (until 2 yrs) and the car seat needs a lot of support under the bottom to prevent our son from slumping forward in the seat.  We have to roll a lot of towels, etc. under the seat - and this has been an issue in several different cars/trucks/SUVs that we've used.  Also, it is very difficult to tighten the shoulder straps each time we put him in the seat - is there a trick to this?  We also use a Britax convertable car seat that doesn't require so many adjustments.  The Safety 1st is a decent car seat for the price, but not the best.
