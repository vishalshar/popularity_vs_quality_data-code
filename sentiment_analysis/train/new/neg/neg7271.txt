My son has only been playing with this toy for a short period (3 weeks?) and now the sound mechanism has failed. Without the sound, the toy loses it's uniqueness. It becomes just another plush, colorful toy...I can't find these in stores any more so I may be buying outdated goods. Long ago, this toy seemed to last forever.Be weary that these toys may be older and may not have fresh "battery" power in them.**While the sound is working, it is a lot of fun for everyone. Not obnoxious at all. It's a really cute toy.
