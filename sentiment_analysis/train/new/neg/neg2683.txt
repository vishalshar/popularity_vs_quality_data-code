Disappointing. As an exclusively pumping mom I thought this was the answer to my prayers. I managed to pick the right size, but I'm disappointed with the quality. There are loose threads on it and the bottom band of the shelf bra is turning my reusable nursing pads black. The design for hands free pumping leaves something to be desired. It should really be accessed by pulling the top up instead of from the sides; it's very awkward. I contacted the company over my concerns with the product and received no response back. This is not worth the money.
