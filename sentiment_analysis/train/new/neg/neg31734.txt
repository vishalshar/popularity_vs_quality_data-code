I purchased this brush from Amazon and received itSassy No Scratch Bottle Brush, Colors May Vary over a week ago.  It is supposed to be for cleaning baby bottles but I bought it for cleaning bottles I use to hand feed baby goats--they are the same as baby bottles just the nipples are different.  I chose it because it had a self contained soap dispenser in the handle.  First the description on site did not say that the bristles were of soft silicone or something similar. On arrival I removed the end of the handle and proceeded to pour in the dawn ultra dish soap which immediately began pouring our the bristle end of the brush. I then held a finger over the dispensing hole and filled the soap chamber again---screwed on the handle tightly and removed my finger from the dispenser hole. Soap stream out until the chamber was empty again. Okay--so it won't hold soap. Then I tried using it to clean the bottles.  The bristles removed the the formula residue on the sides but not the bottom.  So I now have a soft rubbery brush that does not clean bottles & does not hold the soap as advertised.  I placed in the laundry room and use it in the laundry tray just to whisk out the dog's water bowl every day.  Still looking for a dispensing bottle brush that actually holds soap & cleans.I do not recommend this brush for any purpose.
