This is a soft, sweet little baby rattle but there's nothing really spectacular about it, I was expecting a little more from this based on all these 5 star reviews; I also didn't feel it looked exactly as shown. The stitching/sewing lines were a little crooked where the rattle is larger on one side of the circle than the other (so more stuffing on one side, not symmetrical - not a huge deal- sort of gives the look of handmade I guess), the part of the cheeks that appear sort of "hand painted" in the photo is unfortunately so low it's almost sewn completely into the seam, so you can barely see that detail and even the colors are more dull than what's shown here. It's also smaller than how it appears in the sample photo (and I know my baby is smaller than the child in the picture here so I actually thought it might seem bigger in comparison). Despite all of this, its still a quality made product and it would be fine to combine with a few items in a baby gift but I wouldn't say it's really worth more than $6-7. This was my first Bunnies By the Bay purchase - I have 2 children and had never received anything from this brand but it seemed so highly rated, I thought I'd order something to see what all the fuss is about ;) we have a plethora of baby items between 2 girls and its hard to find things that "stand out", this is cute and my daughter chewed on the ears for a few minutes but then sort of moved on.
