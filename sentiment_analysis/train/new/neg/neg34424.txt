It was working great when I received it, in fact the mailman said he heard it during his whole shift, was so excited to give it to my nephew for Christmas, that I gave it early. He had it in his possession for all of 15minutes, then it stopped working. All i did was pull the tags off, and it never giggled again. There is also no way to get inside the ball to check the batteries, unless I rip through the stitching and then put it back together. Im really upset, but not worth the money to return it for another at this point.
