I bought this bag in November 2014.  In January the buckle broke.  I didn't do anything about it at first, but finally it started to get worse and worse not being able to close an overfilled bag (moms you can imagine).  I called Amazon to return it but it was past the return date. I called Kalencom and they were so nice and friendly , they actually sent me a brand new bag free of charge for my trouble. I like how unique the designs are. I have a funky style and don't want a boring diaper bag.  I would change the changing pad. It's not very thick. My kate spade diaper bag has a really nice thick one that has snaps that hold it when you can fold it up. This one is really thin and kinda poor quality. I love the bottle holder and the pockets on the inside. All in all it's cool ,but possibly not worth the price? Get it when it goes on sale
