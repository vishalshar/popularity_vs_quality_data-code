I really wanted to like this. The beautiful color, the fact that it fits through most single doors, locally made in southern Cali.... However, my husband and I both agree after 2 years of use: we should have just dropped the extra $ and bought a double BOB. The single BOB we had for our first child is indestructible. This one is a little less sturdy, cannot really be used as a jogger, and overall was a little disappointing compared to the experience we had with the BOB stroller.
