This bassinet has a lot of features I wanted.  Sun shield on the side, canopy, and changing station that remains attached.  One of the pictures shows a 1/2 bassinet, which I also really wanted, but apparentally this is not accurate.  It only comes with a full bassinet, which I am concerned is not very comfortable for a newborn.  I haven't used it yet for a newborn, but I have had visitors use it for their 1 yr old.  They thought it was difficult to add sheets since the bottom pad is attached by velcro straps near the end.  I also think the side are very difficult to lock and unlock, but this may be the standard for all playards.
