When placed under the nipple in the nipple collar these are supposed to prevent leakage and they do a little bit, but not to the degree that I would use them to take liquid bottles with me.  I use these for when I premake a bottle with just the premeasured powder formula in it and don't add the water yet.  I put the premeasured water in another bottle and use the travel caps for the liquid.  Do not buy these unless you plan on using them like I do.
