I really like how cute all the animals are on this rug but the colors just seem a little dull to me.  Also, I read a different review that the rug was very plush, and it isn't.  I would not use this to set my infant on, I would get a blanket.  It also never seems to stay flat, and I've tried putting boxes on it, vacuuming it, steaming it, but the corners roll up.  If it was a $20 rug I probably would be satisfied with it as a little decoration, but I was expecting something I could put my child on that would be very colorful.
