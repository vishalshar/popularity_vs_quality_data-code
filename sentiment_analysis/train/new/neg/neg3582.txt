We bought this travel bassinet to take with us while we traveled out of state for our son's birth, and to have while we waited for the interstate clearances to bring him home (he's adopted), and we found it to be very nicely made and sturdy.  Unfortunately, my son listed to the side a bit in it.  I think it just isn't level.  It was also a bit big for him (he was only 2 days old).  We had much better luck with him in a laundry basket that we filled with a pillow and a quilt.  I think now that he's older and is used to sleeping in a bassinet he'll do better in it.  Plus, I love that it has a mesh zip cover that you can use while you are out on a picnic or at the beach.  Once he's a little older, it will be more appropriate.  If you are using this for a newborn, I'd wait a bit and try something else.
