I got this because I have 2nd child now.  At first I thought this was the lightest tandem stroller in the market with seemingly positive reviews...It's quite heavy.  Anyways, so I've only used it about 10-15 times and the wheels all went flat and one of them has disconnected from the track and needs to be replaced.  I had read reviews from other customers about this WHEEL ISSUE, and I didn't make much of it. But honestly, it is a HASSLE.  Especially if you travel a lot and can't just order a new wheel outside the US.  Honestly, a waste of money.  I wish I could return this clunky thing because no $400 stroller should have this kind of inconvenient. cheap wheel problem.
