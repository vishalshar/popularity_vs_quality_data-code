I researched a ton of activity mats before purchasing this one.  I will say it is very cute!  We've had it for a couple of months now and our almost 5 month old daughter loves it.  HOWEVER, we carry it around the house to different rooms and for some reason now the toy bar won't stay up completely.  Also, our daughter has started rolling over and when she does it at a particular angle the whole thing topples in on her!  She's also a big kicker and will kick the sides and again the whole thing can collapse very easily.  I am constantly messing with the thing to get it to stand up straight.  I'm now looking into a double bar one like we had for our first daughter (which became damaged in storage) because the shape holds up so much better...
