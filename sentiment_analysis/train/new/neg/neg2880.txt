This clip works fine for the Soothie pacifiers, which is the reason I bought it. However, from the picture and description I thought I was buying 2 clips. Instead I only got ONE clip! The picture shows the fornt and back, which are in two different fabrics, of the clip. I think this is very misleading. No where in the description does it say how many clip(s) you are getting. The only indication is that in the product name it says "clip" not "clips". The product is fine, just be aware you will only get one clip.
