Constantly drops signal no matter how close you (BEEP!) have the portable parent unit to the base. When the unit is no longer "linked" it will BEEP loudly until you turn the unit off and then back on again. These units have even lost the signal (BEEP!) when they were in adjacent rooms a mere twenty feet away from the base.When you contact the manufacturer to request a replacement, they will want you to conduct a series of tests over the phone (BEEP!) with them. My wife called and VTech said that it would take about fifteen minutes to conduct a diagnostic test. Anyone who has had a young child in their life knows you don't have extra time to troubleshoot a trivial baby monitor (BEEP!) over the phone. {Paging the "Ain't nobody got time for that" lady} You are required to conduct these tests with them before they will replace your unit (BEEP!) even when it is still within the one year warranty period.If you want a baby monitor that will constantly wake you up (BEEP!)ing in the middle of the night then this unit gets five stars! Hey, VTech, if you think I have time to fix your device then you can go (BEEP) yourself!
