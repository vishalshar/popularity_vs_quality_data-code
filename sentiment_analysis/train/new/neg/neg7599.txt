I'm a dog breeder with a small amount of dogs that are in and out the door all the time.  this gate works great to keep them out of the room that they don't need to be in.  The latch could use a re-design because it's a PITA to use but otherwise, it's great.  I doubt it would work well for a child though.  the dogs don't lean on it but the couple times they pushed on it, it popped open.  I don't think it's secure enough for a child.  Certainly would never put it at the top of the stairs, that's deadly accident waiting to happen !!
