I like this item. I no longer have to worry about my son hitting his head against the water spout. It's an ok spout protector, the only downside and reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is no place on this on and pull up the little knob on your spout so that you can shower without having to remove this device. It's quite annoying and I wish I would have seen the other ones that can stay on while you shower because they have the right parts so you can pull up the little shower device on your spout. Its cute for kids because it shoots water out of its mouth but annoying for parents. Shop around first. I guess it's fine if you have a separate bathroom from your kids.
