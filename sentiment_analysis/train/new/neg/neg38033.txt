I wish I had researched these a bit more carefully before I bought them. I was sucked in by the cute contrast stitching and "organic" material. However once I washed them for the first time I realized I had wasted my money. Let's face it, the price isn't cheap for only five cloths. When you first receive them they are super soft and the perfect size but after one wash (on delicate, with baby detergent, and dried on low) they were pilley, paper thin, and had shrunk to a size that is way too small to be effective. Yes, I suppose you could delicately hand wash them and line dry them, but is this really going to get something clean that you are using to absorb baby spit up and drool, I don't think so. I would NOT recommend these!!!
