Got this to protect our DVD player and cable box from the meandering hands of our 1 year old.  It came with velcro squares that you can use to affix to your appliances, which I was wary of doing.  In some cases you may be able to put the short lip of the guard under the appliance and the weight of the appliance will hold it in place.  Our son figured this out instantly and pulled it off numerous times, so I had to resort to using the velcro strips.  This seems to be doing the trick so far, though it's a bit of a pain to have to detach every time we need to put a DVD in.
