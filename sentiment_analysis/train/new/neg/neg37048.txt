Nothing really bad to say about this very affordable accessory, but there is just not a whole lot of intrigue to it either.  Out of the smaller toys, it is one of the more difficult to grip, but my five-month old daugher plays with it on occassion.  She loves her Taggies; this is just not one of the top ranking items.
