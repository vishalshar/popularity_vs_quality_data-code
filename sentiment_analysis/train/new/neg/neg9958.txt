I should have either gone with a more expensive model or skipped out altogether on this purchase.  It's basically a toy.  The tip constantly falls off.  I realize it is meant to be replacable, but it shouldn't stay in the ear of the person your looking into the ear of.  Being what I now know about ear infections (that they don't necessarily need to be treated every time), I think I should just leave the diagnosing to the professionals and then I can decide whether or not to administer antibiotics.The good news is that when my son is old enough that the peices are not considered a choking hazard, I can probably give this to him to play doctor with.
