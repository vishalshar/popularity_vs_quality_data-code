I had these with baby #1 and I LOVED them. Totally 5 stars.. until my husband accidentally microwaved one too long and it burst.Fast forward to now, I just bought a new set, as we are expecting baby#2, and I want a full pair of working boobie warmers (My husband and I call them tittie toasters, because I used them primarily for heating, and I love alliteration.). I received these a couple of days ago, and they came without the covers that keep the pads from being directly on the skin. That worries me because I don't have the old set, and I don't want a heating pad directly on the skin, it's not safe. Just wondering if it was supposed to come this way or not? When I bought them before, just the two pack, it came with covers.
