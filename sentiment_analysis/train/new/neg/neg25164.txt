I understand that you get what you pay for, and the table has a pleasing appearance, but the quality is shoddy beyond belief. Nothing lined up right when we were putting it together, the drawer sides were bowed and crackled warningly when I tried to screw them on so I didn't tighten the screws all the way, the back piece was cut crooked and didn't fit in its groove. The inside of the drawers is unfinished. I'm going to have to get some drawer liner or something before I put my baby's things in there and heaven help me if splinters end up on her clothes. If it fits your budget, go for it, but know what you're getting. I will think twice before buying anything from Summer Infant again.
