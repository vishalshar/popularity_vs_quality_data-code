The towel arrived quickly and looked very cute. It's a little thinner than some other towels I've tried but was good enough. The problem is that it ripped after the first wash. It was washed on gentle cycle with other clothes and when I pulled it out one side of the hood was completely ripped open. Very disappointed with the quality.
