While I like the concept of table toppers, this one is NOT one that I would recommend.  It sticks well on most surfaces, but the print on the table topper is too bright and distracting.  Our 1-year old sometimes can't spot little pieces of food lying right there in front of her!  I would have much preferred a simpler design (preferably without cartoon characters) and a lighter color.
