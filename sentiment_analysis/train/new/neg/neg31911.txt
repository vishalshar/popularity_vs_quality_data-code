I would say I had high expectations for these. I use the Flip Hybrid cloth diapers and had tried their inserts as well as some charcoal bamboo (which I didn't realize aren't eco friendly). Although I liked both inserts I still wanted something that would keep moisture away better from my sons skin and be super absorbent, so I got these based on reviews. I've only been using them on him for a couple of days but so far he has soaked through his diaper (which he hasn't done with the other inserts) and I change him every hour or 2, and when I change him their bunched up. Maybe my son is just a heavy wetter and perhaps neeed doublers or something when I use them, but I had higher hopes for these.
