I had a  lot of trouble putting the gate together and installing.  Take the rubber ends off rods to insert through the fabric.It's the only way to get them through, but then it's difficult to get them back on. I would recommend it to be a two-person job.  The gate looks nice when up but the spring bars are extremely stiff. OK if baby is the offspring of a WWF fighter.
