I too purchased the gym for my grandchildren and after a month or two the star stopped themusic.  We replaced the batteries but the music did not come on.  The first star was replaced and it also worked for a month or so.  Now what, by then the children were past that baby phase so I put it back in the box for my second round of grandchildren.  We I took it out a couple of weeks ago I again phoned for a replacement by was told it is discontinued.  But ........I like the music as well as the children so I wasnt about to give up.  I opened it up to check the wiring and if everything was in working order.  The music did not work but the colors that went with the music did.  As I was tinkering around,with the sound was on, I pressed on the music chip to see if it was lose.the srew stuck to it and it started playing all the sound as before.But I could not leave the small screw driver in it so I took one of the screw and put it in the music (in one of the 4 holes on top).  So then I tried the same on the next one and it worked, guess it needed some kind of grounding.  SOOOO  dont throw the toy away, try this andsee if it works for you as it does for me.
