I use a set of monitors to be able to hear my kids while I'm in the office, and I also leave one in the bedroom so at night I can hear if the door is opened or one of the kids get up.Cons.... I keep getting a beeping noise letting me know that the connection is lost. The issue is that I am only 50 feet from the monitor.  For the price and the range they claim, forget it.This may be small, but the units are skinny and they get tipped over easy. Not a major issue, but not very handy.When they are connected, they have that "hsssss" kind of sound all the time. They seem to broadcast even when there is no noise.Last, they do not have a "talk" button.  You can not speak from the unit you carry.  It may not be a big deal, but I used these for 1 week. The lost connection drove me nuts, and I ordered a different set.  Here is the link to the new set  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007NG5UEU?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00They are called  "VTech DM221-2 Safe & Sound Digital Audio Baby Monitor with Two Parent Units"  these cost HALF the price, and work great.  I left a review on them, but for half the price, good connection, stable, same features PLUS a talk to the monitor button, you can't go wrong.
