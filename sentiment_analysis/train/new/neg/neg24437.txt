I bought two of these gates for my kids' rooms (to keep our puppies out). Their doorways are exactly 30" each. One of the gates works great - doesn't bow out and fits sturdy. The other one doesn't fit at the 30" mark (too loose) so I took it to one notch above 30" - probably 30.25" - and it fits OK, but still not as sturdy / even of a fit as the other one. The second one bows out a little. There is a 'catcher' on each gate to 'catch' the arm (that you use to secure the gate) and prevent it from bowing out. On the first one, the catcher works -- on the second one, the catcher keeps turning downward as it isn't that secure.I can definitely understand why some have written very positive reviews on these gates and others have written less than positive reviews. I have one of each. For us, it does the job - it keeps our puppies out. I also want to mention that the second gate falls off periodically and we need to reinstall it - which only takes seconds - it's just a minor pain. I've even tried switching the gates on the doorways - and it is the gate, not the doorway.Our puppies are small - shih-tzu - so they can't knock the gate down. I would not recommend this gate for anyone trying to keep a larger dog and/or a toddler out - they could probably knock it down easily, especially if given a less than sturdy version.
