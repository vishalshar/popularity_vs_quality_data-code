Incredibly BAD service! BUYER BEWARE. This $1000 stroller arrived defective (handles were different lengths, so slightly uneven), and the second time I used it several small pieces inside the wheel assembly broke and the wheel popped off.  I contacted this seller and they basically told me to shove it. They refused to do a return or exchange and referred me to the manufacturer. Apparently they only allow 30 days for a return, and they won't ever make an exception even though we couldn't realistically have known about the defect before then.Like most people, we ordered this before the baby came.. Well, it took a week for the stroller to arrive. The day it came, we went into labor. Then we had a newborn baby in the middle of the most stormy, frozen winter in our lifetimes, so no, we didn't take the stroller for a walk around the block with a week-old baby. It wasn't until 6 weeks after it arrived that we actually had a chance to use it and discovered the defects. I contacted them them a few days later and they refused to do anything. In addition, the customer service person was rude in the emails.Now I see the incredibly high number of bad reviews for this terrible seller and I wish I'd looked this up before buying from them. NOT worth it! Whatever you need, get it from somewhere else.
