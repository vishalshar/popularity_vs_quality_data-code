OK So the sippy cup does have a nice soft nipple but everytime my child drops or throws it (he's 11 months and throws everything) the valve inside pops out and the cup is no longer spill proof.  It is not a faulty cup because i bought two and they both have the problem.  Not a great choice, and too bad because the design is nice almost like a sports bottle but I who wants a sippy cup that the have to monitor their child with so that the dont drop or throw it and then leak it all over themselves or the house.
