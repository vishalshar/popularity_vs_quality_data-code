My first purchase from Target was great! It was thick, I put it on my new born's face and body. A small tube lasted for a long time. It felt quite nice during winter and my baby smelled good! Then I bought two more tubes from Amazon, to my surprise, they were much more watery! At the same time, my pediatrician suggested me not to use fragrant moisturizers, so I stopped using it. When my baby was 8 month old, was having diarrhea, I happened to run out of Aquaphor, I used it instead on my baby's red sensitive butt, he screamed and burst into tears!  I immediately switched to A&Z diaper cream and he was fine! I probably will never use it again on my baby, but it still could be a nice winter cream for adults!
