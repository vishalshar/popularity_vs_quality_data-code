I just installed these a couple of days ago, so I will downgrade my review if I have any problems in the future. Mine came with a 3M tape, and the installation seems very sticky. They are certainly installed firmly enough that my toddler daughter will not be able to pull them off, and that was the whole point. The only reasons I knocked off a couple stars are:1. The installation tape comes in pre-cut strips, so you have to use several of them. It would have been better if they sent a roll of the double sided tape instead. If the tape was in one roll, that would also make installation of the foam strip easier because you could put one piece of tape on the foam, and just pull the backing away from the two ends to get it aligned properly before pulling off the rest of the backing and securing the middle of the strip to the table.2. The foam strip develops something of a shape memory from being rolled up in the package, and by the time you get to the center of the roll, you really have to fight against that curved shaped to install the tape and get the strip installed on the table in a straight manner. It would have been better if it came in strips (perhaps two 6-foot strips or four 3-foot strips), but I do realize this would have also increased the shipping cost.3. There were no directions included. I am sure there must have been some things that would have made installation easier, but they included no directions other than simple pictures showing to put the tape on the foam and stick the foam on the table.
