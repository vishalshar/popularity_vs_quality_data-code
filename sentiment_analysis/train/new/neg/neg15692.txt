This product is a good value when compared to other stroller covers.  It is nice and warm, and even my busy 18-mo-old doesn't mind being bundled up in it.  However, the zippers do get stuck a lot.  I had the same problem with the zippers on the infant bundle me, but it didn't stop me from purchasing the toddler version because I didn't want to spend twice as much.
