This wrap works great for my little guy. He was about 7lbs when I got it. He falls right to sleep in it. It doesn't hurt my back. We have taken it on two hikes. I only have two issues with it. It gets hot. My husband had a huge sweat stain on his chest after out first hike. And my little guy usually wakes up crying in the wrap after a couple hours from being hot and scrunched up. He's is not big enough to let his legs hang out. When I pull him out his feet are red and he is gassy and he screams. I have it a 3 because it let's me get stuff done and he is fine as long as I don't leave him in it for a long time. I'm she this well improve when he can hang his feet out.
