Hate this seat. If you use it with the carseat, as we are doing due to the birth of our newborn, there is hardly any room for the 18 month old.  The seat faces the rear only and the car seat juts right into the poor girls face. Also, the sunshade is a joke. It is but a tiny little piece that hardly covers half her head. There is ZERO protection. And we can't face her away from the sun as it rear faces only. Even when the newborn is out of the car seat and using the regular seat, the rumble seat won't face forward by design and we still have this problem. Total fail. The passenger in this seat has to wear a hat & sunscreen or she will burn. Unfortunately, our little one refuses to have anything on her head so she either sits there in full sun, we don't go anywhere until the sun is down, or we get a new stroller all togther. With $1100 already invested (Vista, car seat, rumble seat), we are hesitant but will just dump the entire stroller and get a different one, from a different maker. Also I have lost all confidence in Uppa  Baby as a brand. We bought the Vista in 2014 when our baby was born. We liked it and knew of its two seat capabilities but we didn't think we would need it as we didn't anticipate a second baby, but alas one came in 2015. As such, we had to get the rumble seat. UB decided to change everything in 2015 so we had to rush and get this before it became completely extinct (according to BuyBuy Baby and UB customer service). I would not buy this seat unless you really have to. The seller on Amazon was great and it's not their fault UB sucks.
