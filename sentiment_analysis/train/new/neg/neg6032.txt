So this is perfect...Decided to get this for my little brother so he had a recording of me when he wanted to hear my voice as I am 2000 miles away. Package arrived today. I immediately opened it so I could record my voice, then send it off to him so he could receive it before Christmas. Ive been sitting here for 20 minutes trying to get the recorder to record more than half a second. Something is wrong with it big time. Now I have to figure out how the hell to get this thing to work before the end of the day. Made in China. Gotta be proud!
