First off, the bag they come in is for all intents and purposes useless.  Don't buy these expecting to keep them in this bag as it's pretty cheap and with one good tug, the suction cups that are sewn into the thin vinyl backing of the bag would likely rip right out.  The toys themselves are cute enough and my 7 month old seems to enjoy them but they don't really "snap" together as advertised.  At most you can put two or three together before they fall apart.If you are looking for an inexpensive way to fill your basket of bath toys with something that is safe and would provide ok fun for your kiddo - these are your toys.
