I ordered the tot lock magnetic key to replace the one we misplaced (suspect 2 year old threw it away :)). The magnetic key that arrived in the mail is not the Tot-Lok that is pictured. It looks as if it is a older generation version. The package says Safety 1st magnetic locking system key but it is shaped differently and when held up to the cabinet did not unlock like the original Tot-Lok we had did. I called Amazon and they told me they would resend the item to me and expedited the shipping to me for free. Unfortunately, when the package arrived it was the same key I had received from them the 1st time. Either the picture is wrong on the website or the information not accurate. I am returning both for a refund and had to order directly from the Tot-Lok company which I believe is not owned by Safety 1st (maybe used to?).
