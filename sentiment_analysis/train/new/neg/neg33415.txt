I bought this to carry snacks and formula for my 9 month old and I wanted different sizes. Although the set comes with a mix of 2sizes, the lids are horrible. The twist on threading is too tight/not finished well. Its neither a twist on nor a snap shut lid. A bit of both is a bad idea. In addition the snack box itself is bendable, so you cannot get a grip to twist off the lid open. I tried for 10 minutes and finally just pulled open the Lid by deforming the box. the colors are pretty and the size is what i wanted, but that's about it. It would have been perfect if I could actually get it to work for me.One thing they got right is that the baby cannot open it (if I cannot, I don't think my son can).Save yourself some time, Search for other products!
