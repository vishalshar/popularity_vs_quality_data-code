All of the product descriptions and questions answered on Amazon say that this bassinet is appropriate up to 25lbs or 5 months, however the product itself says it's only good up to 10lbs or 3 months, whichever comes first. I don't know if the item has changed and Amazon has just failed to update the specs on the new model, but upon receiving the bassinet I was really annoyed that you can only use it for a baby up to 10 pounds. That is potentially only one month of use. What a waste of time and money. I am returning this product. Who wants a bassinet that you can only use for a month? I will continue looking for a better item.
