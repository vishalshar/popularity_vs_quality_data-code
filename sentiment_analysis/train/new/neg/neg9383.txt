Bought these because all the reviews on the fabric ones were poor. The moment I opened the packaging I knew I'd never use it. It's like an origami project. The last thing I need to deal with while wrestling a squirmy baby into a high chair in a public place. If you have a personal assistant who can set this up for you before you slide the kid in, then great, get it.
