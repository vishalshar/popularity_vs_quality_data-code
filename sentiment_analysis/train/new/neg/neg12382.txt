If I had written this review when I bought the cup 6 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars. Now, my baby is 14 months old. We try and give her a regular cup as much as we can. Sometimes, though, we need to give her a drink in a cup that won't spill - and these are perfect for that. The problem now is that she has teeth and she bites on the end of the spout. We do our best to discourage this, but it only takes a second and POOF - she's bitten a huge hole in the end. (Check out the pictures of this listing - someone posted an image of EXACTLY what happens when the child bites off the end.) I've started to get worried about giving her the cup, as I found her chewing on a piece of silicone she got off of the end. It wasn't enough that she would have choked, but still not good for her. Thus, I've had to buy replacement nipples ALL THE TIME. I bought 5 of these cups in different styles and I am about to go buy replacement spout #6 & #7. Bottom line: this is a great cup for a transition from the bottle. But, once your baby has teeth, you'll be buying replacement spouts until the cows come home or you switch to a cup with a hard spout.
