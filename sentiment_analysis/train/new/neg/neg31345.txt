Wow... this doesn't even swing out of the way! I have to remove the entire bar from both sides, with both hands so that my child can get in and out.

My only other option right now is a tray, but that's heavier, bulkier, cuts into the child's seating space, and we don't need a snack tray. If only the bar swung out...
