It's the right size and works how you would expect a thermos to work. So no issues with the product itself. But since it's marketed for kids, the characters are the decision maker. My 2 year old is all over Little Einsteins. The pictured art is what I got but it was so faded/discolored that it looked used. Anyone can notice it. This could be enough to make certain kids cry. So keep that in mind if your kid is particular about details or things being "right." My son doesn't really care so I'll keep it but it was disappointing.
