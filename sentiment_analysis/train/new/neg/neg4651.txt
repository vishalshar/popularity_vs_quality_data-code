While these discs will still fit on the top of an Avent Natural bottle and hold a seal, they don't fit snugly in the nipple hole like they do with Avent Classic bottles. So milk won't leak or spill, but when you unscrew the ring, you have two pieces to mess with. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a sealing disc for the Natural bottles- hopefully they're coming soon!UPDATE: I did, however, learn that the rings for Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottle Screw Rings, 4-Pack fit on Avent natural bottles, so I just ordered some rings and now the seal fits nicely in the ring on my Natural bottles!!
