First let me say we love Taggies products and have many including clothes. When l got this blanket it did not appear to be a Taggies brand so l called kids 2 and they confirmed that it is not a Taggies. As you can see on the blanket on the left (a very loved blanket we own, so much so on that on same day as this I ordered a new one just like it from another company) one ribbon is always a Taggies logo ribbon none are on this. I will be returning this one. It did have what appears to be a Taggies paper tag attached to it with the kids 2 company logo they stated they do not know how another company would have gotten it.
