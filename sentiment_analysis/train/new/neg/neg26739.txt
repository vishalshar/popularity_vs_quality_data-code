i have used the Original for over 3 years with my first child.  I used the Original with the second child until the day I lost it.  I bought this one in October 2012.  I have tried to work with it and like it since it is not returnable.  Every time I used it, the bottom curved part would hurt my hip bone, after a few minutes, my son would scream in pain (after his leg has gone numb).  I did try customer service to tell them the issue and even after telling them i am going 5 years on using Ergos, their replies insists that I am doing something wrong.  The only difference is that it is this model and not the Original that I lost.  If someone would like to trade me for the original, I would be glad to.  This is practically new. Maybe worn 8 times since purchased - not very long since it hurts me.  Maybe because I'm 5' 4". Again, no issues with the Original.
