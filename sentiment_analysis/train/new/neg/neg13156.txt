These look great and are easy to fit on to the already awesome Orbit Stroller. You can install and uninstall them really fast.However, they are only good enough for a couple of bottles of water and some small items. You can't really use them for Shopping of any kind. Installing them makes the stroller too wide for most aisles and hard to navigate and these don't add much space. You can barely store anything in them.For non shopping outings, you may be able to get rid of the diaper bag by storing stuff in these but again you would barely make it with everything that's needed. Its far easier to just hang a diaper bag on the hand rails.I would recommend skipping these as they are not very useful.
