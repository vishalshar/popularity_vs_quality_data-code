The monitor works well.  We actually tried a Samsung before this and the picture quality in the dark wasn't good enough.  The Summer Infant was good enough in the dark.  So we are happy with the monitor until....the recall.  There is a recall on the batteries because they are likely to explode.  The same day the new report came out I filled out the online application with Summer and 6 weeks later still no replacement battery.  Today I get a letter saying they are still working on it but it's a lot of work and very time consuming to order, receive & replace these batteries and they will get it to me when they can.  Any parent out there knows how helpful of a tool a monitor can be to make sure your baby is safe.  Can you image going 6+ weeks without a baby monitor???  I will never by another Summer Infant product again.  They used a cheap China made battery and wont take the proper steps to correct the problem.
