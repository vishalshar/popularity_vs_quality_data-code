Discount manufacturing is right.  It came today and it is VERY small.  Just to explain the sizing...  I purchased the 2t-4t.  My daughter will be 3 in December and still wearing 24 months, so to say the least, she is tiny.  It fit fine for her size (but you will need to order a size up.  I ordered this in this size because the reviews expressed to order a size up, but since she is small, I thought the 2t-4t would work). But when my daughter went to take it off, one of the straps broke.  This is for a Halloween costume.  I don't really have time to return it, so I'm going to sew it back on.  It's nothing fancy and the straps are incredibly flimsy.
