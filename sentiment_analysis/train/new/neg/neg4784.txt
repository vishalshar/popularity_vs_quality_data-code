I didn't realize until after I got this, that the disposable inserts (by ziploc) that are made to go with this are discontinued. It comes with 5 sample inserts, which actually don't work. Due to the defective cap, which leaks, there is not enough seal to make the liner collapse. I would not buy this. I should have read the reviews for this product more carefully, as they are negative overall.I would only buy this if I already had the regular (non-disposable) breastflow disposable bottle, in order to replace the nipple only.
