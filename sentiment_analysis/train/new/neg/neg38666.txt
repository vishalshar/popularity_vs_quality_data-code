they are great but very bulky. i will probably try these on my son when he is older. Right now he is too little for these and they are a little to large to put on him at this time. They look like they would do great, i just do not like them on my skinny little boy. I tried making the cover bigger but it did not seem to fit right. So i will see as he gets older to try them out when he is a toddler.
