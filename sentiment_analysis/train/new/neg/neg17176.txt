These hooks are a great idea and came in real handy for hanging things off the stroller (purses, diaper bags, shopping bags, etc). They were much more convenient than using the straps that came with our diaper bag.I never had problem with the swivel closure staying put like some other reviews mentioned, but after a couple months one of the hooks snapped (which is why I'm only giving them 3 stars).They were nice hooks and if they had been made out of more durable material I'd probably still be using them.
