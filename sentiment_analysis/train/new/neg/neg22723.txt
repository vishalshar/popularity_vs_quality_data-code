We have an 18 month old and currently use the Summer Night and Day monitor and love it!  I am expecting in November so we were on the look out for a good multi camera system.  AFter reading reviews this was the second one we decided to try and after the first night I knew that this was probably not the system we were going to stick with.  The menu system is a little clunky and when the monitor is on the auto-scan mode between cameras it takes it a good 5-6 seconds at times to have the camera adjust and give you a viewable picture.  The camera's actually have red lights that light up each time it scans to that camera when you are in night vision mode.  It didn't bother my daughter but I could see where it could bother a small child.  The thing that put me off the most was that both times we tried to use the monitor after a full charge it died within 2 hours.  my daughter naps longer than that so we knew right then that this was not the system for us.  We also only live in a 2700 Sq ft house and had a few moments of signal problems here and there.  We ended up with the Summer Infant Sleek and Secure Multiview and am loving it! After using the new summer system it frustrated me that the 2 systems we tried before it had such horrible menu systems and lack of buttons on the monitor itself.  I don't want to go into a menu to make it stop scanning or shut the screen off.  This system also does not have continuous audio like we had gotten used to in the summer systems.
