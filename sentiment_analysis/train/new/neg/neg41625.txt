I was so excited to receive the flowers for my baby but when I opened the package I was so disappointed. The quality is terrible. If you are interested in seen the real pictures of what you get please contact me. It has glue on the fabric. The fabric has been cut terrible and it looks it has been sewed it by hand because the sewing quality is lousy. DONT BUY IT
