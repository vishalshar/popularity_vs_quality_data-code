This mirror gets high marks from me on appearance. The straps and edging for the blue one are tan/beige which matches my seats. It's very cute, without being childish.The Velcro actually works well to keep it in place. Baby hasn't arrived yet but I have driven my car around with the mirror in place, to test it out. It holds up just as well as any other mirror and hasn't come loose in the Velcro at all.That said, I think baby will look very small in the mirror. I have attached photos taken from right in front of the mirror as well as from the drivers seat, using the rear view mirror and simply looking back. You can see the actual chair is much bigger compared to what shows in the round baby mirror. The reflection from the mirror is definitely not the large image that is in the photoshopped product images.Will I be able to see baby much at all to make it worth using this mirror? I hope so! I will have to wait a few weeks before I know. I plan to update my review later.UPDATE: Sadly, this mirror will not work for us. I tried it after baby was born and had a hard time seeing when his eyes were open or closed. I swapped it for the Britax mirror which has a larger reflection, but is easily nudged out of place. I tried this mirror again for a few days and still could not get it in any decent position to see my baby's face. It was fine if I turned around to have a look, but not with the rear view mirror. Back to the Britax for us.
