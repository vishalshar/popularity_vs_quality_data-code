I bought this drum for my 1 year old to pound on. It has lasted a few months. I am not sure if she sat on it or it was stepped on, or if was simply leaned on, but the siding is a thin piece of decorated cardboard that is woven together at the seams. The top and bottom fit into grooves in the plastic pieces. No adhesive or anything holds it together. The siding has crinkled and collapsed beyond straightening out and the cardboard has come out of the grooves. I have seen other reviews that mention this product should last forever. I doubt it. The sound is great, the rest of the toy is great, but it is held together with cardboard. Junk.
