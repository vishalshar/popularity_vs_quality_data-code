I LOVE the cupcake bib. My complaint is I ordered two of the cupcake bibs for gifts I needed quickly. I got two different bibs and I don't like the one with a flower rather than a cupcake. That bib is also pink. If I wanted two different bibs, I would have placed an order for two different bibs. I wanted them to match and now I don't have the identical bibs for their gift.
