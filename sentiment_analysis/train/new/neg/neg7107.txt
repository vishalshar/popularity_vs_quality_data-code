Milk in the pump every. Single. Time. I'm disappointed in this pump... It was recommended to me by a lactation consultant so I bought it, despite already having an Ameda Purely Yours. It pumps great, don't get me wrong, but I managed to get milk in the tubes after almost every pumping session. (And for the record, I don't make too much milk nor do I hunch over the pump, as the troubleshooting would suggest). I bought extra tubing and I suggest you do the same thing. I wish I could return or re-sell but sadly pumps aren't allowed for that bc of hygiene issues. :(
