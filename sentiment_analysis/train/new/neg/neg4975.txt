Our daughter is clumsy and our house is small so there is always something to run into. She has fallen and gotten bruises all over especially her head. I felt like a horrible parent and hated seeing her hurt so we thought maybe a helmet. We always jokes a helmet is cheaper than the insurance deductible. Then I looked for a helmet. This one was top rated and didn't seem so hokey. So i purchased and when it came (wrong color ) I put it on her. She is 15 months and has a average size head. It was so loose but stayed on. Except when she didn't want to wear it she ripped it off. I couldn't get her to put it back on. I wish it would have worked. Its really well made and nice feeling. But the whole thing is huge. The elastics bands didnt have to stretch when I tried it on. It was too big on my 4 year old and 2 year old as well.
