I would give these 5 stars but I think the stitching around the edge may have ruined my iron..I didn't get these for baby wipes but instead got them to carry in a small wet bag in my purse in place of tissues. I'm OCD (like I mean really!) and I was trying to iron them and the serger stitching around the edge (that I assumed was cotton) melted to my iron a little bit. It's not awful just a few lines on my iron but I use it to iron some of my other personal cloth reusables and in my sewing so I'm a little perturbed. ESPECIALLY since it really didn't get the creases out of the fabric.. I will have to dry them flat from now on to keep them from wrinkling.That being said they feel like they will be perfect for my needs!
