This carseat seems safe enough, however, it's inconvenient in a couple of ways.  First, the crotch buckle consists of 2 separate plastic pieces, which must first be matched up (which is difficult to do if the infant is struggling) before being inserted into the buckle.  Also, I'm not sure that the plastic pieces are as heavy-duty as a metal buckle would be.  Also, the sun cover seems to be in the way of the carrying handle (or vice-versa).  I feel like the plastic piece which connects the sun cover to the carseat is cheap and could easily break, rendering it useless.  The straps rub against my baby's neck, causing a lot of redness and chafing, so I've had to purchase a product to wrap around the straps to prevent this from happening.  Maybe if the straps were positioned a fraction of an inch further from the center, this wouldn't be a problem.Overall, it's nice to have a way to transport baby from the car to the store/restaurant without having to wake him up, but I think other brands of car seat are a better option.  I wouldn't recommend this one.Also, diapers.com was terribly slow to send it!  It supposedly came with free 2-day shipping, and it took 9 days to get here!
