The clips on the lunchbox are great, the rest of the backpack :no. The overall material of this bag is far cheaper than I expected of a bag as expensive as this one. The top clip used to hook it on things unclips on it's own all of the time, and so the backpack ends up falling to the floor instead of hanging up on a hook by the door.  The worst part - and I contacted the manufacturers directly and they they have not responded to me - is that the actual lunch bag randomly won't zip closed. I have played with the zip trying to figure out if there is a trick to it - there isn't, it just sometimes stops working leaving my son's lunch hanging out. So the whole reason I spent more than I usually do is null and void. I'm buying a new backpack this weekend from a store where I can look and touch to really verify the quality - and I am returning this backpack to Amazon. I hope I can still return it - it has been over 30 days, but when I originally went to return it I found out I had to send it back before they will refund me. My son will have no backpack and I don't have money budgeted to buy another one while we wait. Overall, not happy with this order!!!!**UPDATE**I was able to contact Amazon once school let out and get a full refund. This was after the return deadline that comes with the product, so I am very happy with the way Amazon handled the issue. I asked for a refund though, rather than a replacement because I don't agree with other reviews that this is a good quality product. Overall it feels really cheaply made and to have the zipper break on the lunch box so soon after purchase isn't acceptable quality IMO.
