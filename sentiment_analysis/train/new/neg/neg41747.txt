I thought my baby, who loves to pull tissues from boxes and unravel toilet paper, would love this. She just isn't into it. I think it doesn't have enough handkerchiefs for her, or she just doesn't get the same thrill. I've taken to loading baby wipe containers with cloth wipes that she can pull and i can continually stuff.
