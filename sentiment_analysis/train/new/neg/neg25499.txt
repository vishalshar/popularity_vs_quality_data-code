I am at the weaning stage and bought this to put in some very small tubs plus a sippy cup, it just about fits that plus spoons and a bib, I wish it were deeper. Also I have another Fridge To Go case, in that one the freezer pack is removable but for this one, you have to put the whole tote in the freezer which takes up a little too much room in the freezer. Had I realised that before purchasing, I don't think I would have bought it.
