I bought these bath toys to replace "squirties" that were constantly getting moldy. Well unfortunately one of these (the green with ball that moves around) still gets moldy. There is space between the ball and sides so no matter how well I shake it out, water gets trapped in there and it becomes slimy...gross. The mirror one is completely useless (as a mirror). You cannot see your image in the mirror, but it works just fine as a boring floaty.  The yellow rattle one is the only one worth while. It makes noise which children like and it has no parts to get moldy.  I had high hopes for this set, but another wasted toy set for us.
