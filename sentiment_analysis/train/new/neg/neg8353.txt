We did some serious research before picking up this stroller for our 3 1/2 year old son and new born daughter.  All of the reviews made it seem like the perfect fit for what we were looking for.  We selected the product because of the light weight of the product and the reviews but once we recieved the product at  home and tried it out it was clear that it would not work for us and we ultimately returned it before ever taking it out of the house.  Here was the problem for us.  Once the baby car seat is installed there is not enough room for our 3 1/2 year old to sit comfortably on the step.  He litterally had to lean forward because the front seat has to be fully reclined to support the car seat.  The benh seat does shift backwards but the foot rest for the back seat does not so his feet were behind him.  "Mommy I am not comfortable" came out in the first 30 seconds of sitting on the stroller.  This was a huge disappointment to us.  The Product was beautifully constructed, was very light, has a sharp modern look to it, rides well, and folds easily but if you are in a situation to have to use the car seat with a toddler that wants to sit down I do not recommend it.  Hope this helps
