I thought this would be great for my 6 month old who is constantly putting anything and everything in her mouth.  It's really neat that there are so many different rings and the base squeaks (she likes that part--instant smile).  The colors are vibrant and there are a ton of different textures.  But my little one doesn't seem to care too much about it and she's now 9 months old.
