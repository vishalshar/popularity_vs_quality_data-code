Great deal for the price, but if I were to go back... I'd spring the extra $30 for better quality bedding.The little extras thrown in to give you the impressive '13 pieces,' they're cheap and you wont use them.The bumper is super poor quality that falls down. My son is 1 and a half and it's still up because it's a good barrier to keep his paci in the crib at night, but it crumples down. It doesnt have any support to stay up, so it has literally squished to a 1 inch barrier around the bars. No matter how many times I try, it just falls. I love the quilt, but that's the extent of my affection for the set... but I've never laid it on my son, it's just a cute crib hanging sunlight blocker for naptime.
