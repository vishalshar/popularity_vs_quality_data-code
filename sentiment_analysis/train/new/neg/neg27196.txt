have had this stroller for a couple of years now. really hate it. doesn't look comfortable, kids feet dangle too easily, the straps are a nightmare, and perhaps the WORST thing about the product is the horrendous customer service by the company itself -- ZERO support -- and total lack of willing, authorized service providers! even the providers listed on their site -- and they are few and far between where we are in the NYC area -- say they cannot so much as repair simply a damaged wheel. what a joke.
