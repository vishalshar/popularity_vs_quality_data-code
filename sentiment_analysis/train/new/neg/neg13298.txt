I realize the description says "â€¢100% Microfiber Polyester", but I still expected more coming from Boppy. This would have been my fourth boppy cover (for different kiddos), and this was a huge disappointment. I ended up returning it, it just felt so cheap! It was not what I would consider to be soft by any means and I would not for one minute want my newborn's skin touching the fabric! Lesson learned, not all boppy covers are created equal.
