I didn't want to believe that the reviews stating how urine gets between the potty seat and the toilet seat... but its true, totally true.  I have a 2 year old girl that likes to watch her pee come out, therefore causing her urine to shoot straight out, or up and out like a rainbow.  Saw this seat, which is one piece, with a huge pee catcher hump, all of which I thought would have worked out for us.  It would have been a great design, but there is one HUGE flaw, and that is that pee does get stuck between the chair and the seat.  This is very VERY annoying.If you could redesign this seat to make it that the lip that sits inside the toilet seat, instead of 3 little lips, make it one big lip around the bottom of the seat, I could give you 5 stars!  But this is a major flaw in the design of this seat, and is not recommended for anyone to use, unless you like cleaning up the extra pee that's laying around due to this seat.I am starting to think that the positive reviews are those of the company employees.  I hear that this manufacturing company, as well as many others, force their staff to purchase items they make as to post a phony and positive review of their products/company.  This is a practice that is becoming more and more prevalent on Amazon.
