Put on on the fridge and one on the oven. I placed it high up on the fridge so that he could not reach. Instead, he gave the door a big yank & broke it. The sticky tabs on the underside of the plastic are very low quality and do not hold it in place very well. I even cleaned my fridge with alcohol to make sure it would stick.The oven one is still in place. That is only because he walked right up to it, pushed the button, and opened the oven. If you push the big button on one of the pieces and it unhooks. Any child could figure this out easily.The design is very poor to keep a child out if placed within its reach. The craftsmanship is ultra poor due to cheap materials. You're better off spending a little extra on something that will actually work. How badly do you want your little one kept out of your appliances?
