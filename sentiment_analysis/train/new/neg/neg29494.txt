This nightlight is supposed to have sensors that allows it to automatically turn on in the dark and off in the light.  However, the product I got does not have this feature.  Not sure if they sent the wrong product (although what I received was exactly what is on the picture) or they have false advertising.  I have to manually turn it off to turn it off during the day.  Also, the product description says that it has an option to have it screwed on to the electric socket, although I didn't see how it can be done.  The packaging does not state anything like that nor it has an instruction packet that instructs how to screw it on the wall.  It would have been a nice feature to be able to screw it on, since my daughter likes to pull things off and rub against our hardwood floor.  I rate it a 3 star because it does generate decent amount of light and it is true that it is cool to the touch even when it's on all day and night.  I wish they update the product description to remove the statement about it having light sensors and being able to be screwed on to the light socket.
