These fit better than our diaper covers and prefolds in the first few weeks, but after those first few weeks they were too tight around the legs, and they sometimes didn't contain everything, though we knew going in that these were not known for being perfect.  They are adorable and were easy to use, but pretty expensive for something that is used so briefly so few times.
