It's a good idea, but the suction is not strong enough to hold it up. I struggled with it for a while and kept hearing it fall into the tub. When I thought it finally stuck, it decided to wake me up at 4am and I'm not happy about it. I have something like this to hold up my phone in my car and that hasn't fallen off, but this suction is just not strong enough. The lever should be longer or something to get a tighter grasp onto the tile.
