The product itself is fine - but packaging was damaged, to the point of my not being able to give it as a gift.  Looks like it had been dropped or sat on (!) before it was shipped, because the cushioning inside the package was adequate, and the box exterior did not appear to have been damaged.  Disappointed, because the broken plastic housing affected the placement of the antennae, which could no longer stand upright at the "head" of the caterpillar.  Just laying inside the box, and could not be repaired, because that's where the plastic was damaged.
