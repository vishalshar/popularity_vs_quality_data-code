I'm stuck with these bottles because I have an Ameda pump that was free from my insurance. Otherwise I would be using the Medela bottles and pump. First, they are too small. You can fit 5 ounces at the most and I can usually pump 6 and sometimes more, this means I have to stop and hook up a new bottle which is  extremely inconvenient. Second, the lid design is very strange. The lid has two parts to it which makes it a pain for cleaning and also securing the lid on the bottle.
