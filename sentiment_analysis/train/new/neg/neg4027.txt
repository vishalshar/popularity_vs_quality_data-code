Not impressed. We ordered this for our Baby due in January & thought it was poor quality when we put it together. The stroller was hard to steer & the handle on the car seat seemed really flimsy. We returned this & decided to go with a more expensive better quality jogging travel system. I would give it one star but I gave it two because the design & colors are pretty. Otherwise don't waste your time buying this!
