Sleep sacks are awesome in general but this brand is not my favorite, I prefer the HALO brand. If you are trying to decide between this and HALO I would spend the extra couple bucks and just get HALO.The good: Cute pattern and double ended zipper which means you can zip up or down without having to re-thread the zipper end. Cool idea, but not necessary in my mind since I never unzip it all the way to the top during diaper changes anyways.The bad: Fabric is quite thin and not very soft. Even though the zipper pull tab is supposed to tuck under a flap of fabric at the top it tends to kind poke out near baby's neck/mouth.
