I purchased this sippy cup after using Dr. Brown's soft spout sippy cup.  My daughter loved the soft spout sippy cup, but the hard spout is horrible.  Mostly air comes out with sucking on it (I tried it myself after my daughter got frustrated trying).  I thought maybe I put it together wrong, so I took it apart and tried again--same result.  It wasn't even worth keeping it.
