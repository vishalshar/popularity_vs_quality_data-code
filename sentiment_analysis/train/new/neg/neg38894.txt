I ordered this set for my 2-year-old because we misplaced all our toddler silverware during a move (which we later found). The grips are fun and the spoon is wide so that he can scoop up yogurt, applesauce, and diced fruit easily. I, personally, feel the fork, which is the same as the spoon only with slats, is too wide and the slats don't really allow him the ability to pierce food. I definitely default to other forks in our collection that are narrower and easier to use.
