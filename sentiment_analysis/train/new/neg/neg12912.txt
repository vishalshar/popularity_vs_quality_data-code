The carrier seemed to be a great deal and had some pretty good reviews, but when I tried it on, I had to tighten the straps all the way down to the shortest they will go, and it was still pretty loose. I consider myself fairly average in size and still have some baby weight on me, about 5'6" and 145 lbs, and this was too large for me. When my son was in the carrier he felt secure, but the carrier holds him very high ( his head touches my chin) and I felt like I was going to tip over. It is nearly impossible to see where you are walking with him so high, I just can't see around him to the floor. The holes for his arms when he is facing towards me were too far back, and I had to keep his arms in front of his chest and not in the arm holes. The holes are in the right spot if he faces forward though. I got a backache in about 20 minutes, not enough time to take a walk or do anything in the house, which is why I bought it. The best description for this carrier is to imagine a school backpack worn on your chest instead of your back. I gave it 3 stars because I think someone with a larger frame or a stronger back may have better luck with this carrier. It is easy to use and get the baby into, not complicated at all, which I know is untrue of many of the carriers out there. It also didn't hurt my shoulders, which is another complaint of most carriers.
