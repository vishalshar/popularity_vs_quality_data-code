Like another reviewer, I am frustrated by this lemon of a swing that I can't get a full refund for because it was a gift. Dorel Juvenile Group is the manufacturer, but their refund process is cumbersome and doesn't allow for a refund without proof of purchase...impossible to produce since it was a gift and the registry no longer lists the price of an item received. From the first use, the waist strap buckles were difficult to unclasp without a significant struggle. Distracted by the demands of a new baby, we made the decision to continue using the swing without buckling the waist strap. For about one month our baby was soothed happily in the swing. Suddenly the swing motion stopped working consistently and the nature noises adapted a strange, warped sound. We promptly replaced the batteries, assuming low battery power was the problem. Approximately every second or third use, the motion and sound problems occur. But more important, and more frightening, are the problems with the waist strap buckles. As our daughter grew stronger and was moving around a great deal, we grew concerned about her safety in the swing without being buckled into the seat properly. Yet every time we buckled the straps, we had extreme difficulties getting her out. When I finally could not release her from the swing for nearly 10 minutes (a panic-stricken period in which she was crying frantically and I was panicking about how to get her out), I immediately set aside the swing and went to buy another by Fisher Price.
