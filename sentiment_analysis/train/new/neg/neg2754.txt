From the product description, this seat would fit most of the bikes. Well, out of the three bikes I own, it only fits on one of them (not the intended bike). The problem is the seat's design: the seat is inserted into a connector that will be installed on your bike frame. One of my bikes has the brake line blocking the connector while the other one has no bike carrier clearance above the rear wheel ( the carrier is right on top the wheel ).  I went to a bike shop trying to find a bike that would work with this seat. Out of 20 different models, only 2 might fit the description. I don't know how Britax defines "most" in their dictionary.
