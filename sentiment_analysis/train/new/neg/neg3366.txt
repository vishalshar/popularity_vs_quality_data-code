If I could give it negative stars I would! We ordered cheap starter furniture for my daughter from Target, which is actually amazing and still going strong. Figured I would do the same for my second but decided to spend a little more, so I purchased this. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!! Sure it looks cute and matched my crib perfectly, but it is the worst furniture I have ever owned. It has been falling apart since the day we put it together. I dread pulling open the drawers to remove clothes because I know that just means I am going to be spending the next 5-10 minutes putting every single drawer back on their tracks. I want to kick myself every time I go into my amazon orders and see how much money I wasted on this pile of crap!!
