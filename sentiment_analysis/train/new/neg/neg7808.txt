I should have known this wouldnt be compatible with all types of cribs! I have it attached to mine but not in the location its suppose to be where she can look in the mirror and play with the toys. Its at the bottom by the mattress but my daughter who is 7 months old goes to sleep to it and its not soft music either but she relaxes to it somehow. The only real flaw for me was if you have the sleigh type cribs that are thicker up top you cant install it the way it is meant to be installed. You have to have the skinny top rails.  Update: my daughter is now 17 months old and I'm JUST taking this mirror off cause it was a blessing to have during the rough sleepless nights and crankies! She never became attached however some how it kept her calm and she went to sleep! Plays for a good length of time which I LOVED!! Can't seem to part with it though cause it was such a big part of our routine lol.
