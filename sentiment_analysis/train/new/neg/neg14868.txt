Bought this quilted sheet with a new Graco Pack N' Play thinking that the Graco sheet would be suited for their own product.  But to my surprise it didn't!!  It was too small and the mattress would not lie flat.  So disappointed.  What a waste of money because I can't even use it for anything else.  Do not buy!!
