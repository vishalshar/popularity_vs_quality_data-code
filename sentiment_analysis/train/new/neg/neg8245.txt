I was seriously expecting this kneeler to be way bigger than it is. It's like..so small! The padding is thick enough, but the size is a joke. I bought this to use for bathing my newborn when he's born in a few weeks, but my husband & I decided to try it out when we gave our cat his bath.  I was wearing shorts so it was easier to detect the flaw in how slippery the pad gets when wet. My knees kept sliding on it & it further solidified how disappointed I was in the purchase. We are going to keep it,  but will be looking for another kneeler soon.
