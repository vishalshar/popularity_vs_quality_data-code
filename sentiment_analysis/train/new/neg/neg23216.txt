These are of a lesser quality than the exact same product that I purchased at one of the big box stores the same month.  I love these for burp cloths, but the ones from Amazon were thinner and shrunk more than the ones from elsewhere.  Buyer beware, I think Amazon got the short stack on these.  They are still usable, but the quality was just not up to par.  I'm including a photo, showing how much smaller and thinner the Amazon one (on the right) is compared to the other one (on the left).  Both have been washed, dried and ironed.
