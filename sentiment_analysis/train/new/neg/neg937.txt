I really liked this pad at first. Being a first time Mom, I read a ton of reviews before I bought anything, and this had such good reviews, so I went ahead and got it. 7 months later though, I find this pad is just annoying.First the velour Velcro belt is nice and soft HOWEVER when you child gets bigger and starts eating solid food, IT WILL GET POOP ON IT. Unfortunately the design of this is such that taking the belt off to wash is a huge hassle. I don't have time everyday to take this thing apart, wash the belt and the cover, and put everything back together. It's a really poor design as the holes that the Velcro belt go in are hard to deal with when putting the cover and belt back on. Plus the cover has some weird sleeve things that go in to the holes but are really annoying, I don't know why they are there. Poop invariably gets on and around these sleeve things and it is very hard to clean.Another observation is that when the cover is off, you can tell the foam is pretty cheap and sort of flimsy. For the money that you pay for this, it should be much more well made.This pad is a good idea because it's great to have your younger baby secured by a large belt, however it's of limited life because once your baby starts rolling over you're not going to leave them up on a changing table anyway belted in or not because they get wild (at least my son is) and it's not safe to do that at that point. For the money this thing costs I am very disappointed that it is not better made with sturdier foam and a much better design for cleaning and care.Today I bought a 20 dollar bassinet pad and will be using that going forward on our changing table - no there's not a belt, but again, I never leave my son un-attended anyway so this doesn't matter to me. The pad is lightweight, doesn't come apart in any way, and can be wiped with a washcloth or wet wipe very quickly.
