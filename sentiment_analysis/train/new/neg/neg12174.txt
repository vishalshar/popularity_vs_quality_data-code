This sleeping bag is very-very long and is quite heavy. The description said it works for babies age 2 months to 2 years. I thought it was odd when purchasing it, but bought it anyway. I wish I didn't.My baby is almost 4 months old and is over 20" long. We tried using this sleeping bag few times and it was more hassle than help due to how long it is. Every time I pick him up I have about half of this bag loosely  hanging about. So when you are lifting baby from a crib you also have to grab this loose part, so it doesn't get caught by crib's railing. May be for someone it isn't huge inconvenience, but when you are lifting a baby in a middle of a night multiple times for feeding then having any extra things to manage is a hassle for me. It would be less in a way of it wasn't so heavy.The fact that it is heavy is also a problem for the baby. Little babies like to kick their legs, but even though my baby is quite strong he wasn't able to easily kick his legs inside this sleeping sac due to the weight of the material.I would absolutely return it, but we accidentally got some poop on it the first time we used it and so I felt bad returning it, even though poop came out without a stain.
