This highchair is pretty, but not very functional compared to other chairs available. . .The chair is not adjustable up or down or reclining.  However, this is fine for my 8 month old who sits upright when eating, but I wouldn't recommend it for a younger child. especially before they can sit well on their own.  The wood matches our diningroom set (which is why we bought it), but it is soft so scratches easily.  One of the trays is screwed into the chair and the other one snaps onto the third tray.  This makes it harder to clean than the description makes it sound.  Also, the seat coushion is cloth and not easily wiped down.  We're going to buy a vinyl one we can wipe down to replace it with, otherwise we'd have to wash it every time our daughter ate.This is a good highchair for the money if you are willing to put in the extra care for aesthetics.  It was surprisingly easy to assemble.
