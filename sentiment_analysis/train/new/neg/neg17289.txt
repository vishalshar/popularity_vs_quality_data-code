I have a six-year-old and an eighteen-month-old, and surprisingly, they both played with the little bath toys that came with this Sassy Splashin' Fun Bath Tub.  The turtle “cup” has holes in it for a shower-like effect and fun play, but it will retain water long enough to dump the majority on the baby to rinse off.  Those are probably probably the best features of this set.  The tub is light enough that the little one (1 and 1/2 years) picked it up, and the plug hole is easy enough to remove.  She did this as well, which was an immediate cause for concern.  And unfortunately, she took it completely off the tub.  It’s easy to snap back on, but I don’t see it staying in place for very long.  While we no longer need the newborn mesh at this point, I did place my 21-pound baby on it and it stayed. It was easy enough to get on but took a bit of effort to remove.As for the “storage” bin, I don’t know why I bother to replace it when it repeatedly falls off.  Don't carry the tub by this end because the bin is very easily removed.  The storage areas themselves are slightly curved but should hold all normal-shaped bottles, and sample/travel sizes well--but not round ones.  Plus, they’re not very deep, so I can see bottles easily falling out, and they really don’t provided much room to store the toys, a feature prominently mentioned on the box.  That said, the tub itself is great and works just as well as the other baby tubs I have used over the years.  It's useful for giving our baby a bath and for storing a few of our various tub toys.
