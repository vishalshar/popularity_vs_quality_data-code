I registered and purchased Avent bottles for my first child. I heard great things about them from a few other people and they seemed to be "trendy." Although the 4 oz bottles were better in terms of leaking and seem to be better with thin liquids like water,the larger bottles leak like a sieve unless you completely dry every edge of the nipple, the nipple sleeve and the rim of the bottle and then are careful not to over or under-tighten.  This has become an annoying, but necessary ritual. Altogether the bottle system gave my son more gas, not less.  He spit-up constantly and it was only after trying other nipples and switching to a soy formula that I figured out that the bottle system was contributing to his misery.  Not to mention the misery my husband and I suffered all the time in the middle of the night at feeding an infant a bottle that is leaking on him from underneath and not knowing it until his outfit was soaked!By the time we fixed the bottle, changed him and settled him again, he was hysterical and would not go down again easily.The first stage nipple is inadequate to feed the baby easily - the hole is small, they get lots of air and get upset about the lack of faster gratification.  The size of the bottle also has made it difficult for him to hold it and feed himself now that he's a bit older.  It's harder to hold aloft because of the size.  I have read reviews and heard good things from my best friend about the Playtex "Premium" Nurser (not the regular Nurser or the VentAire.)  While I'm not looking forward to spending more money on the drop-ins for my baby girl who is going to be born in 8 days, I am looking forward to a potentially more spit-up free and drier life with my second!
