We really wanted a bassinet that would convert to a crib.  We purchased this crib through Amazon.  When the package arrived, the box was all mashed up to the extent that you could see the crib and the dents in the crib through the box. We refused the package so UPS returned it.  The Amazon rep I spoke to was quite polite and she organized to get a new replacement crib to be shipped out but I had to tell her that they should reinforce the edges of the packaging.  We received the new one about a week ago.  The packaging was slightly better and all the screws seem to be in place.  The one issue we now have is mattress holder for the crib (not the bassinet) is chipped badly on one end.  This is so frustrating because our baby is due anytime and I don't have time to return and reorder this item.  We have setup the bassinet and it's okay, just minor scratches, but once we want to convert it to a crib, one end of the mattress holder would probably not hold up.  I'll be contacting Amazon to see if I can get UPS to pickup just the mattress holder and get it replaced with a non-defective one!  I have to also says that both packages I received seem to have been sent to other customers who have either refused delivery or sent the packages back, they seems to have really gone around.  I am not happy with my purchase and Amazon needs to do a better job of the items they sell to customers especially when since this item is sold through them and not a third party.
