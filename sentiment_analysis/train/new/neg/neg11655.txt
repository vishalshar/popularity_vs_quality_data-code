First let me state that overall this is a good choice if you want a 5 point harness with higher weight limits.If that isnt what you are looking for, go elsewhere.  I am the father of a 4.5 year old boy and 18 month old twins, so I have a little expertise in installing car seats in multiple cars.We've typically bought Britax but I didn't want to spend that kind of money for 2 Britax's and I wanted the 5 point harness.The quality of this seat doesn't compare to Britax, not by a long shot.  The britax's are heavier and sturdier.The install is such a hassle on this.  The tether strap tightening system is not easy at all and I cannot get a really tight tether on this seat in my Honda Odyssey.The latch system is impossible to use, as the only way to get the belt to tighten is to pull the strap in the path and direction of the lap seat belt, which is obstructed by the seat.  The Britax seats only require you to pull up, and in this case, its straight up while applying some pressure with your knee to the seat.I have resorted to using a mighty tite and the seatbelt but I for the life of me cannot get a tight fit.I also noticed that the portion of the seat that comes in contact with the carseat is made of flexible and thin plastic.  This is where the downward forces are exerted on the seat, and as you tighten the car seat to the vehicle's seat it causes this plastic to bow outward.  I have contacted Dorel about this and they are replacing the seat, but only AFTER I have returned my original seat.  Am I supposed to lap my child in the meantime?If you never plan on removing the seat or switching vehicles, get the tightest fit you can (and hope you dont bend the underside supports) and leave it.The whole crotch strap not being long enough is true!  I ordered my replacement and got it, but I understand there's a considerable backorder on this item.Avoid this seat for its flaws.  You'll need a PHD and a year's personal trainer to get a tight fit.
