The first time I ordered this set of cups,  only one came in when it's supposed to be a 2 pack. I sent it back and re-ordered, only to have the same issue yet again.  I decided it wasn't worth the hassle of returning a second time so I decided to just keep the cup. My daughter used it for a week before biting through the spout. It leaks like crazy now.  We are using Playtex sipsters now and they're much more durable.
