This has a pointed angle at the bottom. My 9-month old son can go super fast on this walker all around our linoleum floor kitchen. But, I have to watch when he's coming toward me because when the walker hits my ankles it's so painful! I don't know how any of the other users are tolerating this. It's been a great hands-free way to let me son be in the kitchen with me but I don't enjoy getting my ankles hit.I kept the piano toy off the walker. Without the toy, it is a nice tray. I place food there and my son can eat off of it.It's working out but the ankle strikes are not worth it.
