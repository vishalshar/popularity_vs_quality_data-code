great set for the bath time. They get a little wet and stick to the tub and even the marble tile we have around the tub. My daughter loves playing with them. She's 1.5ys old so we are just starting letters and numbers so this is great. The only gripe I have is that they are sold in "boy" and "girl" sets and the picture cards are different in each which is a little biased in my opinion. I bought the boy set because she loves cars and trucks and those words were only in the boy set. She still puts toys in her mouth and these are made of foam so they do have teeth marks on them. On the plus side- they did not tear when she bit it.
