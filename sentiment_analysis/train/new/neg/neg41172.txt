I would not recommend this for the one biggest reason that the volume is so low I can barely hear the music. I tried to look at it in a positive way that if my baby kicks it during her sleep in the middle of the night the low music won't wake her up completely. This item arrived with the batteries leaking out brown rust inside/outside battery plate. I wiped it down and threw in fresh batteries. Still wondered if this is the reason for the low sounds. I'll never know.There's some good things. My baby girl kicked this and enjoyed it. Worked her leg muscles. At the time of this purchase my baby girl could only lay still on her back so this toy did encourage her to kick. I liked that when I leave her to take a bathroom break, I can hear the piano music which was a delight but aweful because I can barely hear it on full volume and my bathrooms across her nursery door wide open. She hasn't played with this for months now. I through it on the floor as a play option as she crawls now but passes it often.Placed this under her feet while in her jolly jumper. She pooped and it somehow got all over this pianos. I ran water on it soaking inside and out. Squeezed as much water out. It dried. Still worked after.
