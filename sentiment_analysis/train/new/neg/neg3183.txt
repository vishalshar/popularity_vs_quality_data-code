I purchased this for my nearly six month old daughter, who is pretty much in the 50 percentile for her height. At its lowest level, there is 10 inches between the bottom of the seat and the floor. With my daughter in it, her legs still dangle in the air a good 2-3" above the floor. The springs are very stiff and it just doesn't give much. By the time my daughter can use this, she'll be ready to start walking.Waste of money.
