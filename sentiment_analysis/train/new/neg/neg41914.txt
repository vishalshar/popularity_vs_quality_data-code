While our little chunky monkey is only 9wks, she is heavy enough (14lbs at last visit and gaining fast) that my husband and I debated which size to order. We ended up with the small (3-6 mo) and I'm glad we did bc even the small was too big. Her legs were not long enough to pop her feet out of the holes and she was able to pull her legs out of the legs of the suit, trapping her legs at her chest and severely ticking her off. The top of the suit was tighter and we had some difficulty getting her arms in. This might just come with practice. Needless to say she was wailing by the time I finished getting this contraption on her... not a good state for trying to fall asleep. I am keeping the suit and will try again when she gets a little longer. I suggest the seller add recommended baby lengths to their sizing. At last dr visit our daughter was around 22inches, if it helps.
