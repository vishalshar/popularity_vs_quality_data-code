When I received this stroller I was extremely disappointed with the fabric(it is a strange color and also made with a very cheap looking nylon).  I planned to immediately box it up and ship it back but as soon as I put my baby in it I changed my mind.  He looked extemely happy and comfortable, and he always seems to fuss in his other stroller.  I decided to keep the stroller and it has performed very well on the dirt trails around my house.  I recommend this stroller to people who aren't so concerned with appearance and just want a well-built stroller for a reasonable price.  Maybe try the red or maroon.
