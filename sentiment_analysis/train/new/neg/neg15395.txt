The images were super cute and perfect for my little boys room. I gave 3 stars not five because I feel like the fabric is anything but soft. Especially on a kids bed you want the softest snuggly material, and this is more crunchy and . . . . anything but fluffy. I'm considering trading it out for something a little more comfortable. But if you're looking for a winter situation where you could put this on top of some thicker blankets, this would do well.
