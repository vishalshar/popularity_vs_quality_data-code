Returned this item for refund [which Amazon DID honor] as this "wedge pillow" did not in any way maintain its wedge shape -- thus, it could not elevate the lower leg as depicted in the photograph. Also, even if it had maintained its wedge shape, it obviously was designed for a single bed mattress only, a fact that was not mentioned at all in the irem description!
