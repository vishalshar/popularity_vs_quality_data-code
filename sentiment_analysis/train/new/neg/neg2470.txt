This didn't stand up very well as I tried to use it to block my garage door opening so my Dane wouldn't go past it.  She understood she wasn't to go beyond it even though she could have just stepped over.  However, it wouldn't stand very well unless I put several bends in it which wasn't that easy or that much stability either.  It is probably best for small dogs and you make this in a circle.  As a line across something, it's not sturdy to stand on its own.
