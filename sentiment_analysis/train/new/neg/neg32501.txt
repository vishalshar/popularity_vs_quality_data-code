We got two of these, this one that plays music, and one that just rattles and spins.  Our daughter plays with them both equally, but this one drives the adults around her batty.  It isn't that loud, but it can still interfere in conversation, or hearing the television.  Also it plays two versions of one brief tune, over and over and over and over.  She doesn't have to perform any specific action to make this happen.  It goes off if she brushes it with her elbow, sneezes too close to it, or touches any part of the toy.  The bug that makes the noise is also heavier than the other elements so it doesn't spin as well as the plain one.  Several other reviewers have complained that the battery dies too quickly; we are hoping this happens soon.  If it doesn't, we are either going to remove the battery, or lose the toy.
