I am an internet shopper.  I review everything before I buy it.  This diaper bag seemed great after I read the reviews, but IT IS NOT!  I don't require a lot of space every day, but I would like to be able to fit 2- outfits (newborn!), burp rags, bibs, and one thin blanket on the inside of my bag, without having to take all the items out to find anything.  There are these long shallow pockets across the top.  If you put anything in them (paci, tiny motrin bottle, cellphone), then you really can't reach into the bag below, because those top compartments are sticking out into the middle of the bag, trapping the bottom items in the bag.  And the main compartment and outside pockets all have velcro, so try getting your outfits and blanket in and out without snagging them.  Try putting your own arm down in there, without snagging the sleeve of your shirt or sweater.  Impossible!  I just absolutely hate this bag.  No other way to say it. I have never reviewed anything so negatively on Amazon.  Very disappointing.  Maybe I can sell it for half of what I paid, so that someone who feels the way the other reviewers do can buy it!
