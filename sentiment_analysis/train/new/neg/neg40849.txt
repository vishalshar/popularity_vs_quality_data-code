I want to love this stroller. We did a ton of research and loved the features this stroller had for the money. It pushes like a dream and I get compliments everywhere I go. Now the bad- I purchased it 4 months ago and it is FALLING APART. The cold weather cover for the bassinet is unusable. It has pulled away from the zipper because the quality of the stitching is horrible. I have requested a replacement part however this is a ridiculous thing to have to do so soon after an expensive purchase. Very disappointing.
