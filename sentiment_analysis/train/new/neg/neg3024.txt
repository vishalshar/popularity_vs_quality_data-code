This snaps onto the side of a quinny buzz so you can have a soda or water while pushing the carriage through the summer heat.  Great idea for your cool looking stroller right?  Wrong, because the stroller is so big, going through your normal doorway with the stroller, say on a trip to the doctors office in any walkable city is a disaster.  The cup holder hits the door as you try to pass through it and comes flying off.  So swap it to the inside...well you can do that but when you go to fold the stroller it comes flying off. Move it down move it up same nonsense.  Finally I put my sport bottle after a work out in it so I could run home with the baby from the gym.. (my gym has child care)...well 24 ounces caused the exterior of the cup holder to loosen from the clip and the basket part of the cup holder flopped around from then on and drinks, even small ones would fall out.  Don't recommend, though I love my Quinny.
