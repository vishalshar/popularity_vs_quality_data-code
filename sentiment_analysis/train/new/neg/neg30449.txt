I live in San Diego, CA, so strong sun is an issue even during the winter months. I bought the UPPAbaby shade because I am using the infant car seat in combination with my stroller frame, and the infant car seat came with a sun shade that was too short; I got tired of using a blanket to shade my baby. The UPPAbaby Bubble, unfortunately didn't live up to the expectations. It looks great, is very stylish, and it fits fine on my car seat, however it doesn't shade the baby completely from the sun: the side mesh, that is not covered by the silver layer, lets the sun through. I really don't understand why the sides can't be covered as well by the outer layer. On the other hand, it seems like it does protect from the rain. I hadn't have the chance to test the bug resistance. I ended up buying another shade, that may not look quite as good, but does a better job in protecting from the sun.
