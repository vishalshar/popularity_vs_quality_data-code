I really really wanted to love this seat. I read a ton of reviews and decided to go with the Snug over the Bumbo, but we ended up being really disappointed. The tray is not secured at all, it sort of clicks in at the sides, but the center part just sits together, it doesn't click in. Within 5 minutes of my 6 month old sitting in the seat, she was pulling the tray off! Maybe I should have got it for her when she was younger, but this is going back to the store :(If you have a rambunctious handsy kid like me, you may want to rethink this seat!
