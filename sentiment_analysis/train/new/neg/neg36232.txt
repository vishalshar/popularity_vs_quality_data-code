It is kind of cumbersome to put on but baby seems more or less comfortable. Was great for facing in, but once she started facing out she was too heavy to carry comfortably without my back hurting so I rarely use this, only in situations where we are out and about without my husband and I think the place may be crowded and I want to keep her very close to me(people tend to want to be touchy feely with my baby)
