Loved this when it arrived. My newborn slept in it and the vibration helped her to sleep. It was also compact making it easy to use bedside. It is light weight making it easy to move room to room when needed. However the fluffy puppy headrest could be a suffocation hazard. I move it up so even if my daughter turns her head it won't block her breathing. We have had it two months, the motor has gradually gotten louder and not barely vibrates anymore. I am disappointed this no longer works as it was helpful with sleeping.
