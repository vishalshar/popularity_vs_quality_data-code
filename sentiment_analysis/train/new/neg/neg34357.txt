I gave this product 2 stars because on the bottom of the cups the plastic cracks and leaks milk/juice. The handles come off the bottom easy and when done enough it cracks the plastic. I had them only for a month and they started leaking. Other wise they are really cute cups and I like the rubber sippy.
