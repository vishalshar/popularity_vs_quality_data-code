There is nothing elegant about this very small wallet. Took several weeks to arrive. I did not realize it was coming from China, or I would not have ordered it. It has a horrible smell to it, so much so that I have left it outside to air out. Too expensive to ship back. Will end up donating it. Don't waste your money!
