I bought these to go along with the Thirsties Duo Wrap, and unfortunately it's not a very good system for my baby. While I love the absorbency of both layers, the fitting just means plenty of leakage when paired with the Duo Wrap. We had to deal with so many leakage with this our baby has proven to us that she's just not having it!The hemp layer is VERY absorbent, but that also means that it takes such a long time to dry in the dryer. Often we would have to get these to stay in the dryer a little longer unfortunately.We ended up using traditional prefolds for the the Duo Wrap. I'll have to think of what I can use these with, probably pair it with the other diapers as an extra layer in the future. I bought multiples of these, so now I'll have to get creative so they won't go to waste!
