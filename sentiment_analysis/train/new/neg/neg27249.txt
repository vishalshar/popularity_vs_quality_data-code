I had high hopes for these diaper liners after reading the reviews, but found them to be the worst of the ones we've used. They are stiff so don't work very well if you like to prepare your cloth inserts all at once ahead of time to make the diaper changes quicker/easier. The stiffness also prevent them from being tucked around the cloth inserts so there is a lot of staining on the edges that we didn't have with the softer, larger, stickier bummies....maybe if you're using the pocket type or more traditional one piece cloth diapers, these may work fine. But we use g-diapers with the cloth inserts and these are awful
