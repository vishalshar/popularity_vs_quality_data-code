This has helped organize my freezer, but I am disappointed that it does not hold the number of pouches it claims to. I can only fit 8 pouches comfortably, though it says it should hold 12. Maybe I just have overly filled pouches? Either way, I wish it held more, but it does help to keep things more organized.
