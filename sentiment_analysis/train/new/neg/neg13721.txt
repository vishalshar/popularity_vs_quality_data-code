I have been gardening for >25 years and I normally have no problem growing anything from seeds.  Including basil over the last couple years.  I have bought this brand before at local store and grew without issue.  But I have had ZERO seeds germinate.I have tried growing with local soil, in miracle grow gardening soil, inside and outside.  Over the last 2 months, no basil seeds have sprouted, even with all my other seeds growing. I cannot explain why they are no sprouting, but I have explored all the probable variables, leaving only the seeds and wild theories like being irradiated in the mail.In addition, the amazon price is ~$5 when the package has $1.59 printed on the package (probably to inflate for Prime shipping).  If you must have these seeds do yourself a favor and save $4 by going to the local Lowes or Home Depot, who sell for the sticker value.
