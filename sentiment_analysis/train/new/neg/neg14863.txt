Everytime my daughter uses this potty I notice urine on the floor.I also noticed it is harder for her to get situated to sit on this potty compared to others. I thought that it would be better because it was smaller and a trusted name , but this was not the case for my daughter.The pros are it is very easy to clean, does not take up to much space on the floor, it is pretty portable to leave in the car.
