the cushion keeps falling off and my toddler hates it, i dont think he feels safe on this thing lol, we just ended up going to a local store and buying a floor potty and we're having more luck with that then this thing, wouldnt recomend this if you're trying to potty train, you're better off just getting a floor potty and emptying the pan and cleaning to be honest.
