The swing is perfect as long as you have a large area to put it. I didn't realize it was so big, I guess I didnt read the specs properly. It is a great swing, works perfectly and the speed adjustments are great. The songs do get a bit boring after a while but that's normal. the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the size and bulk of it. I would have preferred something a bit smaller but none the less still a good swing.
