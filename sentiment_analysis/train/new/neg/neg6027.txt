I'm very disappointed in these security blankets.  We have many Aden + Anais products, but this product does not live up to their quality.  I guess Aden by Aden+Anais is the cheaply made version.  The muslin is thinner and the satin started falling apart after the first wash.  We have 2 authentic lovies that have been through the wash many times and are still good as new.  I was hoping to find a security blanket without the animal attached for an extra backup, but don't think these will last much longer.  I normally don't mind paying higher prices for Aden + Anais products because of their high quality, but these are a waste of money!
