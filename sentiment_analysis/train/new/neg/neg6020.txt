My wife and I are looking for a baby video monitor for our 6-month old daughter - our requirements are digital transmission, 5GHz (to minimize interference), 3.5" screen, good day and night video quality, easy pan/zoom controls and range (our bedroom is 50ft away down the corridor from the nursery). We don't need a temperature sensor since another unit does a good job.The First Years Home and Away Portable Video Monitor met most of these needs except for 5GHz transmission (works at 2.4 GHz). The key feature that attracted us to this monitor is their claim of 650 ft range, clear transmission.Installation, use, etc. were quite easy and we were happy with the video quality (both day and night). We found the skype feature interesting but somewhat cumbersome to use (since the monitor has to be plugged into an available laptop via USB cable, for skype to recognize the unit as an additional video cam).The biggest drawback is range. The monitor loses connection at ~40 ft, from nursery and then straight across the hallway. We turned off every 2.4 GHz device (WiFi, Phone, Bluetooth, etc.) to see if any of these devices caused interference, to no avail.Just to see if transmission strength was an issue, I used a homemade parabolic antenna ([...]) and voila! The range improved considerably, but the next challenge became that of keeping the antenna either vertical or horizontal (it can only move 180 degrees along one plane), while still capturing a decent picture of my daughter in her crib. Unfortunately this didn't work.Lack of range (10% of what is advertised!!) is unacceptable; renders the product unusable in our bedroom. We are returning this product.
