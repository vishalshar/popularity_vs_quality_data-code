The brim of this covered my baby's nose, so baby didn't like it. The nipple size was a bit larger than other brands of rubber pacifiers I've tried. The rubber was definitely thinner than other brands I've tried, but the price of these was 3 for the price of 1 of the more expensive brands. My kids won't use the rubber ones, so I opted for BPA free from NUK and Avent, with silicone orthodontic nipples. Rubber is supposedly healthier though, if your baby will take it.
