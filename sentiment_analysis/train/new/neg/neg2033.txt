This was awful. Despite the fancy packaging, the material is for this kit was very similar to Crayola Model Magic Clay, and if you've ever used that, you'll know that while easily molded, you can barely see indents by hand prints. I wasn't able to push my little guy's hand in firmly enough without fear of hurting him. It dries to an airy, flexible, foamy "ornament." If you're looking for a glassy, glossy, substantial, long-lasting keepsake, keep looking.
