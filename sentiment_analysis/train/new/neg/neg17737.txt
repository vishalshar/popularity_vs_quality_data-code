Most younger children under age 3 _will_ be stopped by these covers, but only if they do not figure out how to remove them altogether; they are fairly easy to remove: our 23-month old has no problem taking them off the door. A better design would make them harder to remove. (Note that the back of the package cautions that the covers should not be used once the child figures out how to defeat them.)
