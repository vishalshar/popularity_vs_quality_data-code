Careful with this.  If you plug this into an outlet with one middle screw (vs two screws - one on top and the other on the bottom). The cover can easily rotate in circles around the one screw, exposing the electrical box behind it... AND THEREBY THE BARE ELECTRICAL WIRES IN THE BOX.  I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone use this with electrical outlets that have only the middle screw.  I imagine if your outlet covers use two screws one would avoid this pitfall.  I tried screwing the one screw really tight to avoid the rotation issue, but it turns out the product is made of a softer plastic so the screw can actually work it's way right through the cover itself, rendering the device broken for good
