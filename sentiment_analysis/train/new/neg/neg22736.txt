I bought Clearly Safe Stove Guardsfrom Kid Kusion at a local retailer a couple of years ago.  I loved them!!  After a couple years’ use, they reacted to the heat of the stove and melted a bit, making them fit sloppily on the stove knobs.  I had a hard time finding them again, so was thrilled when I found these online.  They’re a different design than I’d previously bought but since they’re the same brand, I decided to purchase.  These look exactly the same as the ones I'd purchased previously but I was SO disapponted when they arrived!  They appeared to be hand-cut.  Each one was a little bit different from the other.  They fit sloppily and weren't as thick as the originals.  They just fell right off the stove knobs.  Didn't work at all!  Thankfully, I was able to return them.  I'm still searching for just the right guard.  For now, I'm still usung the melted, old guards because even all worn out, they were better than these!
