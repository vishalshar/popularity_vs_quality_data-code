I purchased both the valance and lamp for my baby's room. The lamp looked beautiful in the picture, but when it arrived the quality was horrible. Some of the dark purple paint was missing on the front by the flowers. There also was a ring of glue around the entire lampshade. Not sure if I got a defective lamp or if this is the norm. I was so disappointed and had to return. The valance though is adorable. Just wish I could have the matching lamp.
