For starters, it is very light-weight and will slide across wood floors (scratching them) easily. It might even be toppled easily with baby inside by a sleepy parent at 4 am or a young brother or sister determined to do away with his or her competition.Next, the wood is easily scratched and the screws are very cheap. The Allen wrench provided did not sit fully into some of them, making them easily strippable.Third, the wool mattress does not quite fit into the bag. The mattress is a bit too big.Fourth, the board is so cheap they have to print "do not discard" on it, because it appears to be packing material. For this, we went through hoops upon hoops to make sure we got the formaldehyde-free version? It might was well be cardboard.Fifth, the mattress does not accept US sheets and mattress pads. How on earth can you sell this in the US if US sheets and mattress pads don't fit?!Sixth, the sheet provided cannot be put in the dryer. Very practical for a baby sheet! Who has time to line dry sheets for a baby? Or is it part of a grand scheme to get people to buy more sheets to have on hand?All in all, this is a VASTLY overpriced item that is clearly not worth what we paid for it.
