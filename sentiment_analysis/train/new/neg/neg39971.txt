I have the old version of this baby monitor, the one that used triple A batteries. It works great! Bought this version as we had another kid and we needed two and it looks exactly like the old version but green . This version is flat out horrible. The signal cuts out quite a bit and the battery life is atrocious. To top it all off you can't actually replace the battery as its non-standard.The good things about it are:* It tells the temperature in the room (main reason I choose these baby monitors)* Has a nice lullaby selection (same as old version though the recordings are shorter)Don't buy this version, the battery life alone makes this a bad investment and the signal interruptions which cause the baby monitor to beep while you are sleeping makes it worthy of the recycling bin.
