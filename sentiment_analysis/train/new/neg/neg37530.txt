I've had this cup for a month.  I put it through the dishwasher and I bought the OXO sippy cup cleaning tools but you just can't get the straw 100% clean.I noticed that, apart from the lid leaking, it was okay initially.  But then I saw little black specks in the straw.  No matter how much I scrubbed, those specks stayed, like they were embedded in the plastic.  Then as I was inspecting it more closely, I saw them in the ring of the straw, right where the straw goes through the lid.  I pulled the straw out and the entire ring that is partially hidden by the lid was encrusted with black!I felt so sick knowing that whatever my daughter drank touched that black bacteria!For $11 a cup, it's just not worth the convenience of a weighted straw.  I feel much better using the disposable take and toss, which I can clean thouroughly.  If they could come up with a better system, I would consider buying again but they need to fix the straw and leaking lid.:(
