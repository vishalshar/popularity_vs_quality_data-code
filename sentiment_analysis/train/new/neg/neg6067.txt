The liner is a great idea, but you can simply make your own! Simple buy their reusable liner and use grocery bag with a paper towel folded into a square.  I find the grocery bags you use to bag vegetables and fruits in grocery the perfect size.  I also like to use the 10 gallon wastebasket liner from costco (only 3 pennies each).  The costco wastebasket bag liner is huge, but it is only, as long as you get the job done, right?  And it is only 3 pennies.  Putting a kitchen paper towel in the bag also makes a big difference.  I will post a photo too.
