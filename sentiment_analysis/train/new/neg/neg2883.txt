We bought this tent because we were going to Florida and wanted to make sure we had some shade for our 18 month old daughter. When we put it together at home to try it out, she loved going in and out of it. On the beach she wasn't interested in going into it at all. She just wanted to play in the sand. We thought she might nap in it but it was too hot for that and while we were at the beach all she wanted to do was play so it was best to go back to the room for naps. Our biggest complaint is that it is quite flimsy and broke in the wind. We can still use it but one of the plastic poles is broken. To be fair, I should mention that it is very easy to set up and take down. Perhaps it would be more useful for a younger baby and not on windy days.
