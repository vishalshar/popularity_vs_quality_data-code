<>< You can donate loose disposable diapers your baby outgrew and used cloth diapers and supplies to your local WIC office ><>They will make sure they go to moms in need. I'm very low income and was terrified to invest money that I needed for wipes and Huggies on cloth diapers. It seems like a huge investment. Poor moms think the cost is too high, that it's too hard, they won't have time to wash diaper, daycare won't allow them etc. None of that is true. I am so glad my 1st pack of diapers and inserts was free. I want to share that experience with other very poor mamas. I hope you can help in your community too:)I've tried a few brands of these at different stages of development.>>>>OsoCozy<<<<-these are in a roll with cardboard inside. I like this set up. I put a string through the hole and hang them off my changing table-they're stiffer than the other brands. They're rather like a super cheap dollar store dryer sheet. Not very comfy feeling-okay protection. My daughter is on Alimentum and that makes her poor runny. The liquid poop goes through this liner and stains the diaper-these shift around in the diaper, they all do on my daughterBumkins- Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Count, (Pack of 1)-these come in a box, like tissues-they're super soft-liquid poo sticks to these better than the other brands-these still shift in my dirl's diapersCute Patoots- Cute Patoots Biodegradable Flushable Bamboo Cloth Diaper Liners- 100 Sheets Per RollI didn't like this brand until my daughter started solids. If you have a breast of alimentum fed baby, they don't work well. These are the worst for runny poo. But they rock once they start solids and for protecting the diaper from ointments.-these come on a roll without a roll inside-semi-soft-they will shift in the diaper-runny poo leaks throughI try a new brand each time I buy diapering stuff so I can share my experience:)
