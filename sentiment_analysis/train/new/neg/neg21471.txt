This hat worked the first time I put it on my daughter - there was zero water on her face. Each time I've used it since, it will not seal around her head and a sheet of water goes directly into her face. I've tried it on her head many times and followed the directions exactly but she gets soaked every time. Not worth the hassle or money.
