Such a useful sounding product.  Too bad it didn't work for us.  Maybe there is another product out there that would work better, but it appeared that they all had the same general design (by all means, PLEASE give me recommendations!)We've been busy potty training and avoiding public situations for a bit now, but got our first chance to try this sucker out yesterday.  My poor kid took one look and screamed "I don't want to!" a few times and we put a diaper back on.  This does NOT fit well on a public toilet seat (it doesn't fit at all).  I tried it both ways, and neither direction worked.  It sits ON the toilet, not inside where it would be secure.  The position in the photo was the best "fit" I could come up with.  The handles are almost touching the seat so the kid would be sure to grab that awesome public booty rest as well as, or instead of, the handle.  Maybe it was designed to fit some other type of public toilet, but the one we tried is fairly typical I think.Love the idea, hate the execution.  Although it did indeed fold up fairly small to fit into the diaper bag.  Guess I can stop carrying a toilet seat with me when I go places now - at least until I find one that works anyway.
