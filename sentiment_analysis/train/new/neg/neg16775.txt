When I saw this I thought it was perfect for our sons first christmas. At 7 months old he was in love with the tags, so I bought this. He doesn't care for it at all!! But i'm not one of those people who rate a product badly just because their child din't like it. Why I don't like it:-the taggies aren't very "tag like" they're too soft and i wihs they weren't looped-Its small, i htought this was going to be way bigger especially with a $30 price tag, its average stuffed animal size-the cute mouse inside is difficult to pull in order to get it to vibrate(which lasts merely 2 seconds)can't imagine a child being able to do itBesides that its cute and I play wiht it every now and then. If it was half price i'd say try it for yourself otherwise pass on this one.
