I only ordered this diaper because I needed one for my toddler for night time. Oh my goodness was I in shock when I put it on her this is the bulkiest diaper I've ever seen and I've tried almost every brand out there, the diaper is cheap I agree but it's still a waste of money since my daughter refuses to wear it no matter what she wore it for maybe 5 minutes the first time I put it on her and since then it's just been laying around wish I would have researched it and got her something else or even buy a small pack of disposables for the same price which would have lasted for at least 25-30 days (since she only wears one for the night time) depending on the pack size and not 5 minutes. I do not recommend this diaper to anyone at all!
