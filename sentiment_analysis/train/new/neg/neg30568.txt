We have a very tall toilet, and were having trouble finding a step stool tall enough for our 3-year-old to use the potty by herself. We bought the Baby Bjorn trainer seat and step stool, but it just wasn't tall or wide enough. The Little Looster seemed perfect. However, we've been disappointed. Though it is a litte taller than the Baby Bjorn step stool, it doesn't feel stable and secure enough. The plastic it's made of is thin and wobbles a little when she steps up, causing her to startle and grab me. There's no rubber on the bottom or on the top like on the Baby Bjorn step stool, so it slides around on our tile floor, again causing my daughter to feel insecure when she's on it.We've been using it because it's the only thing we have that's tall enough, but I'm looking for something else because my child has been resisting using the potty since we got the Little Looster, and it's derailing the whole potty training process. I need a step stool that has the strength and quality of the Baby Bjorn with the shape and height of the Little Looster.
