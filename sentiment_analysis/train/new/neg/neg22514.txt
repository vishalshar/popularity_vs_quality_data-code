I was excited to use the go crib and it was perfect for my travel abroad. The set up was easy, it was light enough to carry as a cabin bag. The third time it was inflated, the was a loud pop and we noticed that seem on one area had ripped open. The pressure on the pump gauge did not say that we had over inflated the crib. We later found out that one of the pump connections wasn't working. The crib was perfect when it worked. For the price 199.99, I think the material should have had better quality. I got a refund for it so I'll be looking for similiar products.
