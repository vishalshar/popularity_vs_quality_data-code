I bought this car seat in December 2010.  My son turned two in February, and in March, he began complaining of back pain.  We've taken him to his pediatrician and we've had multiple tests including a back x-ray performed on him to try to determine the source of the pain.  Interestingly, we found this thread when searching for back pain in toddlers:[...]It is amazing how many of these people own Britax car seats, have toddlers that complain of back pain, and have that back pain magically disappear when they switch to another seat.  So, we just switched to the Graco Nautilus seat, and today my son says, "seat no hurt back daddy!".We called Britax, and they are completely insensitive to the issue.  They told us that there is nothing they can do and that they have never gotten a single complaint about back pain with their seats.  Unbelievable when you look at the link above.  BOTTOM LINE:  SAVE YOUR CHILD'S BACK.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SEAT!
