I have these bottles in glass but I broke two so I thought it was a good idea to get the plastic ones....bad idea...these bottles leak TERRIBLY unless you get the nipple on just right. I never had leaking with the glass bottles. I guess I'm going to toss the plastic ones and just get more glass and try not to drop them....
