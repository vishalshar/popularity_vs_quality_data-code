I've been using this diaper bag since my son was born almost six months ago and am very disappointed in it. In fact, I'm on Amazon tonight shopping around for a new bag.Here are my problems with this bag:- The main pocket is large, but isn't very easy to get open (especially with one hand). The pocket doesn't open up completely making it difficult to get at the things that are inside.- The stroller attachment straps are a joke! They broke the very first time I used them... within a half hour! The bag wasn't even very full. It had a receiving blanket, a bottle, a couple of diapers and a small packet of wipes. The straps are a cheap rubber and seem like they'd be a good concept, but the rubber tore just like a big rubber band would which made the straps completely useless... garbage!- I thought that the padded shoulder would be nice and it was for a while... until the black part of the pad (the part that sits on your shoulder) started disintegrating and leaving black crumbly residue all over my shirt.- The bag itself is attractive at first, but I learned my lesson buying a light color... it shows dirt and isn't easy to clean.- The bag seemed poorly sewn together. It had lots of long strings hanging off of the corners and seams.- The outer flap has a large pocket that is convenient for my wallet, but it has lots of other very small compartments that don't fit much of anything at all.All in all... I'm very disappointed in the quality and design of this bag. I don't write reviews often, but I wanted to forewarn other parents that I would not recommend this bag to anyone.
