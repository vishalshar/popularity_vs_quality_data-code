I bought the breast shields in small as the standard ones that came with my pump in style was too large for me. However, it seems that the connection portion of the shields i got did not fit in as well as the standard ones that came with my pump (see photo). Basically, i couldnt fit as much of the shield tip into the connectors as i would like.It uncoupled once while i was pumping halfway in the middle of the night.It takes effort to forcefully shove the two connecting parts together to ensure that they don't uncouple while i am pumping. Sometimes, when you are sleep deprived and groggy, the last thing you want is to have to struggle with assembling/disassembling the pump.In summary, the shields fit, but not as well as i would like it too. Also, i noticed that the imprinted 'MEDELA' logo on them is missing the (R) as compared to the standard size one that came with my pump (you can see it in the photo of you look closely enough). Just my observation.Edit: my order was from lullababy
