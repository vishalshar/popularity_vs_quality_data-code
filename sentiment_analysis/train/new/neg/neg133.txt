I was really excited when this came in and couldn't wait to put it up on my wall. Unfortunately, the product didn't live up to the excitement. I followed the instructions exactly and thought that putting it up would be an easy process. Not so much. My first attempt at putting it up, resulted in nothing. The transfer just came right up. My second attempt left several words on the transfer sheet and several on the wall. It was pretty much ruined, there was no way that I was going to get everything lined up correctly to try it again. Plus I noticed that several of the letters had ripped. Now, I'm probably going to be spending the next 30 minutes trying to scrape the remaining letters off of my wall.
