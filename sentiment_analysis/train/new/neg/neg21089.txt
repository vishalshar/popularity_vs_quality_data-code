The left leg on this doll looks like it is out of the socket. I'm assuming it was how it was packaged but doesn't look nice. I was disappointed with this as we bought my son the boy one for his baptism and he wanted to get his baby sister the girl doll for her baptism and it looks like the leg is disfigured.
