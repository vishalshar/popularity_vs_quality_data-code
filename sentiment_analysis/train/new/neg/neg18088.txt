I purchased the Primo Viaggio Carseat and Pliko 3 stroller. Although I have received many compliments on how this travel system looks, I am really disappointed with the car seat. First of all, it is really HEAVY! With my 4 month old baby being in the 90% percentile, I have given up on even attempting to use it as an infant carrier. The material is also very HOT! I try dressing my baby in the lightest clothes possible, but she starts crying after 10 minutes in the car. When I pick her up, her back is all wet from sweating. Finally, the seat doesn't recline and the pillows on the sides of the head area do not provide adequate support for newborns. I tried using another head support pillow instead, but the ones that come with the car seat do not detach and don't leave enough room for anything else. The only thing you can do is roll up a receiving blanket to prop the baby's head up.
