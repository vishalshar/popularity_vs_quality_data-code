I ordered these based on the great reviews. I contacted the company to ask if they were safe for a 1 year old, and they assured me the 2 year age limit on them is just because most block play motor skills are developing around age 2. The size is perfect (Melissa and Doug's version are so tiny they truly are a choking hazard).  They're pretty. I was so happy. Until my child started playing with them. The wood is much too soft.  After a few minutes, she left teeth marks in several and then they started splitting and splintering.  It's like the faces are starting to come off. These are going back. Too dangerous!  Talk about a choking hazard!  Also...they are made of "Michigan Basswood" -- which is  410 on the Janka Hardness Scale. Maple is 1450, for comparison.  So this wood is definitely soft!
