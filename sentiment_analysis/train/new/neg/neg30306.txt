The photo IS misleading, as very few baby toys would be made to such small specifications. It's really teeny.So much so, that despite the age specifications on the product features--"For ages 12 months and up"--there is a choking warning further down that states,  "WARNING: CHOKING HAZARD -- Small parts. Not for children under 3 yrs". It would seem that even the manufacturer is confused about the size.Of course, I didn't find any of this until later, as I would assume many people didn't. And when one is in the middle of Christmas shopping for nieces, nephews, kids, parents, grandparents, spouses--occasionally, reading the specifications, (something I almost always do)--falls to the wayside. Thankfully, we always have the opportunity to check the item before we give it. So, I won't be wrapping up a choking hazard for my 13 month old nephew.I will be sending back all of my Wonderworld toys, and I wish I had read the other reviews stating size issues--it would save me the hassle of now having to pay shipping and go shopping elsewhere.Other than that, it's an "okay" toy. I think other eco-friendly and organic toymakers provide better craftmanship and usability.
