I was so happy to find this lunch box.  I  was searching for a lunchbox option that didn't find me always searching for lids to little tupperware containers and washing out my ziplock bags and was phalate and bpa free.  I didn't like the other bento type ones because you still have the lid issue.  This seemed like the answer to my prayers.  It has been, almost.pros:1. one container, one lid2. super easy to wash3. tons of room for different foods4.  when closed properly you CAN put yogurt and such in it5.  pthalate and BPA freecons1.  it is huge and fills my kids kid-sized backpack2.  hard for her to put the lid on the right way (she tries really hard, even sits on it but can't quite get it)I was happy to see that they have come out with a slight smaller version with 3 compartments.  This one came close enough that I am willing to invest in the new model in the hopes that it will be THE perfect lunchbox.
