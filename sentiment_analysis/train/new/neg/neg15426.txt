Prior to owning this stroller we used the Chicco double stroller.  I had trouble hearing my two year old talking to me as she was placed in the very front.  Also, my two year old was constantly asking what her little sister was doing and would try to turn around to see her.  This stroller is half of the weight of the Chicco, the girls can ride side by side which they both love (even the youngest at 3 months old).  We have a Chicco car seat that does not snap into this stroller; however, it rests in there with no wobble and we have used it that way once so far without any trouble.  I have not had any trouble steering this stroller and it does fit in a regular doorway.  The only slight oddity I have with it is the 5 point harness just clips into a little slot at the top and easily comes out.  Luckily my two year old doesn't really like the shoulder straps anyway and also will stay put with just the lap belt and my 3 month old is too young for it to pose a problem either.  I absolutely LOVE this stroller, I'm so glad we got it!Update....the wheels can be very hard to turn the stroller with, it becomes quite difficult and hard to handle!  Still love that it is light weight though.
