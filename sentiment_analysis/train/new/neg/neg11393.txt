We bought this bag to travel with our stroller to Chicago.  The stroller itself is so big and bulky that it doesn't make for a good airport usage if you're by yourself since you have to take off the wheels to stow it away in the bag.  The first time we used it we checked at the gate which meant that I had to hold the baby while my husband took apart the stroller and wheels to stow it away (do not attempt to do this at the end of the boarding tunnel because you'll need more floor space.) The bag is well padded and has a shoulder strap and handle straps.  The stroller arrived in great condition as did the bag (no rips or scuffs which I think is more of a testament to the airline than the bag.) The second time we just checked the whole stroller at the ticket counter since its just as easy to carry the baby through security and to the plane in a baby carrier.  Again, bag did great and the stroller survived the journey no problem.  I do with the design made it easier to fold up and store in the stroller basket.  And I wish it was cheaper.  Its a pretty steep price but you don't have a choice if you want to protect the expensive stroller for air travel.  Depending on the destination I usually don't travel with this stroller by air since I like to have one to use at the airport in case of delays, etc.  We now have a separate stroller for air travel which is lightweight and folds with one hand so I can travel without a companion to assist.
