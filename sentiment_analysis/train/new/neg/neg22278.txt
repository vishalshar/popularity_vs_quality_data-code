We bought this thinking it would be perfect for keeping our son's sippy cup from being flung or dropped from the stroller.  Sure, it can do that, but this gets 2 stars because of the design. Unlike Munchkin's other 12-ounce handle-less sippy cups, this one has a spout/nipple that CANNOT be removed from the collar - or if it can, it's really, really hard to do so.  I pried my nails under it, used a phillips screwdriver, and resorted to a tiny bottle opener to attempt to remove the spout from the collar. However, it is very much so a two-piece construction, meaning that water can get into the spaces between the spout and collar and then sit there and get moldy.  Ugh, no thank you.Munchkin, fix the lid design and this would get 5 stars!!!
