We love this mobile and so does our 5 month old son.  He squeals with delight whenever it is turned on.  However, I was horrified when, like some others, he awoke crying at 3 AM one morning (he was 3 1/2 months old then).  When I went to check on him, I saw that the whole assembly with the animals and beads had fallen on his head!  I was very upset.  He had the string wrapped all around his wrist as well.  We reattached the mobile the next day (I left it out of his crib that morning) because we thought maybe it had just come loose for some odd reason and it was  a fluke.  To my shock, it fell again a few days later, although he was not in his crib.I contacted Tiny Love via e-mail and they told me that they had received similar complaints and that one of two things were happening:1) People were not holding in the little button when attaching the animal assembly to the 'arm'.  If you don't hold the button in the whole time it can fall like this.2) Sometimes the little piece of plastic inside the 'arm' where it attached can chip and break, causing it not to lock into place.Tiny Love did say they would send me a new one at no charge so I gave them my name and address.  Three weeks went by and I had not received it so I sent a follow up e-mail.  A week later we received our new parts (it came with a new arm and the hanging assembly).  If we had not had this problem, I would have given this product a 5+ star rating.  However, be very careful when you install it, and check it frequently to ensure it is not coming loose.  We installed the new one that we just got a couple of weeks ago and no problems yet.  Ours had chipped on the inside so it was not snapping into place and that is why it fell.
