0 STARS for both Amazon and Albeebaby because they sent me a completely different City Mini. I ordered the green 2012, 3 wheel and Amazon sent me a 4 wheel ALL BLACK 2013 City Mini. Dont know how you could get the two mixed up but okay amazon. No five stars for you Amazon/Albeebaby.3 stars for the actual stroller. Why you say?1- The stroller really isn't THAT light. Its light enough to pick up with one hand when in a rush but its pretty solid otherwise. I struggle just to carry it up 10 steps.2- Once again the actual folding is amazing when in a rush. Take the baby out and just pull up. Amazing!3- The seat sits way back. I can imagine this will be a big problem since the baby who is using it is already trying to reposition himself at 6 months old.4- The basket is a pretty good size. I'd say you could fit 3-4 packs of Costco chicken breast. It easily fits my back pack baby bag.5- LOVE, LOVE , LOVE the handle. It is so much better than a foam handle. Love it!6- Amazingly sized canopy. Covers atleast half of the baby.7- Did not come with a bumper bar. I knew this but you'd think for the newest 2015 price they would atleast include that.8- People have mentioned that you kick the brake bar a lot. When I had that comment on my mind I did indeed kick the bar BUT once I was just naturally walking outside with the stroller I did not. my foot never touched it.9- I can feel the bumps of the street more with this City Mini than the Valco Snap.Overall its a good stroller if you take public transit or walk the majority of the time but I repeat it really does not feel lightweight once folded. If you're looking for an light & easy to fold stroller I would highly recommend the Valco Snap. The -2lbs makes a drastic difference!!
