The premise of this is brilliant, but the execution leaves something to be desired. You have to fill up the water container quite a bit and it is difficult to seat back in place, which can cause it not to work. So I just leave it in place and fill it one large cup at a time to prevent this. The other problem is that the formula and the water mix together in the same part of the device and cause a build up on the bottom of the formula container that once again causes it not to work. You have to pick up the formula container and run a paper towel along the hole the formula comes out of every few bottles. It's a huge pain in the neck. I would think the people who designed it would think of a better way to combine the formula and the water but keep them separate so the residue doesn't build up, but I am no inventor so I'm not sure how they would do it. The bottom line, however, is that the price for this and the convenience it offers of being able to wake up at 5am and press a button and have a bottle in two seconds at the perfect temperature far outweighs the hassle of the product's design. I would recommend this, especially for the price.
