I really wish I had waited to buy this. My little one is a 95 percentile child and she was a little too big for this when we really needed it. She started really wanted to hold our hands to walk alone when she was about 9 months, and could walk by herself when she was 11 months. I bought this when she was 8 months and we only used it a handful of times because she hated it. She didn't like it and it was tight on her chubby legs. When she was about 10 months and really going strong on walking around with our help it would not fit on her.Even if it had fit, we would only have used it for about 2 months anyway, because she learned to walk so fast. Also, she was really tall and I am short, so I never really had to bend over very far to reach her hands. My husband would have been the main one using it. So either way it would have been a waste of money for us.I ended up selling ours on ebay for half the price I paid, even though it was like brand new.This product would be great for those who didn't have a bigger baby that could use it for longer, or parents and grandparents who may have some back issues. But for us it wasn't worth it.
