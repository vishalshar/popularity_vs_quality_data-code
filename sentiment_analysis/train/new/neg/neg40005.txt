Best stroller ever I absolutely love it.  Glides amazingly, quality build with quality materials.  I do have one bone to pick though and it is a big one so that is why I am giving it one star because the issue is so huge and dangerous it needs to be recalled.  The wheels.  In less than 3 months of use I have received 3 flat tires all in the back wheels.  I have spent approx. $50 on new replacement tubes from BOB.  The first flat was popped by a small thorn that went straight in, this was the only flat from off road trail use, the rest happens on concrete sidewalk.  The second one was popped by a dried thorn that upon removal I could crumble between my fingers.  The third flat was a tiny piece of metal that popped a replacement tube.  After the first flat I thought maybe I overinflated the tires so I bought a pressure meter and inflated them all to exact specifications.  This did not help.  The rubber on the tires is way too soft and cheap in my opinion.  I can not go on hikes anymore without carrying tools, pump, and spare tubes.  These tires are very dangerous here is why: Imagine you go on a several mile hike with your infant and receive a flat from something as stupid as a thorn.  Now how do you get back?  Ditch the stroller and carry the infant for miles? What if I am in bear or puma country and its getting late? A stroller meant for the trails needs rugged quality wheels at least the quality of a cheap bicycle tire.  These wheels only appear rugged but are total crap rubber.  I am currently looking for a solution and would greatly appreciate any help offered.  Is there a foam I can fill the tubes with or a way to reinforce the wheels?  Are there any after market wheels I can buy that will work with this stroller's rims?  Anything please bc I am sick of the flats that ruin this PERFECT stroller otherwise.
