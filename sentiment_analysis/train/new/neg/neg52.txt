I love the idea of a booster feeding chair as opposed to a regular high chair. I love the swivel mechanism. What I don't like about the chair are the straps; they're too long and we had to tie them in knots to adjust them properly. Another drawback was adjusting the angle of the chair; I've only managed to do it successfully once. My spouse also seemed to think that the raised hump in the middle should have had some padding.
