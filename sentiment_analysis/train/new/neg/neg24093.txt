I used this set of tubes for a month and the hard plastic connector at the end of the tube snapped. Thankfully it was my last pumping session of the day at work (I just used the good tube as a single), but the LAST thing working moms need is to have a part fail. I am lucky to have a lactation store at our local hospital so I could quickly source the Medela brand tubes, which are far sturdier. Not sure if this problem is an exception, but that was my experience.
