Package was sent fast. Quality is amazing, however the base where her legs went ware so wide, it did not work great for my 2 month old. The material wouldn't fold nicely for my daughters leg to sit correctly. Instead of the frog leg bend, her legs would be almost straightoutwards. Works better when they are bigger.
