I was very happy with this monitor when I first purchased it.  I liked the zoom and the night vision.  The picture was clear and the range was pretty far.  So when my second child came along, I purchased another camera for the same monitor.  I liked how it would scan between the two rooms and I would know if one of my children were stirring.  Three and a half years in, the battery blew up in the parent receiver.  It's pretty scary and could have caused a fire, luckily it didn't.  Bought a new battery, but that didn't help.  After talking to the company several times, I was told there's no warranty and they don't sell the parent receiver seperate, so if I want to keep using my cameras, I have to buy a whole new set!  Wish I would have just done that 6 months ago when I bought the second camera.  I don't need a third camera and I'm frustrated that I have to buy one!  I think I'll probably be picking a new brand this time.
