So this product would be great IF the removable pads they advertised would go back in and stay in place just as easily as they come out. They do not "hook" to anything on the back of the car seat and so your kid ends up just sitting on the "seat cushion" pad that you've had to lay back on his seat after washing. I ended up taking the pads out all together because it kept getting bunched up around my son. Maybe I don't know how to use it properly, but at this point, why do I have to try to "figure it out". Would not purchase again. If I buy a car seat, I want it to work right away and not give me grief.
