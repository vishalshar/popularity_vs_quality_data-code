We originally purchased this item for our son 3 years ago but by the time our daughter was born 7 months ago the pad had developed several strange black spots.  We weren't sure if it was some sort of mildew or mold or what, so we played it safe and purchased a new one for her. However, after the first time I washed the new pad and hung it to air dry, I noticed two of the black spots on IT!  A mysterious red patch has since appeared.  We have NO idea what these spots are.  Otherwise we really like the pad and it gives us peace of mind, but I'm still wondering what causes the discoloration???
