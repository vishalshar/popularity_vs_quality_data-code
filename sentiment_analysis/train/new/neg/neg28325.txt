I am not reviewing the bee teether that vibrates, though it might have the same problem.  Please be careful when allowing your baby to use this teether if they already have developed some teeth.  My 10 month old has been using this teether a lot recently.  She already has four upper and lower teeth, but her molars are now coming in.  My husband noticed the other day that she had almost completely chewed through and off some of the bumps on the upper wing.  She could have potentially choked or swallowed the pieces.  I have an e-mail into Sassy and I'm waiting a response.  Please use this teether with caution.
