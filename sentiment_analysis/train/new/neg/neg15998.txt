I bought this specifically for the suction cup base...well it only suctions to my daughters high chair tray or any other hard surface for around 20 seconds then, its tossed right on the floor with the rest of her toys. As well she seems to get her fingers stuck in the toy and then screams, I had to take it away from her because she kept getting them stuck, I was worried she would bruise her hands or worse. If the suction base worked at all I could place it just within her reach so her hands wouldn't get stuck in it, and she could still spin it. I am very disappointed with this toy and as well have forwarded my concerns to the manufacturer. I hope this and all the other reviews help any other parents looking to buy this.
