I originally thought this was the perfect alternative to the SwaddleDesigns flannel cotton blankets--for a lighter, summer-weight option--but have since changed my mind. Here is why: these blankets are a very light gauze-like material. That seemed fine, but the problem is that during the night, when my son squirmed around in his swaddle, the blanket moved around and formed almost rope-like bunches of material around my son, which has to be uncomfortable to sleep on. The flannel is able to stay put much better. But, I am still glad that I have this blanket. It is a great light, breathable blanket for other uses (such as covering your stroller when you're out to give baby some shade).
