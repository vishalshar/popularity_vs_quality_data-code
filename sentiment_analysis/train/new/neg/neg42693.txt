The review called "Low Quality" is accurate in that this product is made of a thin, cheap fabric.  It arrived oddly in plastic without any kind of label, tag, or brand.  However, it serves my intended purpose: provide a subtle cover over the crib spring to make the crib look more "finished."  I have a baby boy and was having trouble finding a gray crib skirt that wasn't ruffled.  I wanted a low-profile white and gray skirt and this does the job.  Given the crib skirt is purely for looks and doesn't really get touched, I didn't care that it's not soft and is a cheap fabric.  That said, I do NOT recommend this brand (Baby Doll Modern Hotel Style) for any other uses, such as their pillow or comforter, as I assume they are also of poor quality and those are items that need to be much nicer.
