I have tried a lot of nipple brushes - most of the time, bottle brushes come with some kind of built-in nipple brush that is cleverly integrated into the handle of the bottle brush.  These built in nipple brushes are usually too small and the bristles too firm for my liking.  But my biggest "issue" with these built-in nipple brushes is that the nipple brush is stored INSIDE the bottle brush handle - which is going to be damp and dark.  Can we say bacteria and mold haven?  Ick.  Not so clever if you ask me.Enter Baby Simba.  I love using this nipple brush.  The bristles are really bushy and have just the right amount of firmness.  Not too firm, not too soft (I feel like Goldilocks!).The bushiness is also PERFECT for cleaning out Medela pumping parts.For perspective on size, it's about the length of an average woman's index finger, tip to end of handle.That said, they are not the best quality.  After about a month, the orange handle eventually becomes seperated from the bristle rod.  You can still use the brush, but obviously it's more difficult to use without the handle.  You can screw the handle back on, but it will fall off again, and again, and again, and again.  If you're willing to put up with this annoyance, the bristles will last for a few months of every day use before they become all warped.  Since it's a 2 pack, you're looking at about 4-6 months of use from this package.However, this hasn't stopped me from buying another pack after the first two died.  It's still the best nipple brush out there, and the relatively nominal expense is worth it in my opinion.  It's not like we're talking $20 each time...
