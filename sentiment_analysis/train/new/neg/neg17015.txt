I bought this when my 10 month old grandson was able to pull himself up. Right out of the box I was disappointed. The plastic is thin and the toy looked like it would just topple over.I use this toy only with strict supervision, because he can pull it down. There's no exciting toys on the front to interest him. He sometimes twirls the toy on top for a few seconds, and will push it around for a few minutes. I wish I had spent a bit more, and bought one with a wider base, educational and engrossing toys, and sturdier overall.There's nothing horribly "wrong" with this toy, but there's others out there that offer more.
