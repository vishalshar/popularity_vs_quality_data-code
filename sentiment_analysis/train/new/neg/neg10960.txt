For the price, this is a great bouncer chair. Very cute details and the fabric is a good quality. Also like the setting for the vibration. BUT the sound that this product is suppose to include lacks. At first I thought the chair I received was faulty because I could only very faintly hear the music, even on the highest setting. But the replacement chair I received had the same problem. Just know everything else about the chair is great, but the speaker on this product is useless.
