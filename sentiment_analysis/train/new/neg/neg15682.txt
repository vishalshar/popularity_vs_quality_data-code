This product has a very strong odor like a chemical odor of some sort, almost like gasoline. I let them sit outside, washed them, etc and still they have an odor. Not something I would ever let my baby chew on. Back to ordering another Baby Banana! I'm assuming it absorbed the odor from the factory in China they were made in. No thanks! Also, shipping took 6 days when usually my Prime orders arrive in 1-2.
