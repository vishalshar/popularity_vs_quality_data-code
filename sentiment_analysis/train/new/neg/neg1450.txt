I put this item on my registry because I thought it would be nice to get all the basic healthcare items in one purchase rather than having to buy them individually.  I see now, though, that this item is really not necessary.  Between the things the hospital gave me and the other items I received as gifts, the only things left in the kit that I don't have duplicates of are the medicine dispensers and tooth/gum brushes, which certainly don't necessitate purchasing a $20 kit.  Save your money and just pick up any miscellaneous item as needed.
