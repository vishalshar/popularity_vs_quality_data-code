very lightweight and cheap-looking materials hamper this product from earning a 5.  I paid $205 for it, but honestly it looks very cheap and I am in doubt if it will last very long.  There are a lot better options out there for cheaper.  That being said, it does its job and I have not had any issues with it as of yet.  Will do a follow up in roughly a year to let  you know if it held up.
