CONS:VERY bulkyVelcro won't lastDon't fit around legsDoesn't hold poopHard to stuff the extra linerTakes forever to dry in the dryerPROS:Cute printSuper absorbentFold down flap for boy/girl wet spot adjustmentThese diapers are VERY pretty, and like someone else said, should have read the reviews first.  These are SUPER bulky on my 12 pound baby, and I had to put him in a clothes size up while wearing one. It is very loose around the legs, and would not contain a blowout.  Maybe when he is at the far end of the weight range!!!  I am glad that he did not have a blow-out while wearing one of these, because it would have been worse than if I just left him without any diaper on.  They do absorb the pee well, and keep it contained.  There is an extra liner for heavy wetters & overnight, but you have to have extremely small hands to stuff them in the pocket.  I do like the concept of the biodegradable liners that come with, but they feel like rough paper towels.  I know I wouldn't like to wear a paper towel in my underwear!  I was generous enough to give 1 star for the effort the manufacturer made on the pretty prints.
