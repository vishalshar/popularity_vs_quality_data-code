This is good for an affordable carrier. I needed a backpack one desperately and I do like it but my baby doesn't like it so much. She has gotten used to it, but still gets cranky having to spread her legs like that for any period of time. I also love the mesh back opening so it wasn't too hot when we went on a hike this summer. It was such an attractive deal that my husband and I bought it literally at the same time, arrive the same day! We were both trying to impress each other with this great deal!
