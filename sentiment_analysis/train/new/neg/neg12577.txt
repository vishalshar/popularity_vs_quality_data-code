I purchased the NuRoo (black) within the first couple of weeks of having my baby. I had a case of the baby blues and hoped that if I had this shirt it would be the answer. I pictured walking around the house and throughout our neighborhood with our 7 lb newborn snug and cozy in her little pocket... maybe even a trip to the grocery store! Not the case. I blame my purchase on what I like to call the "haze" I was in during the first couple of weeks.The idea is wonderful and left my review at three stars, because I think it might be a great product for some. And I won't get into specifics, but the research on skin-to-skin contact is fascinating.What I liked:* The belt is cute.* Simple design.* I could see it being an easier option to use for some than other baby carriers.* It did hold my baby in a safe position.What I did not like:* Personal preference, but I hate polyester. The fabric content should have stopped me from purchasing in the first place.* Too hot. I had my baby in March and thought 3/4 sleeves would be perfect. I did not know how hot my hormones would make me feel. I wanted to be naked, not have on a polyester shirt with sleeves and a padded belt with a sweating baby in the middle of it all.* The price. If I hadn't been in the haze of having a newborn I would never (EVER!) have purchased this shirt for the price of $60.* The velcro.. oh the velcro.* Did not really feel like I was getting "skin-to-skin" contact between the pocket the baby is in and the bra I was wearing under the shirt.I bought a Boba baby wrap and have much preferred it.
