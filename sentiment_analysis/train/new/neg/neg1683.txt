I ordered these thinking they were Alvas, but they are not. Three of them don't have labels, and the other three are labeled 'BestoBaby'. They are not the same quality as my actual Alvas. While the PUL holds in liquids, I get a lot of leaks through the stitching. I don't have this problem with any of my other diapers, just these six.
