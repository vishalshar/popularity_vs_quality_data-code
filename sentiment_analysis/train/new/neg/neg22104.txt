I like this better in pictures than I do in person. It fit my changing pad perfectly and is very soft.  The material started looking a bit ratty after the serving wash, and the graphics look a bit busy though.  Perhaps it just clashes with my nursery theme.  I don't regret my purchase as it was a good price, and it meets its purpose.
