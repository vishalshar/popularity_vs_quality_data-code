They are really cute and I love they colors but they are a little on the small side. They would be a good size for a preemie. The big problem with mine is the velcro closure. It's so small that it doesn't even have enough to get an attachment strong enough to hold. Every time I put one on my baby I pick him up and it falls right off. :( Not at all what I wanted.
