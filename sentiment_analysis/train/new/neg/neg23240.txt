Dont buy this. Any reviews on here that are positive are fake. If I could return it I would. It is junk. It has absolutely no support from the developers, other than the android app that gets an occasional update (which ends up ALWAYS breaking something else in the app). I have been in relay mode for 2 months. A $15 baby monitor works better and more reliable. I had terrible quality and stability when it did work. Both Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S4 work for about 3 minutes and then disconnect (well not now since the last two updates). Both phones are unrooted and fully updated. For all 3 of those devices being made from Samsung they should work flawlessly. Without WPS you need a windows computer to set it up. Linux support (besides android) is not available. You can change some settings via linux by directing a browser to the ip address of the camera and using the camera username and password to log in. However there will not be any video playback and certain settings fail to save or appear across different browsers (chrome, midori, firefox). Every attempt i have made to contact the developers has been ignored. This is Samsung's worst product I have owned. It was advertised as being a baby monitor. Why use this for watching your baby when it works once out of every thirty times you try to use it? When in relay mode sound is disabled as well, along with the lagged poor resolution video: you will be done changing her diaper before you see yourself on the screen (seriously). I guess my minimum of 30 mbs connection isnt fast enough for a crappy video, but it is just fine to stream 1080 Netflix on three devices simultaneously and 3 computers running nonstop. They cant complain that my ports arent forwarded or router issues either. This product just does not work.
