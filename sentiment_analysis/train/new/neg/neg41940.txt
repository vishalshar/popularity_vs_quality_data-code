GREAT idea!!  Nail clippers on new borns just invites trouble.  This IS the way to go.  I wanted to order for friends for Baby Showers BUT, it does break easily.  Ours just stopped.  I changed the batteries twice... still dead.  It's too expensive to act this cheap.  I would buy a competitors product before buying this again.  In fact I'm in search of a different brand for this product.  Alternatively, I just use old fashioned nail files on  my baby.
