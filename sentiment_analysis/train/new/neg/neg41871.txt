I choose this bottles over storage bags, hoping to make things easy and convenient for me and my husband when I returned to work,or was away from home.  I would pump the milk straight into the bottles and freeze it,{no problem at all} and my husband would thaw the milk and feed our son.  Here is my complain, I found out the first time I tried them out that it takes forever to defrost the milk. Just putting it under hot water took me like 25 minutes while holding a wailing baby in my arms and still was cold when I fed the baby. I bought a bottle warmer to see if that would make it easier the next time, and to my frustration, it did not defrosted the milk at all.  I had to return the bottle warmer because it was useless.  I end up buying the lasinoh storage bags instead, I like them because it only takes about three to five minutes to defrost and feed a crying baby warm milk. And my husband has no problem at all running them under hot water.In my experience, this bottles are okey to pump and transport milk, and for keeping milk in the fridge area, but not for freezing and thawing it if you need the milk ready in a short time. You probably have to take the milk out one or two hours before feeding it to your baby, and let it sit and thaw before warming it. and if you don't use it, once it is defrosted then you'll end up throwing it away as it has happened to me.  I personally like to take the milk out of the freezer, thaw it and feed it right away. And honestly babies are unpredictable, sometimes they would want more milk than usual and you have to have it ready in a short time.
