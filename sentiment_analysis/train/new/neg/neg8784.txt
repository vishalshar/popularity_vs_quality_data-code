Playtex Diaper Genie Essentials Diaper Disposal PailThis was a great buy for the price. However a couple things wrong. We ordered two Playtex Diaper Genie Essentials Diaper Disposal Pails. When we got them both boxes were missing the 30 pack pail and 270 cartridge refill that is stated in the amazon features to come with as well as the diaper genie box itself says right on it it has a 30 pack and a 270 refill. Then when opening and examining both units one has a defective close flap that is supposed to snap back shut after the soiled items are pushed through it. It was a relatively easy fix. Once examining the one that was put together properly we found one of the tension springs had bent and fallen out of the mounting hole. So now we are having to fight with Amazon and playtex to send the remaining part of the order that was excluded from both pails.I would suggest getting this item because it does work well when in proper working order. However I suggest buying refills at the same time you buy the pail so the product can be used right away seeing as Playtex has decided to short their boxes all the parts.
