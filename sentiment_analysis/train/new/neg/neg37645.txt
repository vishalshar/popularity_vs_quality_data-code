These are WAY overpriced. They are NOT water proof and after a few hours of wear, the other side IS damp/sometimes wet. My baby spits up milk sometimes, she doesnt drool. The only reason I got these is because they are a lot bigger than most bibs and they keep the spit up milk off the baby's clothes. But after a few times, i do have to throw these into the laudry because they arent absorbent.
