After reading all these great reviews, I made this buy.  This product did nothing for either of my babies-- in fact it made them fuss, which was not their normal behavior.  It did not move fast enough at all!  The swing is far superior, so I don't get the point of having this.  It takes up too much room as well.  If it moved a lot faster or vibrated, it might be useful, but I wouldn't recommend this at all.
