I actually don't know how well it works, becuase I bought it as a gift and the packaging looked so bad I couldn't give it as a gift. It looked like water had gotten on the packaging in the warehouse...everything else in the amazon box was fine so it wasn't from shipping. At first I thought I would just take it out of the packaging and still give it as a gift, but then I noticed that there were black marks on the part of the lilly pad that wasn't covered in the packaging. Just decided I would keep it for myself for when the neice comes to visit.
