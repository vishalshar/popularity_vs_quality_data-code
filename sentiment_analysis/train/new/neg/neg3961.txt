I received this bundle through the Amazon Vine program.  Some of these items are very useful, some not so much, and some I haven't yet used and don't think they are particularly useful at all.1) The Cup.I like this cup a lot.  It is a good training cup for a toddler sitting at at able and starting to learn to drink from a glass.  The top has several cut out holes around the rim, so the toddler gets used to sipping from an open cup.  However, it is NOT spill proof.  There is also a top that is (mostly) spill proof that can be used as a traditional sippy until your child is ready for to start learning to drink from a glass.2) The spoon.This is a nice soft-tipped spoon, principally to be used for feeding infant children.  My son is beyond this stage, but this seemed like a good spoon generally.  I like the carrying case, although, honestly, it's just something extra to clean.  A plastic bag works just as well, and that you can just throw away.3) The stroller hook.Unnecessary.  I use a diaper bag that can be hooked around my stroller's handles, which keeps my belongings more secure and less likelty to make the stroller lobsided in weight or to get caught in the wheels.4) travel bottle brushUnnecessary.  Seriously, do you really have a great need to wash bottles when you're not at home?  I don't get this product at all.5) Snack container.As good as the Munchkin brand I see most commonly.  But better, because this has a top, which keeps all those cheerios from filling the bottom of my diaper bag.6) Wipes container.This wipes container keeps wipes wet, better than the Huggies-brand refill container I also have.  It's also harder for my toddler to open and then just take all the wipes out, too.So that it.  Decide for yourself if the individual items are better to buy individually -- my hunch is yes, it will be cheaper to just buy what you need rather than this "bundle."
