Do yourself a favor and get a BOB! I have had this stroller for a year, and it has always shook when I walk too fast, which is not fast at all.  You have to lock the wheel to prevent shaking, however it is really hard to keep the stroller on a narrow sidewalk when the wheel is locked.  A friend of mine has the BOB revolution, and she is not having these problems.
