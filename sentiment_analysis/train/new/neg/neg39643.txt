This is an excellent car seat if it fits your car. We have a 2001 Subaru Outback and the seatbelt anchors in the vehicles seats were too long, or the height of the lower half of the car seat was too short. Either way you look at it, we were unable to tighten the carseat due to two things. First the hard plastic portion of the seatbelt was contacting the carseat and preventing us from tightening it any further, and second the carseat itself does not have a seatbelt lock off. I tried on 4 separate occasions for over an hour each time, and employed my husband for extra muscle, it was an impossibility. After a lot of research online I discovered this problem could be remedied if the carseat had a lock off. So we returned this and got the Britax Frontier 90 with the click tight closure and it is brilliant. It went in, in less than 5 minutes and is as tight as can be. Thank you Amazon for accepting returns without any fuss!
