There are several things I like about this toothbrush, such as the length of the handle, the comfortable grip, and the bright colors.  However, on every toothbrush we've used the bristles have fallen out after just a couple months of use.  When it first happened, I thought it was a fluke.  I threw away the second toothbrush in the pack (mine was a multi-pack) as a precaution and purchased a second toothbrush from a pack of one.  After a couple of weeks, this toothbrush lost another bristle from the head!  This is clearly a problem that needs to be addressed, and I no longer feel safe cleaning my baby's teeth with brushes from this company.
