With my first child I purchased a traditional high chair (Chicco brand).  I didn't like how huge it was and how much space it took up in our small breakfast area. So with baby #2 I opted for the Space Saver in Mocha Butterfly.  Baby #2 is now 8 months old and we use this high chair for most of our mealsPros:takes up less room than the traditional high chair (the footprint is only as large as your chair)can be pushed up to the table and used without the traycute designconverts to toddler seat (though we haven't used it this way yet)Fabric is washabletray fits in the dishwasherfabric pad clips into place and stays putConsfabric is NOT truly wipeable. With a messy self feeder I have to wash this pad daily and it requires line dryingunthreading and re-threading the straps through the holes is a pain (not impossible just annoying)chair pad is thin (and thus uncomfortable for baby) we have to use a folded towel to add extra paddingstraps are NOT easy to clean and are white (stain central)pad does not cover over the sides so food collects between cushion and chair every single timeholes/crevices/gaps on the inside of the armrests collect food and require a small head tooth brush to clean out (a washcloth can't get into the space well enough)armrests bump into the side of the table so we can't pull the seat in as close as we'd like (even when it's angled)The majority of my complaints would be solved with a change in the seat cushion. It if was plastic fabric, had more padding, and covered the chair over the sides it would be MUCH better. And if the armrests were removable....it'd be Perfect!!
