I was looking for a ramp for my Safety 1st baby gate and since Tee Zed was the only one that sold such a product, I gave it a try. I was not able to fit my gate into this gate ramp as the base of my gate was larger than the width of the gap on the ramp. It would have been better if the gate ramp was made of more flexible material, like maybe a kind of rubber, so that it can flex to accommodate gates of different base widths. I now own a white elephant.
