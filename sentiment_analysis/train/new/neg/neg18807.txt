This neckalace was way too lose on my child's neck. So loose that he could get the beads into his mouth. I don't think it is healthy for him to suck on it but there was no stopping him and also he could break it and choke on a bead or strangle himself. Stopped using this as soon as I saw him walking around with it in his mouth. He was one year old at the time.
