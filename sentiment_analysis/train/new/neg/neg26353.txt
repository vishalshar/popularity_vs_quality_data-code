It's okay. Doesn't exactly serve it's purpose of being able to see a rear-facing baby from your rear-view mirror - as you cannot angle it down, so you really just end up looking at the very top of the car seat/ceiling (unless you turn around while the car is stopped and look down into it, then you can see the baby). My almost 12 month old daughter can't see herself in it either, however it keeps her entertained with the music and lights. She is able to kick the flower to keep turning it on once the music stops. We tried the mirror on the back of the driver/front passenger seats, and if she was forward facing, it would be perfect. Just have to wait until she's big enough to go forward facing before she can see herself in the mirror.
