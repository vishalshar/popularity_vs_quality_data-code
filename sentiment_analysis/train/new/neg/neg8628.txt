i was in the store and saw this unit and it was advertised as "meeting new standards" or something like that. i had already had one by the same company, however, i thought that i would replace it because this new and improved version was taller (it sat on the top of the mattress). so, i purchased this bed rail for my 4 year old and it wasn't too very difficult to snap the pieces together. however, once you get it together, getting it to fit properly was IMPOSSIBLE ! it would have been easier had my husband been at home, but he wasn't, and i figured, how hard could it be ? well, let's try VERY HARD. first, i had a BIG problem trying to get it to fit between the rail/frame and the mattress (there are two "arms" that fit underneath the mattress) on the bottom bunk bed. but after a lot of time and scraping of the wood frame, i was able to get that done. THEN i had to try and push the sides down tight enough on the mattress to make the arms lock -- all the while, the thing kept falling over (hence, the second person being helpful). this, i was unable to do. MOREOVER, i thought that had i actually been able to lock the thing properly, how long would it take for me to change the sheets ? realizing that i don't have that kind of time, energy or patience, i returned the darned thing. interestingly enough, the clerk didn't even ask me why -- apparently two other people had just returned the same thing -- oh, and by the way, don't think that once you get this thing together that it will fit in the box again, because it won't. it locks in two places, and you can't disassemble. AND its pretty awkward getting it back in the car -- sorry, the bitterness still lingers. i wouldn't advise that anyone purchase this device -- there are better products on the market that are easier to use/assemble.
