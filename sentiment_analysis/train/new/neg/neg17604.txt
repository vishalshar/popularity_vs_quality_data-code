This is a nice carrier, but definitely not worth the money. This is one of the more expensive ones out there, I did some research before I bought this and read reviews that people recommended it because it is the most comfortable for your back, can be used for multiple carrying positions, and has a high weight limit. However, there are more cons for this product that make it so I wish I had just got an ergo (or similar) and not spent as much. It is too big and bulky to use for a newborn--though technically you can--it just felt like baby was going to fall out the sides the whole time, and the material is so stiff, it was not comfortable for her. I had to buy a sling in order to be able to carry her around the house. We do use the Beco now that she is older and bigger, and it fits fine for carrying the baby facing in and out, but when I tried to do the back carry it just did not fit right. The baby's legs seemed pinched by the arm straps, and the chest strap was strangling me. There is one other thing that is not really a big deal but kinda irritates me--there is no pocket. It would be very convenient to be able to have somewhere to put my keys/phone when we go out for our walks.
