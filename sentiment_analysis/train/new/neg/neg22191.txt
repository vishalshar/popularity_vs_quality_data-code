I was so excited about this toy.  Loved the music and the mirrors, and the options for crib or floor.  It worked for about 30 minutes, then stopped.  I e-mailed the manufacturer several times, and received no response.  I'm so disappointed, I think it would have been a great toy, and I would have recommended it to many people had it kept working.
