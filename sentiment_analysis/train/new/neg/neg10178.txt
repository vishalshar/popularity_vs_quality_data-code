Bought this as a replacement for my daughter's favorite monkey...the bow is on the wrong side and she was onto us for this fraudulent version! In the picture the bow is on the same side as her original favorite, but when they arrived, the bow was on the other side. It can't just be moved, as they are sewn on quite well.That being said, if you aren't buying it trying to fool your kid into thinking you are a hero who found her toy, it is great.
