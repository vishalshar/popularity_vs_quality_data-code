This travel bottle warmer did not work.  I read over the reviews and knew this might not be the best product and that it would take a long time to warm a bottle.  With that in mind we plugged it in 30-40 minutes before our son would need his bottle, the light was on, and we put a bottle in with plenty of time to warm up.  Thirty minutes later the bottle was still ice cold.  It was faster to put the bottle between my legs as I sat in the car than to use this warmer.  We tried it three times during our travels with various amounts in the bottle, and each time the bottle was still ice cold. Overall, I do not recommend this product.
