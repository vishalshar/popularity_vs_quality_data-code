I like it but only a little. "La gorrita parece una porrqueria comparado a la foto", is what first came to mind to write. The beanie looks like a dumb commical version of the one pictured on the baby. The color is a brighter orange which makes it a lil more comical. LOL really!!  It is cute so, I kept it. The one pictured looks MUCH better, with textured edges, the nose is sooooo much cuter. It was too big for a 2 month old. I will try to post a pic soon.I got it to fit good enough on a 2 month old for the pictures but will still fit at least 6 months from now for sure. I want to add pix, but I am not sure yet if I can from "my orders" option. Most of the bottoms of these costumes are too big and they need to be folded over and fastened so it fits and the diaper doesn't show. There isn't really a way to fasten them anyway.  It's okay because even though there is a crochet button as decoration there are no button holes, or at least I didn't figure it out. I used safety pins so you may need to invest in the special large baby kind of safety pins.
