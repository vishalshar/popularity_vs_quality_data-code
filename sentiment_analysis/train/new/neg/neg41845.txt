Not sure if it's my fault; but this thing WILL NOT stick onto our window.  I've cleaned the window, tried to attach it.  I've cleaned the window, wet the suction cup, tried to attach it.  Nothing keeps it sticking on our window.  And to make matters worse, it will not roll up after pressing the button the top bar.  Disappointed.
