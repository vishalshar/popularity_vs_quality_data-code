As other reviewers have pointed out, this really isn't a book. It is basically a crinkly fabric teether. This toy would be good for a first grabbing-chewing toy, but I wouldn't buy it for a baby over six months of age, as it lacks colors and textures to keep an older baby occupied. We preferred the bunny lovey made by  the same company. My daughter played with it daily from 2-4 months, but this book was a flop at 6 months. Though not organic, we prefer soft books by Manhattan Toy,  Roger Priddy and Jellycat.
