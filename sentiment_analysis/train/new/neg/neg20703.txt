I bought this stroller for my triplets. The bolts on the bottom are made of aluminum and have broken off three times: the third time it happened, all three babies were in the stroller and the front bar came down on my daughter's legs.  The collapse also bent the stroller frame. The babies are 10 months old so they're not over the weight limit. This stroller is an absolute safety hazard. Fortunately, I was still in the driveway and not in a place where I couldn't get any help. If I was anywhere else, this could have been a disaster. I'm communicating with the seller who said the manufacturer has a one year warranty on the stroller and would replace it,  but now he is retracting this statement and says that the manufacturer will only replace the parts.  I have requested a refund since I'm not sure a new stroller would be any safer.
