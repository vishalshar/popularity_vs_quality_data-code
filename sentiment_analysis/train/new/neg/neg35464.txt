The background:Well this seemed like a great little pump, I researched and liked the idea that it had different speeds and could be set to start off very gently. I have only ever used a manual pump before and whilst the manual works well I thought it took quite a long time and it did hurt my hand after a while. I wanted to try something that I thought would be quicker and more efficient. I saw the negative reviews and thought maybe those people just got a bad one.The Pros:Cute bag. Easy to assemble pump. All the bits look sturdy enough. Different levels of suction. Easy to operate.The Cons:It doesn't work well. I am so sad. It had such promise. It is really slow to pump, there is no change of speed available so it is either very gentle and slow or you can make it stronger but it is still super slow. My pump also cuts out intermittently - you can coax it back by upping the suction level, then you have to take it down again when the suction kicks in. I could pump much more efficiently with my old manual pump.The bottom line:It looks cute and seems like great value. But it just isn't.
