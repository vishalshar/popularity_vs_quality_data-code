I'm adding this one to the pile of overpriced and unnecessary baby gadgets.  In theory it seems like a great idea to have a hand held masher for feedings.  In practice anything that will mush through the holes is also easily mushed with a fork, which costs about 25 cents and you probably already own one.  If the food has any fiber at all, it will not go through the holes.  Even pasta cooked al dente is a trial for this gadget.  After smushing, there was more food left in the bottom of the device than food that came through the holes.  It just squished the food and didn't really push the food through the holes for a bite size.  At home, I found myself reaching for the fork or potato masher instead of this or a blender - as both a fork and potato masher work better than this little gadget and both are quieter and easier to clean than a blender or grinder.The only good side: I can see the appeal if you are traveling or in a restaurant and want a hand held item in which to hold some baby food while you dish it into little one's mouth.  The spoon snaps into the handle, which is also a plus.  While the design is pleasing, however, the function is limited and not worth the substantial price tag.  Over three years and multiple kids I found that I used this maybe 4 times.What works in this gadget?  Already soft things that you can easily use a fork with:Bananasovercooked pasta.Super ripe fruit, such as pears, that you must peel firstwhat doesn't work?Sweet potatoes, any vegetable with a skin (peas, corn, beans) and everything else.
