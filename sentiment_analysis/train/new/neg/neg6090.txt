My child seemed really comfortable in the car seat but it was extremely difficult to get him in the seat. First, the straps are hard to adjust. When you pull to release with the lever, it was as if you had to yank on it to get any slack. The release lever to get the seat out of the base was extremely difficult to find and then it would catch and get stuck in the base. Overall, it was a great looking and comfortable looking car seat. I didn't have the time or energy to fight with it so I sent it back.
