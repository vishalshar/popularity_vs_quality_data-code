I've had this seat for two years and loved it until I realized that the Styrofoam wings of the "true side impact protection" are broken on both sides.  I've never been in an accident or even a near accident.  I don't move the seat very often - maybe 10 times in the past year.  I can only assume that they broke when my child grabbed on to them as he climbs in to his seat.  It's just Styrofoam - no plastic backing or support, so any sideways pressure and they snap.  They still appeared to be in place.  I didn't even notice until I took the cover off to wash it.  Everything else about the seat has been great.  I never had problems tightening or loosening the harness like other users.  My child does sweat in it, but we're in Texas.  He'd sweat in any seat.  I love the velcro strap holders on the side.  They have made it easy for loading and unloading my son.  I love they easy latch buckles.  That's why we went with Britax to begin with and why I would even consider Britax again, but this is our second Britax to break prematurely.  They don't seem to last longer than 2 years, which is disappointing since I invested in seats that could grow with my children.  I may have to research some nicer brands.
