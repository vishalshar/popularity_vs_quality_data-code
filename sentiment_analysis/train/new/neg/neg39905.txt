This particular monitor itself is fantastic, but the handheld version is a little bulky, and for whatever reason, there's always a lot of interference on the monitor.  Your BT headphones, phone, wifi, wireless mouse, and all sorts of things can interfere with this monitor.I do like the fact that there is a standalone display that we have set up in the kitchen just in case.  The handheld one is a bit ugly, but for the purposes it's suited for, it works great.  The charge lasts okay, probably 3-4 hours if you don't constantly view the screen.I think that the screen colors are actually a bit less bright than other monitors that we own.  It's a lot more faded, and sometimes seems more black and white.  Even the IR side is a little bit weaker than I'd like compared to the Infant Optics brand.All in all, the only reason I would push for this particular set is the stand-alone monitor.  It's one of the few sets you'll find with one.
