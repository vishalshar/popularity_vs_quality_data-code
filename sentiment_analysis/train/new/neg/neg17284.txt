I was given this bottle at the hospital to use for my son and unfortunately it was the only bottle he would take. They don't sell it in stores anywhere, so you have to order it online, which is a pain. Also, it opens from the bottom, which makes it extremely hard to clean the top nipple part and if you don't close it properly than it all leaks right out of the bottom. I also had trouble finding a bottle warmer that it would fit in, so I would have to warm the bottle in a different container and then transfer it to this bottle. It was a hot mess. I will say that my son loved them, but it was a highly inconvenient bottle for a parent. If they made it a bit narrower and had the opening at the top, I would probably consider using it again, but now how they are now.
