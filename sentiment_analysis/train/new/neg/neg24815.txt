After reading all of the great reviews on this booster seat, and thoroughly researching all of the other boosters on the market, I purchased three of these seats for my daughters. My daughters are 3, 4 and 6 and they are all on the tall side.At first my children loved them as we just took short jaunts around town, as they are pretty and cushy, but after our first long car ride, I started missing the old Britax car seats my youngest two had outgrown. When my oldest daughter, age 6, became sleepy, she dozed off just fine and rested her head on the wings of the booster. My 3 and 4 year old however, tried to do the same, but as they would fall asleep, their heads would droop down to their chests. We tried to recline the seat a little after this to try and alleviate the problem, but as soon as you install the LATCH from the booster onto the actual car seat, the back of the booster pops up at a 90 degree angle again. It is very frustrating and I am very angry about all the money I spent on these seats, just to see my daughter's heads resting on their chests. I even tried lowering the head rests, even though it positioned their belts at the very edge of their shoulders, and this still didn't fix the problem. The main reason I bought this booster seat is because I wanted them to be comfortable on long car rides and nap comfortably if they wanted to.If anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this problem, I would love to hear them! I would have just sent them back, but my 3 year old was sick and threw up on hers the second day we owned it!
