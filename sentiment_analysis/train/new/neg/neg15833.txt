These are cute but if you do not have the silicone spout in perfectly, they leak. This includes making sure that the vent is pointed into the cup (it tends to reverse and point out when you wash it. When you insert it in the blue lid after cleaning, make sure to turn the lid over and see that the ring of the spout isn't folded over before putting it on the cup, or its going to get everywhere.
