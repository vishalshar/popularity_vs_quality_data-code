After just a couple of months it became difficult to fold up the stroller because the back wouldn't fold correctly into position.  I have the older model of this Jeep stroller from when my 1st daughter was a baby (she is now 7 y.o.) and that one held up very well still use it today for my second daughter who is curently 2 y.o.  The only draw back from my older Jeep stroller was that it could not recline and I miss place the canopy so this is what prompted me to buy this newer model.  The newer model has its positives &  mostly negatives.  The biggest positive is that it is pretty durable despite being use almost daily.  Never has an issue with anything breaking or falling off.  The three main down sides are the tray table does not lift up to allow you to put the child in so you have to constantly lift the child over it which can be cumbersome.  the cup holder in the tray table is not large enough to accommodate average size sippy cup it only serves as a snack cup but that makes it difficult to clean. The other major draw back is that in order for you to wash the liner you have to dismantle the whole stroller literally.  The liner is NOT attached with velcro & snaps INSTEAD IT IS ATTACHED BY SCREWS so you have to take them out (over 10) .  After washing the liner my father-in-law tried his best to reassemble it back on to the frame but its still not the way it was originally positioned.  When I have more time, I will have to try taking it apart AGAIN & reassembling myself to see if I can get it to look like how it original did.
