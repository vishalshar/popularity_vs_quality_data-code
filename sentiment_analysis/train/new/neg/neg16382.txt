We were excited to receive the fisher price perfectly pink mobile for my daughter. The concept of the lights shinning on the ceiling and the music was what we wanted for a little baby girl. The baby will be born on 2/3/10. Sooooon!When we opened it to look, we discovered the mobile was missing the little bee. This is suppose to be brand new. Now I have to jump thru hoops to send it back and on top of that its going to cost me.  This is more trouble than it is worth.We are very unhappy.Mother and Grandma.
