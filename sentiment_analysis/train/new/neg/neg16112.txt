The first spout cover I received worked perfectly. It inflated easily, provided a nice, cushiony cover for the sport and it didn't lose much air at all over the course of 6 months. I was utterly impressed for the price, so we ordered another one for the in-laws house.The new one showed up and I almost lost a lung trying to inflate it. After 30 minutes of pulling material, squishing the nozzle this way and that, and huffing and puffing, I came to the conclusion I got a dud. It simply wasn't going to inflate. Hopefully everyone else will have better luck.The bottom line though, is for the price, it's worth the gamble.
