This isn't a bad choice for a Noah's Ark type toy but it leaves something to be desired. The printed images of animals on the cut-out block shapes aren't very inspiring and the blocks and corresponding fittings are too amorphous. The animals fall out of the ark easily because of this and yet the toy is very awkward to handle. It's OK but not great.
