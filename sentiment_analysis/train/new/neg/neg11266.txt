Having read other reviews for the set, I felt confident I was ordering quality bedding.  But when the set arrived, I was very surprised how rough the fabric felt.  Even after washing and drying them twice, the feel of the fabric has not improved. I certainly would not sleep comfortably on these sheets and I don't expect my 2 year old to have to snuggle up to sandpaper every night. Very unimpressed.
