Actually the rattle itself is nice and I think my grandson would probably enjoy it a lot.  The reason I'm only giving 1 star is due to the condition of the product that I received.  Arrived with no protective plastic wrap and it's dingy and dirty.  Appears very shop-worn.  Not sure whose dirty hands have been all over it but I'm certainly not going to give it to my 4 month old little grandson who would immediately stuff it in his mouth. May try putting it in the wash and see how it turns out. Very disappointed.
