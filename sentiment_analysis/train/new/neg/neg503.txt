Let me start with we love the mat! The colors are very vibrant and beautiful! I work from home so I bought this to set up in my office to give my 7 month old padding. It does just that and keeps him off of the cool floors. However, he has learned to tear the pieces out of the mat. We did have a chocking episode. My only complain is that some of the pieces were made much to small. Most pieces are to big to fit in to a child's mouth but 8 of the wheels that are on the vehicles' are very small! I wish they would have made them bigger like most of the other vehicle wheels. The choking episode was obviously VERY scary. To prevent it I hot glued all of the small pieces in so that my baby still has the entertainment of tearing it apart and I have the option to easily move it.
