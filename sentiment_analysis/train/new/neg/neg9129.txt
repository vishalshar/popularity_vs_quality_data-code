The chair is very easy to put together and construction is of good quality. The finish is beautiful and should go well in many homes. Seat and foot rest height is easy to adjust; no tools necessary.The major drawback, however, is the product says "Starts out as an infant high chair and then converts to a toddler booster and then a preschooler chair, and beyond". Well, I have a 5 year old and am looking for something she can use a desk chair that she can pass down to her younger sister once the baby outgrows the small high chair. The seating area of this chair is so small that my 5-year-old cannot get comfortable in it. The footrest is equally small, so even though her feet are not that big a significant portion is sticking out.If you plan to use it only as a baby chair, this is ok. But don't expect it to grow with your child. For us, it is going back to amazon. (good that they have free returns)
