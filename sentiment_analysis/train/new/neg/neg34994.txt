Mostly good things to say but i'm going to start with my only complaints so far. 1) The color is not quite as advertised on the blue/teal and white potty. In the pictures i thought it looked more blue (even looking at them now) however it is more green than blue. Not a big deal its not drastically different  and it is still a nice color but i would call it more teal than blue. Secondly it has a sticker on it that i cant remove. Right where the backrest is. It is larger (probably at least 3.5inx1.5in) i tried to peel it off and it is clearly leaving a residue. I might try a goo gone or something but i didn't want to have to do that much.That being said, its a good buy. Its the perfect size for my daughter (who is 18 months old) and it is still big enough to let her grow into it a bit while we potty train the next few months.  Its a lot lighter than i thought it would be but that ok itll be easier to travel with that way. The insert it easy enough to remove. The material was nice and it was here on time.I did a lot of searching to find the cheapest option for a potty that met my needs and this was it. I paid about  7$ Totally worth it.
