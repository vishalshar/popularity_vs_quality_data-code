The tray is a good size, though it could stand to be a bit bigger, especially if used for food. While the pommel top is easy to install and remove with one hand, the upgrade tray is a trickier feature, often requiring both hands and a look under the hood to ensure the tracks it slides on are aligned with the grooves under the tray. Add to that the fact that baby's knees are often in the way of the sliding tray and I have to press them down to get the tray on. But once it's on, it's great and I am able to put an array of toys in front of baby. Removing the tray is also a hassle though. The plastic clips pinched to remove the tray seem a little flimsy. I hope they don't break as I am not sure the tray can continue to be used if they do.UPDATE 12/22/2013: Now that baby is older and her legs are longer her knees are no longer in the way when I slide the tray on.
