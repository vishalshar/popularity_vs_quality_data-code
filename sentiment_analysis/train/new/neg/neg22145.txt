I had a Graco adapter previously and the adapter snapped into the stroller securely, the carseat locked onto the adapter securely, and there was a strap for extra security.  I loved it.  I ordered the Maxi Cosi adapter for my new Maxi Cosi car seat... and couldn't be more disappointed.  It snaps in to the stroller fine - but I can't get it off.  It is ridiculously difficult to get it out.  Even worse, the carseat does NOT lock onto the adapter.  There is a strap for security - but since I plan to use the Valco hitchhiker for my toddler, the strap is just not safe enough for me.  One good shove could dislodge the carseat.  I thought perhaps I was shipped the wrong adapter - and checked with the seller AND with Valco directly.  Nope.  It's the right one... just a really lousy fit.  So disappointing since I can't return the carseat - and it isn't worth the cost to ship the adapter back (though the seller did approve a return).  I own 2 valco trimodes, 2 hitchhikers, 2 bassinet stands, 2 bassinets, and many other small accessories (snack trays, cupholders, bug nets, etc.)  This is the first - and only - Valco product that has disappointed.  So frustrating.  :(
