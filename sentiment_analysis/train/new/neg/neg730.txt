I decided to wait in writing a review until I really had some use of this pump.Love: The price, it has everything included and very easy to use.Dislike: When I first started using the pump at home with the adapter, no batteries; I noticed the suction was weak on one side. When I was ready to use it again I made sure to read the instruction once more and assembled the pump as I did the first time. Still the suction was weak on one side.I started to use the pump at work operated by batteries. I've noticed the suction is weak on both sides when used with batteries and have to stay on the pump a few minutes longer. Now on the 2nd week back to work the suction power is weaker and I changed the Energizer batteries within 1 week of use. My 15 mins are turning into 17-19 mins and I tried increasing the level. With the added minutes and increase, my breast remain full and are aching by the time I go home. Too bad these machines (base/motor only) can't be returned or exchangedUpdate: I've noticed a slight decrease in my production of milk. I have to stay longer on the pump in hopes to get back where I was
