I thought this would be a good holder for my 2 year olds cup in the car. While it holds it fine he can't reach it himself or put anything in and out of it and I still have to hand him items. Kinda defeats the purpose. Maybe once he is upright more and forward facing it might work better but I still don't see him being able to put items back in as it collapses easily.
