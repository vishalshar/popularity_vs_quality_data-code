I'm kinda disappointed with the teether I purchased.  I baught one directly from the company at mommycon in September and  it had little beads in it to make it rattle.  I read the questions on this product and the answers were yes it has the beads (even though the pictures don't really show it.) This is my son's favorite to because of the rattle and he loves to chew it. After receiving this I looked at the actual website to purchase this teether and in their description it states "new design - rattle free".  No where in the description on amazon does it say that. While my son absolutely loves this teether, I am disappointed that it doesn't not have the beads and it does not state that anywhere.
