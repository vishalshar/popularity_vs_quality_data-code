These are a really neat idea for potty training toddlers. I really like the side storage pockets that are adjustable. They are made to fit many car seats but I have two different models of convertible car seats and these just don't quite fulfill their purpose. They slip around and bunch up frequently and after a couple of washes, they have lost their gripping material (all over the seat). When my toddler has had accidents I have still had to wash the car seat. Assuming these stay in place, they are helpful with minor spills.
