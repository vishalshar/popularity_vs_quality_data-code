Purchased 3 of these, opened 1 to test and in my 2 year olds 3 in 1 Nautilus Graco car seat since she is potty training. It holds urine if it is a small amount, but if she has a full blown accident it soaks right down into the car seat and soaks that too.The whole point of purchasing these was to save ourselves the hassle of constantly pulling apart the car seat to clean it when she had accidents.As much as I was hoping this would work for us it didn't and I would not recommend this product as it has been more of a hassle if anything
