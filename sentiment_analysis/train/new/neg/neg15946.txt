Our friends had this pail for their son and while we were visiting we fell in love with it! It was automated and it contained the smell! Well, sure it contains the smell of a small baby whose main diet does not consist of solid foods. Once your baby hits the toddler years - forget it!!! Our son's room always smells like dirty diapers now! Even when there are NONE in the pail! We've disinfected the whole thing numerous times, left it completely disassembled sitting out in the hot, summer FL sun all day. Nothing works. I'm going out to buy a Diaper Genie II Elite tomorrow. That same friend just ditched her Graco for the Diaper Genie II Elite for the exact reasons as us and her son's room doesn't smell at all. I've read reviews all over the internet ([...]) on the Genie and it has the best ones by far. Something of note on the Diaper Genie II Elite: their pails are made with an antimicrobial plastic that inhibits the growth of bacteria and which works as an additional odor deterrent in the system.****NEW/FIRST-TIME PARENTS: PLEASE keep in mind that as long as you have a newborn and have not entered the toddler years, you honestly have NO idea what "smelly" really is! LOL  So, when trying to find a diaper pail that will work for you, look for reviews on how it measures up to a toddler's stinky diapers and not just another parent that has a "4 month old", etc. - the toddler stage is the true test. Just some friendly advice from a first time mom with a now 18-month-old who has already gone through 3 different diaper pails!  :]
