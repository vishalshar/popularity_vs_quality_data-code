My son is gigantic for his age, and also has less than zero interest in potty training. He's grown out of half of his AIO diapers with no sign of interest in the potty. (Ye gods.) Rather than switching to disposable pullups or something, I decided to supplement my diaper stash with these, mostly for nighttime use.Pros:- They're the largest of all my cloth diapers, so they actually retain all the urine his growing bladder can produce. Note that this also means that they're huge under his clothes. We're used to having to dress him a size up, though, so it's not a big deal.- No leaks yet.Cons:- They hold smells really terribly. Even after being prepped and washed thoroughly, they gathered that ammonia stink way faster than any of my other diapers. I think it might be the kind of plasticky covering? It might help to dry them in the sun, but it's winter here. I haven't been able to try it.- They smell as soon as he pees. I guess that's kind of helpful for knowing that he needs to be changed, but yuck.- Even though they fit, the fit is...odd. They're bulky in weird places.- The aforementioned plasticky material isn't soft and it seems to be a little uncomfortable for my son. It only appears to bother him at night.Anyway, these should tide me over until the little dude realizes that toilets aren't his mortal enemy, but I wouldn't buy these as a part of my "main" stash.
