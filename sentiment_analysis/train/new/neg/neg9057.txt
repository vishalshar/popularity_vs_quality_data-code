I purchased this product but after about a week of use I realized it just wasn't for me. It seemed like a waste of money when I could just walk the diapers out to the trash and save the hassel of the diaper genie. I ended up selling it to a neighbor for half the price that I paid but at least I didn't waste tons more purchasing all of those refills.  :)
