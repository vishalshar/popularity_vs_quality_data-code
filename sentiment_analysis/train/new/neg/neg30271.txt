I wanted some Medela branded tubing replacement, and I didn't read carefully enough, but this product is very misleading because the breastshield connectors are Medela, but the tubing is masked as "TC" which I thought was a type of tubing, but it stands for "True Care", which is a knock-off brand.  Item works, but I would not have paid extra for some 3rd party tubes!  Quite disappointed.  Buyer beware!"2 pump-in-style tubing. By True Care"
