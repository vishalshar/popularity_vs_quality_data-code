I purchased this teether after my 9-month old decided that the squishy dropper part of the infant Tylenol bottle was his favorite thing to chew on.  I searched high and low for something similar he might like since he wasn't a fan of the ever-popular Sophie the Giraffe teether.  I came across this teether and thought it might be similar and work for him.  Unfortunately, he isn't a fan of it.  I wish they made a teether that was a tested, safe version of the Tylenol bottle since it seems that a lot of babies like to chew on that (but I won't let him since I'm paranoid...)
