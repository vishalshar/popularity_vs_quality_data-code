We got this swing for our little guy and while it has a bunch of great features, it leaves something to be desired too.First the positives:-The swing speeds are great and definitely fast enough to keep our little guy zoned out.-The mirror on top is his favorite thing! He can see himself and it keeps him entertained much better than any mobile could since he is making faces and interacting with "the other baby".- The sounds are good and especially the music helps him fall asleep very well- Running the swing on slow with the mobile on keeps him entertained for a good while, allowing me to prep food or do a chore or two before he needs my attention again.- This swing is the only place I can put my baby in awake that will make him fall asleep for me which is great!However:- The machine makes a loud grinding sound when it gets started, whether or not I start the swinging to help it out.Once it goes, the small noise it makes when swinging is fine but I've woken up my sleeping baby more than once trying to put him into the swing asleep and getting it started.- The music turns off after 15 minutes and there is no way to change that. It's great that the swing keeps going indefinitely but it would be helpful if the music had a way to change the time since my baby often wakes up once the soundtrack stops.- When swinging side to side, the legs can move, causing the whole thing to start rocking.- When swinging side to side, the arm on my swing goes more to one side, causing the arm to smack into the right side leg so I cannot run the swing on full speed in that direction.I've recently found that running a white noise machine next to the swing helps drown out the grinding sound when it starts and keeps my baby asleep when the music cuts out too so that helps immensely.Bottom line: I will keep using this swing since I have it but would probably look for a different one if I had to make the purchase over again.
