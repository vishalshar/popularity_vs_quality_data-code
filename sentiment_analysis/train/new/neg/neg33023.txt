We bought this due to the fact that my wife liked the color and wanted something that would work for both boys or girls.  We were also looking for a Fit30...We registered for it as a baby gift and got it.  It looked nice and worked well for our new little guy...  However, he started growing very fast and at 6 months now, he weights 19 lbs.  And he hardly fits in the car seat.I ended up looking at the back of the car seat and it says Fit30, and the carseat cover says Fit30...  But it doesn't even fit a baby at 20 lbs.  I then had my brother dig out his old Fit30, and it was much larger.  My son fit in it with no problem.  I then went to B r Us and looked at the normal cheap Fit22, and my car seat was the same size....Not happy that at 6 months old, I have to buy a new carseat due to this issue.
