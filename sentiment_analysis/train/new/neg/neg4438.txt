Trying again to leave a review for this item.  First, it is significantly over-priced for quality.  Second, mine arrived damaged (the box/ packaging was fine yet the backend of the lion was rather seriously broken/ crushed which leads me to suspect it had been shipped already damaged by the 3rd party seller).  After the whole process with this purchase (tried to charge me multiple times on the same item) I shouldn't have been shocked to receive a damaged product.  The item I received doesn't really LOOK like the image shown either...it looks white on my screen but the item I received is ivory/ beige.  I will not be re-ordering this which is sad because online it seems so cute and matches my baby's other playthings.  I would never recommend such a poorly constructed high dollar item to anyone else...damage aside, it is not at all well-made for the level of damage seen BEFORE it has even been played with/ used.  Quite disappointing, to say the least.  NOT what I wanted to receive on Christmas Eve.  Shame.
