Very disappointed in this pacifier. The glitter is so subtle, I had to look very closely to see it. In person, it looks more like dust than glitter. Also, the print is somewhat faded looking, like it was done with an inkjet printer. I would expect it to wash off very quickly. $7.42 is a lot to pay for a single pacifier, and I at least expected it to look like the picture. I am much more satisfied with the basic 2-pack pacifiers I've purchased for $3-$4.
