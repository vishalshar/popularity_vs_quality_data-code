I am so disappointed that this is too small for me. I also feel like the pumping portion is too much on the side and not in front. The worst part is that I washed it and wore it for the day so I can't even return it. Why don't they make these bigger? Do they think only skinny people need to pump and nurse? I would think they work better if they are a better fit (I measured to fit in it) I would definitely get a size larger then suggested unless your breasts are small.
