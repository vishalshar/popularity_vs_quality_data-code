The Evenflo Triumph fit well in my car when it was rearfacing, and it seems well built.However, I have a big problem with the side-mount tension knobs that are supposed to tighten the harness around the child for proper fit.  It works & is fine if you only use it once in a while.  It's even a nice idea to have the knobs on the side particularly when the seat is rear-facing.  My main problem with it is that it tightens the harness from the hip straps (not the shoulder straps).  When it tightens from the hip straps, I then have to adjust the straps through the buckle all the way to the shoulders (because of the complicated two shoulder straps).  I have a Costco Omega seat that has a harness adjustment lever in the center bottom & it's so easy to release the harness when unbuckling & then tighten it when buckling (it tightens from the shoulders with only one strap, which is both logical and easy).  I love the harness adjustment lever feature.  I use it everyday & so it improves usability of the carseat to me EVERYDAY.  Using the harness adjustment lever is so much better than trying to force the child's arms through the tight straps all the time.I have had my Costco seat for 4 years now & prefer it to the Evenflo seat (I've had for 2 yrs) because of the harness adjustment lever system.
