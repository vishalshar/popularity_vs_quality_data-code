My baby had issues keeping his binkie in his mouth, but would only take the soothie.  The soothie clips are too big and bulky to wear to bed (we tried), so we tried this.  He loves it - it's like his lovey now.  He rubs it on his face as he goes to sleep, then pops the binkie in after his bottle is done.This is still too bulky.  When he rolls in his sleep, it gets stuck under him and the binkie pops out.  But, I think it's at least somewhat easier to find when he's sleeping, so I'm getting up less to give him his binkie back.I suggest buying at least two for cleaning purposes.  Trade off from the start so both get his/her smell on them and wear the same.  They may not notice now, but if it becomes a lovey like ours - they will eventually.
