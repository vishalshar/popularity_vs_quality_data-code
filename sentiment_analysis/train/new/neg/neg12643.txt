I owned a Diaper Champ several years ago - it was wonderful!  Here I am years later in need of diaper pail, again so I go with what I know.  Well, what I didn't know was that the product has been redesigned.  It simply doesn't work - a cheap and ineffective design.  The smell coming from the Diaper Champ is atrocious.  I've even gone to individually bagging the poopy diapers before I put them in the Diaper Champ - it still stinks.  It's a total waste of money!
