I ordered these & have nothing bad to say about the pacifiers but I ordered the combo pack of 3 the caterpillar, ella the elephant & the giraffe. Only 2 of the pacifiers came in & I'm still missing the giraffe! This is quit disappointing bc I always buy from Amazon & nothing like this has ever happened! Buy @ ur own risk!
