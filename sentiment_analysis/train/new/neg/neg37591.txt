I usually don't write review but I am going to write 2 flaws this stroller has that I wish someone wrote in their review.This stroller is really good overall but just 2 things...Cup holder: It sits right underneath the handle and it won't move so you can't even put a normal size water bottle there. Maybe the tiny one will fit. Forget about putting your coffee or smoothie in there and take a stroll...storage net under the seat: Since the support bar runs right on the top of the storage net, you can't put anything in there. I just put my sweater in there since no bag will fit.Other than that, this stroller is very stable since the wheels are pretty big and recliner adjusts easily. I would give 5 stars for the stable structure of this stroller but 1 star for the cup holder and storage net.
