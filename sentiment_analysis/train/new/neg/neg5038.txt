I bought this pillow because I wanted an organic replacement for my old pillow. This pillow came wrapped in plastic! What is the point of buying an organic pillow that comes in a material that leaches toxic chemicals into the item that is supposed to be organic? It had also clearly been opened and taped back shut with packing tape as though it had been returned by another person.  Maybe it wasn't but it gives me the heebie jeebies thinking that someone else used the pillow. I have tried to return the pillow as instructed and no delivery service has come to pick it up. The pillow itself seems okay and as advertised as long as it's not always wrapped in plastic.
