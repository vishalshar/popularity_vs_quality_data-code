First the positives. As mentioned by another reviewer, this seat has high safety ratings, meeting both U.S. and European standards.  It is nicely padded -- my son sleeps in it for hours with no complaints.  It has a small footprint so it fits nicely into smaller cars.  (This may explain why some users found their kids outgrew it quickly).  It snaps right into the base easily and is a bit lighter than others that I have tried.  On a more superficial note, this is a good looking carseat --  the fabrics come in very cheery color combinations and its styling is more sophisticated than most other carseat offerings.  I personally appreciated the lack of funky prints and baby-ish patterns.On the down side, this seat doesn't fit with several of the universal frames such as the Snap and Go.  The only universal frame that I have been able to find to accommodate it is the Maclaren Easy Traveller which is a bit harder to find and a bit more expensive than its competitors. It also doesn't work with many of the adapters that are available with various strollers.  So if you don't plan on buying a Quinny stroller, your options for a compatible frame or stroller will be limited.Another drawback is that this seat lacks a notch that allows it to fit snugly on the seat area of a shopping cart.  Most other seats marketed in the U.S. seem to have this.  While you can still sit it on the top of the shopping cart, that notch would  make it much more secure.  I never even knew about this until after I starting bringing my little one to the supermarket and realized this deficiency.Finally, I agree that the sunshade could provide more coverage, but I'm not sure how it compares to other car seats in this regard.Overall, I'm still happy with the purchase, but if you want to use it as part of a travel system and not just as a car seat, be sure to check for compatibility. If you aren't buying a Quinny stroller, you may run into problems.
