HORRIBLE!I ordered this piece (2 of them as a matter of fact) only and only because of how beautiful the bright butterflies looked on the pictures.BUT...  When I received and opened the package  I was so disappointed of the way they both looked with dead, depressing colors.  What happened?  How can they look so differrent?I've attached the pictures of them.  Even though I took the pictures under a lot of light, there's still no life on these two sculptures...  They killed my beautiful butterflies!!!So I'm donating them beacuse the shape is OK, I just don't like the colors...
