I was thoroughly disappointed by this car seat.  The features all sound great and convenient but it is the most uncomfortable seat i have tried.  in addition to it being soo heavy.  I purchased this as soon as it came out several years ago and should not have invested so much money into something this heavy and uncomfortable.  The bright material is nice but not when you use it day in and out with a baby or toddler.  It gets dirty fast and stains easily, a hassle to take off and put on for frequent washing.  The canopy is of a flimsy design and i did get the rain spots which is totally uncalled for for a high end product such as this.  The head rest/adjustable shoulder belts are a difficult fit for comfort.  Can never get it right as the head piece moves up and down with the belts.  The little pockets to hold the snap ... never worked.  just cant get them in there to stay put.  Also, it is very difficult to put into a shopping cart.  it does not click in as other carseats do so you either have the risk of it being loose but the baby will be in a reclined position and you can see over the top if your a small person, or you have to really tilt it up to where the baby is nearly upright and you cant see over the top of the carseat while shopping. Also the material is not breathable,  all my babies sweat like crazy in it.  and the little insert for newborn premie is useless and uncomfortable.On a positive note, the base is nice, easy to install.  I also like that i can easily put this on the stroller frame, very convenient.  If there are any out there for sale.. do not buy.  save your money.  go with a cheaper more practical brand.
