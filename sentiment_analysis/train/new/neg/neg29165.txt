The product that arrived was one small box 37x37x20 that did not fit the advertised products in the picture. The cost of the product I paid was $79.99 + $18.00 shipping and handling fee. NativeThai gave a refund of $37.99. I paid $60 on a product that seems to be only worth $20. Overall, I think NativeThai gives false advertisement and should not be selling their product under the labeled "Large Toy Box and 4-Cubby Organizer Set". It should be labeled "Small fabric box". And there should be true representation of the photo submitted by NativeThai, not a false advertised picture of another product you will not be receiving.
