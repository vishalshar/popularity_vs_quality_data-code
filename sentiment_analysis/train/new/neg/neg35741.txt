I cannot believe this is marketed as a baby gate when it doesn't meet the common standards of a baby crib side!  I am very upset that I now have to purchase a piece of deck netting or plastic rail covering to still use this gate! Shame on you, Dreambaby, for even putting this extension on the market!
