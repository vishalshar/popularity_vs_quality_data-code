You know a few years ago nuk had bottles that were not foggy. These bottles that showed up were foggy. Their new bottles that were not discontinued are all so foggy I do not trust these products because of the fogginess. I would honestly wonder why the old ones did not have the fogginess and the new ones all do. I would not recommend this product. These products also do not work well in Bottle warmers. They do tend to very easily warp.
