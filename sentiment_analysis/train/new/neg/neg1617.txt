I bought this teether as a "car" toy in order to occupy my daughter.  This product line is a bit pricey--it's very good quality, but I don't really want her using this as a teether!  I was initially attracted to the looks of this and that it is made in Europe (good quality) but I would pass this one over in the specialty baby store!
