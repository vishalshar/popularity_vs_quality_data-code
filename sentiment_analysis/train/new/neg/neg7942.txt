I will deduct two stars for the following: 1. canopy would not stay up and slide back often. 2. handle latches were not operating smoothly and would often required multiple pushes to get the handle to fold down. I liked the extra head support as compared to other seats but then that is expected for the premium price over a Graco seat. did NOT latch smoothly into the matching Combi stoller either.
