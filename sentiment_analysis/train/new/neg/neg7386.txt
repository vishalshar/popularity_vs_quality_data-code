My daughter loved the NUK nipples so I was very happy to find these for her to graduate to a sippycup style without going too dramatic. She switched with no problems and seems to like them. The problem is they are very soft and flimsy at the opening. She bites down on them and the opening rips very easily then all the milk comes out super fast so it's kind of hard for her to drink while lying down. I was disappointed in the quality since I am a big fan of Nuk in general. She is still using them but they are almost all ripped.
