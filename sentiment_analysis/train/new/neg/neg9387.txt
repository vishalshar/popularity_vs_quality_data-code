ended up giving it away. the cupholders were too small to hold any normal size cup. if it did hold a drink, it was not easy and not at all convenient to get the drink back into the holder... bc you have to pull the elastic band...so you need 2 hands just to put your drink away. not super practical when you're trying to push a stroller and you have to stop just to put your drink away. I ended up buying the Universal stroller organizer by ethan and emma. it has normal size cup holders and I love that you can fold away the mesh bag when you don't need to carry too much stuff around.this one was kind of a dud.
