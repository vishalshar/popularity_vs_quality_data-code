Nice walker. After getting this, I'm not a fan of the bar in front, I worry about my baby coming forward and hitting the bar with his head or mouth. I usually take it off and put other toys on the walker. I wish the giraffes would move too, as those are what my baby is most interested in. They only turn, but it would have been cool if they moved more. Also - they do start to fall off easily as mentioned in other reviews. I like that it folds for storage though.
