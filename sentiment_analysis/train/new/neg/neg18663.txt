This is a big bag, but volume wise, it's small. This was to replace a bag that I had that broke (Soho bag). The old bag I had was technically smaller or maybe just a bit under this one, but it was able to hold more stuff. Yes, this has the bottom plastic nubs to prevent the bag from touching the floor, and yes it has an insulated pocket and pocket for your keys....but if you want to use this for an all day affair, forget it. I typically carry the following: 1-2 extra outfits, 6-7 diapers, wipes, hand sanitizing wipes, snacks, water bottle, a toy or two, jacket, and a few other random items. I would not be able to hold all that in this. The bag that ending up working was actually still by Fisher Price but it was a much bigger bag. Got it at ToysRUs: Deluxe wide opening diaper bag.
