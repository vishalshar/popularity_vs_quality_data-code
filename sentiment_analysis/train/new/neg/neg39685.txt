If you are looking for a very convenient travel potty seat that is easy to throw in the diaper bag  and can be quickly wiped clean when you are out and about then this is a great choice. However, if you are looking for something for your home or a place where your child spends a lot of time, I would keep looking. This she provides no padding or contour to make a child more comfortable, and the opening in the front can be a little confusing for boys who are just starting to use the potty.While the Sesame Street characters are appealing and my son loves to carry it around when we go out, this is definitely not the sheet while the Sesame Street characters are appealing and my son loves to carry it around when we go out, this is definitely not the seat you want for early training  you want for early training.  it is better suited to quick trips out for those who are either well into potty training, or fully potty trained but not yet big enough to use the full-size seat.  The design of the seat is not condusive to the long period of time that mist children need to stay on the potty when they are first learning to "go". On the positive side, compared to other seats designed to fold up into diaper bags for on the go use, I have found that this one snaps into place with much less of a space between "sections", is incredibly sturdy despite how thin it looks, and isn't prone to the type of skin pinching that accompany most travel seats.Although I would rank this amongst the best of the collapsible potty seats, if you have room in your bag I would just as soon carry around a more padded non-collapsable seat.  Because of its more limited usage, I am giving it only three stars.
