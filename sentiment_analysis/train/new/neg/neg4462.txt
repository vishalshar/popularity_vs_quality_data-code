I bought this car seat February 2015. It looks very nice for the price. I had the car seat installed professionally. The professional couldn't even get the seat installed securely. She admitted that she loathes these seats and wishes people would just spend the money for a better/safer one. Not even a year later, the bars on my sons car seat that control how high up the straps go broke, damaging the structural integrity of the seat itself. Safety 1st my butt! Save yourself the hassle and purchase a graco!
