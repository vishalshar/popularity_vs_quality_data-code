I ordered this bracelet in hopes of relieving my son's teething pain. I also ordered a second one for the lady's daughter who watches my son. It didn't work for either one of them. They are cute but didn't help with teething pain. Also the beads aren't knotted in between so if it broke the beads would go everywhere. I wish I had known that before purchasing as well.
