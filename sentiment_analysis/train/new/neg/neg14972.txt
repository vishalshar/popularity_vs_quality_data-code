In terms of comfort, I like this pillow fairly well. I've had it about a month though, and I have already had to stitch up a hole in the seam, and stuffing definitely wants to shift. I can live with the stuffing shifting part. I was mostly disappointed that the description said it came with a 'slipcover' but it really doesn't. There is nothing like a pillowcase that you can remove to wash.
