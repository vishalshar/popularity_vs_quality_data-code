This thing is awful.  The paper backing on the inside of thing the second I unwrapped the first on, the paper backing started crumbling to pieces.  It was like confetti going all over the inside of my car.  It was extremely brittle and just touching it, the paper disintegrated.  But I was out, it was hot outside and I knew my 3 year old would have a hot car seat when I came out of the store.  I decided against my better judgement to use it anyway for her comfort and that was a horrible decision.  When I removed the seat cover after 30 minutes, my child's car seat looked like it had been covered in white ashes.Do not buy this product. Look elsewhere for something with better materials on the inside lining.  All of the 5 star positive reviews, they must have had better luck getting a batch that wasn't crumbling to pieces when they opened it.
