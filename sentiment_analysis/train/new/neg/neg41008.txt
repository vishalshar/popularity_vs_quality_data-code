This is a very cute puzzle, but not very durable. After only a couple weeks of minimal play, it started to fall apart, and not a good way. The wood chips off in small strips, and can be easily swallowed. It would also be easy to cut your hands on the pieces once this starts to happen. I don't have a kid that's hard on toys or anything like that, this is just not a well made product. If you want durable, buy a different puzzle. We've had good luck with Melissa and Doug puzzles.
