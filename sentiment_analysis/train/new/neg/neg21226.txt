I settled on this stool for my son's potty training, and while the construction is great, and it seems very sturdy, it does not meet the needs I had.I knew there could be an issue with tipping, but so far that has not been too much of an issue. The real problem is that the "non-skid" on the feet isn't non-skid enough. When he climbs up on the toilet and sits down (which he is still doing fairly gingerly, mind you), the stool will push forward out from under him. Additionally, it is a little too short for his legs to rest on (we have a standard size toilet) which is completely my fault for not double-checking measurements, so heads up on that one.All in all it's a decent stool, the lock mechanism does work as it says, and its light enough to be transfered around. just be aware that unless you have a bath rug under it or something, it could very easily slip and cause an injury/spooked potty trainer.
