I've been using this changing pad cover for 2 years now and at first it was my favorite. Now it is my least favorite. At the beginning it was plush and soft, and fit perfectly. After 2 years the elastic has completely given up and the fabric feels quite thin and cheap. I have some by Aden and anais and pottery barn changing pad covers and both of those have held up perfectly. Other brands are worth paying more over this one, especially if you plan to use for more than one child. This item will go to the trash.
