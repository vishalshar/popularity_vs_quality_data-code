They are ok overall. One thing to point out is that they are very light and easy to move around. I wish they had more weight on it (they would be more steady that way). Also, on one of the bibs, the Velcro was barely attached. I had to stitch it up. Otherwise, they are very durable and used a lot by me. Very easy to wash too.
