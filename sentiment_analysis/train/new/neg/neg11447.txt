I love how soft this is for my baby and I love how easy this little t-shirt is to put on. The one thing I don't like and maybe this is just baby t-shirts in general is how the shirt rides up constantly unless my little one is asleep and doesn't move. When you pick your baby up the front flap opens up and the t-shirt just bunches up all over the place. It turned a cute and easy to put on t-shirt into an annoyance. My husband hates it so we never put it on our baby anymore. I wish there was at least a snap at the bottom to keep the shirt from flying open but that wouldn't solve the bunching up problem. I'm sticking with onesies instead.
