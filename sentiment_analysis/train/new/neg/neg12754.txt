Such a disappointment. Ours arrived without a squeaker in it but Amazon quickly resolved that problem so I am happy about that. However, even if it had arrived with the squeaker feature working, this toy would have been a huge disappointment. It's just a blah toy that does nothing to engage the child. My daughter wasn't interested at all when I showed it to her. This was a surprise because she loves her other toys from Skip Hop.
