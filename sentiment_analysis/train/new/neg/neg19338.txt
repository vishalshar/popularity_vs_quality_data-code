This pic shows a green,blue, and cream on the review page. The product order page showed the orange,green, and cream colors that I wanted. The product I got was blue, white and yellow.  So if you order, just know they will be Gerber washclothes but don't necessarily think you will get the colors you are seeing on the screen.
