I think whether or not these kinds of things work depends on each kid. And because each baby is unique, you just never know.. So you can't really make your decision based on these reviews. I would suggest to reviewers to share a little more about their child and what aspects about your child that make it likely that s/he will enjoy this product or not.I tried this around 5 months for my baby because he wasn't accepting solids. I tried everything I could think of. I figured maybe he wanted more control, and even though he still didn't take the food when he was holding the spoon himself, I decided to go ahead and purchase this and try it out. At first, he was intrigued by this new thing and so put it in his mouth. But when he realized there was food in there, he spit it out in disgust and never accepted the feeder since.He only took solids from my finger. And then suddenly after that (I don't know what happened), he began to feed from a spoon. I think my baby just wanted a little more time before starting solids. I wish I was more patient and trust that my baby will come around rather than spend money on these different products.
