I want to love this. I have bought two now the kitty and this tiger and the idea is really great but those smoothie pacifiers will not stay in my babies mouth. The little animal keeps the pack close to her mouth so if she were a little older she could get it right back in (she is 2 months old right now). But by the time she can do that I will be using the orthodontic binkies so her teeth don't get messed up. I wish the animal were a little heavier and that the binkies were removable so it would be easier to wash them and so that I can put a different kind of bunny on there when she is older.
