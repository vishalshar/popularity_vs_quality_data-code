It functions like it should but there are parts issues.I give 5 stars to the seller. The first order the a piece of the base was broken. I quickly received the return shipping label and received the replacement unit.Upon assembly - discovered that the second unit also had issues. This time it was with the piece that dangles the toys above the seat. The piece would not stay connected to the seat. Fearful that the third unit would also have defects - decided not to send this one back.Be prepared for issues upon receipt with this unit...
