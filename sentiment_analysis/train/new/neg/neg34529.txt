Really cute and love the bright colors, but it requires too much upkeep.I like that it can carry 4 bottles worth of formula, good for longer trips. What I don't like is when you unscrew it to get to the next level you have to attach the used portion to the bottom, therefore the bottom is now in contact with your bag or whatever surface you put it on, which means you pretty much have to wash after EVERY use. And with all the different parts it can be cumbersome.So for now I'll just stick to the formula dispensers you get from the store, they are smaller and only have 2 pieces (vs 6 pieces) and can be used more times without a wash.My baby doesnt eat snacks yet, so i decided to give it another try for snacks, so I will wait awhile ad when shes older, see how it is to carry dry snacks and maybe even homemade purees, I will update then :)
