This crib bedding set has a beautiful safari animal prints, which were the primary reason that I decided to purchase it for our future son as it matches our nursery's theme. However, the fabric is polyester blended with cotton. So I bought a seperate 100% cotton sheet for the crib to replace the sheet comes with the bedding set. It also took quite sometime for the product to arrive.
