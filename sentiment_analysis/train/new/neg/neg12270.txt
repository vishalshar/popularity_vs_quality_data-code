UPDATE:  This product only lasts a few years.  You would not believe the nightmare I'm dealing with.  The entire plastic back of the encasement disintegrated.  I took it off my bed and it looks like someone threw a box of mashed potato flakes all over my bedroom. There is plastic dust everywhere.  I've been sneezing for hours and my lungs hurt.  I have vacuumed my mattress countless times and the plastic flakes are relentless.  Here's a photo of my hand vac after my third attempt to clean up my mattress.  There is a plastic coating on everything around my bed.  Not happy.The bottom line is you are looking for a product that easily wraps around your mattress and box spring and keeps the bed bugs in or out.  This works.  With two people, it's easy to get on and it comes with a convenient little plastic tie to secure the zipper.  We've had ours for about a month now, and used together with those plastic traps we put under the legs of our bed, I feel that this was a successful measure to keep the bed bugs away from us while we're sleeping.  Of course they are not as thick or luxurious as the mattress covers you might have purchased with your mattress, but I honestly cannot tell the difference when I lay down.  And that's coming from a fairly sensitive sleeper.  I definitely recommend this product.  Also, it fit around my mattress and memory foam topper, but you definitely need to measure your mattress first so you can buy the appropriate size.  Once you open the package, they will not take returns.
