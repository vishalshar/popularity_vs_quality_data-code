Ordered the Gray Door Extension from VMInnovations on 10/3 to go with our North States Superyard for our 7-month-old twins.  On 10/16 when I opened the package I found that the item had arrived damaged, with several sharp plastic shards broken off the frame.  I called customer service to request a replacement, and to see if they were really going to stick to their stated return policy that indicates that the customer pays return shipping in all cases.The phone rep was pleasant, told me that in my case they probably wouldn't make me pay for the return, and in fact may not require me to return it at all since it wasn't repairable  -- both door and frame are made from molded plastic and both were damaged.  He asked me to e-mail him photos to verify the damage.  I sent pictures of the damaged door and frame and of one of the sharp little choking hazards that had broken off from the frame.I received an e-mail saying they were referring the case to the manufacturer and would get back to me when they heard back.After waiting five days, on 10/21 I wrote back to VMInnovations pointing out that I bought the item from them, not from the manufacturer, and that I expected VMInnovations to take responsibility and send a replacement.  I received a response apologizing for the delay, assuring me they are "in contact with the manufacturer still trying to get this taken care of for [me]"and offering me a $10 store credit.  They ignored my demand that they take care of this, and told me that if I had other questions or concerns they'd be "happy to help."On 10/28, after another week with no word from VMInnovations or the manufacturer, I wrote to let VMInnovations know I was going to post this review, and offering them a chance to comment.  I asked if they had any insight into why it's taking so long to hear from the manufacturer (assuming they still haven't) and if they could explain why they are passing the buck to the manufacturer instead of handling the return/exchange themselves, etc.  So far no response, although to be fair I sent the e-mail rather late in the day.To sum up, I ordered this door extension a month ago and have been trying to get a replacement for the damaged one they sent for almost two-weeks, but can't seem to make any progress with the seller, and I've lost my patience for their nonsense.I'll post an update as I get new information.In the meantime, buyer beware of the product and of VMInnovations.
