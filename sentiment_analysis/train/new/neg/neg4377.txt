I know washmitts for baby are supposed to be soft, but really?  This one seems too fuzzy...I gave it a trial run, and the soap seems absorbed (good) but it takes forever to come out and rinse clean (bad).  I think I'll save it for when baby's a toddler and can wring it out or twist it or something...
