Do not buy this product. It didn't work out of the box. I called MOBI and the person who answered the phone actually knew what I was calling about when I told him about the problem. So it seems this is very common with this product. You put it on the base and the light is green like it's charged up right away. When you push the button, the light doesn't work at all. He said he can send me a new one, but the shipment from China wasn't coming in for another week. I am going to just return it and get my money back.
