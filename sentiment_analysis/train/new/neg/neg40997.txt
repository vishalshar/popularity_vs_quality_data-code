I wouldn't recommend it. The instruction onlytell you how to change the full plastic bag.It came today, double-wrapped in plastic package sheet. It took ten minutes to get the plastic wrapping off which was taped to cardboard display box. once the pail was taken out of the box some more plastic wrap had to be removed. Then the plastic bag for the poop fell out as did the inner lid and ring. The container is of flimsy plastic and, because of that, it is hard to get the lids and door to latch. The main lid does not open all the way which makes it difficult to dump the soiled diaper into the container. I called the maker and the sent me a video, which, although intended showed how to install the inner lid and the frame holding the plastic tube/bag of flimsy plastic bag material..
