I bought the angel guard because my daughter is a special needs child. She is constantly unlatching the seat buckle. I have used them on two trips. I had trouble unlatching the guard but believe me, she didn't. She was out of her seat belt in no time. My little Houdini is too smart for her britches! I guess I'm gonna have to go redneck and use duct tape.
