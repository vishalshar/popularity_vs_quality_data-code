Ok - this is my first review.  I have bought, and bought and bought on Amazon but have never been so inspired to review until this purchase.  First, let me say that I love the look of these bibs.  Second, they are really absorbant (I have a 3 and 1/2 month old and she drools and sometimes spits up and they hold up well).  Now the negatives..... When I received them I washed them, like anyone would do prior to their child wearing them, right?  Well, the red dye on three out of the four bibs bled.  Now, they did not change the color of the bib - just bled on the bib itself.  And yes, they were washed in cold water with light colors.  Another negative is that the bibs attach with velcro in the the back.  The velcro is not the negative - it's the quality of the velcro and the placement of the velcro.  Unlike most bibs the velcro is not placed on the tips of the bib but rather an inch or so in.  This makes for a snug fit on your baby.  Second, the velcro is a very small square instead of a broad strip like many bibs.  If you do not velcro the correct spot you can also damage the bib as it will pull the cotton like fabric of the bib causing it to fray.  So, long reveiw made a little short..... cute fabric, nice length, very absorbant....poor design, poor fabric dye, poor placement of velcro and quality of the velcro.  All in all not worth the money.
