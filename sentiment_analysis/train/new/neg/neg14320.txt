The reason I purchased this mobile was so I could have the complete All Stars set, and when I bought it I was under the impression that it was put together all ready. So you can imagine my surprise when I found out that it came in tiny cheap plastic pieces that first had to be pried off of the piece of cardboard it came on!!! It took me about an hour to assemble the thing and my fingers are still hurting from trying to put it together!!! And when I finally finished, I brought it to my baby's room--all proud of myself I must say, because I finally succeeded in putting it together--only to find out that the stupid thing didn't even fit on the back of the crib where it belongs!! And of course it doesn't adjust to fit every crib because it's cheap plastic!!! So now I'm debating if I'm going to return it, or just keep it on the front of the crib where it doesn't really belong just because I worked so hard putting the thing together!!! Save yourself the headache and don't buy this!!! Buy something else in the All Star collection--everything else was great!!!
