I should not have spent the money for this product.  It was overpriced.  My husband likes the gum, but it is impossible to find.  He is now trying other brands.  I feel like I have encouraged sellers to overprice items and it will never happen again, even if I can't find an item(s).  All-in-all, the service was great, exactly what I ordered and arrived in a timely manner and shipping was free.  I like spoiling my husband lol but he will get a different brand.  Thank you.
