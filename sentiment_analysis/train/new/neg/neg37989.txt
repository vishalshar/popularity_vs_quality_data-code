Bought this to keep our 12 month old from pushing the stereo buttons.First off it comes with velcro for mounting. Yeah that will work to keep it from being pulled off.I drilled some holes in the bottom and screwed it to the bottom edge of our entertainment center. It wont budge now.The only problem now is our surroundsound receiver is already too deep for the shelf so when the little one plays with the guard it still manages to push against some buttons.She quit playing with the buttons after this hindered her fun with hearing them click as they are pressed so all it good I guess.
