This little timer is adorable, and the idea behind it is a great one. However, it doesn't work. Right out of the box it worked once, and then after that it would only run for about 3 seconds before it would quit. A couple of other things I noticed about the design of the product itself: there is no clear explanation (especially for a small child) about which direction to turn it such as arrows perhaps. It might be logical for an adult to turn it clockwise, but not necessarily for a little one. There was also no "stop" at the #2. You could turn it to 2, but you could keep turning it and turning it and turning it. All in all, a wonderful idea, but if it doesn't work what's the point?
