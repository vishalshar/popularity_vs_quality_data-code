I bought this product to use on a Fireplace.  It didn't work very well for me.  I ended up buying a similar product, also sold on Amazon, Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard, and using that instead.  The Prince Lionheart product is thicker, and larger, and lays in place better.  This is important on a brick fireplace, because the adhesive strips just don't stick well to brick.  This Premium Furniture Edge product tends to sag, and roll off the edge of the Fireplace.  But the Prince Lionheart product lays flatter, and stays in place even if the adhesive strips don't really stick.  See the photos I provided for an up close product comparison.  It may work fine on other surfaces, where the adhesive strips can really grab hold.  But it was not effective at all on my brick.I do have to give Premium furniture credit for great customer service.  They sent me an email asking for feedback on my purchase, and I responded with the same information that is in my review.  The refunded the amount of my purchase.
