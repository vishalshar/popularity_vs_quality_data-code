It is a dark day for thermometers, to me.It is a dark age of thermometers, to the consumer.I thought this was the golden ticket, when I purchased it; however, the thermometer died over three months.The readings were always slow, which I figured was because of its "medical, accuracy".It seemed simple enough, which is usually a good thing, in terms of durability.However the screen has gone completely dark.The beep works, but when I opened it up, the battery was completely corroded and turning every other area around it brown.Maybe i'll have to go old-fashioned.It certainly makes me think about how much our modern technology has made some of the simplest applications have such a short lifespan.What once used to be flawless.
