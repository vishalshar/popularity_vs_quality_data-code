It looks as adorable in person as oin the picture, however, I did not realize this is not an actual screen print shirt and I have not been happy with the other kind's inability to hold up wash after wash, though I haven't given this one the true test yet, but am gauging this on other shirts of this type. However, it should give my grandson at least a few wearings before it start peeling.
