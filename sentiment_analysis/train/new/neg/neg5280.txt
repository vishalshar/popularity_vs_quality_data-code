I really want to like this product because o it's portability, I can take it everywhere and put it anywhere, but it seems that it moves very slow! I don't know if is just my product or the mobile is supposed to be slow. Otherwise I would love it. The music is just perfect, is not like those annoying tunes from other toys, not too loud, not too soft. Also I like the fact that the little toys are looking to the baby.It doesn't have lights so if is dark he can look at it..It comes with a clipper that makes it a little longer, but in my baby trend car seat that is too long and the little toys hit my baby's face, so I just put it without the clipper, and make it perfect.Also is good to know that it only attaches to a sturdy side, if the side is only fabric or if it have a very thin material it will fall. I used it on my graco pack an play, on my tiny love rocker, I tried to used in my fisher price rocker but it keeps falling. Also I hung it on the car seat and on a portable fisher price swing.My two month old baby like it at first, but then he got bored because is too slow compared to his other mobile.
