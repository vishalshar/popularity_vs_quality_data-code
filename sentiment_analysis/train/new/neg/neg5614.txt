I started having trouble sleeping comfortably on my side early in my twin pregnancy. By about 16 weeks, my expanding tummy was already making sleep elusive. Based on other reviews, I picked up the Boppy Prenatal Sleep Wedge. I've used it almost every night until now (34 weeks) and find it to be helpful, but not a miracle cure.Pros:--Inexpensive. Many other maternity pillows cost several times more, but this is inexpensive enough to try as an experiment. If you don't like it, you're not out much.--Easily rearranged in bed. When I flip from side to side half-asleep, it's easy to grab the wedge and move it, too.--Not too big. Our king-size is getting crowded with my huge belly, so having a small pillow is certainly an advantage for leaving my husband some room to sleep.--Works also as a bit of lumbar support when I'm sitting up reading in bed.Cons:--It's a little hard, so it doesn't always conform quite right to my belly when side-sleeping. This is especially true now with two large babies who love to kick & rearrange their bodies at night. There are some positions that our twins get into where the Boppy Wedge actually makes things feel worse by adding unnecessary pressure.--Hard to fit a pillow case to it (unless you want to sew something yourself), but at least the outer case is removable/washable.--Sometimes, the height of the wedge is just a bit too much, causing me to want to roll onto my back.Overall, if you're having a hard time sleeping, the Boppy Wedge is worth trying. It isn't perfect, but I still use it every night. And, I can imagine it may come in handy even after our twins are born.
