THis stroller is ok for the price. I formly was using a Graco Quattro tour model which was great...had gotten beat up over the years mostly due to travel. Bought this cheaper version based on reviews. I like the way it handles, very easy to manuever. The thing I dislike the most is the way it folds down. I can NOT do this one handed like the other reviews say. Very cumbersome to fold and get into vehicle compared to my old one.I also dislike the way the seat reclines, on a pull string type system. NOt as easy as previous stroller. Cup holders are nice and the infant tray is usable. Also wish the canopy did actually flip to front as well. You can do it if you don't secure it per the directions to the frame (velcro I think). These are just the things I was looking for in a stroller like the Quattro tour model had, but didn't want to spend the extra money on another one. Guess I should have. But this one will work for now.
