I love this hearth gate as we have a furnace that's awkwardly placed in the middle of our living room and we have a one-year old.  That being said, we had a terrible time getting five, whole, unbroken pieces.  We ordered it in January and when it came, the parts were all loose, because the zip-ties had broken, and one of the round, plastic connector pieces was broken.  We returned it to Amazon and purchased it again in February, from a different seller. This time, the gate arrived with the same round, plastic connector piece broken off from not only a panel piece, but the gate panel was broken as well.This time, we tried calling KidCo directly and while the customer service people were very nice, they weren't very fast.  They sent us the three-panel model in hopes that we would get at least five unbroken pieces.  When I told him about the broken pieces, the customer service person said that the cold makes the plastic brittle and that the UPS carrier throws the boxes around too roughly.  Well, gee, invest in some styrofoam or package engineering, because the problem is clearly on KidCo's end.Anyway - two months after my original purchase and three shipments later, I finally got a whole, unbroken set of five panels.  It was easy to put together and mount to the wall.  It is sturdy, works great and keeps our furnace safely out of baby's reach.We love it, so we gave it five stars.  I should probably take away two for their terrible packaging, though. If you do order this, you better have KidCo's phone number on hand - 800-553-5529.
