this could have been a good product if it wasn't so flimsily made. the velcro piece that sticks to the window to hold the bottom of the shade down fell right off of my clean window, and the suction cups don't stay very long, either. the hole in the bottom tab to attach to the suction cup is too big and slips off the cup. the clip on the top that hooks over the top of the window broke apart on the second day of use. on the plus side, the roll-up action is good and the overall look is nicer than some other shades. it shades somewhat...i wish it were more opaque, though. overall, it's a cheap product that doesn't seem to stand up well to its intended usage.
