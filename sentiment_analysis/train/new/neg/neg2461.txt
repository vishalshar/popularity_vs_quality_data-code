I purchased this "pad" to complete my child's Fathers Day gift and am very disappointed with the results ... First, the description as a pad seems a bit deceiving because it is not a pad of ink for your child to cover their hand/foot nor is it a pad of transfer papers - it is one sheet of transfer paper (my fault I should've read the description better).  Second the sheet is extremely small, it would be fine for a footprint, but the hand or an infant may not even work, my daughter is 2 and neither her hand nor foot fit on the sheet.  Finally the prints themselves came out horrible - the fact that it ruined a $30 framed item for my husband was the icing on the cake.  I would NEVER buy this item again.
