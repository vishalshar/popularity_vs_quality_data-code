The gate is very hard to close securely. We are super safety conscious and I have found many time that the top and bottom have not latched properly. My baby pushed through this ( closed) gate yesterday and fell down and entire flight of stairs. Thank God above that all he ended up why was a bruise in his forehead (after and ambulance and ER visit). I spent some thine this morning inspecting this gate, closing and reopening it. After what I thought was a successful latch (visually looked good),I was able to pull the gate open by pulling on the bars. DO NOT BUY THIS GATE. I blocked off my stairs and immediately  ordered the same brand of gate we had at the top of our other staircase. It is all metal and has a fool proof latch. Wish I had installed this one first.
