I have three year old twin boys and they get into everything. They open the pantry door and take food out and throw it all over the house. Or, they go into their older sister’s room and pour out her lotions and mess up her make up. They would even go in my bedroom and bathroom and destroy anything they could.We desperately needed something to keep them out of certain rooms and from messing up everyone else’s things. I looked up how to prevent the boys from being able to gain access to the rooms and these were the most common answer. I ordered 2 packs of 2.It took about two days and they finally arrived. These fit the pantry door, but the rest of the doors I had to flip them backwards because the base of the door handle was too wide for the small opening. This wasn’t a problem because they fit.The letdown came about 10 days later. They learned how to take them apart and off the door. We would find the same messes and the same doors open with the door knob cover apart and on the floor nearby. Unless we have little geniuses, this was too easy for three year olds to figure out.
