Amazon, we have purchased countless items over the years and, without a doubt, this has been our worse purchase experience!  We planned to give this carriage to our daughter during her baby shower this weekend, but that's not going to happen.I was suspicious when the carriage arrived yesterday because the box looked like it had been previously used and it had more packaging tape around it than I've ever seen.  The nightmare, however,  began after we opened the box and saw how poorly the carriage and its contents had been packed.  We quickly noticed that the carriage was damaged and it was missing a wheel.  We then contacted the seller through Amazon.Why I suspect this item was previously returned to the seller:Ironically, this item was sold out when we first saw it on our daughter's baby shower registry.  Over the weekend, it showed available - as new - and we ordered it.  After we ordered the carriage, it then showed as no longer available again.  Given the condition of the box, the carriage and the missing wheel, I'm concerned  both the carriage and the shipping box were previously purchased and then returned to the seller and sold again - without any inspection.This is one of those times when I wished we purchased locally rather than through Amazon because our daughter will not get her baby carriage this weekend.  We have contacted Amazon and the seller to arrange for return and a full refund!
