The Carrara 2 drawer changing table seems to be very sturdy once assembled, and overall I think it will do the job for which it's designed.  I was a bit disappointed in some of the materials; specifically the drawers which were made of a very low quality chipboard.  It took probably three hours to unpack, gather the few tools needed (a hammer and a couple of sizes of screwdrivers), and assemble the table.  The instructions don't have any words to guide you, relying instead on exploded views of all the parts. However, I thought they were clear and accurate.  Prior to beginning assembly, I laid out all the parts and separated all the fastener types into piles.  That seemed to keep the confusion to a minimum.One major issue:  a standard concave changing pad was too large to fit, and the one with the table is only thin vinyl-covered foam.  I don't know if any other sizes of pads are available, but I'm going to have to look around.
