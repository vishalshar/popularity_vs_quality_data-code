The handles on the forks and spoons are large enough for small, toddler hands to grip easily.  The forks are great and spear food well without being too sharp.  The spoons leave a lot to be desired.  The size of the scoop is too large and too deep for our toddler to suck anything off of easily--as a result, she winds up turning the spoon upside down in her mouth.  I think a spoon that wasn't quite as deep would be perfect!  Otherwise, these are sturdy and good quality for the price.
