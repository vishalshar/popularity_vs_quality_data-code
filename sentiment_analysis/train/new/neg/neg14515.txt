I would call this box of toys mediocre here's the good and the bad.Good:1. My son's favorite toys came from this box.  Even now at 7 months, he loves the teething bird, the rattle and the pig that came instead of the ducky.2. Thank goodness for the letters! Not only were they fun-textured, but we used them to hang the toys on his play gym lower.3. Several of the toys have been pretty well abused and show no signs of wear.4.It's a nice variety of easy-to-throw-in-the-diaper-bag toys - small enough he can carry them with him into the carseat.Bad:1. Definitely did not get all the toys in the picture, no ducks, no octopus, and didn't get the thing in the picture with what looks like 3 stuffed cubes.  We did get a stuffed pig on wheels that is not in the picture, and one rattle instead of one of the ones in the picture, but it's definitely less overall.2. The letters came in handy, but really aren't fun toys.It's probably not worth $39.99 - I got it as a gift and would say it's worth $19.99 - so maybe pick it up if you can find in on sale.
