The tip on this spout is very large.  My 15 month old son makes a mess using it so we have stopped using it.  I think that perhaps the flow is too fast because he seems to drink part of the liquid that comes out and spit out the rest.  He has not had problems with other soft tipped sippers (he has a few styles).  Also, we've had leaks at the closure so we had to test it out before giving it to him just to make sure the seal was good.  Other bottles have a locking sound that lets you know you've put it on tight enough.
