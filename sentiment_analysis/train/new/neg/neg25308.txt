This is a great chair and is in a very pretty color, BUT the fabric is terrible! It gets food particles in it and does not wipe clean.  I really wish I could find a vinyl cover for our chair that would fit so I don't have to buy a new high chair.  We have been using this chair since our son was 8 months old and I have washed the cover repeatedly and hung it to dry so it doesn't fit as well now and the stains don't come out.  Save yourself the hassle and buy the Chicco high chair with the vinyl cover...it may not look as nice, but it will be CLEAN!
