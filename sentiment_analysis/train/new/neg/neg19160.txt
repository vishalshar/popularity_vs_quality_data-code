This is our first baby carrier. What we don't like about it (AT ALL!) is that to adjust the carrier and make it tight to your body you end up squashing the baby, since the strap is pulling from the front side of the carrier. We have not managed to use it in a comfortable way, properly fitted to the body. Very  bad design: in order to have it very tight and have a comfortable filling carrying your weight well distributed through your back you need to get the baby TOO tight.
