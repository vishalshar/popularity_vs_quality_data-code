My daughter didn't take to this as I hoped she would. I wear it fairly often but she has only nibbled on it a handful of times, and not for very long. She is 9 months and has her first tooth popping through. Maybe when she gets a little older she will like it more? Not a bad price though, so it was worth a try. She's always pulling my hair like a handle, so I was hoping wearing this would distract her.
