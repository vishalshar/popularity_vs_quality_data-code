I've heard great things about these from many people, since my first child was born. So, when my second baby starting teething, I thought I would try it out. He wore it with no discernable difference for about 2 hours, and then he began the most inconsolable screaming crying fit I've ever heard--he had never cried like that before, and is normally a very calm, happy baby. I took the necklace off after about ten minutes and he calmed down almost immediately. I put it back on him the next day, thinking it must have been a fluke, and the same thing happened again! I googled my experience, and apparently I'm not the only one whose baby had a negative reaction to the necklace. Still, thinking maybe it was a coincidence, I kept it off him for a week, to see if he was just being irritable for a couple of days, and he didn't cry like that once. I put it back on (for the last time) and again, horrible crying fits. I don't know if he just didn't wearing it, or he had a reaction to the baltic amber, but it sure makes things worse for him. Pity, I had very high hopes for this necklace. However, my two and a half year old LOVES it and wears it all the time, so it's still getting use I suppose. It's a very cute necklace!
