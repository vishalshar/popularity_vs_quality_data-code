we tried this and 3 others. they all were terrible. Bought a summer version that finally worked.the graco would rarely work due to whatever cause.. interference??the range was terrible. 1 floor below = static. that had to have been 20' MAX through a floor and it wouldnt work.Plus, for some reason it would just lose signal and turn off in the middle of the night. Infrared was a joke, small area..Garbage for something at this price range. Go with the summer, it was a little bulkier, but it has worked (aside from battery life on that 1 sucking bigtime).
