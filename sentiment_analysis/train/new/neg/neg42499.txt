This crib is well built and easy to put together and it looks good. Damage during shipping was very minimal on this crib. I'm a realist and I know the the delivery companies will not handle this item like a dozen eggs. The shipping part is out of the companies hands and nothing was inadequately packaged. It's easy enough to put together provided you can follow simple instructions. The biggest negative is this thing wreaked of paint for at least a month and a half after I put it together. I bought it plenty of time before the baby came a long so I could "air" it out but I never imagined this thing would smell so strong for so long. Something to Consider!!!
