As others have said, this is a cheap night lite with a heavy, opaque graphic clipped to it.  The light sensor isn't sensitive enough to turn off during daylight hours, and the weight of the monkey graphic can pull the plug from the wall socket if it is at all loose.  We just use ours when the grandson sleeps at our house, so it's no problem taking it out when he's not here, but I don't recommend it for continual use.
