oversized piece of junk..... my son played with this for about 30 mins then he was completly board not worth the money ( i can see why this has been discontinued its total crap in my opinion) too big and bulky and not sterdy enough to hold up a child learning to sit up he just falls backwards. dont waste your money buy a smaller toy
