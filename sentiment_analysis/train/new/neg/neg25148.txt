It works as advertized, but was not as helpful as I thought it might be. It did help give me confidence for the first couple of weeks when I had my first kid. I didn't have to wonder if I fed my kid enough or if he was having a healthy amount of #2's in his diaper. However, it ended up becoming a chore to enter in all the feedings and diaperings and was taking away my energy rather than helping me relax. Also, I suspect now you could get an app that does the same thing for cheaper (plus it's easier to remember to carry around your phone).
