We got our first bumGenius Diaper Sprayer in 2008 when we started using cloth diapers with our first son. We primarily used it for rinsing diapers, but also found it handy for rinsing the tub/shower when cleaning. After 5 years of use, it stopped working so we bought a new one. I noticed the sprayer had increased in price by about $20 and figured out why when it arrived. The hose is much stronger than on our previous one. Instead of a long, clear plastic tube, it's now a shorter stainless steel reinforced hose. I suppose that's better for preventing leaks or burst hoses, but it's not as useful. Now the hose is too short for rinsing our tub/shower and makes it tricky to rinse diapers because of the configuration of the toilet and water supply line. Nevertheless, a diaper sprayer is essential for cloth diapering. I just miss the old, longer hose.
