$8 for 1 pacifier clip? The description and picture are deceiving. I guess I should've read between the lines that it didn't mention quantity-2 or 2-pack. I kept this item only because UPS/Fedex are a pain to get to for me to send this back.The strap is a lot shorter than the other nicer ones that I have. The loop that connects to the pacifier is shorter and thinner than others. I would recommend getting this other one Booginhead Pacigrip, Purple Plaid which is much longer, nicer and cheaper when I got it!!
