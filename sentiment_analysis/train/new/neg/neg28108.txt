I loved these straps at first, but then the piece inside the adjuster broke off.  It's a good thing I was right next to her, because next thing I knew she was standing up in her seat.  The straps themselves are nice and soft, but the adjuster pieces are very thin.  I wouldn't recommend these at all.
