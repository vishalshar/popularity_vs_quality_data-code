I bought this bedding set over a year ago on Amazon (by the way they only had "5 left in stock" then too.This bedding wasn't my first choice but I was on a budget and the really nice sailboat bedding online was really expensive. I found this set "on sale" in December 2010 and purchased it. I was very excited when it arrived and even more excited when I pulled all the many pieces out of the bag that I got for just over $50. I was a little disappointed that it only came with 1 crib sheet but no big deal, this was for our 3rd boy so we had plenty of white and blue crib sheets around.The smell caught me off guard but I washed everything (valances & diaper stacker included) in Dreft twice and the smell was gone. Again, no biggie. THEN we went to put the bumper on the crib and it did not fit! I have noticed the inside of our crib is a bit larger than our other 2 boys' were and needed a bigger mattress to fit it so that may be the case but I was very disappointed.I really liked it after it was on the bed but when my baby was about 4 months old the strings to the bumper started falling off! Then the one sheet it came with started to fray in the seams. The only nice things about this bedding set were the quilt which I've washed several times with no problems and the skirt. We never hung the valances, maybe we will one day but as of right now they wouldn't really match anything anyway since I can't even use the bumper.I definitely do not recommend purchasing this crib bedding.
