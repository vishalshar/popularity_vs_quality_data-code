This monitor worked well, while it lasted. I used it to keep an eye on my toddler, who likes to quietly get out of bed on his own.  I didn't have any problems with the audio. The video monitor, however, stopped working after about the 5th use. My husband plugged it into the wall socket and the AC adapter sparked and then burst open!!! We got a replacement AC adapter and cord, from Radio Shack, but still can't get the monitor to work. You can get a clear image on the screen, like the one advertised on the box, only if the room is well-lit. Otherwise, the picture shows a grainy, black & white little blob. Also, the monitor is huge!! It looks like an old-school tube TV.
