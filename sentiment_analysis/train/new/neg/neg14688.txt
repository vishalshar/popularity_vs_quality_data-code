I love that these are glass, and the silicone sleeves are very nice. However, the brand name is printed on the nipple ring and it scratched my sons chin horribly after 1 use! I don't know what designer thought that putting a raised logo on the ring that comes in contact with a babies face was a good idea.... But it isn't. Sadly, we had to return and wont be buying any lifefactory bottles. We came from a wide necked bottle to this one. He also chocked on the small nipple. So it just was a all around disaster.
