I am a small breasted woman. Before pregnant or nursing I was a 34A. During Nursing I'm a 36C. I found this NEW bobby harder to use than the original. It didn't sit high enough for me. I always felt hunched over while feeding. This one doesn't wrap around my body as far as the other one did. I am going back to the Original Boppy.
