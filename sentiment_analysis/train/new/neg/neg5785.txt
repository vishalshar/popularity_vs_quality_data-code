The stroller is great it brings nice space and it is super easy to assemble.. My two stars go to the bad quality.. One of my wheel is bended for no reason. I use my stroller occasionally and I take care of my stuffs and it was damaged in the first month. The car seat can't not be in all the position as they say.. My husband had to fix it in order to fit the car seat. Wouldn't recommend it.
