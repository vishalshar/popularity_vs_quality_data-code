I was really excited about this box. It fits two diapers and the wipes has two openings. My frustration with the bbox is that the wipes dry up so fast!! Everytime I need to use it the wipes are dry. I keep the lids closed tightly and they still dry out. I do love the size of the Bbox. I keep it in my purse and it fits perfect! I hate the bulk of a diaper bag and this has saved the day.
