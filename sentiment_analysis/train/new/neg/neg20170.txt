I bought this seat three weeks ago because it was rated by Consumer Reports as their safest booster seat that they tested.  It also got reasonably good reviews by parents who had purchased it.  However, I watched a report on a national news program yesterday regarding crash tests done by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety on booster seats.  Guess which seat they used as an example of the worst qualities in a poor booster seat?  You got it, this one.  You can go on the IIHS website and see for yourself.  It is found under the "Not Recommended" category.  Needless to say, this carseat is back in the box and on its way back to Amazon.
