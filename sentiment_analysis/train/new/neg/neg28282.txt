This walker I was hoping would work for my 9 1/2 month old who wants to climb and pull himself up on everything. I was hoping this would do it, not so much. When I picked it up from the UPS guy the package was large but I could easily pick this up with one hand while carrying my son. I guess this should have tipped me off to how light it would be. It snapped together easy without tools which is a plus and has brakes for the back wheels but all the wheels are plastic and because the thing is so light it slides everywhere even on carpet. He likes playing with the front and the lights/music he enjoys a lot but wants to climb up the front too but due to it's lightness it would just tip over on him if I wasn't there to prevent the thing tipping over. He cannot even pull himself up from the back because again too light, tips. He might be able to use it when he is older (when he is better at walking but that's kind of the point of why I wanted it) but not sure. I would return it but don't know if I can take it apart again and he has used the front part which he enjoys but I cannot leave him alone with it or in the same room with him as he is moving fast now (crawling). So not what I had hoped and would really like to know a walker that doesn't tip and has rubber or rubberized wheels that doesn't move too fast for him.
