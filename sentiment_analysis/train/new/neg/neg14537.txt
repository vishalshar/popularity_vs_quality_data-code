I really wanted to like this hands free pumping bra, but the fact is, it simply does not work. I tried using it according to the directions and adjusted it several times but the breast shield just is not held in place by this product. Even if you can manage to get it in the correct location, as soon as milk starts filling the bottles (I'm not talking a lot of milk, like 1/2 an ounce!), the shield pops right of and milk goes EVERYWHERE! While using this "bra", I had to actually hold the shields in place, which completely defeats the purpose. I returned it and got the Rumina hands free pumping bra, which works way better. It is more expensive, but well worth the price.
