I was all ready to give this mat a perfect score when yesterday the squeaky toy built into one of the panels broke. Now it makes no sound and we've only had it for a couple of months so my newborn barely got to appreciate that feature.Furthermore, the texture isn't great for learning to crawl. It's too slippery and makes it hard on the little guy!
