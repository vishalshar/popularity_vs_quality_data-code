I purchased this bottle in the hopes that it would be something my little one would take.  We never tried it out because we found a bottle he liked before it arrived. We received a pink one with flowers on it.  Not what I would have chosen, not a huge deal, but if you are concerned about gendered products this is important to note.  The worst part is I can't return it even thought it's still in its packaging. So now I have an unused, unneeded, pink bottle sitting around.
