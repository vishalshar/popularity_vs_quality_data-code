This will cover the car seat buckle and is difficult for children to release. However, my son was still able to undo the buckle while this belt was wrapped around it. It looked fine from my vantage in the front and when I went to get him out I could see what he had done. That means in the case of an accident or abrupt stop, the chest strap is no good.Basically, this is a great idea. Lots of these straps are great ideas. But you can't get away from just regular discipline. Pull the car over, take away toys, use bribery - anything. Just get your kids seat belt on. None of these contraptions are going to work.And then there's the additional problem of getting the strap undone for the parent in the case of an emergency. It's really difficult because of the angle.I don't recommend it. There's really no way the manufacturer can make it any better. It's the kids that need to change.
