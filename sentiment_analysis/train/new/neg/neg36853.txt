I purchased this baby book right before the birth of my son so that I could keep track of all the important details and have somewhere to store his hospital paperwork. The thing that sold me on this specific baby book was the colors and the cute teddy on the front.When the book arrived I noticed the cover had a couple of small dents on it, but it wasn't really anything worth worrying over. I love the color theme throughout the book and all of the fill-ins. I kept the plastic over the cover and back of the book because I like having the pockets on the inside for storing loose photos and other items. The description states that the book comes with an ink pad for getting footprints/hand prints, but I did not receive one with my order.Overall I feel this baby book serves it's purpose, but I'm not sure if I would recommend this exact listing to family and friends.
