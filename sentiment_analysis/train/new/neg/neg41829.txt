My original review:I loved these but ours broke withing the first couple hours after UPS delivered it! My 3 year old dropped it and the plastic cracked. They look so cool, are easy for my 2 kids to hold (1 year old and 3 year old) and are a great size for little ones who sometimes don't have the patience to finish the regular size ones and set them down while they play leaving a big melted mess. I really do like them and will probably try replacing it and hope for better luck with the next one. I also bought another brand/type at the same time and those have not broken but they are bigger size and I was thinking of using those more for my 3 year old and using this one for my 14 month old. The bigger one is harder for my 14 month old to hold because the "stem" is so short.MY UPDATED OPINION:I ordered TWO additional sets of these. Both new sets have already broken when I have tried to break them apart and just take 1 popsicle out. There are not enclosed directions. I am wondering if I am doing something wrong but there are no directions. I have spent almost $30 buying 3 sets of these and all of them are broken! The first one I blamed on my toddler dropping it but the other 2 have not been dropped by my toddler and have had parts of the blue plastic crack and break off. I'm going to try my luck with a different brand that advertises being BPA free. :(
