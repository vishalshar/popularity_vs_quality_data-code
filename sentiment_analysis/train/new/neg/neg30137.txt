It's cute but needs a longer thicker handle/leash. This is a must for any parent with a strong willed toddler esp one with ASD. This backpack has come in handy so many times.  People can give their condescending looks but one can never be too cautious when it comes to our children.  I bought this for my 3 yo grandson who has been placed in my care, unfortunately I don't get around as well as I once did; & his listening skills are nonexistent when we are out in public (he's autistic), this backpack has been a lifesaver!!  Now he knows we wear our backpack when we're going anywhere and he grabs it on our way out the door.
