The blanket seems fine but the bag it comes with is very odd.  It's just a strip of fabric with two straps (one strap each side) to hold the sides of the fabric together.  When you fold the blanket and put it in, it's very loose and the blanket unravels in it.  For $45 it should be a better way to pack away the blanket.  See pictures for more accurate depiction.
