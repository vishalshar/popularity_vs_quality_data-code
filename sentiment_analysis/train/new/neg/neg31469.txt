I love the hanging organizer and the cloth baskets. They work great and keep all my baby's clothes organized and easy to find. We have a thick wooden hanging bar in our closet though...and the hangers didn't fit on our bar! I had to order a different style that fit better. The separaters didn't fit either because of the large bar, and I was bummed about that. But otherwise it's a good set. Our bar is probably about 1.5" in diameter.
