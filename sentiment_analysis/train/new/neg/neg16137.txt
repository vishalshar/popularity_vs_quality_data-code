Unfortunately, this didn't help with my problem. I had been suffering heat rash from skin-against-skin because over the past 13 months I've lost over 100 pounds. I was hoping this would keep the heat rash from happening until I can afford to get the rest of me to match the weight loss, as I live in a tropical climate and therefore am exposed to heat and humidity a lot. I applied this religiously for two weeks and it didn't help with the itch nor did it stop the rash from forming. Ah, well. On to the next hopeful thing...
