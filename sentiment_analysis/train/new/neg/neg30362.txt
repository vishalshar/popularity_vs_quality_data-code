These teething rings are cute and colorful to look at but there are definitely better teething toys available. The rings are small and difficult for baby to get a good grip leading to either frustration or disinterest. Additionally, they don't have varied surfaces--most babies like to have different textures to chomp into and these particular rings do not provide that. Again, they are cute, but not the best choice.
