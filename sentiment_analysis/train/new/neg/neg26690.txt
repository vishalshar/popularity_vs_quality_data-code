I was looking for a disposable diaper sack that would be a good alternative to the typical "baby powder" scented ones. The "baby powder" scent is overwhelming to me. I had hoped these Munchkin Arm and Hammer Diaper bags would smell more natural because of the baking soda and "lavender" scent. However, I found the smell was equally too strong for me, and in my humble opinion, the "lavender" smells synthetic.I am sharing this, not because I want to complain, but because I know there are others who, like myself, are very sensitive to fragrances and who may be thinking what I was thinking -- that these baggies would smell very natural and light. These baggies are highly scented.The quality (thickness) of the bag is good, and it is a generous size (can easily hold soiled baby clothes as well), but it would be so much more convenient if it had handles for tying.
