I bought this sunshade for my Honda Civic but it looks like the size is too small to cover the windows effectively. Overall it seems to be a good product but you have to pay attention to the suction cups. They have these little knobs on them that you pull when you want to detach it, but if you're not careful and the knobs end up under the upper bar, it will be very hard to detach the upper suction cups. They could've designed it better.
