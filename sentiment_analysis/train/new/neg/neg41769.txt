I bought 2, hoping to use this to affix plates to for my todder twins to get used to plates, bowls, etc.. Well, I don't know about your kids, but my beefy 25lb toddler ripped this right off the table the first time we used it (Christmas morning).. My daughter (20lbs) tried but couldn't get it to budge. So I guess it sort of works? Even though I have a bit of a strong man for a son, I'm starting to think one was defective because it came off so easily. Will give it another try and edit this review if there's any new findings....
