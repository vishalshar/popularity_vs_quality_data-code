This is our third exersaucer.  Our first and second ones were FANTASTIC, nothing fancy about them, our 3 month old kids all used them for a long time and loved them.  I regret giving them away.  This one however was defective right out of the box.  I contacted Evenflo and they insisted it was the legs, I knew it wasn't but they decided to send out new legs anyway. I called them back and told them it was the base, it was warped, causing the legs not to make complete contact with the floor, no matter which surface and the thing wobbled all over.  Anyway, they told me they couldn't send me a new base because this particular model is being discontinued, BULL!  So, they told me to return it to the store.  That's great customer service for ya, grrrr!I always raved about Evenflo and their products, now I will no longer buy or recommend Evenflo products because of this incident.  Thankfully my husband was able to rectify the warped base a bit so now it works fine, but for 45 dollars should we have had to tweak it to get it to work as it should have, NO!Over all, if you get a good one, good, you'll love it as will your baby.  The toys are cute, the baby is able to get great exercise and it's super cute.  If you end up with a defective saucer, good luck dealing with Evenflo!
