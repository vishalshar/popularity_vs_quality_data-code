I had to buy these for my dacare as the state says that the 'plugs' are unsafe.  I perosnally think it is a waste of money.  when i plug something in it does not stay in that great as their is too much space.  Plus it sticks out of the wall a bit so before my kids never noticed the plugs, and now they are always their trying to put things in the holes and try turning it.  i think if you do not have to buy them, then stick with the plugs, they work better and are a lot cheaper.
