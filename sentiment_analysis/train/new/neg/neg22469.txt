This nursing cover is stylish enough to wear as a top and made from a wonderfully lightweight, stretchy, wrinkle-free material. However, I gave it 3 stars because I found it difficult to use while nursing due to its lack of structure. There is no way to make the front stand away for easy viewing. It also seems over-priced for what it is.
