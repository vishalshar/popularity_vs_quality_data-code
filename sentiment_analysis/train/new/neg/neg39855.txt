I bought this pump after reading the good reviews. wanted something small i could take around with me, It takes a half an hour to pump an ounce and then looses suction when the milk gets into the connection where the breast flange connects to the top thing. It was frustrating. I am quite disappointed. It takes too long for too little. The attachments and bottles are nice, but i don't like the nipples (two peice jobs) that come with it. it was a waste of time for me.
