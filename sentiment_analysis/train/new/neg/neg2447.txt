We bought a 5-pack of these bottles for a recent long weekend trip.  I thought it would be great to be able to have a few bottles that didn't need to be washed that we could use and toss.  We went over to my grandparents house with several of these bottles, some formula mix and one Dr. Brown's bottle that had just a little milk left in it.  Thank goodness we took the Dr. Brown's bottle because our 5 month old refused to drink from this bottle.The nipple is much harder plastic than the soft silicone.  Not quite sippy cup material but harder for her to drink out of than her "Tommy Tippie" transitional sippy cup.I did not have the issue with not being able to remove and reseal the bottle.  It's tricky but it worked OK without breaking.  Fine for 6 months + but I would not even attempt with an infant.  Try them before you travel (or have a backup).  I will keep and try again in a few months.
