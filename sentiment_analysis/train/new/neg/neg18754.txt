I ordered this pet gate for my open kitchen and have been disappointed since the moment I took it out of the box. Despite the pricetag, this gate is cheap! While the wood looks nice, the hinges are flimsy and the weight so light that its ineffective in standing up on its own. Customer service was poor and I never received promised label for return. I've begrudgingly decided to keep it to avoid the drawn out hassle of dealing with this outside vender. I've had to prop it up against the inside of the wall and behind a piece of furniture in order to give it any meaningful stability. If my dog was younger than his 16 years and didn't sleep all day, I'm sure this would be a major issue. I'm an avid Amazon shopper and usually am thoroughly satisfied... until now. My advice: save your money and look for another gate solution.
