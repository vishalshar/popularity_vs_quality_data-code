I bought this toy for a friend's baby and have loved them in the past. It usually has a very nice smell and each of the octopus' tentacles make noise when you squeeze them. For some reason this one seems to be defective. I waited too long to return it so now I'm stuck with it, but am pretty disappointed. I won't be buying this online again.
