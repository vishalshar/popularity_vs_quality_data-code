I felt like I NEEDED this. Well it was not worth it. Baby just rolled off the other side and slipped down and as flat as I made my tummy, i couldn't get this pillow comfortably close to my body. And there is no place for your arms. It's weird.We have found other random uses for this pillow. But as far as breast feeding... Worst pillow ever.Just use regular pillows and angle them they way that you need.
