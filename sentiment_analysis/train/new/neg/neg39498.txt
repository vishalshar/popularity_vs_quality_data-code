This is a nice seat but we would like the baby to be able to use the seat in a car, not the living room floor!  I have tried to fit this seat in a 1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme 2 door and a 2000 Chevy Impala 4 door.  Does not work well in either car in rear facing position!  Very awkward base makes it difficult.  Kind of stuck with it for now
