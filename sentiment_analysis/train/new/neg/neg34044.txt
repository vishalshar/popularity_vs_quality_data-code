I bought a set and started using them in January.  One ball unraveled after about 6 months of use.  I hoped it was a fluke and was willing to give the manufacturer the benefit the doubt.  The second one unraveled in August, leaving little wool fuzzies all over an entire load of clothes.  I spent over an hour pulling them off of everything in that load of laundry.  The third one is still hanging on, but I am sure it is only a matter of time before it bites the dust.
