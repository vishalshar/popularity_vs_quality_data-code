While the rack is good for keeping lots of bags contained in an organized place in the freezer and doesn't take up much room (all positives), the slope on the bottom panel causes the bags to freeze with the back side bigger than the front of the bag.  Therefore, when you go to pull out the one on the bottom of the pile, it can't be slipped out from the rest without taking ALL the bags out... Not convenient at all.  Thanks for inquiry about my satisfaction.
