First of all, you don't need a base to use a car seat. All standard seats come with seat belt hooks. (Although I think it is safer with a base). Secondly, the Shuttle is cumbersome to buckle with a wriggling infant and does not allow much air ventilation. It was always a hassle to get our son into this, and he frequently over-heated, even with just a t-shirt on. Save your money and get the Chicco Keyfit. After much hesitation, we finally spent the $$$ and we LOVE the Chicco Keyfit.
