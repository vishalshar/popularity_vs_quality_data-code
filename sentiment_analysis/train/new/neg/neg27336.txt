Got this for my 9 year old who is 75 lbs and 53.5 inches tall. (my 6 year old's seat expires next year, was going to give this to him then) Height-wise, the 9 year old fit fine. However, his arms and torso are FAR too wide for this seat (measuring from the outside of one if his arms to the other he is 14 inches). He is not fat either. There is no give in the side wings at all so he just does not fit. You might want to measure your kid first - the widest part of the seat at the top of the shoulder wings is 10.5 inches or so, meaning the arms and back have to fit within that space. I'm not sure why this is rated up to 100 lbs, maybe if your kid is ultra narrow?  My super-narrow (40 lb) 6 year old fit, but barely. Stop making booster seats for 3 year olds! They should be in harnessed seats anyway!One more thing, although the fabric on the Carbon is GORGEOUS (I live in a cold climate so I don't mind the velour stuff), the shoulder wings and head wings have a bunch of circle-shaped hard lumps (the foam I guess) underneath which the padding doesn't do much to soften. Ugh! I cannot imagine this being comfortable. I've owned so many car seats, most with side wings, but have never had one with uncomfortable foam like this one. The seat padding though is especially plush, I wish other booster seats would have as much padding in that area as this one does.Returning seat.
