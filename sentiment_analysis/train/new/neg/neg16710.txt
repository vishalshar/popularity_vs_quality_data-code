My previous seat was a Britax and I was beyond happy with it. I bought this one knowing that is was going to be a quality downgrade, which it was. That was ok, however my problem is with tightening the straps. It is nearly impossible to get them tight. I can not get them tight enough on my own and even my husband has to pull with all his might, take a break, then pull again just to get the straps tight enough to go anywhere. I have contacted Graco for a solution, however now that I am researching the issue, I'm not very hopeful that there will be one. Sounds like it is just a design flaw. If there is no fix, I will definitely be returning this item and switching back to Britax.
