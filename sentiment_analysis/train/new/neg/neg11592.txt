The only reason this got a 2 is because it's big enough to fit different baby items.  The bows are not white like the picture looks, I have a boy and got pink bows, the elastic is not snug on the smaller items like a car seat, the cover snags on everything and gets holes in it.  The bows were easy enough to take off, but we were left with glue spots.  I've only used this about 5 times and I'm ready to throw it in the trash.  Also it's loose enough that my son can pull it and get his feet stuck in it.  I made one for my daughter with tulle and that was much more durable.
