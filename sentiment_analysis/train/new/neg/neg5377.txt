I got this mobile as a gift from my aunt. I love the Hampton sail boat and lighthouse theme and thought the mobile was so cute too. However, it does not fit the Simmons Crib n' More bed we also bought at Babies R' Us. There is a picture of our exact furniture (natural colored wood- not the white) with the Hampton set and it shows the mobile hooked onto the bed. But, do not let that fool you. You can attach it but it is not stable at all. It wobbles and falls down even if you barely touch it. If the part at the bottom of the mobile was longer it might work. You just can't get enough grip because the spindle piece is just too short. I really hate that I can't use this mobile because it matches everything in my son's room.
