Bouncers are a must-have for any new parent.  They are the babysitter when you need to go the bathroom or answer the door or just give your tired arm a rest.  We searched a while before we found a bouncer that we liked.  The Hoppy Days bouncer was a decent price and had a pattern that could be used for boy or girl.  We have left it on several times, but it seems to handle that well.  We have had it 4 months and changed the battery twice.  Not bad considering we tend to forget that its on.Pros:-perfect for newborn-bounces well with foot easily-head rest to support the wabbly head of a baby-easy to moveCOns:-If your baby is long, they will grow out of it quickly and could hurt back of ankle on the plastic power switch area-the frog hangs kind of low in the front of your child's face-child slides down as he bounces or wiggles *USE THE HARNESS!*Our little boy is 4 months and pretty tall and heavy for his age(28 inches/17+ lbs).  We still use the bouncer when we need our hands free even though he can kick the switch plate at the front.  I just wut a blanket under him to keep him from kicking it too hard.Over all we were happy with it.
