Although this border is adorable, the glue that's on there will NOT work. After putting this up twice and watching it curl off the wall both times...we bought some border adhesive and tried one last time. Thankfully that worked. Don't waste your time...buy adhesive for this cute border and enjoy....because it does go really well with the bedding set.
