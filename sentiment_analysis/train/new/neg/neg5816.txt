I would never buy this car seat again. My biggest complaint is the totally ineffective canopy. We live in Florida and I constantly need to put a blanket or coat over the canopy to ensure the sun is not in my babies eyes. Now the canopy completely fell off and there's nothing in the manual that says how to reinstall it correctly. My baby has soiled the insert several times and it's very hard to get the liner on and off. The only positive thing about this seat is its light weight and it's easy to install.
