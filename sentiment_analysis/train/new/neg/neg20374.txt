lock mechanism is so small and button is in  worst  configuration possible !at the top a button is pressed and slide button about half inch to open -so any child who grabs top and pulls a little can open this thing -all kids upon encountering an obstacle grab at top of it (bcause they're short)  it's a natural motion for a kid/baby to feel around the top and  pull down on somthin in their way...I previously own and use the "summer infant" wood version of this gate and latch is much more robust: gate must be lifted while button is  pressed- plus u have to slide it out of latch cradle- all at same time in order to open -  (at top of stairs)on the other hand: with this gate a little bit of force seems to be able to open even without pushing latch lock button ! bcause the latch itself is minuscule the peice that holds gate and locks it is  only a half inch little plastic pin less than 1/4" inch in diameter- a stair railing can be pushed out that much and open gate without touching button at all - !!I am lucky to have I installed  at bottom of steps-  I would have definitely not kept it had I purchased it first and installed at top - I have no faith in this gate staying locked .. gate is strong - butlock is crap..company better change this lock bfor some kids get seriously hurt ! !
