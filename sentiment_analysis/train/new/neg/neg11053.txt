First off, I don't have any major serious complaints about this product. It works fine and my 6 month old likes it, but doesn't love it like I thought she would.I don't like that it doesn't have adjustable height on the legs. The seat has adjustments, but for my little daughter 25" & 15 lbs, If I get her feet to touch, she has a hard time reaching the toys. If I get her to reach the toys she can't touch the bottom.I agree the purple snack tray is a pain. They need to permanently attach that or make it more difficult for baby to get off.My daugter tends to bore with this easily. There are not alot of interactive toys with this other than the music. And at this age it is really her feet making the music and her looking at the lights. She does love the microphone, but all that does is make a rattle sound when she shakes it. The keys and music buttons, she can't activate with her hands at this point.It is also too big for our house. It does not have any fold up features to make it smaller for storage.I think this is a good concept, but needs some work from FP. I wish I had stuck with a conventional exersaucer.
