It is not very good for toddlers.  Too small to catch enough food and too easy to break when used by a toddler who bites almost anything.  I think for toddlers, it is better for them to start using silverware rather than those plastic spoons.  They may be good for babies who don't have teeth yet.Also, it is expensive.
