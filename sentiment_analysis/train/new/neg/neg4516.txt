We have this right now and our baby is almost 10 months. I have mixed feelings about this car seat.ProsAlthough, we have never been in an accident, it feels pretty sturdy and safe.It is nice, easy to clean (We own the vanilla bean and it is a nice neutral color).It has the latch hook which is nice only if your car has the the proper hooks for the latch.The flex lock is nice if you want to take the car seat out to shop, eat, etc.ConsThe handle is too stiff and constantly sticks, very frustrating, especially in cold weather! NOT GOOD!It's heavy and bulky.My 10 month gets upset in the car seat because she has no leg room (its in the middle seat in the back of a Subaru Outback).And when she throws her head back, the head rest is not soft (its hard and lumpy), and she gets even more upset. Not a comforting thought, especially if there was a wreck. I put a blanket there during long road trips.Also the puzzle-type bottom buckle can stick when I try to get her undone.I have just read how fabulous the Britax car seats are suppose to be and ordere the Marathon convertible car seat for her. We will keep our baby trend for our second baby, but only because it is paid for and safe, but it is not comfortable nor quick and easy to get her out because of the handle and bottom buckle. However, it's easy to get her out is she was to stay in the car seat.
