Got this for the green sprout bottle because of the bottle cracking on impact reviews there.  This should hopefully reduce the chance of the bottle cracking on impact with my tile floor.For my 18-month son it makes the bottle more difficult to hold for drinking purposes.  The ears itself and their attachment points are too soft and not very rigid.  When tilting a liquid filled bottle by holding just the ears of the cover, it is hard to control/rotate it precisely because the ears bend.
