I have had many baby carriers and wraps from $$$$ to $. This one is just okay. I am petite (5'1) and all that fabric is very overwhelming. It also is not very comfortable. Don't get me wrong, the fabric is great. But, after wearing it for half an hour, the fabric shifts and bunches and it just plain uncomfortable and unsightly. This carrier now sits in the back of the closet with the other unloved carriers.
