My 4 year old loves it(and honestly I think it looks pretty cool too)!  Helps him fall asleep at night and stay out of our room.  Careful not to look at the bulbs on this if you have this sitting on the floor.  It is blinding.  PROS:  Cool, rotating colors(or just 1 if you choose).  Fills up a normal sized bed room on the whole ceiling (11x12) and some of the walls too.  Like that it has the port for plugging in ipod and actually includes the adapter. Makes a child sleepy in record time by staring at the wave motion.  CONS: It shuts off after 1 hr.  If my kid wakes up in the middle of the night he freaks and makes me put it back on for him when too sleepy to figure out on his own.  Wish it would stay on longer.  After 3 months of near daily use, it started to make crunching noises when the gears moved.  If you happen to play background music loud enough you won't hear it, but once you do, it will get on your nerves.  Noise isn't there all the time. Might be temperature/humidity related. Speakers are of low quality, but are much louder than I would have expected.
