I received the Similac bottles as part of a “starter” package when I was pregnant with my daughter. It was the small 4 oz bottle and it had a Level 1 nipple on it. I really liked the bottle and nipples as they were pretty easy to clean and my daughter seemed to be like the nipple enough that she would go from bottle to breast easily. No nipple confusion here!As she grew and her appetite got larger I purchased the 8 oz bottles and level 2 nipples. Here is where the issue is – the level 2 nipples collapse when she is drinking from them. You have to constantly monitor and take the bottle of your baby’s mouth (ugh) so that the nipple can fill with air and proceed with feeding again. It’s not a HUGE deal, but obviously the venting system doesn't work with the level 2 nipples and now that I am looking at some reviews….it doesn't work with the Level 3 nipples either.This wasn't an issue with just 1 or 2 of the nipples either. I ordered a total of 10 level 2 nipples and they ALL do this. Like I said, it’s not the biggest deal, but it is a pain that something doesn't work the way it is supposed to. I ended up switching the type of bottles I use.
