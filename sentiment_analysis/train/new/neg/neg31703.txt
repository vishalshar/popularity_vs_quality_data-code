Do not buy this! The mechanism is so poorly design..the sound of a mobile is sqicky and the power of the spin is very poor and jerky.Not to say that the item wasn't packed properly, the box was opened when it reached me, it took forever to get here and then it doesn't even work properly. I returned it, had to pay for a return shipment out of pocket, and then they refunded only half of the money because they found hair in it?? Really...definitely not worth the money and the hassle of a non-prime shipping. Very low quality for a high price!
