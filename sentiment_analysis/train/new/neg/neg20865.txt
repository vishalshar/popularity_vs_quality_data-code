I do not like the hood. It is big and bulky. I do like that it come unlatched. I do not like that when you put it into the pocket, it is big and bulky on the babies head. I do not like that it latches int he pocket. It makes it so I can't use the pocket.I would have liked to have a bigger pocket in the back for my credit card and money.The newborn feature has buttons. With a baby that doesn't fit the regular way, but does fit the longer option, it works, however, the buttons do not latch.
