It's a great product and does what we need it to, but the construction of it is terrible! We're on our third one of these just this winter because the zipper keeps breaking. I can't bring myself to stop replacing them because my 18mo is a wild sleeper and won't keep blankets on but gets too cold without so this is perfect. But if I could find a product that did the same thing and lasted longer I wouldn't hesitate to never use this again!
