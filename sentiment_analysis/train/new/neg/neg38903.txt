They are nice car seat wraps. I received them thinking they would be thicker, but they are pretty thin. The picture was a little misleading to me. However, they are very soft and work for what I needed them to do. Would be great for newborns covering their straps. My daughter is 15 months and I purchased them to just cover her straps as she sleeps with her head down in the car and sometimes the straps bug her neck so I was hoping these would stop the marks. So far so good so no complaints here other than thinking they were thicker.
