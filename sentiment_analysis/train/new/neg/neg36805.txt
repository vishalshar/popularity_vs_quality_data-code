I wasn't as satisfied with this product as I thought I'd be.  It's really bulky when I used it for my newborn in her bouncy seat, and it really just made her slouch forward more because of the bulkiness.  It's like there wasn't enough room for her head!  I hardly ever use it, but I will try it again, since it's been a few weeks.  It's very soft and I think the idea behind it is good, but I just use my old carseat liner that I bought at a department store.
