We originally bought this seat because we lived in a small apartment, and only had room for a highchair we could strap onto a kitchen chair.  It is a very durable product.  It is a good space saver, and I like the fact that it comes with a tray, and the tray does fit in the dishwasher :).  However, our tray comes off VERY easily (my daughter merely pushed a little and it popped right off).  Also, on certain chairs, we cannot get the straps that fasten it to a chair to tighten enough, so the seat moves around a lot.  (And the straps are easy to lose if you don't keep close track of them.) Like some of the other reviewers, I found it to be a good food storage area! Seriously, food gets caught in all the crevices, and it is not easy to clean unless you take it apart.  I don't know if there's a better fold-up booster seat/highchair out there, but I would only recommend this seat for going places, and then to use it with close supervision.  We now only use it when we go somewhere or go in the backyard, and I'll be darned if I can keep those straps with the seat!! We have to put it on the ground now because we can't fasten it to a chair.  We have a real highchair in our house now that we have some room, but I would like to switch to a booster (my son is 2 1/2--it's about time).  I don't want to bring this one in the house because it's so hard to clean up after meals (the booster and the chair underneath--unless you want to scrub the finish off your chairs because you didn't know the food was leaking down under the booster!).  On the positive side, the seat has lasted 6 years and is still in great condition.  I just wish the seat were designed better!
