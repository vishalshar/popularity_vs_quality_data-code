The book itself is just what I wanted. Not too many irrelevant things to fill in but just enough of the good stuff: family tree, firsts, foot prints, a page for each month and a page for first 5 birthdays. It also comes with a few clear pockets for other items and several blank pages to customize. I like that it is a standard size so I can add more if I'd like to.What I didn't like was that although the packaging was fine and the product appears to be new the very front page has a lot of dirty smudges on it. Not really what you want for the front page of your baby's book. Would be 5 stars if it wasn't dirty.
