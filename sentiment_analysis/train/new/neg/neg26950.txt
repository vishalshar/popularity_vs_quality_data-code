I think this is a great idea so you don't have to buy so many different stage nipples, and it works on ready-to-use bottles as well as expressed breastmilk bottles. I can only comment on the slow setting because my baby is not old enough to try the faster flows, but the slow was quite fast for my baby. It was faster than all other stage 1 nipples I have tried, and I have tried Avent, Dr. Brown, Ventaire (both wide and narrow), Soothie, and Playtex Nurser.
