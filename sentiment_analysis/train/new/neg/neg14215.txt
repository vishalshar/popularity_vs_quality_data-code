I like how this diaper wicks moisture away, and I started using it more for my daughter when she began sleeping through the night.  The problem is that the tag, which is sewn into the back center seam of the diaper, hangs outside the diaper.  So by the end of the night, when her diaper is pretty much soaked, the tag has become soaked, too, and the moisture wicks onto her clothes.  I end up having to change her whole outfit, sometimes in the middle of the night if the wetness has woken her up.  I'm going to see if there's a way I can pick out the stitches to get rid of the tag, but it's sewn in pretty firmly.  Other than this fault, I like the fit of the diaper OK, though it tends to get bunched up under her belly like low-rider jeans.  And stuffing the liner into the pocket can be really annoying because sometimes it doesn't want to lie flat since the rise is still snapped at medium height.  Anyway, I only have one of this kind of diaper, and I'm glad I didn't buy more.UPDATE: It's been a few weeks since I removed the tag, but the diaper still wicks moisture along the back elastic, so I'm no longer using it as a nighttime diaper.  I still don't like the way it bunches in front and looks like an abdominal pannus, so she only wears it at home.UPDATE #2 (downgraded from 3 to 2 stars): This diaper started to retain stink badly, and half the time the inner soaker didn't agitate out in the wash. After 14 months of use, I threw it out. I'm only buying all-cotton diapers now, since I've had very little stink issue with them.
