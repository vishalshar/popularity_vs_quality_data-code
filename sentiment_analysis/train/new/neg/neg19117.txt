I have a terrible time trying to rinse my almost two year olds hair during bath time.  We constantly run into issues with the water running into her face and eyes.  I was hoping this would be the solution.  I feel that this will only work on an older child who is able to understand to keep their head tilted back.  Although the soft plastic lip allows for tight connection with the forehead water will still spill into the face if head is not tilted back.  I found the handle design a bit bulky and uncomfortable.
