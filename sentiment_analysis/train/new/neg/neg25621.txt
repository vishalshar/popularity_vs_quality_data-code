I have many of the items in this set, and I was quite disappointed at the size of this. It's about the size of a pear, not nearly normal eggplant size. Especially strange considering the fact that the carrot is carrot-sized, the tomato is tomato-sized, and the mushroom is portobello-sized. (The peas, however, are banana-sized. Go figure).Overall I like the fabric, I like the handmade imperfect aesthetic, and the fair-trade pledge. I just wish there was a little more proportionality to the sizing for some of these items.
