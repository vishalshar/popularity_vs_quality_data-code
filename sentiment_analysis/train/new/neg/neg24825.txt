Of the three stars I have given this hamper, 1 star is for the attractive design and 2 stars are for the really great mesh bag, which does make transporting baby's dirty laundry to the washing machine very easy, but I must let you know that this hamper shrinks when washed! The washing instructions say it is machine washable and it is attached to the wooden frame by velcro so that it can come off for cleaning. I followed the specific instructions on the label, but when it came out of the dryer it was two inches shorter and would not fit on the wooden frame.  Not only that but the fabric was completely worn out.In spite of this, I have ordered another one (this time in pink), because I really love the look and size of this hamper.  I guess I will just have to be more careful about keeping it clean, and I'll hand wash it next time around.
