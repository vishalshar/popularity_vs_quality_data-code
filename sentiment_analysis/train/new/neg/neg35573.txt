Basically this is a nightlight on a timer.  We already own a plug in night light and light timers--I should have just used those rather than spending the money on this.  Even if you don't own these items, you can buy them both on Amazon and still save money vs. the price of this.The blue light is very dim and is barely noticeable when there is any daylight in the room (even with the blinds closed)--at night it works fine.  The chart and story are not high quality and had no impact on our son anyway--he continued to come out of his room for two weeks after we began using this.  The "reward" of a sticker on the chart was less important to him than continuing to do what he wanted to do--leave the room.After two weeks of trying this light with several nightly interruptions of our son coming out of his room, we decided to put a baby gate in front of his door.  This was a much more effective solution to his sleeping problems.  We did, however, continue to use the light in conjunction with the gate.  2 months into this project and he will now usually stay in his room until the light goes off in the morning.So, this might work for you, but you can achieve the same result for less money by purchasing a plug in night light and a timer.
