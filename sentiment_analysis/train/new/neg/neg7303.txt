I actually bought the 2006 version of this stroller in November 2007.  It broke last month (July 2008).  The lever that you push down to open it cracked in half and now the stroller cannot be opened.  I give it a one star for 2 reasons - 1.  It broke and is completely non-functional 2. It is still under warranty and Inglesina customer service has not adjudicated the case or returned any phone calls in 3 weeks so now I am stuck without my everyday double stroller.  Before the stroller broke, I thought it functioned ok.  I would have given it a 3 star.  Good qualities included easy to maneuver, fits through all doors, very compact when folded.  Downsides include very difficult to open (had to push really hard on the lever which is probably why it broke), kind of heavy for an umbrella stroller, seat back was sort of lumpy and looked uncomfortable, the backside of the hood is too short and does not stay buttoned when the seat is fully reclined and actually flaps in my sons face when he is fully reclined, and the seats are very narrow so if you have kids that are above average width, I do not recommend this stroller.  If Inglesina calls back in 1 week, I may change my review, but otherwise, I'll stick with my one star.
