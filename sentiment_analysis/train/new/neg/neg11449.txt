I know I didn't pay much, but I was hoping it would be a little bit more functional.  It is too short (I'm 5'5'', so if I have a problem, that's too short).  Within a couple of months the wheels started working like a bad shopping cart - who knows what direction one of them was going to decide to go.  Also, I found myself regretting not getting a stroller with even a small basket or mesh bag to put small things in.  It is near impossible to push this and hold a couple of small items in the store at the same time.  I found myself putting these items in my baby's lap and then they either get chewed on or thrown at some point.
