I was so excited to receive this booster seat! Out of the box, it was easy to use and to affix to chair. My 15 month old son also enjoyed getting to sit at the table.The 2nd night we had it, I was cleaning it after dinner, and the straps that clip into the crotch buckle COMPLETELY fell apart. Both of them. The stitching just disintegrated and came detached from the seat. I am so thankful that my son was not in it when this happened. Poor quality for such an expensive booster seat.
