I'm so devastated by the damage caused to the rear of my vehicle by the two Safety 1st Baby On Board Magnets I purchased.Not only did the color completely fade on both within a year, to the point that the writing (and whole purpose of the magnets) was ineligible. But the magnets fused themselves to the paint work of my car. I tried everything to remove them, Goo Away, soap, steam, but they would not come off in full. I ended up having to use a tool to get them off my leased vehicle and now will incur the cost of having the paint work fixed.I'm outraged that this is going to cost hundreds of dollars.Buyer beware.
