I read the reviews on this product and was aware that some had stated that the purple-framed mirror gave a distorted image.  The trouble with that is you don't get a choice when ordering.  You get what they give you.  So I took my chances and I got the purple-framed mirror.  The image is distorted.  I was kind of hoping that the other reviewers were being just a little too picky, but nope.  I will say that the image is clear from most angles, but as soon as you place a finger on the mirror it becomes distorted.  This wouldn't be a problem except that most babies as they grow older like to touch their mirror image.  The reason it becomes distorted (in my opinion) is because the mirror is a safety mirror.  It's paper thin.  The construction otherwise seems adequate, although I haven't taken it out of the box yet.  I'm still deciding whether to return it or not.  I like the idea that the mirror is removable so that you can place it in a crib or stroller or wherever.  It just seems kind of expensive to pay for something that you're not completely happy with.  The trouble is that it's hard to find a floor mirror for babies anywhere else!
