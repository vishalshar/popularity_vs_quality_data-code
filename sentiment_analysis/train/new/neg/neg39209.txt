These are OK, but I don't like at all how they are short and I feel like I will have to glue them together to make them more sturdy under her sheets.  At just 2 foot and put together with another 2 foot one, they come apart and are not even under the bed and look horrible.  They should sell these in at least 4 foot long pieces, not two 2 foot long pieces.  I bought the stay put half circle foam bumpers and they are 56 inches long and are much more stable under the sheets and look better also.  I use those on the sides where she is most likely to roll and feel better about it.  I have ended up using these on the bottom of her bed in case she were to wonder down towards the bottom, but most likely she won't and it's a good thing because I don't trust these keeping her in with just 2 foot of foam.
