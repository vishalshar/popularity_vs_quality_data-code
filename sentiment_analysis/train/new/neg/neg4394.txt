Fits our standard size toilet seat perfectly. Is comfortable for my son and easy for him to sit on. Good price.There are two big cons, however. With a boy, this has almost zero splash guard. It might even make it unusable for us. Also, it comes wrapped in plastic, but they've screwed the plastic on, so it's a huge pain to get off or clean fully.
