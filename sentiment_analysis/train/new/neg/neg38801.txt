First I would like to start by saying that I had originally purchased this product two years ago and it has held up very nicely. Recently purchased two more and these new models are lack luster and leave much to be desired. The screws that came with the units are specialty screws  and did not come with an additional screw driver for them. I  had to use the wrong type of screw driver to assemble them.  Secondly the machined holes are not aligned correctly and the screws are raised just enough to grasp which could be hazardous. I do not know if the company has changed manufactures but I do know the quality has dropped significantly. I have included pictures showing the flaws of the product.
