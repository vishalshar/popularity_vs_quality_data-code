I got these for my brand new 55" TV. Got the new TV stand last night and the new TV delivered to my house this morning, after plugging everything in i wanted to get these installed because my three year old cannot be trusted with anything.Well, the screws were all the same length, unfortunatly, the larger screws fit the diameter for my TV but are simply too short. Without the plate, they are just long enough to grab, but the plate itself is simply too thick for the screws to catch. After reading these reviews, now I'm worried that this strap system may just be poor quality and probably should not be listed as a safety device. Come on DreamBaby, can't you do better than this? I had purchased a few dream baby items before my daughter was born and now that I think about it, I don't think any of those were particularly useful either.
