I have such mixed feelings about this cup. On the one hand it's light and easy to handle for the transition of bottle to cup and it's pretty good when it's placed upside down with very little spills BUT on the other hand... the spout area collapses when the my child drinks from it. It happens every time... unscrewing the top to relieve the suction works until he begins drinking from it again. Lastly, the spout cover that came with it didn't quite fit again after I sterilized the product for the first use.I give it 2 out of 5 stars because the collapsible nipple/ spout is very frustrating!
