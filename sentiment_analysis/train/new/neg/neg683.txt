I bought this to use with squooshi reusable pouches for my baby homemade pureed food. The quality is good. And this made it so convenient to feed her right from the pouch. Before buying this, I had to bring the small container from baby bullet and spoon with me when we go out and it always leaked and got everywhere in the bag. Really frustrating. These spoons fit almost exactly but if you scroll all the way, the whole on the spoon won't face the right way, it kinda faces to the side. Now talking about the dispensing the pureed food, it's ok. If the puree is thin enough, no chunky piece in there, it'll come out fine. My pureed food is stage 1 (meaning water like consistency), it comes out fine but from time to time, there's small piece that will clog the whole on the spoon.This happend when I was feeding her in the car, and at that point, there's nothing I can do coz I can't use my finger to unclog it. And I didn't bring an extra spoon so  I got to stop feeding. You best bet if that ever happens to you is for you to use a toothpick to take it out. That's still even a maybe coz the whole is kinda small. Also, the spoon is kinda deep. My baby can never finish everything from the spoon, just the tip (and she's 6 month). So what I did was tipping it forward while slowly squeezing out the food, that made the food go to the tip and my baby can just finish everything. So all in all, I'd prefer something more flat for my baby's age but I still haven't found it yet. This will do in the meantime.
