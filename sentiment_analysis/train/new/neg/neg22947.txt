For what this cost, I'm not all that thrilled. The detachable pillow is great but it ripped literally the first night my 2 year old slept on it and we woke up to a bed full of stuffing. It is very comfortable and we bring it to day care every other week. I'd probably not buy this again. It's pretty cheap quality.
