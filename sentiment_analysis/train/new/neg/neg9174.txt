I was told that it would work with a garden bathtub.  It does go over the "free-standing" faucet but it doesn't stay.  It balances there, easily slides to either side, to the back or off the faucet completely.  My kids (twin 1yo) pull it off easily.  It's cute, they love to play with, but it doesn't serve the purpose I bought it to serve.
