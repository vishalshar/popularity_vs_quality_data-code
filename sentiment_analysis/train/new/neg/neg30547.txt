If it worked, this would be a wonderful toy.  The instruments sound good (a rarity in children's toys) the concept is great, and even the musical arrangements are pretty well done.But, in my case at least, it doesn't work.  Seven of the thirteen instruments sound great, but the other six just sound like static punctuated with Morse code.  Pressing firmly down on the Play button (much more firmly than my three-year-old could possibly manage) helps with some of these instruments (although then, oddly, sometimes the wrong instrument sounds!), but not others.Amazon can't replace (they are almost out of stock, but whether that is temporary or permanent I couldn't say), so we'll be getting a refund.  We're just pleased that we tested it before my son saw it - he would have loved it, and would have been devastated that it didn't work.
