I was certain my son would really love this toy with how many different sensory objects there were. He doesn't really have much interest in it and rarely ever picks it up. It's really cute and there are a lot of different "things" that babies can choose with (teether, textures, rings, mirror, etc) so I am still happy with the purchase.
