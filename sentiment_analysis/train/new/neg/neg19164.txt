The bank is far too small for any kid to use as an actual piggy bank. I can hold it in the palm of my hand, and my hands are not that big. I was hoping for something a bit more on the size of a 10 inch or 12 inch piggy bank, with some volume to it. This is exquisitely crafted and exactly the shape I wanted, but much like the PT Cruiser, it's undersized as hell. (Seriously, if they'd made the PT Cruiser on the chassis of a Chevy Silverado or a Ford F150 truck rather than building it on a Dodge Neon chassis, I would have bought one and loved it and called it George. But instead, they built the vehicular equivalent of a Rott-puggle - something that looks like a Rottweiler, but sized so nobody could take it seriously.)This is pretty much the same experience. If it had been a good sized piggy bank I would have happily paid more for it, but this could hold perhaps $15 in change, if you're lucky. I was hoping for something on the order or magnitude of my grandfather's spare change jar, which held nearly $500 and had enough room that a silver dollar wouldn't get stuck in the hole coming out.
