I was so excited to try these, but my son won't take them. I thought since I was breastfeeding he'd like that these flex like a breast when sucked, but he doesn't care about that at all. The size and shape of the nipple deems a bit odd to me, and I suspect it's what he doesn't like. The only pacifier he'll take is the soothie. Save yourself some money and buy a pack of those. If your baby doesn't like them, then start trying out others. I wish I'd done that before I'd spent $7 on these.
