OK, we purchased this because it was cheap, and we thought, &quot;Hey! It can't be too bad!&quot; WRONG! It does not cover the entire shopping cart area where baby sits, and the toys dangle on the outside so baby can't even play with them. We ended up purchasing a Floppy Seat; we love it! Seriously, DO NOT buy this. You will end up hating it, and you will buy something else, so in the end, you are NOT saving money. I hate Infantino products. I have bought two, and both of them are totally worthless.
