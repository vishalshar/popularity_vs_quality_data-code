I really wanted to like this baby toy--chemical free, wood, and my baby did enjoyed chewing on it right away. However, the elastic that holds the colorful wood pieces together repeatedly separated enough while he was playing with it to catch and pinch his little fingers and made him cry--that seems like a major negative to a baby toy. I would definitely not buy this one--toys that make babies cry are no fun at all.
