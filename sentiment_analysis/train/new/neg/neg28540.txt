It works as a pillow, but feel like it's a bit lumpy maybe? It's not uniform thickness throughout with some thinner spots. My 2.5 yr old doesn't need much in the way of thickness so it's fine. We've had a few potty training accidents on it (don't ask!) and have had to wash it several times. We wash but let it air dry and seems okay. I'm not much of a sewer, but can sew square lines. I went to the fabric store and bought cheap fabric to make the pillow cases as the others seem way to expensive!
