Bought 2 of these (for the 9 month old twin grandchildren) so they have something a little more secure to sleep in when they spend the night. Didn't want to spend a lot of money since I have to buy 2 of everything but I still wanted something with a little quality to it since they'll be spending a lot of weekends at grandma & grandpa's!These seemed to be OK at first but the 3rd time these were set up, the latch inside one of the the long sides broke on 1 of them. Seems to be only a thinner spring that holds the latch in place & acts as the release mechanism. Once this broke, I could no longer lock the bar into place. Tried to exchange it but they were out of stock on this so I ended up spending the $20.00 more for a Graco Pack-n-Play. I'm really glad I did because the quality is much higher on the Pack-n-Play from the thickness of the nylon material to the latching mechanism and the padding in the mat. Since I'm trying to get something that will last until the twins are at least 2 (if not a little longer), I returned the 2nd one as well & got a 2nd Pack-n-Play.For something that you wont be using EVERY weekend, this will probably work well for you. I really think the one that broke just had a defective spring since the other one still seemed to be working fine.
