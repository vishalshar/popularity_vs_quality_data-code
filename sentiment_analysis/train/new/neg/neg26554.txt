I bought one of these bras in the weeks leading up to my return to work but mistakenly ordered the wrong size. I ordered a second bra in the next size up so I would have the correct size. I have used the larger bra, rather uneventfully, for about a month now. Until the wee hours of this morning.Many have complained that the material in this bra stretches out, but I hadn't experienced that until this morning. I am an exclusive pumper that relies on pumped milk to feed my little one. I set my alarm for 3 am, hooked everything up, and kicked back to watch some infomercials while I pumped. About 15 minutes into my pumping session, I felt something run down my side. I reached down and the entire bra was soaked. Apparently as gravity was doing its thing, the bra had stretched out so much that the flanges were no longer being held snugly against my chest. The milk was flowing backwards out of the flanges instead.To say I was miffed is an understatement, but about 40 minutes into pumping, my baby decided to wake up hungry, which she seldom does anymore. Unfortunately, since I'd lost about an ounce of milk due to this bras malfunction, I was left trying to console my LO for the next 20 minutes as I tried to pump enough to feed her.Needless to say, I will be looking for a more supportive product on a go forward basis. When you're barely producing enough to keep up with baby's demand, every ounce matters.
