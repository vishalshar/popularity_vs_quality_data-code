We started with Mobi's top of the line $500+ model.  Its antenna broke after a few months, and the whole unit died in about 9 months. Spending another $500 to replace it was untenable. But we had mounted the camera bracket to the wall, and didn't want to have to drill new holes, so we bought another Mobi - this unit - that we thought had the same mounting. It turns out the mounting was the same, but had to be installed 180-degrees rotated, so we had to re-drill anyway. Then, after about 6 months, this replacement unit stopped charging. The problem is with the plug that goes into the monitor - it won't actually connect the electric current unless you hold the cord at a pitched angle. We complained to Amazon, who kindly send us a replacement. That unit is now 4.5 months old, and as of yesterday, it too has stopped charging. Who builds a product like this?!?!?  Unless you are planning to buy a new monitor every 4-5 months, skip this brand.
