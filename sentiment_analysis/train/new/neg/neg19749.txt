I agree not for carseats!  My newborn son's head is not secure in the headrest.  I think it should be thicker so that the head is secure in the headrest.  When the car moves, his head pops out of the headrest and he ends up leaning forward or to the side, which defeats the purpose of this headrest.  I do recommend using this on the swing because the swing doesn't move as much as a car.
