We are on our THIRD Pippy monkey, all in one year. I bought one of these for my son when he was about 9 months old, and he was in love. Instantly. He brought it with him everywhere and couldn't sleep without it. Because it was well loved, I had to wash it in the first week, and after washing, I noticed that the foot pads were starting to fray and the seams were coming undone. I handstitched them up, and ordered another as a backup (seriously, the kid couldn't be without it). We used the "backup" when the primary monkey needed washing, etc. Both had many seams coming undone, with giant holes. I used my sewing machine to stich them back up, but more holes would appear. The edges of the satin underneath are not properly reinforced, and they fray and come undone. We purchased a third monkey for Christmas (less than 2 months ago) and BEFORE wrapping it, I zig zag stitched the paw pads. He has been washed about 4 times since, and the side seams (where the satin meets his top fur) has about 3 holes in it. I am so bummed that these don't hold up for regular use, but my son loves them so much I will just have to keep reinforcing him. For such a pricey "blanket", and something that clearly needs to be washed regularly (what baby doesn't need his blanket washed regularly) it should hold up MUCH better.
