We got this for our UppaBaby Vista stroller without doing much research, unfortunately.  There is a notch on the outside of either side of the stroller bar that is made for this cup holder, and since we definitely needed some sort of beverage holder for the stroller, I gave this one a shot.I can't recommend this product for a few reasons:1) Size - You can only install this cup holder in two pre-determined places on the stroller - the right or left side, facing out.  Unfortunately this makes an already wide stroller about 5 inches wider, making it easy to catch this cup holder on door frames, clothing, and people.  Since the break in the upper ring is on the side of the cup holder, you don't just knock it into a door frame, the flexible part of the clear plastic ring catches on the door frame, and if you're not careful, it will break off.2) Flimsy plastic - The prongs inside the cup holder are designed to hug the cup you insert, and they do accomplish what they set out to do.  However if you put anything else in the bin (as you are inevitably going to do - ziplock snack bags, small toys, keys, etc.), upon removal these things will catch on the prongs, and in my experience they snap fairly easily.3) Drinks spill easily - This is not just a problem with this particular cup holder, but it is firmly affixed to the frame of the stroller, with no give, so if you are strolling on a bumpy sidewalk, cobblestones, or curbs (which is presumably why you bought a stroller like this in the first place), drinks that are not fully sealed (including coffee cups with small nozzles) will spill all over the place, including in the storage basket below.I know there is a newer version of this same cupholder, but the design is the same so I don't see that any of my above issues have been resolved.So, what to get instead?  I recently (long overdue) replaced this with the Britax Stroller Organizer and it is really an excellent product.  It has two cup holders (soft sided and lightly insulated), and a center pocket for other items - phone, etc.  Also, the velcro attachment allows it to move with the terrain so I have never had a drink spill.  Also, you can remove it easily and install it on another stroller if you need to (I have a MacLaren Quest and it fits it well).
