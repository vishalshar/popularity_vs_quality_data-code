I find this design to be really cute. The fabric is pretty thin, so if your boppy pillow has a design on it already, you'll probably be able to see it through the cover. I'm not crazy about the zipper being in the middle of the pillow, but I knew that was the case when I bought it and it doesn't really hurt anything. Overall, I do like this cover.
