I just purchased this for my 7 month old son.  I was looking for a new interactive toy for him as his hand dexterity has improved so much in the last month.  I think it's a decent toy but isn't that exciting and doesn't hold his interest for that long.  He is still too small to be able to pick it up and turn it to another side so I have to watch him and see when he gets tired of one side of the toy.  It's decent for the price.  Of note, do not get this toy wet.  I made the mistake of rinsing it in the sink before he started chewing on it (I didn't submerge it as it says on the box) and water got into the three clear tubes; now the little balls don't fall freely and get stuck because of the moisture.
