The bib was reversible but does not have the food catcher on the reverse side.  The second bib was not like the one pictured and did not think the quality of the plastic  was as good as the bibs I bought my children.  This was bought for my great-granddaughter to use when  she visits.  Not sure if it will hold up to daily use.
