At first, I thought this would be a great item for my 5 month old. When I got it, it looked cute, so I put it down in our living room, thrilled to have a place for the baby to learn to crawl. After having it for a few weeks, I can say, I would not buy this again. The pieces fit loosely together and come apart ALL.THE.TIME. I am constantly putting the pieces down. My husband and I TRIP OVER THEM while carrying the baby so much, I've finally decided tonight that it is simply hazardous. I would have returned this mat, but one of the pieces came loose and was sucked up into our vacuum cleaner and a corner of it tore. My good friend and my in-laws have a mat very similar to this, but neither of them have this issue. I am very sorry I spent the money on this. I will try to update this with pictures tomorrow before I remove it from my living room.
