Ages 3-12 months only and here's why: I bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months old. We had to supervisor and guide her on usage for about 1 month before we were secure she understood not to poke her eye with it. For 12 solid months it has been a life saver. This soother was amazing...until her 1st molars came in. She chewed it to shreds in seconds. I bought another one and within minutes it was shredded again. I looked at the packaging and it reads 3-12 months. Ahhhhhhh...that was not mentioned online. It all makes sense now. So, bottom line-excellent product for pre-molar teething. After that, take it away. I just ordered another brand on silicone teething sticks with the hope they will be more durable. In theory, it's a great product. Initially, it does the job. But, it just isn't durable enough to last through the entire teething phase. I wish this had been advertised when I made my recent replacement purchase. Ten bucks down the toilet.
