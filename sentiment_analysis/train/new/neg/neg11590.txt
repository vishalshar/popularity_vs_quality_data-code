I bought these just as a cheap insert. I didn't expect to be the greatest since they were so cheap, but I did want them more as an extra layer of absorbency. These work just fine. I think when I am done using these for baby I could use them as a mama cloth for light days. The only issue I have noticed is the corners curl slightly on some of these. No big deal since I use these between layers and can force them to be flat. For the price these are an ok product. I know there is probably much better, but they will cost more. You get what you pay for. This product does it's job okay enough, especially if on a budget.
