My son really loves rubber duckies and other toys that you can squeeze water into and squirt water out, but they always build up nasty gunk inside and I end up having to toss them out. This seemed like a great fix for that problem, so I was really excited to have him try them out. It took me a couple minutes just to get the cat together (the dolphin comes already together, but the cat doesn't) - it was not easy and I honesty almost gave up. Once he got them in the tub, we were disappointed with how difficult they are to squirt water out of - you have to hold them at just the right angle (namely, the hole pointing down). Great idea, but not a great product.Update:They do get easier to take apart and put back together after a couple of times. However, they are still rather stiff and don't squirt easily enough for my 3 year old.
