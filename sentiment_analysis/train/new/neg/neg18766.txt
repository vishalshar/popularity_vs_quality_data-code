Documentation on this seat reflects the high safety standards it meets, so I won't comment on that. I like the ease of installation of the base, and how easy this seat is to use over all. It looks great and I love the Adventure color. But I have a few gripes:- The fabric simply isn't breathable. Baby gets hot. Many people have had this issue. I ended up removing the infant body insert for my 5-week old, and leaving the head support in. This seems to have helped a lot.- Hate that I need two hands to unlock/move the handle. It's a pain.- The location of the release button, to remove the seat from the base, is ridiculous. If you have a vehicle in which the seat buts up against the back of the car's front seat, the release button can be a pain to get to.- The canopy is USELESS. It simply doesn't offer enough coverage and it's pretty much a joke.Seat is high quality, but for $170 or so I am just not 100% pleased with ease of use. Chicco can't help that some babies run hot, but the fabric isn't something I'd want to sit in for any length of time, and the other issues are ease-of-use complaints.
