I ordered 2 of these blankets...one in lavender and on in pink. The lavender arrived in a solid lavender as shown in the picture, however the pink blanket arrived several shades of pink with elephants on it. It's not terrible, but it's not what is being advertised in these photos. Buyer beware if your set on a solid colored blanket...if you're indifferent like myself it's still not a bad looking blanket.
