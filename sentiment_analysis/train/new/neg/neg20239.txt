For the price it could be a bit more detailed. The green card holder only comes with one card (A cardboard Bunny photo) it'd be better if it were a "teething Type" card with back to back photo's of animals. The star that plays music lists it as "motion" however the only way for it to be motioned is to hit the side of the "gym." And it only goes through one song regardless of whether it's on motion or On..and then you have to push on one of the stars to play the song. It'd be much more worth it if it played more songs, again strictly due to the price of this item. overall it's not bad, but Had I known these things prior to purchasing it, I'd have either waited for a coupon for this item, or bought something better. In addition the size of the gym seems small. One plus side is the little green kidney bean pillow is great for propping up baby for belly time..not unattended of course.
