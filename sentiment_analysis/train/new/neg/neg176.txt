Pro..  It works about as well as the regular flat safety plugs.Cons.. Its fancy design does not seem to really serve a function, it is not much easier to remove than the flat kind.  The big con is how it looks, not to me but to our toddler.  The whole reason for a safety plug is to keep the kids out of the socket, but this one seems to attract the attention of our toddler, it looks interesting, looks like something to play with. We have some of these up and quite a few of the flat ones. He totally ignores the sockets with the flat plugs but tries like crazy to pull these fancy ones off the wall.  I will be picking up some more flat plugs this week and just use them.
