Bought it in white and the candle itself it is a good size and height. I think the thing I dislike the most is that the part of the candle with the age and pictures is actually a STICKER, makes the whole thing turn into something cheap looking! Some may say "well what did you think it was?"...Well I've had many candles before with decorative pictures and such and they weren't stickers! The candle is nice but the whole sticker thing is ridiculous to me. So after you burn down to the next age, you have to cut the sticker down because its just left there sticking up with no candle behind it anymore. At the time I bought this I didn't see any reviews letting me know it was a sticker, maybe I missed one because I never would have figured that was what the designs were on. So, oh, well, you've been warned....if you're okay with that then this is the candle for you! I'm a little bummed because I dropped $20 on this thing and my daughter will be stuck with it for 21 more years, not really worth spending this kind of money trying out a different one, they all have their faults of some sort from the reviews I've read.
