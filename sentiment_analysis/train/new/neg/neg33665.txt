After purchasing the fisher price " rainforest " high chair I wanted to buy a second high chair that wasn't the exact same color and print. I assumed this one was the exact same but sadly it is not. The rainforest one is way easier to clean and remove the straps. I will include a photo to show you. It seems the rainforest model was better thought out then this. Aside from how the straps and cushions go on its the identical high chair. Given the choice I would have purchased the rainforest model again.
