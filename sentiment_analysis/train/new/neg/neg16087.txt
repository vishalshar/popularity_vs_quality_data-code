I ordered 3 packs of cloth wipes to compare - grovia, imsy vimsy, and osocozy. The grovia, by far were the nicest wipes and the most economical. These wipes are cheap, thin, and flimsy. Grovia is thick and absorbent, perfect for wiping messy bums. Don't waste your time and money here...go buy the grovia ones.
