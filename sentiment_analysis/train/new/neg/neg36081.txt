I bought these cards for my Mom who has ARMD.  I also bought a brand that uses 4 different colors so that no two suits are the same color.  My Mom likes the other deck better because she can differenciate the suits better, but her friends prefer this deck.  I'm assuming that her friends like this deck because it is more traditional and is what they are use to.  They all like the fact that the letters are so big though.
