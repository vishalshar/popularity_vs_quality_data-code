This stroller is a huge waste of money!  The wheels repeatedly get stuck sideways, particularly on surfaces with less traction and I end up having to forcefully push the stroller on wheels that aren't spinning.  (Dangerous, especially when in crowded NYC locations or getting off subway, when I can't safely bend down and try to manually straighten them out, which is absurd to have to do anyway!)  I got a cheaper umbrella stroller for half the price at Sears with wheels that spin beautifully, and would recommend you do the same!  (Also, the visor came all bent up and the sling seat tore after only 3 months.)
