I purchased this set because I wanted the labeling lids and extra bottles. It was cheaper to purchase this whole package than to purchase only the labeling lids. The extra storage bags, storage guidelines magnet and the storage bin were a nice bonus but not really necessary. I don't see much use for the small tubes unless you need a very accurate volume measure. The labeling lids are WAY more convenient than having to write with tape (or whatever method you choose) on every bottle. This would be a very nice gift for an expectant mother who is planning to breastfeed.
