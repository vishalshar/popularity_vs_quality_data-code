I thought I would love having one of these but I rarely use it. I wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I have an anaconda in the bed with me and end up throwing it out of the bed. If you are like me, I have to change positions A LOT through out the night and the pillow is not easy to move. I prefer just using a regular bed pillow between my legs and one by my belly to support the weight. If I had it to do over again I might try the snuggle mini instead. This thing is just to big!
