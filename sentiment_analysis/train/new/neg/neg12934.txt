That little aqua snap-lock top shown in ALL the photos is not actually part of the product (it must belong to the pack of wipes in the bag). It's deceiving, because it certainly looks like that is part of the product; the photos even show it overlapping the oval opening seam. So basically, this is a fashion bag to sling over your stroller; not a bag that will actually keep wipes moist. Considering you'll be traveling with either a diaper clutch or a diaper bag (because this does not have room for diapers), I see no point in a separate wipes bag to sling over your stroller. On second thought, it might be useful if you have a toddler whose face/hands often need wiping. It just didn't live up to my expectations.
