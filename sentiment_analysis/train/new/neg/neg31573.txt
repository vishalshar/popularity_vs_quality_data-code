I cannot believe this seat has so many great ratings - I have no idea why?? I have had my carrot cake Cocorro for 10 months now and the seat has been malfunctioning for half of them. Now it is unusable and I dread dealing with customer service based on what so many others have said. First the seat fabric stained and piled right off the bat - and this is from very light use - we live in CA where we walk at all times except for long car trips. From my daughter rubbing her legs back and forth in the seat, the fabric is basically shredded. The stains never seem to come out and I have washed the cover several times. As for the buckle - this is really my problem. The part that clicks the straps together at the bottom is impossible. It seems like the spring is broken and we either have to keep trying to buckle or we have to mess with the buckle part by pushing down on the latch part several times until the spring does something and it buckles. I have seen other reviews complaining about both of these things so maybe stay away from the carrot cake. I have also not seen a single good review on the customer service so I, like others, am afraid I will be getting a new seat with this one a total waste of money. I checked out the warranty and just an fyi, read it before purchasing so you know that 1. you need to buy from authorized dealer, 2. need to register it, 3. need original box, 4. cost of shipping is on you, 5. car seat is not covered unless you can prove it is their fault and not yours, 6. the phone service won't get you anywhere so you better email, 7. they will not notify customers of recalls so you will not be informed by going with this company - just checkout the Facebook complaints to learn more
