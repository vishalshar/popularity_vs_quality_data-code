Worst product ever !!! Do not buy unless you want to kill your baby  I ouch used this to keep my grandson away from the top of the stairway in stalled it according to the instructions and on his first try he pushed it over and went down the steps on his head , the plastic hardware and overall cheap shotty construction of this product will not allow enough tension to make for  safe secure use anywhere !!  And my grandson was your test dummy Thanks Amazon!!!  Tim B .
