I want to love this more, but it has a few downsides.*You can't skip songs- all the "Music" is one button and the other noises are separate buttons. This wouldn't matter much, but I generally start out with the star projection on and when I have to turn that part off but flip to get music only, it starts over / is less seamless (read on).* For some reason, when it's on music only, it flashes a burst of light between songs. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't but it sure sucks when it does it when I've already left the room (see above, I have to turn off and on again and start the same song again, which my daughter notices).* The buttons-- I thought, how bad can they be? Well, it really is hard to tell if it's registered that you've pressed them, which matters for the time settings. It seems to wake my daughter up if it stops too soon so I like being certain the 60 minute button is pressed.* The green button on top- way too sensitive. I use a burp cloth to cover the damn thing (see burst of light between songs above) and sometimes the weight of it turns it off. Cue starting the music alllll over again.The sounds are super nice. Way better than the crappy soother we had before this. And my daughter (17 mos) loves the stars and glowing lights (too much for us to let her use it in the crib- it keeps her awake). She also loves the firefly images. But overall, there are some flaws that make it annoying. It's a hassle to return so we'll keep it, but I wouldn't buy again.
