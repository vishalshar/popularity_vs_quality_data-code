I have not yet filled it with milk.  I did the test with water.  It did not leak no matter how much I shook or squeezed it.  It stands on the base, and pours out pretty good from the spout corner.  The materials feels like it will hold up well, it feels a bit thicker than other brand.My concern is that the bags are not sealed before you use them.  And the pouch in which all 25 bags are stored is not sealed either.  As such, there is no guarantee that each of the bags is sanitary before you put milk in it.  On the contrary, the other brands bags are sealed before use -- the outer bag is sealed, you have to tear the strip to open it; and each of the 25 bags are sealed - you have to tear the strip on the top before you can open and put milk in it.  Bottom line, I will use the 25 bags that I bought, but -- for a fraction of the cost per bag, I would rather continue using the other brand.
