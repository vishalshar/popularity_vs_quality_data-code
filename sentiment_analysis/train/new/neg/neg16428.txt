My sister bought me a pack of these for when I watched her son at my house (pre-baby for me.)  When it came time for me to cover them for my own child, I went against the reviews because I liked the ease of getting them out. I continued to cover all the outlets with these covers because I didn't think my daughter would be crafty enough to take them out. Well, I was mistaken!  She has been taking them out for the past few months (she is now almost 17-months) and now that she is fully transitioned into walking from crawling it is 100x worse.  Once she gets them out she puts them in her mouth. One reviewer commented on the newness of the outlets, but I too have new outlets and find it has no bearing on the ease in which these come out.
