The first time we used this it didn't work. We put the batteries in and the on off button didn't work. If you only closed the battery cover part way, it would automatically turn on. And to turn it off, you had to take of the battery cover. We tried it this way. The 2nd time we used it, the mixer part fell out. We thought we got it back in, but the 3rd time we used it, it fell off again. Trying to get it out of the bottle was so difficult that the partially on battery cover fell off and broke. We had to throw it away after only 3 miserable uses. I would NOT buy this and I would NOT recommend anyone waster their money. Currently looking for something better
