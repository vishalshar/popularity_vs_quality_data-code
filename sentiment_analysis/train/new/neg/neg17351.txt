I'm a big fan of Bumbo products(and its goodwill cause: [...]), but the Bumbo toilet trainer doesn't seem to be readily available outside the UK currently. (Though I did do some research and found out from the distributor it may be coming back to the US mid Jan 2012, possibly through Toys R US and J&R.com for approx $35)Anyway that being said I just wanted to get an "in the meantime" potty. Boring story short, my 9mo old was using the toilet (with me sitting behind her) just fine for the last few months and mysteriously stopped for the last 3 weeks. I suspected it may have been a comfort issue/growth spurt and she wasn't sitting well/feeling comfortable on the toilet anymore. Our new Nuby potty seat, which does fit our round toilet seat exactly, did the trick. Back to our normally scheduled programming!PROs:CheapWorks for teeny baby bottomsCONs:Can't pick color/ Got random ugly color via Amazon (though judging by the shade of pink we got, likely all the colors are ugly)Slightly inconvenient to put on/offbut still worth the purchase to be able to flush the goods!!(but would rather get the soft molded Bumbo were it available for easier on/off and more comfy for babe's bottom)
