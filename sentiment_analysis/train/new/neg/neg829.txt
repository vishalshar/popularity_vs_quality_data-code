i have to agree with above posters. i bought this cup holder for our bugaboo bee in 8/2014. it was completely broken six months later.A cup holder should be standard on an $600 stroller....right? when the inside "pegs" snapped off. It seems the plastic should be made of a more flexible material rather than the rigid plastic. However, a brilliant move by the Bugaboo company to make people have to buy a new cupholder every 5 or 6 moths. Still looking for a good cup holder.
