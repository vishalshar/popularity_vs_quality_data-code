I love this hat but it is not for ages 4-18 months as indicated so I gave it a three star rating.  It fits snug on my 8 month old so she won't be able to use it for long. Btw, my child has average size head.Despite the cons, it is the most adorable little hat.  I love the colors. The extra stuff it come with is useless and not for babies/toddles, especially since this won't  even fit as they grow. I would not put pins in a baby's hat- not safe!Great for younger babies.  But if you're looking  for something  a little larger for 12 months to toddler, I recommend the crochet owl hat by Bitty Bows BoutiqueUpdate 11/25/13I've been using the hat for a bit longer and it appears the material stretched a bit after a couple washes.  It's not as snug so my little one will wear it a bit longer.  However, I still wouldn't recommend it for a child over 12 months since you will not get much wear out of it.
