My 22 month old child can open this in 12 seconds or less. We have had the item for about a year or so, but we got it well before it would've been an issue. Once he started walking, we'd keep seeing him next to the open cabinet. We kept thinking it was our fault for not being careful enough with locking it properly. So, this is really a hazard, because you believe the safety device is working, which sometimes is worse than not even having it at all. It takes so long to figure out what's going on, because the way children get around such devices does not involve the same techniques adults use. So, you know what it is *you* do to open the cabinet and you figure the kid can't do that so you're safe. Nope.I have a video which I'm attempting to post.Amazon keeps rejecting my submission of this review, and I'm following all the guidelines, but I can't make the video longer than it is, so I'm not sure what's going on here.
