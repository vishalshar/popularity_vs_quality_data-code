This was pretty pointless for me. Warming the pads would take a while since you have to use water and I never had the need for cold pads (except on my actual nipples which these don't cover). The little thing to keep track of which breast is pointless because there's an app for that! Same with the little book...I just used the BabyConnect app for all that. I also never had an issue with leaking really so the pads never got used. Basically I didn't end up using any of this! It's a nice idea but spend the money on an app and then see if you even need cooling/heating first. You can always just use a warm washcloth for heating!
