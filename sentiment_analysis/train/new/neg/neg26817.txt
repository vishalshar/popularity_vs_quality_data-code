For just a few bucks more, the Evenflo has armrests that can be put up. This is helpful if you have an independent child who insists on seating & belting themselves - those armrests can get in the way during the climbing process and make it harder for them to buckle the seatbelt. I didn't realize how important that was until I bought this booster.On the plus side, this chair seems comfortable and well-proportioned. Quality is decent and cupholders are always useful.
