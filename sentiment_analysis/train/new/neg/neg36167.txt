I am telling you; don't buy this toy unless you want to waste your money. I bought this toy for my son--whom was 6 months at the time and I was VERY disappointed.This toy has its good qualities and bad qualities.The Good Points:This toy is supposed to be attached to the stroller for your child to play with.(great if you travel a lot and need your baby to be entertained) The big bug in the middle serves as a snack cup that your child can open up itself. There are other toys that your child can play with, such as a material butterfly, and a butterfly with rings that you can place up or down and a bug with leave that spins. The colorful toys do attract your attention and is safe to play with.The Bad Points:The manner in which you place the bar on the stroller is horrible. I used the directions and the bar did not attach properly and it fell off the stroller in the street. It also can be dangerous because if this toy is not attached properly, your child may decide to pick it up to swing with--which they can hurt themselves or others around them. Another bad point it, the snack cup fell apart. There is no "snap" feature on this cup, nor will it properly hold anything in the cup because inside of the cup is supposed to be the securing device--that does not work. This idea of the stroller bar was not executed properly and the material for the snack cup is cheap. Truly a disappointment since Sassy is a name brand item. Well known for its quality in other items I have purchased from this company.So in conclusion, my son is now 10 months old and plays with this on the floor in our living room. Not on the stroller, that it was made for. It is usually in the price range of 14-19 dollars, but honestly it is not worth it. It was poorly made and you cannot secure it properly.It was a waste of money. Look for other stroller bars to play with.
