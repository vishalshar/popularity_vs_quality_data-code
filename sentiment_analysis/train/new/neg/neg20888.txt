I looked a lots of different walkers in stores and online trying to find one for my 4 month old. The biggest problem I had was finding one that was short enough my son could stand in, this walker worked great once we took the wheels and bumpers of the bottom so that it is stationary. The only thing I really dislike about the walker is that two of the wheels swivel and two only go one direction, I much preferred the older style in which kids could make it go any direction, I'm sure a lot of this has to do with saftey but some of us don't have stairs to worry about.
