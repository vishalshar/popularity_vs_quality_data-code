We've used Britax for going on 6 years with my oldest, so im very familiar with their products. we recently purchased this seat in hopes to continue our daughter being safe In the safest car seat known! I've had an issue with my youngest who's 11months old, and still rear faced, eating and chewing the gray chest piece that's attached to the harness. This morning i found a chunk of the rubber in her neck!!!! Come on Britax, y'all are supposed to be better than that! So what do I do if my daughter, who is rear faced, is chewing chewing chewing and chews off a piece, meanwhile I'm going 60+mph down the interstate, and starts to choke, not to mention there's no telling what the rubber is made of! Very disappointed with Britax and this purchase, this seat costs way to much for these things to be happening!
