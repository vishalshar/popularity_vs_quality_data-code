My 5 month old is a heavy drooler, as he just started solids last month.  He would go through 2 regular bibs a day with the amount of slobber that was coming out of his mouth.  These bibs just don't fit him well; granite he is 20 pounds at 5 months :) I feel as though they are too tight around the neck and when they bunch up, they go over his chin and creep up towards his mouth.....that makes me nervous.  In order for the bibs to lay perfectly on baby, like in the pictures...he can't move.  Which is impossible, because this kid moves all the time!The fabric is incredibly absorbent and super soft on the front.  The fabric on the back of the bib is like a windbreaker jacket.  I love the fact that it has snaps and not velcro, because velcro can get really scratchy.  If I can find snap extenders I will buy them and extend the bib a little more, so they can be used.
