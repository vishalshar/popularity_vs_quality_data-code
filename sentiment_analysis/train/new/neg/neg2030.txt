These are the best quality I've seen in a diaper cover. They are roomy, and work best on older and heavier babies. I bought the first cover for my granddaughter, but did not use it till she was 1 1/2, because she is skinny and the pad folded prefold shifted too much. Now it is great for nap time with a padded prefold and booster. I use these on my grandson with a pad folded flat, now that he eats solids and poops more solid. It works great-so easy. 4 of these and a dozen flats are my main stash, at a very reasonable cost.
