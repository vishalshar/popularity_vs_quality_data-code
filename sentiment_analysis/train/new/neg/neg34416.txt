My wife and I bought Grovia after reading all the positive reviews. They were purchased in 2013 for our son, who died in childbirth. They were obviously never worn. We always planned on having another child, and put them in a climate control environment--no humidity or excessive heat. In 2016, we welcomed our second child and were thankful we hung on to the Grovia diapers...until we put them on her. After ONE use, the elastic had worn out. One. That's it! I emailed Grovia, and have to admit they have lightening fast response times--unfortunately, they aren't much help. I figured they'd want to help out and replace the shell because it obviously was a bad diaper. Nope. They sent me sewing instructions. I kid you not: sewing instructions! They admitted that this is something that happens to their diaper shells (they claim it's rare), but they couldn't offer a replacement because it had been longer than a year. If you only want to use Grovia for a year and don't plan on using it after that for any other future child, then you might like Grovia. If, however, you are the kind of parent that wants to buy a diaper shell that lasts without having to learn how to sew then there are plenty of other options. I understand that heavy use would make the elastic wear out over time, and it makes sense to have a warranty that helps cover this--but elastic from a well cared for diaper shell should not wear out after one use.
