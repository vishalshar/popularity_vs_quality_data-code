I purchased this bottle for my breast fed baby thinking it would be a great fit (looks like a breast, right?). I couldn't have been more wrong. The way babies nurse don't work this style of bottle - they can't get their entire mouth over the "fleshy" part - So they only drink from the tiny nipple with their mouths pursed. This trains them incorrectly and then they will suckle inefficiently when breast feeding. In short, if you want to breast feed, don't use this bottle. The warmer was a great idea, but not practical.
