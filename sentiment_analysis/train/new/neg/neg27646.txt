I bought the Juno Blu Ventana bag along with the pump case to carry my Medela advanced to work and back. First, the pump case I received is not as pictured. The "B" emblem is mounted on the upper left hand corner of the case rather than the lower Right as pictured and the B is upside down. I know this is a minor detail, but it drives me nuts especially considering the $30 I spent on this case. The only reason I bought it was because I wanted my pump to be secure in the larger bag, and the pump case DOES have the Velcro needed to secure the Medela Advanced pump. It would have been nice if the Velcro was inside the Ventana bag on its own to save on weight and costs. I realize many women may not use the same pump, but the Velcro could be covered so it could be used optionally, and add much less than $27 to the cost of the bag. I suppose you can carry the pump bag around by its self, yet with out any other storage, I wonder how practical that would be. At any rate, I don't love this case, but since it is worlds better than the mustard yellow my pump came in, I guess it is ok.
