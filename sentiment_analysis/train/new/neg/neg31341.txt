I have owned Funtainers in the past and have never had a problem with them.  Unfortunately, they have changed the design and like many products that do this...the original was much much better.  This thing leaks EVERYWHERE!!!!  Even with the lid on and it falls on it's side for more than a minute....the entire cup leakes out.  It's a mess and also the graphic comes off after washing!  I've had these less than 6 months and the graphics are all faded.  I hate this cup....and to make matters worse, I bought two :(  Even washing by hand only couldn't make this cup work.  BOO!  Do NOT buy this.
