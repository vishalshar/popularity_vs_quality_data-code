Color was lighter and with a tan undertone, which unfortunately didn't match what we needed it for.Size was too small for my 3-year old. When I measured him, he was exactly between 21-22" but when I put it on him, he had to wear his pants over his belly button in order to get the fit right. Wish the description was more specific on age rage for it.The quality was as expected for the price range, I just wish the description of the product was a bit more helpful.
