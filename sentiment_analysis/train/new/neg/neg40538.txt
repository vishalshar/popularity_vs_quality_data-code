I was super excited for this diaper and I'm really disappointed. I'll start by stating that I adore my Babykicks Joey Bunz Premium Hemp Inserts and that is what led me to purchase this diaper. There isn't anything about the diaper that I like and I'll break down why here. First, the beautiful and soft bamboo liner is pointless because it can't be next to my baby's skin. Bamboo is super absorbent, but it doesn't wick, so it gets soaking wet. To remedy this, they include a ridiculously thin fleece liner that you need to place between baby and bamboo. This sucks for a variety of reasons: it's annoying to get it in place, it is an extra step, and it gets lost in the wash since it is so thin. Second, the design to stuff the diaper in front sounds good but there are issues keeping that closed once my kid starts walking around. Third, the rise snaps are in a spot that rub against baby's thighs. Fourth, the diaper cover takes so long to dry (because the bamboo is part of it) that I have to put it in the dryer (which I never do with my covers) which means the PUL will likely start to break down faster than my other diapers.I learned a really important lesson here: don's mess with what works. My go-to diaper is plain old bulky Bum Genius 4.0, and they do the job better than any other diaper I've tried. They don't have a lot of cute prints or colorful snaps, but they work. Stuff them with Babykicks Joeybunz and you've got an awesome diaper!
