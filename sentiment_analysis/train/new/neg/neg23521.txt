I was excited about this carseat because of the low price and great reviews, but unfortunately I had to return it because it did not fit securely in the backseat of my husband's Pontiac G6. We followed the directions exactly for rear-facing installation using the LATCH system. After both my husband and I tightened it as best we could, there was still a 3 inch side-to-side movement. The manual says only an inch is an acceptable amount of movement. We tried using a rolled up towel under it for better stabilization, but no luck. I'm sure this is a great carseat as long as it fits securely in your car.
