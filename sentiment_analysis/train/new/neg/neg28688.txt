The design and size of this stroller organizer are great.  I looked at a few different options before purchasing a caddy for my Uppababy Vista, and this appeared to be the best combo of size/functionality/price.  I like that the middle compartment closes with a magnet instead of velcro, so the baby doesn't get disturbed by the sound of velcro ripping open.  I would have rated this as 4 or 5 stars had I submitted by review earlier, but just this weekend -- after less than 9 months of use -- the right side strap ripped completely off of the organizer.  Since I don't take this off and put it back on too frequently, I would expect this to last longer.  This is the reason why I'm only giving this item 3 stars.  Due to the poor quality of the item, I don't think I'd recommend it.
