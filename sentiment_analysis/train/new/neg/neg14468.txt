It wasn't elegant at all. We had a wonderful nursery set-up but I really felt it needed a rug. Although we have some jungle/animal themed things around the room, this just did not fit FOR US.If you have the entire theme from the Kids Line Jungle room... it may be nice as it completes it. But don't think this would fit as a stand-alone piece in a room that did not have other Kids Line Jungle items.Plus, this is really weak quality- terrible and flimsy.
