The idea is genius (+1 star) and so I figured ok, this will replace all my zip lock bags, it's so pretty (+ another star)... it will be worth a splurge... well pretty is the only thing it is. That is, until you touch it. The second I opened the package I was instantly disappointed.  So much so I literally JUST received it in the mail moments ago and am writing this review nine months pregnant right away. The bags are made with low quality zippers, not smooth at all. The mesh feels like cheap dollar store pencil bags and the hooks are cheap and again, not smooth at all. If I paid twenty bucks even I'd say whatever I'm paying for the idea...maybe also the pretty pattern .. (still overpaying). but FORTY FOUR DOLLARS!? Are you kidding me... This is no where near the quality to charge almost fifty bucks. This is basically five cheap pencil bags sewn w cheap clips n pretty cheap fabric.  I feel completely ripped off.I hope this company checks out Le Sportsac and sees the quality of materials used. My $100 duffel which is obviously much much larger etc is beautifully made with quality fixtures that makes a plain black duffel worth $100 , I expected with the fifty dollar price tag for five mesh bags to at least be of that quality to justify the price. NOPE.I'll just go buy a few different size better quality bags and clip them to a ring for cheaper. Even forever 21 make up bags are of better quality. I really really wish this worked out but I feel so ripped off and cheated I'm returning the item asap.Please invest into the quality of your bags. The idea and design are there, but u cut every other corner to make a buck... Forty four of them.
