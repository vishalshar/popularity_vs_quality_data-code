We just spent most of the day in the ER thanks to these cups!  While I admit, I really liked this product when it first came and so did our little 9 month old boy, I feel that I failed as a parent and did not check the edges of these bath cups before I gave them to my child.  Normally, I inspect toys more closely given that he is already walking and crawling and that he can be handful to keep up with.  Also, note that this bath toy is listed under "Baby & Toddler" with 9+ months listed as the age range for this product.  Our little one was holding one of these cups in his hands when he had a slippery fall while taking a bath. Given that these are BATH toys, I would expect smooth edges and a bath-safe design which seems missing/defective. While I would expect a bruise or some red marks from any plastic toy that baby lands on, the outside of his cheek was split open and required 6 stitches from the edging of this cup.  Immediately after he fell, I was focused on him and the fact he was bleeding, instead of trying to stop and see how it happened. It was not until we got home from the ER that night, that a friend and I inspected the cup he was holding and realized these plastic edges are sharp!  They are sharp enough that it would be uncomfortable for an adult to drink from the rim so clearly a baby should not have had it to play with.  Bottom line, the design of the edges needs to be changed before I would deem them safe for a baby. Wile accidents are rare, and this product already has over 300 reviews on Amazon alone, it only takes one fall to have the same thing happen to your child.  Stay away, and find other bath cups. It you do choose to purchase anyway, inspect all products before allowing your child to play with any toy, especially those intended for use in or near slippery surfaces. I wish I had been more consistent with this advice even earlier.
