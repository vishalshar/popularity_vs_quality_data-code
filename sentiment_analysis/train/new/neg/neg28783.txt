The smell is almost overwhelmingly strong. It smells really good though. My baby's daycare teacher told me she likes it. It seems to make his rashes worse though, and its hard to get the smell out of the diapers when I wash them. Now I use it for my own skin or sometimes I spray it into the air in the bathroom if one of the kids stinks it up.
