The toy we received suffers some of same defects reported by others.  Though advertised as snug-fitting, one green peg drops out of hole at slightest jarring of the bed, 2 yellow pegs slide through too easily, 2 red (largest) pegs are impossible for an average child to budge. We had hoped that Made in USA would mean a toy of better exactness.  It's noisy.  On the plus side, the bed is beautifully designed and finished.  And, the defects in the toy we received could be turned into a learning experience stimulating the child to imagine ways he or she could remedy these.  Can the too-skinny peg be wrapped with duct tape?  The too-fat ones be sanded?  The too-fat ones be perfectly fine after a break-in period of hard pounding?  The green, yellow and red pegs be returned to the manufacturer for replacement?  The noise level reduced by placing moleskin on the pegs or on the hammer?  Also might the manufacturer certify the amount of lead present, if any, in the paint?  Or, does Made in USA mean that we can safely assume zero?  How about certifying the decibel level?  This would give adults a possible opportunity to teach child about sometimes having to wear hearing protection when using tools.  Thank you for the opportunity to post a review.
