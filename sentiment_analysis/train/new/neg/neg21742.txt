Great little bassinet and I love how sassy it is! Minus half a star for the red color not being true to the color advertised, mine is a much darker red. Minus half of another star for it being so difficult to find sheets that fit the mattress. It would be nice if there we sheets made to fit around the little seatbelt thing so the mattress can be protected from leaky babies. Because let's face it, most of us are going to resell and want it in good condition!Update: After actively using the bassinet for two months I have concluded that 1. It's difficult to get an infant to sleep in a bassinet. Eventually, after two weeks we managed to get the baby to sleep in the orbit 2. Our infant was born at 20.5 in (average I think) and at 7 weeks and almost 24 in. he's almost too big for the bassinet (sad face) 3. It's  true that the bassinet is designed in an odd way, it doesn't seem to sit level but dips a a bit so the infants blood is pooling in their poor little head, had to prop up to make level. 4. Never used the rocker 5. Never used the set belt thingy but pushed it out of the way, perhaps this is just for use in the buggy anyway.
