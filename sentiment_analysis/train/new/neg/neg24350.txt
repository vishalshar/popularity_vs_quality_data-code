I ordered this to replace my old one of a different brand. It serves the purpose I bought it for however I prefer a deeper "pocket" like my last one did covering more on the sides and top. I also prefer to have a self sticking adhesive/tape running along the length that I need to assure the security of the product to stay in place where this one had Velcro strips spaced apart that you add yourself. I have had this product on my fireplace for 2 months now and have not had a problem with it.
