Mirror fairly clear.  The ties are just sewn lightly- I wish they were sturdier and sewn along the back, or attached through the fabric rather than just tacked on.  My little guy ripped one right off within a couple days of use.Other than that, it's safe and they like to look at themselves and I like knowing it's a safe and soft product for them.Off to sew some ties on again.
