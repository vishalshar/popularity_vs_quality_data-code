I love PPB, but I hate that they apparently think that their entire customer base only owns iPhones.  I have the Samsung Galaxy s4, and it does not fit in the phone part of this wallet unless I take off the protective case.  I don't want to take off the protective case, so now I'm not using this wallet because it's not worth it if my phone doesn't fit in it.It's a cute print and a cute idea, so if you're an iPhone user, go for it.  For we Android phone users, we're out of luck.  :(
