I have been using these dispensers for the past 4 months and I thought they worked well until today.  I had noticed before that the formula would look like it was different levels in the seperate compartments even though I had carefully measured each serving to contain the same amount. I thought maybe I had gotten distracted and missed a scoop here or there but I now know this was not a user mistake.  Today one of the compartments clearly had much more than the other 2 even though I know I put exactly the same in each! This means the container is not secure and formula can transfer into the other parts! This is not ok!!! I am so upset about this because I have been feeding my son wrong amounts of formula sometimes!! I use these daily and now I cannot use them when I leave the house which really stinks because I bring my son to work with me!  This is unacceptable and renders this product useless. I will still use the single serve containers that came with this because they do work great. But buyer/parents beware that the 3 compartment container is pointless. So disappointed.
