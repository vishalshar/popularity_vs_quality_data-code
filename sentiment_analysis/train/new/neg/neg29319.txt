I thot this was cute (esp since you can remove the rings and use them as "hooks" on a stroller handle, for ex;), but my grandson didn't seem to pay any attention to it.  It seems sturdy.His dad and uncle had a set of keys that they adored.  I couldn't find those, so I hoped this toy would substitute.  I don't think there's anything wrong with the product, it's just that my grandson didn't seem interested.  Therefore 3 stars. mb
