I purchased this seat as an additional seat to have upstairs, so I didn't have to lug the other one around everywhere. This was very easy to put together. However, my 2.5 month old doesn't seem to like it.  She's not old enough to reach for the toys yet, so maybe it will be more interesting to her at a later timeâ€¦?  She enjoys sitting in her other seat very much, but cries when I put her in this one. I like that the vibration feature doesn't shut off after 10-15 minutes because that's a drawback to my other seat.
