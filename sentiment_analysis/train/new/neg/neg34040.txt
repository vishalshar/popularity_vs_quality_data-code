SO cute. Love the pattern and quality seems good. However, it does not fit a standard 32x16" changing pad. I tried it with the babies r us brand and then with the summer infant contoured changing pad, thinking the same brand should fit together. It didn't. On both pads, the cover was stretched so tight it made the pad buckle lengthwise and would not lie flat between the contours. I'm hoping I can find a smaller, maybe flatter pad because I REALLY want to use this cover! It's just too adorable!
