The seat makes a very safe impression and fortunately we never had to test that feature. However, it is awfully heavy, rear-facing very bulky (the car seat in front of it cannot move back very far and needs to be upright). The surface cloth does not wash very well (hand wash only), it develops a nasty aroma after some spilled milks, cookies, etc and it gets kind of roughened after a while. It's a real pain to install with all the tethers and trying to make it immovable and the shoulder strap height can only adjust to the growth of your kid when you uninstall it. Not sure, if there are seats with comparable safety ratings, but given the price I would have expected better cloth and easier installation.
