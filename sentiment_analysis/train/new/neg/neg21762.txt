I'm not sure what has happened to the latest shipments of these sheets, but the seller needs to check the entire batch in their warehouse before shipping these out. They smell like they have been SPRAYED with something horrendous! I thought it was the plastic packaging at first, but I peeled back the plastic to check the sheets themselves- touch for softness & a sniff test. The odor threw me for a loop. I literally nearly vomited, and my lungs got irritated (asthmatic)! Whatever is causing the odor attached to my fingers from feeling the fabric, so they smelled like the sheets too (hands washed immediately)! I have never experienced anything like this. SELLER- PLEASE CHECK THE REST OF YOUR STOCK. SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH THESE SHEETS!! These are supposed to be organic cotton, which means they should be pesticide free & with no chemical finishes. Were they sprayed with something prior to being shipped from the manufacturer, or was there a chemical spill in the same cargo unit or something? THESE ARE NOT FIT FOR A BABY'S CRIB. My purchase is already being returned! Unfortunately, this experience has put me off of Tadpoles branded items!
