It's a really cute set, and my son was ecstatic to open this on Christmas morning, but the bedspread is very thin, and not warm enough for winter time-we have to put another blanket on top of my child when he goes to sleep, or he is cold.  I also expected that toddler bedding would have a pillowcase that fit a toddler pillow, but this one fits a standard pillow.
