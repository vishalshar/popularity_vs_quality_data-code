LIKES: We received our bed quickly and assembly wasn't difficult. It is an attractive bed that looks more expensive than it is, so for that I am pleased. While the drawer space underneath is shallow, it is wide/roomy and able to hold his socks and pajamas.DISLIKES: The bed is a bit higher from the floor than I thought - so my 15-month-old (who is average/tall height) needs assistance climbing in and out.I was disappointed that the side rails aren't higher. I had planned to use my son's crib mattress (which is standard thickness), but once the mattress is in place in the toddler bed it's the same height as the rails. So either we are going to have to order an additional, thinner mattress, or add our own supplemental rails. I have thus had to post-pone transitioning my toddler over to this bed, because I don't feel comfortable with him sleeping there yet without higher protective rails.OVERVIEW: In sum, I am pleased with the bed, but I wish the product description had indicated that a thinner crib mattress is necessary, in order for the bed rails to actually offer any protection from falling out. Essentially, the picture is deceiving, as that clearly isn't a standard-thickness crib mattress shown.
