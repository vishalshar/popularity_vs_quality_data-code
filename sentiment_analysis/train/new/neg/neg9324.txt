Let me start by saying that I like Rumparooz covers because they are great at keeping everything in (including breast feed poos) but they have some major downfallsI feel the plu of this is thiner than some of my other covers.The rise adjusting snaps are difficult. I have to carefully pull them apart because I feel that the PLU will rip apart when unsnapping.These are overpriced. If you were looking for a more budget friendly option, sweet peas are my go to cover.
