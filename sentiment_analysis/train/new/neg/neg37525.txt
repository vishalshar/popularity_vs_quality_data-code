I bought one of these pillows quite a few years ago when I was pregnant with my first. I loved it! It was very supportive to sleep with and I used it for nursing etc after my daughter was born. I also used it through my 2nd pregnancy. It has since disappeared so now that I am pregnant with my 3rd I was very excited to find this again. I ordered it immediately. I am really disappointed in it as it feels much smaller, not as supportive and not as soft as my old pillow. It just feels like design and material is much cheaper. I have ordered a different pillow and I am hoping I will be happier with it. Definitely disappointed in this purchase.
