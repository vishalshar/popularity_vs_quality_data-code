I received this item today and was initially very disappointed.  The product is listed on the tag as being 85% polyester and only 15% cotton.  This is not an organic product, it has a layer of 100% organic cotton.  You cannot see well in the product photo, but the covering is not cotton, it is a shiny synthetic.However, it is 1/3 the cost of the fully organic changing pad and as I have a 100% organic cotton cover for it, I will keep it.Here are my reasons why:-It is made in the United States so I worry slightly less about what might be lurking in the materials-At 32", it fits perfectly on my changing table-It is preferable to the vinyl versions that are most prevalent when shopping for changing pads-It does seem to be made with non toxic, non harmful materialsWe bought the Naturpedic Organic mattress and it is amazing. If you can afford their changing pad, I would go that route instead. Otherwise, I would take this item over other changing pads, even though it is not what I would consider 'organic' as such.  Since the baby will only be on the changing pad during diapering, I'm not as concerned as I would be about a mattress or other objects he is in contact with for longer periods of time.
