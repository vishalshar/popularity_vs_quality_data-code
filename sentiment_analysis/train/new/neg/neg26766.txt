this serves its purpose, as far as protecting my sheets or my clothes are concerned but the colors have faded after only a couple of hand washes. My baby was only 6 lbs when he came out so these are good enough to place underneath him but i can't imagine using them for long afterwards. they are truly waterproof and are very easy to dry.
