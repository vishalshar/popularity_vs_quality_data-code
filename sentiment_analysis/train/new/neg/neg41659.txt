I really do like this calendar, the price would be good for what you're getting except for a couple of things. The calendar isn't completely sealed, leaving it open for dust and debris to find its way in. It came to me dirty right out of the box. My other complaint is that on one of the parts that actually was sealed there is a gash that runs a quarter of the way down the package as if somebody got a little overzealous with a box cutter when opening the shipment. I wouldn't really have cared about the aesthetics if I had purchased this for my own use but I'm giving it as a gift and I just dislike the thought of giving somebody a present that just looks kind of...trashed. Unfortunately, I don't have time to return it before the Shower.
