If I could give this no stars I would.  If your ambient room temperature is over 77 degrees it won't work.  So if you live anywhere mildly warm it won't work unless you use ice cubes.  Who has the time to put ice cubes in it?!  The beep that it's ready is crazy loud so if you have twins it wakes the sleeping one up.  Why does it need to be so loud?! The filter also packed in within 3 weeks of having it so I would need to replace that part every three weeks. Expensive and annoying.  Awful machine.  It's now gathering dust in a cupboard as I missed the return date cut off.  I have 5 month old twins so didn't get time to sort it until now.  Sigh.
