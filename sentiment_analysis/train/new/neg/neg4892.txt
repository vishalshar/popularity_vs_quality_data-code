I have a couple issues with this potty training potty.  It appears that it is rather popular, with all reviews being in the 4/5 star range, but personally I'm not as impressed as the others seem to be.  First off, the deodorizing scent is not very prominent and might as well not even be there.  Second, this isn't a potty that really instills any sense of urgency with potty training.  It doesn't get the child excited to use it.  It is a plain white potty with the Arm and Hammer logo at the top.  The only colors are a murky orange and a green stripe.  It just isn't much to look at, and despite what some may want to believe, children react to the way something looks.  Third, it is very small.  The seat isn't all that comfortable (my daughter even complained about it hurting her butt).  We have another potty that has a cushioned seat, which she prefers far more.  Yes, this is gender natural (which seems to be something reviews have responded to) and it is easy to clean, but then again many other potties are easy to clean.  This, to me, isn't worth it.  It is cheap feeling and looking and doesn't inspire my child to want to try.
