I purchased this because the mobile I had purchased was wind up and only lasted 3 mins so I wanted something that I didn't have to keep going back in every 3 mins to wind up until my baby fell asleep. Well the idea of battery operated is great and I love be motion part of it, but it is WAY too loud! I've tried what other people have recommended and put tape over the speaker to lower the volume but even with multiple layers of tape, it's still obnoxiously loud. I've noticed the loudness actually wakes my baby up sometimes if it's still going when she's sleeping. I just wish there was a volume button or option to turn the volume off completely and just use the motion.
