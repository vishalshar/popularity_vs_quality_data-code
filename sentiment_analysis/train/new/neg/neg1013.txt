It works with the BOB, but I am disappointed at how loose the Graco infant carrier fits on the bar.  the red hook on the carrier does not fit tight or click over the bar.  The bar is really just a resting place for the carrier. I understand that it is not recommended for running, but the only thing that is truly holding the carrier is the nylon strap that comes with the kit.  I would have assumed that for the price and the prestige of the BOB all terrain stroller that this adapter would provide a better and safer fit for our carrier.  Maybe other carriers fit better.  However My wife and I did the research and purchased the carrier based on the better ratings, and we are disappointed in the design of this adapter.
