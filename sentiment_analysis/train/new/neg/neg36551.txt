I should have read the 1 star reviews instead of just the 5 star reviews before I bought 2 of these kettles. The first one lasted only 3 months. I thought maybe I just left it on too long or got water on the bottom where the kettle connects to the base so I bought another. This time I was very careful when cleaning and refilling the kettle. I only turned on the kettle when needed and turned it off before lifting it off the base and this one only lasted a month. It's a good concept and very convenient when it worked. Horrible product! Very badly made. Unfortunately I was unable to return the item because the box had been thrown away by mistake. So not happy and very disappointed!
