Reading people's 1 star reviews, I agree with their findings.  But on the PLUS side, this was the perfect size for our newborn once she outgrew her wash pod.  At around 20lbs now, it's still the perfect size and shape for her in our bathtub...and most importantly, our baby likes being bathed like this.But the main downside is that this is a GIANT SPONGE.  It's not like a bath pillow that has a cloth part with a plastic inside, this thing is filled with (polyester, I think) cottonballs.  So it soaks up a LOT of water, and then you have to wring it out afterward to keep it from getting moldy.  If you're gentle with the wringing, it doesn't have to fall apart right away... but it will eventually fall apart, and it will get moldy no matter how much you wring it out and leave it to dry - so you need to wash it in bleach every now and then...But if you just need something for your newborn until she's able to sit up reliably in a medium sized baby tub - then this *might* just last long enough.  But there's a good chance no.  So far we've gotten two months use out of it, and it only has one hole where the cotton is sticking out... I expected a little more from this company.
