One of the rubber bottom insert keeps falling out. Have tried switching to see if it is the hole or the rubber insert. Looks like the hole in the plastic is too big for the rubber insert, I will have to put tape around the hole or something to fix this problem. Have no problems other than that one hole. Love the playzone yard and will figure this out.
