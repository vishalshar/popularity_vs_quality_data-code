This is cute and I was ecxited to purchase a portable noise machine for my baby. However, it only has the option of a 23 or 45 minute timer. You can't turn the timer option off, so it will turn off in the middle of your baby's nap (and the sudden silence may possibly wake him/her, as it does mine). I guess it's so your batteries won't run out if you forget to shut it off, but why not have a 90 minute or 2 hour option?Save your money and use a really cheap radio on a static station. That's what I've been doing.I really wanted to like this more.
