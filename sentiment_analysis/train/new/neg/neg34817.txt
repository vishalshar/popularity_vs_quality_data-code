We have passed this on.At the time of purchase, it was the only double stroller legally able to ride to the gate at US airports. There's that- HOORAY!!! Traveling alone to Europe with two littles, that's priceless.Using it on the streets: AWFUL! It does not turn well. a wheel felt like it was about to fall off. We only had it about two months, as we bought it specifically for my travels. the handles are super cheap, slippery and painful. Please use some ergonomic factors when designing strollers, if you'd like to remain in the business!The entire construction bowed under the weight of our two kids- one 2 year old and one 4 year old girl.It is far too low. I would think the ideal height for someone pushing this is about the average of a US 1st grader. Definitely not 5'-9", like myself. My husband at 6'-5" just laughed at the thought of pushing it. He would have broken his back...
