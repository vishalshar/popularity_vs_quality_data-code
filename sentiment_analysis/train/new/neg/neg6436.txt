After a lot of research on double strollers for my newborn and 17 month old, I decided on this one because it was lightweight and also allowed for an infant car seat to be attached. Well,  for the price, I'm not that happy.  First, the infant car seat does not fit well. Everytime I use it I have to jam it into the stroller because it does not really fit even though it's the correct carseat. I'm worried the stroller will break at any moment since I have to push that hard just to get it to fit.  Further, if the infant seat is in the other seat is pretty cramped.And like everyone else has said, forget trying to use the baskets.  Not only are they small, but there is a bar at the top, across the baskets, that make it impossible to squeeze anything into them. I just pack a very small bag, and I mean small, that is large enough to fit 2-3 diapers, some wipes and a snack.  I leave my large diaper bag in the car.Without the car seat, the stroller is not bad and I suppose I'm happy with it. It is very light and once you figure out how to fold the sroller (and it's not that easy at first), the stroller does fold up rather compact and fits very easily into my car. I figure once my youngest is old enough to sit in the stroller without the car seat, I'll be much happier.All in all, until one of the other high-end stoller manufacturers make a double stroller that allows for an attachable infant car seat, this one is the better choice. I could not imagine having to push one of those huge Graco strollers around.
