I got this book twice from amazon. I returned it first because it has 2 pages of info for "daddy" and none for mom.The rest of it works.The replacement has the same issue so I'm assuming all of them with white cover in a certain batch are like this.I really like the ink idea and the rest of the book that's why I don't want to send it back anymore. At this point I'll just print my own headline and glue it over the original. (probably can make something more interesting anyways).I'm leaving the review in case someone intends to correct these books at some point.
