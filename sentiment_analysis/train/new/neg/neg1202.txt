I really wanted to love this item for my 5 month old baby, but the wood was too rough.  I'm not sure if I received a defectively made rattle, but it feels rough to the touch and you could even see the uneven/scratchy surfaces.  Unfortunately, it was given to my baby before I examined it, and my baby ended up with a bright red rash on his face and arms from the scratchy wood.
