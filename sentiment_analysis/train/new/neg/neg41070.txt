Not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over Internet, it seems that First Years has discontinued the product. At least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website. We searched for model 4290 - the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer. Apparently, they don't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued. Furthermore, the site is full of broken image links. The thermometer works well but without probe covers, it's not a good investment. You can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers. If the store you're buying the thermometer at doesn't have covers there, find another product with covers available.
