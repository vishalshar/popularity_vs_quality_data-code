I love it. It's rather bigger and bolder than many people might like. I did like it though. :)My infant did not take to it like he takes to my regular jewelery though... He must know he's allowed to chew it, so he would barely teeth it. I did not have fluff stick to it like some reviewers said, but it's turquoise so maybe more of a problem on dark beads. I would like to teeth on it, it's so rubbery and chewy looking! But not all kids are the same. He only chews on non-parent approved items.Get it if money is not an issue, I thought it a bit expensive for the amount of use I got from it.
