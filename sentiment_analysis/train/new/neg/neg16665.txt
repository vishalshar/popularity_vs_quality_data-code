For my second baby gate, I decided to try out a custom solution.  I bought a 2"x3" at Home Depot for $1.79 and cut to length.  I secured the beam to the bannister with velcro straps ($6).  I then mounted the gate to the 2x3 and voila!  Same thing for a fraction of the cost.  You could probably also use inexpensive cable ties instead of the more expense velcro straps and do the whole thing for under $5.
