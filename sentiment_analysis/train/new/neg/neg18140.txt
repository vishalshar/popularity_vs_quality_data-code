This walker is just okay. My 6 month olds had a difficult time moving forward with this walker despite us adjusting it to their appropriate heights. They would try to move forward but would move backwards instead. Maybe they're not strong enough to move it forward with their legs but now that they're 9 months old, they can move forward. It's not very smooth but it does its job. We purchased a different walker for our twin at 6 months and they had no problem walking forward in it and it's a much smoother ride. I guess for this walker I would wait until your babies' legs are stronger and can propel themselves forward in it otherwise, consider buying a different walker.
