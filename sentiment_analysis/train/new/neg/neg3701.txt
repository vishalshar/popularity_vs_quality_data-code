We got these for a baby shower. After the first wash, one of them had a notable hole about the size of my finger (it had to be there before the wash) which greatly impacts it's abilities as a burp cloth. When we tried using it as a bib, we found that one of them was made with two female snaps that will never snap together rendering it useless as a bib.Great idea, Poor execution
