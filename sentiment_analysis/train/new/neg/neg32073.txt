We wanted a bassinet because we didn't want the baby to sleep in bed with us but we weren't ready to send her to her own room to be in the crib by herself yet. We keep this near our bed so we can wake up like paranoid new parents we are to check on her every few hours. The build of the bassinet is kind of cheap and its not worth $80 but its not so cheap that it seems dangerous to put the baby in it, at 10 lbs our baby will soon out grow it so that's about how long you can use it, we knew that when we bought it, but don't expect to use this for more than a few months if you're buying it. Hopefully you'll have put it on your registry so you don't have to buy it.
