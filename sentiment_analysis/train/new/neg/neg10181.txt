Unfortunately, saving money got me to try this product. Weleda is my #1 choice then California baby #2. My little got a diaper rash after 2 days of using product & applying it liberally and at every diaper change. I never have that problem with the other 2 creams I mentioned. Too bad because I like the size of the product & of course saying "butt paste" is a bonus, right? But definitely didn't work for us.
