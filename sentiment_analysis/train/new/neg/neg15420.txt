We tried this toothbrush holder first.  We loved the orange color as that is my wife and daughter's favorite.  We have a Braun rechargeable toothbrush, so this should have been perfect for our interchangeble heads.It works great for that.  Unfortunately, the saliva/water that is left on your brush runs down after you put it in the hole.  That water runs down into the pan and starts to get funky.  You could clean it out every day, but I didn't really need another chore.If you don't clean it out every day, with 4 people using it including 2 kids, it's going to get funky on the inside.  And smell.  Then make your brushes smell.  It was too hard for us to keep up with, so we got rid of it in a couple of weeks and went a different direction.Maybe if they had some side holes or something to help get some airflow through the dish to evaporate the water that drips down.  It never seemed to evaporate.  It'd just pool and start to stink.
