I wanted to like this bed. I know you get what you pay for, but I expected the parts to at least fit together. The legs for the rear end of the bed did not fit properly. The top screw holes on those two legs were in the wrong place and make assembly impossible. I'm great at putting things like this together. When I say impossible, I'm not exaggerating. The holes were in the wrong place. I'm sure this is not the norm because if if were the bed would have worse reviews. Had I received parts that were not defected I think I would've really enjoyed this bed for my son.
