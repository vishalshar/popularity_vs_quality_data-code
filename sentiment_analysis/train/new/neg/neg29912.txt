These pacifiers are average, not bad, but there is definitely better. My son is now five months and does not use a pacifier at all. Between five weeks and four months he really seemed to prefer the GumDrop Pacifiers. My only real complaint is that the soothie covered his nose. Not ideal when baby is sleeping and could potentially be hazardous if left unattended. We did not have this problem when he was a little older but I still would not reccomend this pacifier when there are many more to choose from. Granted all babies are different and some will prefer one thing over another...the choice is yours.
