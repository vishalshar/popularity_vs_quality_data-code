I was hoping this would be taller than my Boppy so the baby would be positioned higher up on my chest and spare me from having to slouch down or prop her up with extra pillows.  But this pillow is so soft that it actually compresses to be shorter than the Boppy once my two-month-old is placed on it.  Plus it's a deal-breaker that the whole pillow can't go in the washing machine.  Is mine the only baby with spit-up and diaper leaks?  It's very cozy and plush, but not practical!
