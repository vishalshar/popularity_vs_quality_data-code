I love the layout of this bag. I love all the compartments, I always know where everything is and I have just enough room for what I need to pack. My issues are with the zippers. First of all, the zipper on the very bottom zipper for the little pouch in the middle are so touchy that it can take me up to 10 minutes to get them closed. This is a BIG issue when you just needed to grab one thing, then close the bag and go. If I'm holding my 7 month old and trying to close the bag it an even bigger issue. If I give up and leave it open everything falls out. My second issue with the zippers is that the zipper pulls are always falling off. I have actually lost 2 and another 2 are always falling off. Without these the pouch on the bottom is impossible to open. I've tried hammering the zipper closed to keep the pulls on and they just won't stay. This also causes the zippers (because they're open too far) to get caught on my daughters clothes all the time. Otherwise, I love this bag.
