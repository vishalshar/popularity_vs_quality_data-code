We purchased this as a bouncer for travel purposes. We have a baby bjorn bouncer that our baby uses daily and loves. Although significantly cheaper than the Bjorn bouncer - The tiny love bouncer is no where the same quality. The Tiny Bouncer - does not bounce. Any movement it does make is very "jerky" not a smooth fluid motion. The two stars are for the easy ability to fold and store the bouncer in the included travel bag. If your baby doesn't want to bounce - you are just looking for something to sit the baby in - the Tiny Bouncer is suitable. If your baby likes to bounce like ours - stick with the Bjorn for the extra money.
