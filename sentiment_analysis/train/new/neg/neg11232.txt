I wanted to love these. . .I just received them and decided to test the leak factor. I put a little water in several of the containers and swirled them around upside down (like I imagine might happen if I throw them in the diaper bag, on the run), and they all leaked. It wasn't a huge, destroy the diaper bag, kind of leak, but its enough that I'm going to keep looking for a good storage container for baby food. They're a great looking container, and they fit in the Kiinde bottle warmer, which is a plus.
