This was our third cast for the third child. Only 1 of 5 plaster rolls was proper in terms of the consistency it became after being soaked in water. The other four remained hard and crumbly, even after soaking individual pieces for 15 minutes (the good roll became right as soon as it hit the water). We were unable to get a good cast out of this kit. We got one good layer with the good roll, and our attempt at a second layer resulted in a falling apart mess. SO Diapppointing!
