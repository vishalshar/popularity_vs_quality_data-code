I give this a 3 star because I love the Mickey Mouse graphic on the cup and it's very easy for my 1 year old to use. Downside is straw comes right out and then milk comes pouring out of the hole. Wish the straw had something on the bottom to make it not pop out quite so easily. Will not be purchasing these again.
