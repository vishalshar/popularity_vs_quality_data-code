I read reviews that the spoon is fairly useless; it was very flat. That wasn't as big an issue for me as the size of the compartments. They didn't quite fit a full 4oz. container of Stage 2 fruits/veggies in the smaller compartments. There was left over and it would make the lids really messy. You can't remove the smaller containers to put a baby food container in it's place because of the size/shape of this set. I got the laptop lunch boxes instead and they fit a baby food container (Gerber plastic 4oz. ones) with the lid removed and fit substantially more food...though only one compartment has a lid on that brand. If you want something that will last into toddler years, for yourself, or something that can hold enough for breakfast and lunch combined...don't get this one. My ideal would have been one of the Bento boxes but I couldn't confirm the safety of the plastic those are made with. The laptop lunches are made with plastic I am more comfortable with.
