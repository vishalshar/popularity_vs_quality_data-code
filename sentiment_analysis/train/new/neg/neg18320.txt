Could be a beautiful crib, easy to assemble, very sturdy, nice finish - much better than a Graco crib that we bought for our first baby (and understandably so as we spent I think between $150 and $180 on the Graco crib while the Medford retails at Amazon for $480).The two stars refer to the fact that once my husband and I unpacked the parts we noticed immediately that a long crack is running along the curved top part of the headboard, i e the most visible spot of the whole crib. It literally runs for probably good two feet. A very visible quality defect that is hardly acceptable in such expensive item. The picture I am attaching shows the whole crack (red rectangular), withe the smaller dark blue rectangular on the left side where the crack is a bit more narrow and doesn't show on the photo as well - but it's still there. My husband's finger at the left end of the crack is there to show where the crack actually ends.We wrote to the Amazon customer service and hoping that we can get the headboard replaced; only need the new headboard as all other parts of the original crib seem fine. Can't return the crib (= wait for the replacement) as it's for our second baby due in about a week.
