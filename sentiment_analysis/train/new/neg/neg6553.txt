This is the first time I have been compelled to write a review on Amazon. Here is what the description said: "Baby can pull and watch pal slowly climb up with the music. "  This is NOT the product I received.  You can yank on the toy as with any hanging toy but there was no slow climb like we had expected from the product description.In addition, I happened to go to Toys R Us a few days after I received the package and saw the EXACT same toy for HALF of the price listed here from the manufacturer.  Needless to say, the overall experience was negative.  The toy is fine but did not live up to the description or the price tag.
