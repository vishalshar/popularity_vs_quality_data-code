This soother has great colors and music as well as volume control and stays on for 15 minutes, which I found was ideal to put my little one to sleep.  But there is movement for this soother, or at least there was for the first few nights.  Now none of the animals move, yet all the other features still work.  It's a lot to take in for a little one, and since mine is only 4 months old he is fine with lights and music.  When he is older, we might have to try one with movement instead - one that actually continues to move for at least a week after it is purchased.  Normally I'd say I got a lemon, but the fact that it DID move when we bought it and now does not makes me wonder if this is happening to others.  Anyway, that's the bad, the good outweighs the non-movement for now and the little one sleeps very soundly and enjoys watching the lights and listening to the music.
