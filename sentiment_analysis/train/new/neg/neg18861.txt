We are using these to freeze one ounce cubes of our own baby food.  The product works as advertised, BUT it's very hard to get the frozen cubes of food out.  I don't like soaking it in hot water around the bottom b/c that melts part of the cube and defeats the purpose of trying to freeze bulk one ounce portions.The method that I've found that works is to flip it over and on a clean counter (or cutting board, plate, etc.) firmly hold the two short ends and bend the tray in the middle until you feel it give, meaning part of the cubes have broken loose from the silicone wall.  Flip it back over and figure out which row broke loose by gently bending it back wards again.  Once you've identified the row (usually it'll be the middle row of three cubes), flip it back over and firmly grip the tray on the long sides and use both thumbs to press hard on the center cube that is loose.  It may take a second, but the cube will eventually break loose from the other sides and you'll be able to push the cube about halfway out.  Flip it back over, grip the cube that's halfway out, and wiggle and pull on it until it comes loose.  Flip it back over and repeat until each cube is out.  It takes a little bit of time, but not that much and you get nice frozen cubes instead of partially melted runny cubes that make a total mess.
