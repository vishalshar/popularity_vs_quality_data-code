I think it's a great product, quality-wise but I was disappointed that it doesn't cover around the baby's head and neck. Even if you use a hat, the neck area is exposed. If you try to cover the area, the baby's face gets covered which is problematic because it's dangerous and you can't see the baby's face. There are cheaper versions out there that cover everything except the baby's face. I returned this product for one of those.
