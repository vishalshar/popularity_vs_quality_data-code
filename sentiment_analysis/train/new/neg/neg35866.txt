This is our first stroller since our 9 month old grew out of his carseat/universal carrier. Until recently I've been pretty happy with it. It's got a lot of good features: large basket, safety bar with tray for baby, cup holder for adult, full recline, adjustable handlebar, lightweight and rather easy to steer, fold and carry. However, the thing that initially bothered me is trully a PROBLEM! The straps are poorly designed. They don't tighten enough for my son and he's not a small baby. The other day, he was in the upright position and someone dropped something in front of us. I didn't see it and stopped short when we hit it. My son flew forward, the seat pulled with him(!!!) and his face hit the tray. I had the straps as tight as they would go.  The seat SHOULD NOT move with him.  I got this stroller because for the money I could spend it seemed the best. It has some great features, but it's not worth the risk to my son. I'll be looking for something else.
