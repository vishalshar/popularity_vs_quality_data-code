The only reason I'm even giving this item 2 stars is that it really is a beautiful design.My problem is that it states in the description that the fish are made of "light weight plastic." They are not. They are paper.I do not think that this is a small matter to quibble over. This is absolutely false advertising, and should be known up front by anyone purchasing the product. The mobile is very pretty, and I could see paying $20 for it. But these fish could easily be torn to bits by explorative little hands. They are made of paper about the thickness of card stock. Maybe a little thinner actually.For $50 I expected a lot more. Especially since the description SAID it was made of PLASTIC! The entire thing may have cost $1.00 to construct. It's paper, some heavy gauge wire, and black thread. That's it. If you're expecting it to be more, as I was and as you probably are if you're trusting the product description, I would recommend NOT buying it.I hope this helps save someone else the time, money and hassle of dealing with the failure of this product to meet the expectations that the manufacturer/seller has set for it.
