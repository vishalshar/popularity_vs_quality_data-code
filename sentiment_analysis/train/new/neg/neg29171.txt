The mat is really just a small thin piece of fabric with minimal padding. It is much smaller than and not nearly as  thick as the other (disney) nap mat we purchased for our one year old. We have a lot of disney baby products and this is the most disappointed we have been with any of them.  Particularly if you are looking for one to go on top of a cot at daycare or preschool I would recommend one of the longer ones that does not come with an attached blanket.
