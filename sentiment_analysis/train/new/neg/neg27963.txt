This product does serve its purpose of blocking shade, as long as the sun is coming in from exactly where you have these postitioned on your window. I ordered these for the 2 back side windows in our Altima. The shape of the window does not allow full coverage from this rectangular shaped shade, which is OK, but sun will still creep into baby's eyes, unfortunately. It also looks pretty cheap and wrinkled. I tried to take my time and press it on there carefully, but still got wrinkles in it. It's just OK. I'm sure there is something better out there, but I do like that I can peel it off if I need to and reuse it.
