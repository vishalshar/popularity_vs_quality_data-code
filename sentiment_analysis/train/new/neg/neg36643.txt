This set is very pretty and the price is reasonable compared to others.  It's a very girly-girl set and the colors work well together.  I only really have two negatives:  first, the sheet is paper-thin and rips easily b/c it doesn't fit over our standard size mattress.  Secondly, the bumper only has ties on the top and not the bottom which I think would be much better.  Other sets out there have on top AND bottom.  I think it's safer.The quilt is very plush and can be used on the floor during tummy-time.  However, one side is very decorative and I worry about a child being able to pull the ribbon or tulle off and possibly choking.  I only put my baby on the plain, striped side of the quilt.
