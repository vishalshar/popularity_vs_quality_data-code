I had mistakenly thought that the Medela Freestyle Spare Parts Kit would include Freestyle breastshields.  Afterall, the picture on the box, on the description, shows the Freestyle breastshields.  The seller claims that Medela has discontinued them and I received the Personal Fit breastshields instead.  The whole (and only) reason I purchased the kit was for the breastshields.  The original Freestyle breastshields were comfortable.  I'm afraid to use the Personal Fit ones because they are hard and not flexible like the Freestyle ones.  The bottles that came with it are also cheap and chinsy.  They say Medela on them, but are not even close to the usual Medela quality.  I am suspicious of the entire transaction.  On top of it all, the seller was rude and not very knowledgeable.  I would NOT recommend this purchase, especially from this particular seller.
