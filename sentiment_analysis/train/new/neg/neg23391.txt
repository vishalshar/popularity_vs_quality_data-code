While sturdy, these pads absolutely did not work for me. They are thick, absorbent cotton, and stayed put in my bra, although they were stiff enough for the short period I used them that I think they would have been visible under anything but a heavy flannel shirt. The problem was that they absorbed the milk - and wicked it out into my shirt. They were also uncomfortably wet feeling. I much preferred the bamboo pads I ended up using, as they did not have the wet-cloth feel once soaked.
