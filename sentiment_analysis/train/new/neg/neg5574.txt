This mat is very convenient, with the blanket, mat and pillow together. It is also very soft, though a bit thin. However, the blanket began to tear apart from the mat within the first week I had it. I didn't have time to return it, so kept using it. I wash it gently about once every 1-2 weeks for the past 6 months (my child uses 3 times a week) and it's holding up fine, except for pilling on the fabric.
