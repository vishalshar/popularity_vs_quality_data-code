I originally LOVED this crib but not anymore. it has big potential to cause serious harm. I think this crib is dangerous! The metal spring frame (that you set mattress on) has moveable arms so the mattress can tilt. I found my 3 month old smashed against the side rail on his tummy with arms tucked under. He had no way of rolling back due to the incline (approx 10 degrees). He's able to roll on his side (flat surfaces, and can roll from tummy to back if arms are out and on flat surfaces) but due to incline- he was able to roll all the way over but could not get back. The problem? He could have totally been stuck face down!!!! I contacted the company- they are sending a replacement box spring without moveable arms... Makes you wonder if this has been an issue for others as well. I do not think my infant alone caused it to tilt- I think me pushing on mattress while we "played" BUT imagine as he gets older and can stand/jump/weighs more. Scary!!UPDATE:I contacted customer service and was sent a new metal spring frame that has notches so the arms aren't able to move. The mattress no longer tilts. IF you purchase this crib- I would contact customer service  and request a spring frame that doesn't allow the arms to move (basically sent me a spring frame from a different crib). Simple fix! Now I wonder why they didn't just include it with the crib to begin with!!
