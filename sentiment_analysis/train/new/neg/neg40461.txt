I loved this toothbrush at first because it is well designed for little mouths. But then after some time realized that it had collected MOLD! So I discarded it and bought another one. This time I paid more attention and yup - within a couple of days (!!) noticed that the product had collected mold. I am returning it and warning others to STAY AWAY until this product is redesigned.
