the bag is great but when we got it the plastic petunia pickle bottom bag it comes in has a big hole and dirt all over the plastic bag and dirt on about 4x4 spot on the bag,  So I am not sure where it came from or who handled it but it was a gift and I did not have time to send it back.  But the bag is nice,  I think the pull out part for laying your baby on is a little on the cheap side considering how much this cost.
