This product is terrible.  The design is cute but the music lasts for barely enough time to get out of baby's room!  Also, one of the reasons I got this was because it has a lock feature so that you can wined it up and then lock it in place so that when you want to turn it on, you just slide the lock.  The wined up feature is so loud you can't not use this but the spring mechanism is so cheaply made or designed that if you use it, it ruins the mobile and then it becomes completely unusable (won't play music or turn).  Save your money....wouldn't use this if it was free.
