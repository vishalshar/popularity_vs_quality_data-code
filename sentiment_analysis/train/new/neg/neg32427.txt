The product itself is wonderful--well constructed, good material, soft, chewable. However, it didn't end up being too practical, which I should have thought through before I purchased. It's basically just another teether your child will throw on the floor and get dirty, since they really can't chew on it when you're wearing it. It's convenient if  you don't have any toys on-hand and your child is fussy, but I always have a purse or diaper bag stacked with teethers and things. I would probably go for the necklace instead, since your child can chew while it stays on your neck.
