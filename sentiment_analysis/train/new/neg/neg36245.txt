Pros: This is comfortable for my 2 year old daughter to use and, so far, seems stable and reliable.  Easy to clean, good for use as a 'potty' stool.Cons: The plastic quality was not consistent since there were some thin spots that made the stool look worn, I expected better quality from Fisher Price. It was received in dirty condition- some black scuff marks presumably from manufacturing or distribution. Its use is limited since it is a short stool- it is good for the potty, but not high enough for reaching the sink
