Looks so cute in photos but does not look the same when it arrives.  Very disappointed in several aspects;-Worst are the shoulder straps, almost impossible to change the position.  They are completely sewn in, no way to reach them.  Tried to contact customer service, even the Facebook page and could not find any help.-The strap between the legs seems long enough but it is too wide and is not adjustable.-The photo shows mesh on the back of the stroller canopy but it is actually white RUBBER sheeting, possibly THE WORST material for the back of a stroller canopy.  I do not know what they were thinking other than how to make a stroller canopy stifling hot!-The removable seat liner just bunches up on the sides and is only attached to stroller by two small pieces of velcro.  I can see this becoming a mess as time goes on.-Not easy to fold up. Definitely takes two hands.-Stroller does not stand up in any way once folded. Also, not too compact either.So excited to receive this pretty lavender stroller but sadly am returning.  Seems like good quality but functions like junk.
