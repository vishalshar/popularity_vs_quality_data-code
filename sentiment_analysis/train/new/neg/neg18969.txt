I would not recommend to buy this product because the board keeps falling down (if not used by my 2 year old son) as soon as there is a little bump or the ground is inclined, which is very annoying. The way it is maintained to the stroller is in my view not effective enough. One elastic maintains the board to the stroller and the elastic keeps loosing so you need to readjust it all the time. Also I need to walk on the side of the stroller as the board takes the space your feet would usually have but you get used to it.
