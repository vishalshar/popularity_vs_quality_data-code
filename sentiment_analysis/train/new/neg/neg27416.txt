This color combination looked modern and fun, however when it arrived it looked cheap.  If the edging was more refined, it could add to the look.  For something you will carry around in your purse, you want it to look as nice as possible for a "on the go changing station".  Also, I have ordered thousands of dollars within the last few months on Amazon in preparation for my babies arrival.  However, this is the FIRST time I have had ANY trouble with returning, and getting a refund.  In fact, I have returned just a few things and the turn around, e-mail follow up and quick return to my account has made me re-order from the vendors.  This vendor however I wouldn't recommend ordering from!  I returned the product, never got an email saying they received AFTER following their tedious return requests. Then I have had to continue to see if the refund has been issued, which it still has not.  Not to mention when I contacted their customer service they had the nerve to ask me to find the routing number versus looking up the order to see if it had been returned.  THEN I was in touch with someone who said they found out the item had been received (obviously), and were in touch with their accounting department to see "where in the process" the refund was at.  THREE business days later they still haven't responded and I am yet again sending another email to help them do their jobs, and get the refund that I am not really sure would ever get refunded.  Moral of the story...don't order from this vendor.  Every other vendor I have ordered from has been awesome.
