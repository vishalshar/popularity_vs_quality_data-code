I just receieved this set in the mail and took it out of the package. The material seems to be cheap, amost see troughish. the only three items that are not see trough are the quilt, crib bumper and fitted sheet. The mitts that come with it are made out of two different materials, granted not something I would use anyways but its the principle. The diaper stacker and the window valances look different than the picture. The window valance has a darck brown stripe running accross on the bottom which I actually prefer and the diaper stackerhas two small pockets on the front in the reversed pattern. I actually prefer these changes just want to warn others about what you are getting. Overall its a cute set and not bad for the price. If you want something of quality I would suggest spending the more money on a better set. My only concern will be putting it trough the wash due to how thin the material is. I will update this review after its been trougth the wash hopefully it holds up.*update It held up trough the wash the material now I'm just hoping it will last a couple of months with no tears etc.
