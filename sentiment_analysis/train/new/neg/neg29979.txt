I have twins and needed another exersaucer. This is a nice exersaucer for the money, but I definitely think it's lacking in some departments. For one thing there are no arial toys, everything is at eye level. The seat spins, but not easily. You cannot collapse the item flat and you can't remove the toys from their locations. The base is a bit smaller in circumference than others, which makes me wonder how secure the product will be when the babies really start moving around. The product directions state that a child who can stand on his own should not use this product, had I known this, I wouldn't have purchased the item. Many babies around the age of 7-8mos are standing on their own and would still benefit with use of an exersaucer.I also have an evenflo exersaucer, abc-123,  and I feel it is a far superior product. It has a larger base, there are springs in the legs that allow the whole thing to bounce, the toys are more sturdy and have more manipulatable parts, there is an arial section which encourage babies to reach and stretch. The product also collapses for easier storage.I was reading some other reviews and there seemed to be a concern about the Einstein exersaucer flipping and another poster commented that there are stabilizers to ensure this does not happen, however, the company has eliminated these stabilizers, they do not come with this product. I, hopefully, assume they had recalled all the products and fixed the issue. Others complained that the toys came out of their sockets easily, this has been remedied...to the point that it is near impossible to remove the toys without risk of breaking them in the process.Overall, a decent product for the money...however, if you can spare the extra $30...get an evenflo.
