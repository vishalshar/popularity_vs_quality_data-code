I have been using this hamper for about a year for my baby's clothes.  We only ever use it for baby clothes, nothing too big or heavy, not that it should matter.  I think it's so cute and I love the handles, and I want to love it, but the fact is, it is falling apart.  I mean, literally ripping at the seams, and has been for awhile.  I plan to contact 3 Sprouts to see if they will replace is.  We have several of their products, and love how cute they are, but the durability of this specifically is bumming me out hardcore.
