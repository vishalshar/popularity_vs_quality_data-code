There are INDEED a lot of straps and if you lose the instructions, good luck!  The metal bar that keeps the main car seat attached to the base is a pain.  It is very difficult to get in, or out.  If you have to switch back and forth, you run the risk of breaking one of the tabs!  I only took ours out 3 times before one side tab broke and the other showed a lot of stress at the joint.  My son loved the seat from day one, which was a big deal because he was always weird about being in the car for any length of time.  He's almost 3 now and still loves it and it has grown with him, and he's still got room to keep growing.  I just wish it were easier to deal with!  It's also heavy - especially if you're like me and leave the booster attached so you don't lose it or damage it!  If you're going to spend over $100.00 on a carseat anyway, I think another model would give you a better value.  If I had tried this carseat out before I bought it, I would not have bought it!  My son's love for it is the only thing that has kept it around this long!
