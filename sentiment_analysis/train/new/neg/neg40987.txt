These cloth diapers are very easy to use--the design makes them easy to put on a baby of any size, are easy to wash, and they're cute. My issue was that our daughter wet through them, even with the big liner in the pouch, pretty quickly. Maybe we were using them wrong? I'd be willing to give them another try.
