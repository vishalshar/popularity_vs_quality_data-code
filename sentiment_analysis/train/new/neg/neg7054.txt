I was impressed with this item for the first 48hours. My little toddler could not open our pocket sliding door, and I was thrilled. My husband however open the latch to slide the door open, and part of the piece that was screwed into the actual door broke off. I don't know how it happened , but I was shocked since it was working so well! Is it possible to replace just that one piece ?
