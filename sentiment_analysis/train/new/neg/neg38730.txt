I would have given this Icy Diamond Tote a 5-star review when I first purchased it, as it does everything that it's supposed in keeping my Auvi-Q cool. In fact, the bag fits 2 Auvi-Q's comfortably. I haven't used the strap that came with the tote yet, but I have used the carabiner which makes it very convenient to clip to almost anything. Here's where my 3-stars comes in. The tote comes with 2 ice packs and after only 2 uses one of the ice packs exploded leaving a gooey liquid not only all over the inside and outside of the tote, but also all over my Auvi-Q's. If you buy this tote, I would recommend getting better ice packs so that you don't have the same problem that I did.
