This was much smaller than I had envisioned.  I use it as a small purse that attaches to the ergo. It is not big enough for wipes. The zippered pouch on the carrier itself is larger.I use it because I bought it.. But  if i had seen how large it was prior to purchase I wouldn't have bought it.  However, I do use it daily.
