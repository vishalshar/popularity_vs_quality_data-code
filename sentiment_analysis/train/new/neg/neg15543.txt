I wanted to love the Baby Soy gowns but they don't fit well. My newborn is totally average sized. She was 7lbs 2oz at birth and 21". These gowns fit her for a week (she was 7lbs at her 5 day pediatrician visit). The gowns are very short and way too tight at the bottom. Also, the hand openings are tiny, which made getting baby into these a real pain. I was disappointed because the fabric is so soft and the designs are adorable.
