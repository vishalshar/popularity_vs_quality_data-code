I purchased this seat for my son about a year ago.  As I write this today it is completely cracked. The "seat" area is cracked and the "hybak" has cracked so much that a piece of it has broken off.  I had the original cooshee seat for my daughter  for 6+ years with no problem. It still looks like new! but this new model has been awful. Very unhappy with it. Would not recommend it to anyone
