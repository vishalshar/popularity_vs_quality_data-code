I get the intend of this mat in terms of helping teach and exposing babies/infants/toddlers, etc., to the alphabet and letters.  After all, that was primarily the reason why I chose this play-mat.  The caveat is that there are so many pieces to the mat, that something as simple as trying to move it to a different area in the room, can easily cause it to have multiple pieces come apart. It's fairly large, so if a piece comes off and ends up under the big mat, it becomes a pain to try to get to it, to snap it back into place.  I returned it for that reason and picked a different one with more padding, but one big piece that makes it a lot easier to simply roll up for moving around or storing it
