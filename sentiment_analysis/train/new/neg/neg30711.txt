I've got three small kids and enough small parts from cups to fill a bucket.  My built in dishwasher baskets do not safely hold many of these small parts, so I wanted a separate basket to do the job.  I figured this was it--but no, it's not.  The holes on this are just as big as the holes in the baskets in my dishwasher, so straws can still manage to slip through and get lost.  The only difference is that this is pretty large.  I can throw lots of lids for cups in there, but I never had problems with lids getting lost or shifting in the dishwasher; only straws were a problem for me.  I guess I need to bite the bullet and start washing the straws by hand, in which case, this basket does not serve any special purpose for me at all.  I also really dislike the latching mechanism.  You need to shift the lid sideways and pull up.  I'd prefer something easier to do one-handed.
