At first sight this looks amazing because it is one of the few bathtubs for baby with elevated base so you don't have to end up with back and knees pain every time you are bathing your little one. Well, that's half true, it is elevated but not enough to avoid the back pain and I'm a small person (5'2'') so I wouldn't have to recline very much but I do, anyways it helps a little bit because you don't have to use the sink (which I personally dislike), a table, a chair or get on your knees on your bathroom floor to bath the baby. Secondly the bathtub it's actually kind of small so your baby fits very well until she is around 3 or 4 months, and I don't have a big baby, she measures only 24 inches now and she hits her head against the bathtub walls everytime she kicks or even moves abruptly (which for all babies is inevitable), the bathtub will work for my baby again when she is capable of sit down but in the meantime we need to be careful with her in the bathtub. To finish, the drain tube included, does not work as expected it falls down constantly if you don't place it in a very specific position (which shouldn't be, because you know, being a tube, it should turn without much trouble and should fit perfectly in the bathtub hole) and you end up with a water mess in the floor...you need to hold the tube tight yourself while it drains the water or tape it or figure out something to drain the water with the tube. At the end I decided not to use the tube and drain the water myself with a cube, not good. I would expect a much better product for the price. I recommend to buy a regular bathtub, at least you will be able to maybe sit down in the bathroom floor and drain the water from the bathtub right there without doing a mess.
