It's a nice playmat, very appealing color combination for the home, and the size of the tiles (1ft x 1ft) makes for tighter fit around corners and furniture when going for a custom layout.  Be aware that it is more on the lines of a soft foam than a springy rubber; so I wouldn't use it for heavy traffic area or wear shoes on it. Also, the intricate cutaway designs is a bit more tedious to place back if you accidentally knock them out while moving the mat.  I subsequently bought 2 additional mats like this but with a simpler design.  My baby loves it!
