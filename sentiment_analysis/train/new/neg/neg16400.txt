I saw this very product in Target for $60! Obviously, I decided the much more reasonable $33 was the way to go here on Amazon. Unfortunately, this thing fell waaay below expectations. I gave it a 2-star rating because the little seat part is well padded and fits on my chairs for my toddler, but I got this for my baby who absolutely hates it. Not because the toys aren't interesting, because one is (the roller ball), but because it's darn near impossible to get him in and out without a struggle or a wound! I didn't return it basically due to the hassle and the fact that I can use just the seat, but honestly, I can't believe they are selling this with the ease of injury. The swivel saucer that attaches to the seat can not only pinch them when your putting them in, it can also catch as your rotating the saucer--which you have to do since that's where the toys are. It's a great idea but very poorly executed. Send me a message if you need pictures or more info, I'd be happy to spare a parent wasted money and my pics don't post on half of my reviews. Here's to hoping they improve this product in the future!
