This is a decent kids' dish set and it has held up well so far (we've had it for 6 months). No problems in the dishwasher on the top or bottom racks. The one complaint I have (which others have addressed and which is why I gave this 3 stars) is that the colorful picture is misleading (at least for some of us) as our set did not include any blue dishes. We received one red, one yellow, one green, and two orange of each item. I would have preferred to have the blue instead of two oranges. But overall a good set.
