The lids on these bottles won't stay on after the first use at daycare.  They would start out tight in the morning, but by the end of the day, they would be leaking and a couple of times they fell off, dumping milk all over my baby.  I thought the daycare people were doing something wrong and then experienced it myself - you just couldn't keep them screwed on. Had to buy something else.
