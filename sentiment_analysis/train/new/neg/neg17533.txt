I am 5'2" and Just 20 weeks when I got this pillow. I get what they are trying to make but I thought it was poor quality. There was to much stuffing so my neck hurt every morning and no zipper to take some put. My hips would also hurt from the from to much stuffing between my legs. The curved part that is supposed to go up around your shoulder was so poorly sewn that the curve of the fabric actually dug into my skin, I tried flipping it around so now the part that should be at your legs was at my head. Also if you need to turn you have to take the whole pillow with you. What a pain! If you didn't like this one you will not like the boppy version. Some of the same problems. Luckily I finallu found what works for me.
