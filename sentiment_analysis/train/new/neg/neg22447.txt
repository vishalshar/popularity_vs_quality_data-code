This mat claims to be reusable, but it's not after you get it dirty. The design rubs off with water. Not washable- it does not adhere to the floor so it you move the highchair, the mat will come with it. It will not stay in place. Also, it comes folded (obviously) but when you lay it out flat, the fold lines stay in it, even after some time. It will never be smooth. I give it two stars because it wasn't expensive, but no more because it's useless to me now.
