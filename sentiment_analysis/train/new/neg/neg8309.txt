I love that this holder folds, and that it's adjustable. Some juice pouches (caprisun sun, honest kids, etc.) tend to partially fall out because there's no bottom piece to hold it, only two small triangles to keep the juice box/pouch in the holder. Also, the holder is adjustable, but if you have a strong toddler who likes to squeeze things, the adjuster easily shrinks (unadjusts itself) and squeezes out juice, defeating the purpose of the holder...
