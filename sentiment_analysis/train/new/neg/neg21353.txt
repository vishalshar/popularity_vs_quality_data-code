I really wanted to live this bag and couldn't wait to get it. When it arrived, I was rather underwhelmed. It's just a messangwr bag with stroller straps, a checklist (which is actually quite insulting as it implies that men have no idea what they are doing when it comes to babies), and a changing pad. The front three pockets are rather small so you can't fit much into them but the main pocket is pretty decent sized.I think that the bag is fine all in all but there's nothing super special about to warrant the price. I may return this and re-order the DadGear back pack.
