I don't like these.Pros:1. These are very easy to install. Simply press into place.2. Color blends in well with the outlet.3. Very cheap (price, that is...see below for quality problems)Cons:1. If you have fingers bigger than the average 6 year-old, good luck getting these off when you need to. You either need to use a screwdriver to pry a corner while pushing the center "push tab", or tear your fingers up with extreme pressure.2. You have to be a master at "Twister - the Hand Version" to get these off. Push tab serves no purpose. It was SUPPOSED to add leverage to allow you to use one-hand to slide it out of the socket, but I always end up doing the following:  A: Using my right hand's thumb and middle finger, grip the sides.  B: Using my left hand's thumb, reach up in-between my right hand's death-grip and push hard on the center push  lever  C: Using my left hand's pointer finger, reach over and down, in-between my right hand's grip, and pull at the top of the plug  D: Apply steady, painful pressure on all points, until my fingers start to hurt, or it comes off3. Little fingers can more easily wiggle their points into the protector, kind of defeats the purpose...Overall: I DON'T LIKE IT - 2 STARSAvoided one star because of the price...I shouldn't have cheaped-out on these, spend a few more dollars, and gotten better ones. Caveat Emptor.
