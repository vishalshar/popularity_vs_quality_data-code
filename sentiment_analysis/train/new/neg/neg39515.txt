I like these bottles because you can pump directly into them from a Medela pump and store them in the freezer.  They are also much cheaper than the Medela bottles.  However, the day I pumped into them away from home, I was super disappointed to realize that they leak when tipped over.  They need to stay upright at all times, which is difficult in a soft-sided cooler or lunch box.  Just be aware of this if you purchase them.
