These ice packs are not very hardy.  The first day using one and it came home with a big hole in it.  The other is still usable but they are definitely not a good choice for using in a kids lunch box.  The hard-sided packs would be better to withstand daily lunch box use.  The quality of these packs do not match up with the price paid.
