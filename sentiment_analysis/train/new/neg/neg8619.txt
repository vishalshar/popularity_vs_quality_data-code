MAMS nipples flow much faster than other brands. When my 9 mo old was a newborn the 1s were too fast, and we had to use Munchkin Latch bottles for awhile (this was a pain because the Munchkin nipples collapse in on themselves). Once she got a little older we switched back to MAMS and they have been great. At 9 mos old, she is ready for a faster flow. We tried the 2s; they are slightly faster than the 1, but we though she could handle somethig a little faster. We tried the 3s (advertised as 4+ mos) and they are WAY too fast. When you hold the bottle upside down with a 3, it is a constant drip (almost a flow) of milk. She can hold her own bottle, and she will take 2 or 3 sucks then have to stop and catch her breath, and then when she stops to catch her breath the bottle is still dripping into her mouth and she gets choked up. We will stick with the 2s for now.  Mams needs a nipple slower than their 1 and another that is between their 2 and 3.
