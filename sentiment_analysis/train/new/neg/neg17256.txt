My favorite diapers are bumGenius 4.0. Some have compared those to alva baby pocket diapers, and essentially they are similar because they are both pocket diapers, have 3 rows of lengthening snaps…but these are obviously made in China and are not the same quality that bumGenius diapers are. HOWEVER, if you are like me and realize you can spend $100 on 6 bumGenius or $54 on 11 Alva Baby diapers (which is what I did) to beef up your supply then you take the china made product with its faults.PROS:-CHEAP! You can get these at a fraction of the cost- but I recommend buying straight from their website. They are even cheaper on there.-Adjustable waist. I really like that the waist wings will over lap. I feel like these run large. When my son was 4 months old we were still snapping them on top of each other. But to me that just means he will be able to wear them longer.CONS:-Leaks. These definitely leak way more than my bumGenius or Best Bottom diapers. Higher quality diapers have a PUL layer that goes up, over and just inside the tops of the diaper. These do not, and they have a tendency to slightly roll down so then it is just the inside cloth against his clothes. Meaning once the cloth gets wet his clothes will be wet. So I just have to be very on top of changing him when I know he is in these diapers. And I try not to have him wear these if he is going to be in a carseat for very long…they seem to leak more then too-Quality. They are definitely made in china. I found a bead trapped between the lining and the PUL layer lolBottom line- If I could go back and do it all over again, I would only buy bumGenius diapers, and not waste money experimenting with other kinds. But since I don't have a time machine handy, we still use these every day. I just know that if I want to make sure he is in a leakproof diaper, I reach for the bumGenius and keep these for when we are just at home.
