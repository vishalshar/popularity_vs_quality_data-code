I was so excited about this seat, it seemed to be everything I was looking for. However, this is NOT a "high back booster" it doesn't have a back at all. After reading all the installation instructions I realized that this seat requires seat anchors to be installed properly with the 5 point harness. Unlike a "high back booster" this seat is just seat fabric on the back and has an anchor strap that runs from the seat bottom up to the head rest. This anchor strap must be placed over the top of the vehicles seat and clipped into the vehicles seat anchor, which my van doesn't have! I did a lot of research on this product including theSafety 1st website and found no description of this feature. I am currently returning my seat to Amazon, their return policy is excellent I was told I would receive a refund as well as a re-embursment on the return shipping cost.
