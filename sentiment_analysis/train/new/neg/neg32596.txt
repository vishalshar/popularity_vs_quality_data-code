While these are the cutest wall decals, they didn't stick to the wall! I am of the opinion that if a product states it will do something, it better live up to its promise! I had to use some reinforcement glue underneath each decal because within an hour, most, if not all of the decals were falling off. And my walls were freshly painted, they were not dirty whatsoever. I contacted the seller and they responded once, asking if I would like a refund. I responded back and said yes, but then I never heard back!? Anyway, if you really like the design, and you are willing to take the extra step to stick these to the wall with some reinforcement glue, I would say buy them because it turned out so adorable!
