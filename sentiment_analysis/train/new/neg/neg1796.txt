I have no idea how this thing got decent reviews. Its awful! Just buy a cheap dish drying rack and it'll work better. The thing falls over and falls apart constantly, with the bottles smashing to the floor, and then me needing to wash them again. It is composed of two plastic pieces that are supposed to lock together in back. But they hardly lock and always come apart. When you put a few bottles on they fall over. I finally had to take the two pieces apart, sit the whole thing on a rack, and tie both pieces to a shelf to keep them upright. But more than that, the little sticks that you stick the bottles on also fall out constantly. I'm always picking them up off the floor. Dumbest contraption ever. When you're sleep deprived and washing bottles over and over, the last thing you need is this taking up your time.
