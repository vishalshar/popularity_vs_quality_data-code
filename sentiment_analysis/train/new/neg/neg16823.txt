It's okay... here are my thoughts.Pros:- Gives piece of mind if your kid is a "light" roller when he/she sleeps.- Stays under sheets so it's not quite as ugly.Cons:- Looks to be too expensive for what it really is... a cut-in-half foam cylinder.- Makes getting back into bed difficult for the kid.- My kid likes to use it as a jumping board to jump off the bed with.- Collects a ton of dust and hair.Given that this is what I consider to be a "transitional" item, I think it's fine and I'm hoping it lasts long enough for kid #2 to use it and be done with it so that I could proceed to incinerate it along with everything it has collected over the years.
