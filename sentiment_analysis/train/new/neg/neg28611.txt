It's a smooth ride, don't get me wrong. It's easy to maneuver, safe, the bar comes up really high, and the wheels can take a beating over cobblestone and uneven concrete.However, I'm not in love with this stroller because of the straps. If you live in a warm climate and plan on popping your kid in here with just a t-shirt, the stroller can work. But add in the cocoon-- totally necessary for a new baby and certainly in the 6 months out of the year when it's cold here-- it is SO difficult to get your kid seated in this stroller.The problem lies with the straps. They twist and turn and get tangled. Then, once they're twisted about three or four times, they become significantly shorter, so when you try to use the buckle, you are pulling the straps tightly over your kid's crotch. Add in the cocoon, a big pram/snowsuit plus pants, a diaper, and maybe two or three layers (onesie, shirt, sweater) that's a lot of fabric to cover. The straps can't really be adjusted when you're kid's in there (again, in cold weather).Plus, accessories are prohibitively expensive.
