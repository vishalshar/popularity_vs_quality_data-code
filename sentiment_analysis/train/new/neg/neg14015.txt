I bought these because I thought they looked "neat."  I'm not sure about the claims of getting more milk - I think that's related to the oxytocin release of pleasure from playing with something new while pumping, which is soooo boring.I have to say, they are great for the first 5 uses, but they wear out quickly.  The soft part started getting what I would describe as air pockets while I pumped, which led to major bruising on the underside of my right breast.  One note, I sanitize my breast pump parts with boiling water after every use, and I think that is what caused the quality issues with the SoftFit.  Maybe it warped or melted?  It's the only Medela part I've had this issue with, but I can't imagine what else caused the air pockets.I've actually switched back to the hard shells because of the bruising, but I'm sure I'll give these another go eventually.For fit - they seem to fit slightly tighter around my nipple that the same size normal breastshields, and I have fairly small nipples/areolas.  If you have larger breasts, I would totally avoid these!
