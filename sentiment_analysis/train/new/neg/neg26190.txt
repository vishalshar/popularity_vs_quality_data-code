The printed top piece is only attached to the fleece backing along the perimeter of the blanket. It shifts all over and we cannot get the blanket to lay smooth and flat. Very frustrating.We bought this to be used in the crib because we do not want to use the bumper, crib skirt, etc that comes with the crib kit. We thought it would be good cost savings. I wish the crib quilt was sold separately.
