I tried and tried, my husband, the nanny and my friends too, (all VERY smart people!) we all tried with no luck, the seat moves back and forward and side to side TOOMUCH, there was NO WAY you can put a baby there! and I mean NO WAY. I research the internet, most parents have the same problem and are seeking for advice on several websites. THE SOLUTION: put 4 BIG towels rolled to compensate the lack of design. I don't understand why you have to put so many towels, Safety First should correct this problem modifying the angle of the base. as soon as you modify the angle considerably by putting the towels, the seatbelt has more traction and the car seat doesn't move. The instructions say you "might "need to put "a" rolled towel... They shoud say YOU MUST PUT SEVERAL ROLLED TOWELS! It was very frustrating, the base is so flat that the seatbelt can't pull the carseat ENOUGH, that's why you have to modify the angle, to let the seatbelt grab a more vertical side of the seat, otherwise is so horizontal, it can't grab it! I contacted the people from safety first, they said is because cars have different angles in seats, so you have to adjust it. The truth is, I purchased a Britax because I hated the SAFETY FIRST carseat, and it works perfect! no rolled towels needed. We installed the Britax in an Infinity, a Civic and an Altima with no problem... So why Britax can and Safety First can't? no answer for that! But if you purchased a car seat like this one, be prepared to experience frustration when installing it, and say good bye to several towels in order to keep your child safe! Pretty car seat, seems comfortable for the baby, but horribly design when installing it rear facing.
