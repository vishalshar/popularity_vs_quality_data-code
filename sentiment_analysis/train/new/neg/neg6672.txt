I love this seat. It's very comfortable for my little guy and provides more support than some other boosters for when he falls asleep, etc.  My only issue with it is the cover looks a little cheap. I was hoping for better quality fabric as this will get pretty dingy pretty quickly and need cleaned frequently.
