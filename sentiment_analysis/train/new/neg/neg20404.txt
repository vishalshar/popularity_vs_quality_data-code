I was excited to purchase this but upon opening the product, i was a bit disappointed. it only covers 3 sides of the crib so thank goodness my crib is against a wall so that would not matter.  The crib skirt also is a bit small. It says that it fits standard cribs, mine is a standard crib and it does not quite fit. The only pro is that the color and pattern is true to the picture.
