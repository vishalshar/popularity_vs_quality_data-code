Bought this in Feb 2011 for a newborn.  It's nice and portable, folds up easily for storage which I love.  Toys are pretty lame but most of the time I don't even use the bar as my baby is busy looking at me or the ceiling fan lol.  My number one gripe about this swing is that the baby doesn't really lay nice in it.  By that I mean the seat is more of a cup... probably protecting them from tipping the swing and/or falling out since it's so lightweight.  But no matter what the babies head is constantly cocked to the left or right because it is such a drastic angle.  For the price you really can't complain because he is 2 months now and still falls asleep in it..., but it can't be comfortable for him.
