Zipper color doesn't match coin purse very well. Not labeled as leather, but it does appear to be genuine leather. Purse itself is quite soft. Scraps of fabric used as stuffing, an eco friendly use of what would normally be thrown out... Kudos to the international vendor for accurately representing contents and value on the mailer. That hasn't always been my experience.
