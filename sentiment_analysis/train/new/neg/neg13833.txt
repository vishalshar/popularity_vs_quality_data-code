It's pretty but overpriced. I really liked the print so I shopped around to get the best price. I ended up purchasing with Amazon but I still feel like they are asking too much for what it is. The sheet feels like a poor quality sheet. The crib skirt and comforter look nice. It looks just like the picture. The comforter is very soft.
