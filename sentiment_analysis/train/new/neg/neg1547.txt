I ordered this blanket for my infant daughter to snuggle with at daycare. I fell in love with the design and I've loved other A&A products that I have- so I threw caution to the wind after reading a few bad reviews and pushed the button to order. When it arrived, I was floored with how soft it was and excited with my purchase. However, when I pulled it out of the dryer after washing, I was appalled to find the condition it was in. There were threads everywhere and there was a large area (5" x 5") that looked like it had been a attacked by a cat (which I have none). With these threads coming loose so easily, I would think this is highly dangerous given how easily infants can get threads wrapped around their fingers/toes. I've never had something fall apart so quickly- I'm sorely disappointed. Especially given the price- what a horrible product.
