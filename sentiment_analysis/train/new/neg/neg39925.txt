I was quite unhappy with this purchase. Not only did I receive a tube of cream with an expiration date only 2 months past my purchase date, but also noticed that it made my baby's diaper rash worse. I ended up throwing away the cream and using extra-strength Desitin, which worked better by far. While it wasn't expensive, I still feel it was a waste of money and need to ask for a refund. Hopefully it works better for your baby!!
