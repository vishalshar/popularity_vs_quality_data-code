Our current housing is small so we purchased this instead of a infant tub. I like it because it dries quickly and thoroughly unlike the big sponge ones. We also like it because instead of the infant laying flat he is in a reclined position that allows him to see more and he loves being able to kick his feet in the water you can't do that with the sponges. This one also folds for storage making it even smaller. The only thing I would change would be making the mesh with a little more give to cradle the infant a little more and help with the sliding issue (when your baby kicks and moves around they slide down a little) my boy is over 10lbs now and the mesh still doesn't give much and stays straight instead of cradling him.
