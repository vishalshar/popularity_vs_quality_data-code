Wanted an organic natural 100% pure pillow and this was the best I could find.  Pillow arrived and it is VERY FIRM.  So, if you are thinking this pillow will give over time, think again. I punch it and move the cotton inside around to try and soften it.  The pillow case that contains the cotton is stitched closed so there is not getting inside. It's quality built and as indicated by other reviewers, this pillow does have an odor to it.  It's unique smelling and reminds me of a natural smell perhaps but since I've never smelled organic cotton, I can't pinpoint it.  I DID wash this (which now I read you shouldn't) and the pillow was like a rock!  It was so heavy with water....it took 4 hours in a dryer to dry it...and then still damp, re-dried over 2 days!  Don't wash yours!  Pillow dried but odor is still there...have had pillow for almost a month now.  I like it when I sleep on my side and cradle it in my arms (like I'm holding someone) for extra support of my other arm.  Works well!  All in all, the pillow is worth the try if you want purity and an organic cotton.  Buy from Amazon so you can return if unhappy.  Nighty night!
