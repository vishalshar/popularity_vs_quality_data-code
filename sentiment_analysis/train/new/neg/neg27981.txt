This is the most moronic thing I have ever been pressured into buying.  New moms will buy almost anything to keep their baby safe, and this is the perfect example. I wish I'd just cut out a big piece of cardboard to fit the crib size and put that under the mattress.  There is truthfully ZERO reason to spend more than $2.00 on a piece of wood.  I mean...seriously.  I blame myself, really.  But I warn all of you...this is an absurd purchase.
