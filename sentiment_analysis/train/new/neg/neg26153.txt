I tend to skip this cup most of the time in favor of my son's other cups. It's not terrible, but it's enough of a pain that I'd prefer to use the other cups he has if I can.Pros:It holds a lot of liquid.Seems like it might be easier for a young baby to hold.It doesn't leak.Pretty sturdy.. as it should be since toddlers pitch everything onto the floor.Only has 3 parts to wash.Cons:The suction in this cup is a little weird. My son will take a few sips and the whole top starts to suction in, and it becomes harder and harder for him to get liquid out. I end up having to open it, let it equalize, and screw it back together while listening to his frustrated crying. Ugh.The handles kinda suck. It seems like it actually makes it harder for him to hold it since he was already used to cups with no handles (he's 18 months). Worse yet, it really only works as a meal time cup, since it doesn't fit in his stroller or car seat cup holders. I only have so many of the more expensive "spill proof" cups and I prefer to use those when out and about.Can't choose your color. This isn't that big of a deal to me, but carting around this pink sippy cup for my son feels a little cringe-worthy. Not enough to make me stop, but it's a minor annoyance.
