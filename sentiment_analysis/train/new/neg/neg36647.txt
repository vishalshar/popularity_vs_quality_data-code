The gym is really cute and colorful. However, it is short and too flat. My baby's feet are sticking out (at not even 3 months of age) if I place him in a way that makes it possible for him to reach for the toys. If I lay him down with his head at the top of the mat he does fit on it but then the toys are out of reach AND out of sight unless he tilts his chin onto his chest. I have to put a blanket or pillow under his head to allow him to have a more comfortable head position.He loves the ladybug, though.
