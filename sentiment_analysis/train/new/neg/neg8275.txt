Im so disappointed in this transaction.  The baby book itself would have been great, had it not looked like it was sitting around someones house for years.  I actually had to wipe stuff off the back, and there is a spot i cant get off the front part of the ribbon.  The package that it came in looks dirty and the top part of the plastic isnt attached.  I thought I was purchasing a new baby book.  Im disgusted because I have no time to return it before the baby shower.  Im not sure what Im going to do.
