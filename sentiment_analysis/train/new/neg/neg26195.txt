We used to have a similar model in Europe and would have like to find something similar in US. BUT here, the quality is mediocre. A lot of pieces are too cheaply made and would break easily after several month of use. The seat keeps pointing upwards when installed. We would have intended to use as a substitute for a carrycot but it's way not comfortable enough and there is no extra pad that really fits this model available. One part of the brakes is missing and they said it's part of the model in US. So you'll have to put the brake on on each side. No rain cover included in US neither!Good points: Canopy good. Relatively compact when folded. Stands alone and can hold packages on the back, what I like. Basket not no bad for this kind of stroller.
