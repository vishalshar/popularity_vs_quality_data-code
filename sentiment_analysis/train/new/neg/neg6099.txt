The harness is well-made, and the Minnie Mouse animal is adorable. However, our granddaughter is now 1 y 4 m old, running all over the place, and weighs 22 lbs. -- yet she's not tall enough for the harness buddy. When we pull the straps tight, the harness comes up under her chin and is very uncomfortable. We ended up buying a simpler model which doesn't look as good but works just fine.I would have wanted to know the minimum height that a toddler had to be in order to use the harness before buying.
