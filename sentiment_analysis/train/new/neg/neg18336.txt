I liked that this was one of the more spacious play mats, and I liked the design on this one, however for the money, it's not worth it. It says that it comes with 9 toys, ore something like that but they are counting the pillow, and each of the 2 leaves as toys that dangle from it. There is no cushion under the middle of the mat which is fine because you can always put blankets underneath it. Also the music is really really soft. The lights on the music center are kinda lame, in that the animal pictures are very dark and dim, and the lights are actually just one light that bounces from corner to corner. Basically the light does not light up the music box at all. Very very cheap.Last but not least I bought this for my 4 month old daughter at the time, and when we put her in it she was very, very, bored. We also bought her a jumperoo which she loves. I guess this might be okay for really young babies who don't move around much and just like to observe. If you have a very active and playful baby, this might not be fore you.
