I was slightly disappointed in this product.  Mainly because of the size.  It is very small.  We bought it as an accessory to our daughters tent (which is awesome and we purchased on Amazon) the quality is good, but it is just too small.  Doesn't serve as a wrap nor a carpet.  More like a medium sized stuffie with no stuffing
