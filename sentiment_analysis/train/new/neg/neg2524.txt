I loved this product for our daughter until she was about 10 weeks old. She outgrew it quite quickly. Granted, she's a larger, taller baby than most, but I can't imagine anyone using it for more than six months without their baby feeling crammed in. It's really easy to clean but if your baby has an accident while they're in it, it pools underneath them just like any other diaper changer. I wouldn't buy again. For the price, they should make it longer and larger.
