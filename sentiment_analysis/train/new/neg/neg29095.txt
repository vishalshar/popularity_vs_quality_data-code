I love this car seat. I have yet to use it as my daughter isn't due for another couple of months. But it's so pretty. The colors are not the same as what is pictured. In the pic it looks more neon and it's actually more of pastel colors. I actually like the actual color better but if I didn't like the pastel colors I would have been very disappointed. I gave it 5 stars because not only do I like the design of the car seat it is very easy to instal and adjust the shoulder belt and bottom buckle. I also really like the way the shoulder straps loosen and tighter it at the top rather then by the crotch like a graco car seat. However I do wish the release lever that detaches the car seat from the base was higher by the head like a graco. This one is more towards the bottom. Not a huge deal I just personally prefer the gracos way to detach the two then this one. Also the car seat is very light weight and I really like the z handle. The shipping was also very fast :)Update.. (9 months later) I originally gave it 5 stars and now I give it 3. The plastic part that holds the seat belt down when buckling it up with out the base (only done it like this 6 times) broke. I feel like using a car seat the way it's intended to be used there definitely shouldn't be any plastic breaking off. It make me worried to think how it would hold up in an accident. I opened up a claim for a return/refund and I will update again once I hear back from the company as Amazon said I needed to talk to them
