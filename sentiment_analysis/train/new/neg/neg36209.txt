I bought this cover because of the cute chevron print. Maybe I should have looked more careful, but the other side is a "furry" grey material. The zippered side is on the chevron print side, so its like having the "pretty side" on the back of the pillow. Mostly you don't put baby on the zippered side.... So, as far as fit and functionality, this product is fine. But, if you are buying it for the chevron printed side, just know that it is actually on the back side.
