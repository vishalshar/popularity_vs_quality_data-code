These are inexpensive to begin with, but when they arrived we thought the quality was poor even at our purchase price.  We thought they would arrive with a darker brown finishing, but out of the box they are faded in color just like the pictures here on Amazon.  My wife and I recommend that you pass on these decorative pieces and buy something out of the Willow series, but made of better quality.
