Beware!!!! I purchased this product for my mother to use at her house with my son. She didn't open it until a month after she received it, only to find out that it had a few missing pieces however more than that - it does not fit on any table or counter in a safe position. Because I purchased via Amazon, the manufacturer - Regalo, will not return or replace or honor the warranty. It's beyond amazons 30 days and stores123 will not return or exchange the product either as their policy is only 7, yes 7 days to return an item. Closing my Amazon account right now - never again getting stiffed on a product that is brand new and doesn't work and is completely defective.
