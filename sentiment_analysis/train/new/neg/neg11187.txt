The photo for this item shows that it is CLIA certified organic cotton, however the blanket I received does not state this anywhere.  Being that it's made in China, this made me suspicious.  This blanket is also incredibly lightweight.  I'm not sure how "thermal" could be used in any way to describe it.  It's not a bad blanket (although it never got used or washed since I returned it, so I can't say how it would hold up), but the description's a bit misleading and it's not what we were looking for.
