I didn't like the car seat which we've been using since birth. The strap adjustment is actually from the back of the car seat. Instead of the traditional strap coming out (approximately) from the buckle in between the baby's legs. This makes adjusting the strap much more cumbersome, since you have to reach around to make adjustments (since normally you will be facing the car seat while putting the baby in. Also, the horizontal chest clip on the two shoulder straps seems to dig into the baby when pulled tight (you are supposed to have them tight). The cover or cowl to shield the baby doesn't seem to come up to the handle when the handle is at it's normal upright carrying position for the car seat.  It only reaches the handle at one position-click prior to the normal upright position for the handle - what do you do when you have to carry the baby across a sunny parking lot?Finally the thing that I really didn't like - the two shoulder straps seem to rub edgewise against the baby's neck - there should be something done over there by Graco to take care of that. The baby chafes a lot at those strap edges against the neck.On the plus side the car seat is very easy to set up in the car. The base gets attached by the seatbelt really easily. The car seat clicks into place in the base really easily and can be detached just as easily.  Materials used do feel a bit cheap.I'd recommend you buy something else.Still haven't assembled the stroller as yet.
