I ordered this Shampoo shower bathing protect soft cap for my 8 months old daughter on Jan 22 when it was on sale for $1.89. After spending 1 hour reading reviews, I changed my mind and tried to cancel the order. However, the seller didn't allow me to and sent a message said that the product has been shipped (Really?? shipped after the order just made in an hour??). Then, I received the product on Feb 10 which is almost 3 weeks later. My friend who lives 30 minutes from me ordered this on the same day and got hers one week earlier.The quality of the product is ok, feel like cheap water-proof material. It came in a bubble wrapped envelope with the cap folded in half. Therefore, when I first used it, it took me awhile to fix the hole that is caused by the fold. There are 4 buttons that allows me to adjust to the right size for my daughter's head. Her head is about 43 cm and the innermost button works. I have been using this cap to bath my baby for almost 10 days. It works well but I have to fix the hole that caused by the fold every once awhile and worry the water may get into her eyes.Overall, my experience with this cap is fine but I donâ€™t like how the seller deals with my cancellation.
