I personally do not like these! Maybe I bought the wrong size after reading a few reviews, but they do not stretch like I thought they would. Also, when I purchased them I had no idea there were different sizes to choose from! My husband and I prefer to use the pre fold without the snappi, much easier! They do hold onto the fabric very well which is why I still gave them 3 stars, it may just be my user error for not liking them.
