These seemed like a good idea but did not work for me. They do keep my pants buttoned, but my expanding pregnant belly also makes it difficult to zip my pants. Using these extenders increases the space between the buttons on my pants, making it even more likely that the zipper will fall down. These might work in very, very early pregnancy, but now that my belly is big enough to keep normal pants from buttoning and zipping, it is just time to move on to maternity clothing. I also found that the extenders are not adjustable enough, so they are either too loose or too tight.
