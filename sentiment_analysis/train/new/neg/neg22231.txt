We were new first time parents and were buying everything left and right for our baby. but, i gotta admit, these nursery care kits are really not needed. Nothing against this particular company. Im talking about these nursery care kits in general. All you need is the digital themometer.As for this company's product, the kit is good. we also use the nail clippers a lot and it works great. but other than the themometer and nail clippers, all the other stuff becomes kinda useless like the comb, brush, syringe, bulb, etc.
