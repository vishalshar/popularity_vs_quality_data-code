We were needing a car seat cover to take on a trip up north for the holidays.  This one got okay reviews and seemed to be a good deal for the money.  I would have to rate it as just that - it's okay and useful but didn't wow me.The pros -- nice and warm so you don't have to worry with bulky coats or blankets- waterproof so it's great in the rainThe cons -- needs a button, snap or something...the flap tends to come open easily so when you're in wind and rain it can be a pain to keep the flap up during transport; i ended up sewing a snap on ours- not quite enough extra slack in the material - when it's on the car seat it seems like it's very close to his face; i use the shade part of the carseat to give it some lift and bring it up but there isn't much extra material so sometimes it rides up off the topOverall it's handy but has some quirks to work around...
