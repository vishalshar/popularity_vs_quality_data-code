I read the reviews on this bag before purchasing and thought it would be a good purchase because everyone raved about how it let all the sand out.  Silly me - what I didn't really understand is that it lets all the sand in first.  EVERYTHING got covered in sand.  I decided to use only for toys, but the velcro closures don't stick well and it opens too easily so the toys fall out in the back of my car.
