My son absolutely needs this thing on his crib! Will not sleep without it... With that being said, it costs us A LOT of money! This thing costs us 11 dollars and some odd cents a month In batteries... Times that by 12 months... There's no reason this toy has to cost someone $145 in batteries a year.. Plus the toys itself is roughly 40! We love it but hate it...
