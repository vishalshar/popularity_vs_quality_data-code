I've had this stroller about 8 months now and use it for my now 2 yr old and 8 month old. After this much time of using it i can definitely comment on what works and what doesn't work anymore. I agree with the other list of pros and cons but want to add somethings I think will be helpful to know after months of use of this stroller.Positives:- Fantastic infant car seat adapter that even fit my Maxi Cosi cabrio fix (bought in europe)- Loads of storage space underneath and can actually hold quite a bit of weight- Great to have the ability to put stools in multiple orientations to suit both kids moods- Pretty smooth ride for kids and both are able to sleep in itNegatives:- The horribly inadequate screws in the handlebar are a very bad design. The entire handlebar is held onto the frame by 2 very tiny screws, and since you have to pull and push on the handlebar to steer with two children in, pull and push on the handlebar to fold, unfold, load, and unload the stroller, the handlebar gets lots of stress put on it. Within 2 weeks one of the screws fell out, we replaced it only to have it fall out again repeatedly. Have replaced it now about 15 times in 8 months and still having the same problem.- The steering isn't as good after several months of use, the stroller tends to pull to the left. It can be pushed in a straight line if you grip the handlebar very tightly, but even that doesn't work well if the above-mentioned screw falls out.I hope that Contours can fix the problem with the inadequate screws because that would then make this stroller a 5 star.
