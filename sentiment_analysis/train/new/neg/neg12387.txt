I bought this chewey for one of my students who was chewing up all the pencils in the room. He really likes it because it's not too hard and it provides lots of oral input. The downside is that it whistles and can be disruptive during class time and it's super slobbery. I'm off to find a new one that is not hollow and collects saliva like a trumpet.
