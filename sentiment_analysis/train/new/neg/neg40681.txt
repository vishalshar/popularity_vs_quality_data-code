My 2 month old EBF baby has been refusing bottles since I returned to work. After a few attempts we got her to drink from this bottle. Definitely not a slow flow in my opinion. She choked a couple times and a good amount trickled out the side of her mouth. Bottle base feels a bit thin. Like I could squeeze it and easily sent it in. We'll see how it goes. Nipple is a good shape and nice texture. Wish there was a slower flow!
