I saw all the bad reviews and yet STILL bought it because there were not many other options that were affordable. The only thing in there I use is the nail clippers and even those are cheap. Shame on me for not heeding the reviews. I advise against this kit. Only issue is I don't know what to recommend instead! Still searching for myself!
