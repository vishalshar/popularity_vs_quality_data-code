I was pleasantly surprised at the number of products Babies R Us carries for making and storing home mad baby food, and found these trays (though the matching bowl was out of stock).I like the fact that these have covers, which makes the stackable and helps maximize freezer space, and are BPA free. The fact that you can write on them means little to me as I would never use them for long term storage and if I just cooked the food the day before I am pretty sure I can remember what it is for when I transfer it to a ziploc baggie.  The shaped cubes fitting in the matching bowl is cute too.  The problem with this product is, I've already cracked one of them trying to twist them to get the food out.  They are too brittle and don't release the cubes.  That being said, after I cracked the first one, I ran the second one under warm water for a second and the cubes released.  That is all well and good but the first one was already broken.  Kidco is going to replace it though, I just spoke to their customer service and I have to send a picture of the cracked one and they will send me a new one.  A warning on the box would be helpful in avoiding this situation.I also bought at Wilton silicone baking sheet with small square cubes, and it is easier to get the cubes out but they are only about 1/2 oz. each which is too small.  The thought struck me to use silicone muffin pans instead.  This is what I am going to do from now on. If you have a beginning eater, you can use mini muffin pans, and if you have a child who is eating more, you can use the standard size muffin pan.  By placing a cooling rack between each muffin pan, you can easily stack these on top of one another in the freezer.  And when you don't need them to make baby food you can use them to bake muffins and cupcakes.
