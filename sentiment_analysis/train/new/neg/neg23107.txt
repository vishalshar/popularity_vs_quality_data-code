We bought this car seat directly from amazon in February 2010. It is a *large* mostly comfortable seat and we used in the middle of the back seat in Dodge Caliber and currently in Outlander. Yes it takes more space than any other car seat I saw thus far. I love how "smooth" Britax car seats are for buckling and unbuckling.  The down side is that the threads do get entangled (especially if you first close the shoulder straps (which for some reason my siblings keep doing :( Apart from that it looks OK and feels safe.I would give this car seat 3 stars, but one shouldn't be buying this model -- it is retired since January 2010 based on britax website and since I just found that out, I am actually pretty upset with amazon for selling it in February.. (I didn't figure out there was a difference between Frontier 85 and plain Frontier model).
