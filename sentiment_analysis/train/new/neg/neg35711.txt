Wow, this tub smelled terrible when I opened the package!  It was a combination of the main material and the screenprint film.  It made my head spin. I called Kel-Gar (the manufacturer) directly to find out more about the material, which I suspected was PVC, but assumed would have to be phthalate free in order to pass CPSIA standards.  It is in fact CPSIA compliant, but I chose to return it as I didn't feel 100% comfortable due to the odor.  I will get the Munchkin duck tub instead.  We currently have that one and I was hoping to get something a little bigger, but I know that didn't have the same odor issue.
