I've been using this with my newborn for 5 weeks now, so I feel qualified to review it now.  Set-up was easy; ordered this before I gave birth and I managed to put everything together all by myself at about 30 weeks.  It was a little awkward trying to work around my stomach, but not too bad.  It would've gone much smoother and faster if I had help.  I didn't put in the vibrating pack or the noisemaker, since I had a different noisemaker I planned to use.  The napper is made of nice material, and the changing table is easy to clean.  Everything looked good before baby.After baby is another story entirely.  My baby was just over 7 lbs when we brought her home, and the first time I put her on the changing table, the unsupported end sank very far down.  Enough that she would constantly slide over, even if I placed her near the support.  Eventually, I "fixed" it by pulling a wooden shelf out of an armoire and sliding it underneath the changing table.  Problem solved, baby no longer slides around on the changing table.  The napper also had a problem - after the first time we put her in, we noticed the bottom half sagged terribly.  We'd put her down with her head in the head-positioning pillow thing, and I'd get up two hours later to feed her, and she'd be cramped down at the far end of the napper.  I ended up taking out the head-positioning pillow thing, since it prevented her from being able to turn her head and look around like she wanted to; plus, with the sagging, her head never stayed on it long anyway.  Since the napper sits down inside the playpen, I couldn't fix it with a board, and I ended up removing it after a few more nights of finding her balled up at the bottom of the napper.Bottom line - the playpen with bassinet is very nice.  The changing table is a great idea for a feature, but it could use a lot more work and redesigning.  The napper is terrible.  I can't recommend this model because of the extra work I had to do to make it safe for the baby.
