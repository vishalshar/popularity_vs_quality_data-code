Let me preface this review by stating that it is my experience that all double strollers are a pretty big compromise between three main attributes - 1) stability as a unit to hold two children; 2) maneuverability when rolling; and 3) storage size/space.  I have found that the side-by-side jogger-type strollers are unmatched in the first category (stability), yet fail miserably in the second (maneuverability), since they do not do well in most pedestrian areas and stores, and are heavier, wider and more unwieldy in the third category.Thus, if you are looking for something you can stuff in your trunk and zip around a store or market, the front-and-back setup is the best option.  Bear in mind, that you will not be able to tear around as fast and easily as you can with a side-by-side jogger, though.  That being said, the Graco is a compromise between price and function.  For the price, it is a fine machine to get the job done and then fit in your trunk.  Of course, the trays, under-carriage nets and hoods are not as stout as some of the pricier models, but they still work.  If you think you might use the unit for more than 5 years, it could be worth buying a nicer, more expensive model, however, your money might just as well be spent buying this unit and another side-by-side jogger for times when you will be outside in open areas.
