I purchased it online (because shopping online is easy) for my nursery but was a bit taken aback to discover that it required a battery that could not be located at either CVS or Save-on.  An online purchase turned into 2 days of shopping. I then went to Best Buy and they did not carry it either.  I finally found the battery at a camera store. It really turned into an ordeal...for a $20 + S&H clock.  It is a pretty clock, but seems to be put together shabbily.  I could have spent my time shopping for something better.
