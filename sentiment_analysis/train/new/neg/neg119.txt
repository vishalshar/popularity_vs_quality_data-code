I bought the City Mini after several days of researching both online and in person. Initially I loved it.  It was small enough folded to fit in the back of my Prius, easy one hand fold, smooth comfy ride for my toddler.Pros: Quality- well made, good strong material.  Padded seat.  Great big canopy. One hand maneuverability. Compact size. One handed collapse.  Lightweight. One foot brake. Nice looking.Cons: Even though my son is tall for a one year old, the belly bar and snack console were too far to reach and in his line of sight.  Storage basket inaccessible once baby is in the stroller. Front wheel keeps locking. I can only go a few steps when the front wheel locks, I have to keep stopping, walk around to the front and unlock it (or it won't turn). I talked to another family at the airport and they said theirs locks on them too, but not often enough to be a pain.  That's how mine started, but it kept getting worse until the stroller was too much work to use.Hopefully this is something they are fixing. Since I don't actually use this to jog, I'd rather it locked in the swivel position, because it is very difficult to maneuver with the front wheel locked straight.So now I'm researching AGAIN to find something similar, but with larger storage and hopefully no common defects!  Bummer.
