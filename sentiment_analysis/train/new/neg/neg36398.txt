I read reviews on this, and some we're saying that it could be pulled tight so that it is sturdy across the top. I bought it to help deter my cats from wanting to jump in with baby. It doesn't pull tight however. It's loose. It's so loose on the pack n play I don't see how it's all that affective in keeping out the bugs either that can easily climb up from ground level on the inside of the netting if you're using it outside.But for the price I'm keeping it on hand in case it comes into use down the road. Also, for now, it's a good support on the pack n play for the tin foil lining it across the top. Cats hate tin foil (some of them are indifferent to it.) But until baby gets here I'm teaching my cats to hate the pack n play that way. :)
