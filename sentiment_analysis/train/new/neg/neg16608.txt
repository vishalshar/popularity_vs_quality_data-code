I used this pitcher for a week and wasn't too impressed. I would make 24oz of formula and it would take at least 60 pumps to get all the clumps out. It doesn't really seem faster than shaking each bottle and the pitcher is one more item that has to be washed each day. If you use really clumpy or foamy formula I can see where this would be helpful but we use Gerber Good Start Gentle and the pitcher isn't necessary.
