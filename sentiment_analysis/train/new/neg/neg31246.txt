These are great in theory, but they will not fit on our doors.  We have 1" metal bi-fold doors.  The lock *would* fit with the adapter on the wide side, except that the door hinge is at the top of the door and blocks the lock from sliding into position.  Switching the adapter to the smaller edge allows the lock to slide over the hinge, but this results in the locks not doing their intended purpose.  Yes it prevents the doors from opening all the way, but when the doors are pulled it creates a gap for little fingers to get smashed.  Unfortunately had to return them and look for a different solution.
