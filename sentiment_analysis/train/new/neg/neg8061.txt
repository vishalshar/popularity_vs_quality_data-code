This placemat wasn't really what we expected. There are some pros and cons about it but I think for us the cons outweigh the pros. I have to be honest and say at this point we don't have another placemat to compare it with but will probably try the disposable ones. I thought by purchasing this palcemat we would be able to avoid having to purchse the disposable ones all the time. The main reason we bought this was to use when we are on-the-go.It arrived on time and folded/rolled up in a box. Trying to get it to lay flat was a little bit of an issue at first b/c it didn't seem to want to stay flat, it kept rolling up on us. The suction cups are not very good, when one sticks the one on the opposite side would pull lose. The entire time we used it we were constnatly having to wet the suction cups to stick to the table. Even after we got the suction cups to stick the catcher part would not stay down. It kept flipping up and hitting our little one right in the center. We flipped it down and scooted her closer to the table just to keep in down but that defeated the purpose of the catcher part b/c it was then squished against her.She did not take interest in playing or pulling it off the table which was a concern for us with the disposable ones. We thought she would pull them up and then we would have to replace them with another and it would be waste of money for us. I guess we will resort to trying those.We spent more time fidgeting with this placemat when we should have been eating our meal.I think it is very sturdy and would last a long time if we could just get it to stay on the table. We thought about cutting the catch tray off but that doesn't resolve the issue that it wont stay flat or wont stay suctioned to the table.Just a poor design and very disappointed.
