We have a love hate relationship with these pacifiers.  My baby LOVES them.  In fact, he won't use anything else.Personally, I kind of hate them.  We have to replace them every few weeks because the area where the silicon nib meets the plastic guard is not sealed.  It doesn't take long for the inside of these suckers to get really gross and while steam sterilization is great for the outside, I have not figured out how to clean inside the silicon nib so they get tossed frequently.While the initial price seems decent, the fact that we are replacing them so often completely overrides that.Unfortunately for us, we have to keep buying them since the little guy hasn't learned to sleep without one.
