I put this bumper guard around our coffee table because our baby (then 9 months old) kept bumping her head into it. It does have a nice amount of padding and protects our baby's head, so it serves its purpose. The problem is that the baby uses it now to try and pull herself up and ends up pulling the bumper off the table. We are constantly having to lift the bumper back up around the table edge. The excess table bumper is supposed to just wrap under the first layer of the bumper and secure with velcro, but that doesn't stay attached. We now just leave the excess dangling because it is easier than having to go back and tuck it under the first layer multiple times a day. So, it's not pretty, but it does protect our baby, so we have to keep it in place. If you need a table bumper and can't find any of the wrap around/expandable ones that fit your table, I would recommend this, but I really think an expandable one would be less of a headache.
