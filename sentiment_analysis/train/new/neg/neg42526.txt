The quality is poor. Right out of the packaging I washed gently with baby detergent with like items.. Two of the 3 blankets pulled and have loose strings. I wrote to Summer infant with the safety complaint and waiting to hear back from them. I will never purchase Summer infant blankets again. I've bought other muslin type blankets and haven't had this issue.
