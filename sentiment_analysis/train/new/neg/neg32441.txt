I probably would not buy this again. The quality seemed pretty ordinary and the crib sheet did not seem to match the rest of the set. The crib skirt was pretty short and altogether dull. The quilt was pretty to look at, but not soft and comfortable for baby. It is pretty cheap though, especially compared to some of the other ones out there, which is why I gave it 3 stars.
