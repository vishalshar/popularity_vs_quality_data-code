I have this chair in white leatherette.  It was given to us as a gift.  I had not registered for it and in fact had never seen it before.  My first reaction was to be very alarmed of a WHITE cover on a chair for an infant/toddler.  However, the leatherette wipes off beautifully and it has not been an issue.But I hate the straps.  As others have said, they are nearly impossible to get off.  And the tray; it's so big!  We started using it when my son was 5 months old and he could barely see over the top of it.  My son is now 8 months.  We've been using the chair for 3 months and I just wanted to give my honest opinion of it. The thing that I hate the most is the fact that the straps are so hard to get off to clean.It LOOKS great, but I honestly think it works better for a toddler-age child (12-24 months) than for a small baby.  Because of the size of the tray and the straps being nearly impossible to remove (who wants to get out a screwdriver just to do routine cleaning?), I gave it 2 stars.  I think you can find good high chairs out there at a much better price!
