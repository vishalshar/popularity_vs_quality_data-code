After washing the backside becomes wrinkly, still cute...I wish it was plastic on top rather than fabric, because it can stain easily for obvious reasons,my he under side is plastic...again, it works, it's cute, but if was all plastic it would be an easy clean....instead it g t's dirty and I resort to using cloths I have until it's washed...meh!
