I chose the Techno Classic over the Techno XT because it comes with a head roll and foot bag. I'm happy with the stroller, but beware of one thing: you cannot use it out-of-the-box because the materials emit such foul fumes!When I unpacked my new stroller, I was nearly knocked over by the strong smell of plastics and solvent due to toxic outgassing. It was the "new car smell," but 100 times worse than you could imagine. I literally got a headache after being in the vicinity of the stroller for about a minute and I was forced to move the stroller outside. I removed all the liners and washed them three times and the stroller sat outside for 2 weeks before I dared to put my infant in it.Also, as mentioned in other online reviews, MacLaren customer service is non-existent. I sent them 2 messages and no response after 4 weeks. So the stroller gets 4 stars, but toxic fumes and bad customer service each deserve a minus.
