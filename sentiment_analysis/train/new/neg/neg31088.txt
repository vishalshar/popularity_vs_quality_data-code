Got this item for my 3-month to give her something to look at during belly-time. She had been very interested in mirrors lately so this looked great. Turns out the mirror on this is no better than if she looked into a piece of foil! It's warped and distorted to the point her doesn't see herself in it. It's redeeming quality in the "crinkly" ear that babies love so much.
