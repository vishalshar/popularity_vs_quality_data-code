I purchased these cloths because of the decal and gave them a chance considering the lower reviews. What a waste of money....1) The cloths are just too narrow, they honestly won't keep the majority of your shoulder or even the length of your hand covered,2) The material absorbs just like a terry washcloth,When my son dribbled, even slightly, and I wiped him clean, I had to fold up the cloth afterwards and put it in a knot-it bag so it wouldn't dirty anything it touched. My son is now in his projectile vomiting stage... these cloths have become obsolete. My only use for them now is for that occasional one time use.Basically, forget about staying dry with these cloths. I love Luvable Friends, their items are usually fairly priced, reliable and cute... but these cloths were just not worth the price or the detergent.
