I am a huge fan of baby leg warmers, and I am currently stocking up to keep my soon-to-be arriving baby girl warm during the winter months. While I LOVE the colors and pattern for these Rainbow Polka Dot legwarmers, I'm not sure that one-size-fits-all is a truly accurate size description. While I'm certain our little girl will grow into them someday, I doubt they will fit her when she is first born (which is what I was looking for at the time I made the purchase). They are pretty big for an infant! Hopefully, we'll get some use out of them NEXT winter, when she's 9-12 months old...
