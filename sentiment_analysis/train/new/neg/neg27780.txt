Please read so you don't make the same mistake we did... Within 24 hours of applying the stickers to our nursery, multiple stickers peeled and came off the wall.  The biggest concern for parents to consider if you're putting this behind a crib, the stickers could peel off and fall into the crib.  The design is cute, too bad the maker couldn't improve the quality and reliability, even if they had to charge a few extra dollars.  I don't recommend this product.
