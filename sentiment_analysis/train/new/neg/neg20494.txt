This puzzle is adorable and my son (at least from age 18 months - 2yrs) absolutely loves it - the one pictured that is, with the monkey, squirrel, and "Nemo" among others.  He loves it so much I ordered one for a gift.  Problem is the item is wrong, it's an Infantino puzzle that says "Heads or Tails" and has strange cartoon animals.  Very disappointing.  I contacted Amazon customer service and they apologized and sent a replacement which just arrived - again it's wrong.  Be careful if you order sometime around the date of this review, you might get the same, lame version of this puzzle.  -- Otherwise, the pieces are strong, it's well made for what it is, and my toddler loves it.
