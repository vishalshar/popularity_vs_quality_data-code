I actually really love this bra, especially as a working pumping mom. Its comfortable and easy to wear for both nursing and pumping - I wear to work all the time. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the quality is TERRIBLE. I got a black one and a beige one - the black one that I've had a few weeks longer than the beige one is LITERALLY falling apart after a month of use. I don't mind paying a little more for things that are useful like this bra, but I expect this to last longer than a month! Not happy.
