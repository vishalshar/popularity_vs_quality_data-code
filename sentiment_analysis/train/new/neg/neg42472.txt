This set, although very attractive, is completely non-functional. We got two, even though there was only one review, since the set looked nice and met our criteria.Well, turns out the suction base is removable from the bowl, which means it doesn't actually suction if any air gets between the base and bowl (which will happen every single time my daughter pulls on it). I only give the bowl to her if I'm prepared to clean the table, floor, and her hair. Otherwise, I load a spoon and hand it over. We've used this from the time she was seven months til now-eleven months.Also, the bendy cow spoon seemed like a good idea, but a bendy spoon in a parent-child tug of war, or just with a child, quickly becomes a food catapult. I hate when these are the only bowls/spoons still clean, and wish I'd sent them back. We've been "using" them for months now.
