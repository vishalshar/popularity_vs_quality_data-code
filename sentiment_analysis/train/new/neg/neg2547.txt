I have had this for less than 2 months and the wire is separating at the plug. This is the 5th one I've had break since I have had the monitor. They all break at the connection by the plug and have exposed wires. We are incredibly careful with the plugs and try to only unplug them when necessary so it has minimal contact. Not impressed with this product at all. At the rate I'm buying new plugs, I might as well have bought a new monitor entirely. While I like this brand of monitor, the replacement plugs are absolute junk!
