I REALLY wanted to love this.I love modern, clean design - things that are bright enough to be kid-friendly, but not covered in characters and be able to work all at the same time. I really thought this toy organizer fit the bill. After it was delivered, I was ecstatic to find that it was bigger than I'd originally thought. All of my child's toys fit easily into the wide opening at the top - with room to spare. the screw/hooks went on very easy (which is great when you're trying to clean up the toys in the tub with a little one). I also loved the fact that it would be so easy to take off/on, and wash if needed.I immediately went to put it up (and clean the mess of toys that had overtaken my bathroom) - it looked great! Nice and neat, easily reachable for the kiddo, etc, etc, etc. I went on with my evening chores - and came back just an hour or so later to find 3 of the suction cups hanging off the side of the tub. No worries - I got the suction cups wet and re-stuck them. Two hours later, we heard a crash and all the toys were in the tub.HERE'S WHERE I WARN YOU: I thoroughly read all the reviews by other customers before I buy something. It seems that about 1/2 the people said it didn't stick. I, too, thought the same thing as many of the ones who were praising it thought "duh, it doesn't stick to textured tile, grout lines, grimy tile, etc." So I went ahead and bought it, thinking we have a plastic, smooth tub surround - and there should be no problems. I'm regretting it now and think I wasn't smarter than those people - they were exactly the same as me. Now I'm going to have to go buy the command hooks or something else to modify the once-cool toy organizer I'd been so excited about.Trust me - look elsewhere. Even though this one looks great, unless you don't care to expect to modify the hook system and use another way, this isn't the toy organizer you're looking for.
