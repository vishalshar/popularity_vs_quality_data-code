When we were first starting out cloth diapering, I had purchased these among a few other brands of cloth diaper covers.  They are affordable and are made well.  However, I didn't use them a lot because they were not my favorite.  I ended up using all Flip covers instead.  4 years later and we are still using the same FLIP covers!!!
