I bought this bag for a recent trip when I flew from Kentucky to Utah. The car seat fit in the bag and I was able to fit extra clothes with it as well. That was good. The bag made it to Utah without issue. When I arrived back home, the bag had a few holes in it from the airline.  I expected the holes and planned to put tape over them. After grabbing the bag off the belt, the handle started to rip off. When I got home with it, I used the shoulder strap and the bag ripped from the shoulder strap attachment and now is no longer useable.I will say I probably overloaded the bag at 45lbs based on the airline scale.  I do not recommend putting the added weight in it.Would I buy it again?  Probably, but I wouldn't put any extra weight in it.
