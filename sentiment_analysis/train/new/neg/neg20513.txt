The Bag is OK Fits most things you would want to bring along and it fits comfortably over the shoulder.The bag is OK, but does seem a bit small to carry everything you could possibly want. My boy is only 11 weeks so we don't need much right now ... as he gets older or during the winter when we'll need to carry additional heavier and bigger clothes, this bag might be a bit too small.This product gets 3 stars because its size might be an issue, but most of all 3 start for lower quality. Some of the stitching has come off and the plastic "end caps" over the zippers keep on falling out. The bag still works, but is not a permanent solution to our baby gear carrying needs!!!
