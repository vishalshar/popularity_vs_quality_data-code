My 2.5 year-old has been using this set for just over a year.  The spork just does not make sense to me.  I realize that some folks do not want toddlers to use a sharp point fork, but these tines made this one useless as a fork.  The set is essentially two spoons (one just looks a little like a fork).  The worst part about this set is the durability.  The grippy handle of mine seems to have melted a little in the dishwasher and has food particles imbedded in it (I think it is tea leaves).  Gross.  I am much more satisfied (though also bummed at the cost of) the oxo set.
