I ordered the Evenflo Triumph for my daughter who has outgrown her infant carseat at 30 inches. Overall, I think this is an ok seat. The installation in my Honda Accord was very difficult in the rear facing position. I have an older model without the latch system so I had to use the seatbelt with the locking clip. In order to do this you must feed the belt through the seat, tighten as much as possible, then unbuckle and attach the locking clip. You then have to use all of your weight to push down on the seat and stretch the buckle back into the clip. That being said, once it's done the seat is very secure and seems safe. I find its a bit more difficult to get my daughter buckled in this seat than my precious Chicco carrier. Although the knobs on the side are convientient, they are not accessible in the rear facing mode. It should not pose a problem once she is forward facing.I rated this at 3 stars because despite all the issues with installation, I do feel like it is a safe and comfortable seat with a reasonable price tag.
