I wasn't hoping for perfection, but I'm disappointed in this bumper.  Our rectangular table is 136 inches, and there is way too much slack for this bumper to do much good.  If our 10-month-old pulls on it to pull up, it easily stretches a good 3-4 inches away from the table edge. It doesn't do it's job protecting her and she's actually bumped her head on the table when cruising on the table and plopping back down.  Any contact with the bumper and it just sags such that it no longer covers the edge.  The corners are awkward, too.  They are just fabric covered pads, and they tend to stick out from the bumper visibly.  Overall, the pad is pretty ugly.  The light grey color sticks out like a sore thumb against our wood table.  I was hoping to avoid having to use the kind of bumper that you have to stick on, but I'll be ordering some of those now.
