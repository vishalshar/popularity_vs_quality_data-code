These are the cheapest made curtains I've ever come across. The fabric is thinner than paper and completely sheer. They don't really look like the picture and are several inches longer than 84 in. I ordered 2 and 1 of them had odd stitching in the middle of the curtain. It looked like the curtain had been ripped so they sewed it. I probably wouldn't have noticed had they used thread that matched and not bright purple. So I figure I'll send the one back. The curtains are cute enough that I was just going to have a seamstress add fabric so the curtains weren't as sheer. They're going in a baby nursery so I don't need anything super fancy anyway. I called and asked for a replacement. They ended up sending 2 replacements. So I ended up with extra curtains. I open the first one and it looks like coffee was spilt on the curtain. I open the second one and there is a dead bug in the bag. That curtain had what looked like a large grease stain on it. I opened the next one and it has what looks like an ink stain from a pen and the stitching was EXTREMELY crooked. It was straight part way then suddenly arched and came back down. The stitching is coming out in some areas as well. I know nothing about sewing but I know buying these curtains for $22 was a mistake. They aren't even worth $5 yet now I see the price has raised to $33. Ridiculous! Do not I repeat DO NOT buy these curtains. Save yourself the trouble.
