I bought this for my 6 month old daughter and she cannot use the toy yet.  There are little tiny buttons underneath the material that you actually have to find and press.  I have a feeling she won't be able to do this for a while yet.  Maybe better for a child 1 and over.  It is cute though, but she prefers other musical toys that we have.  It definitely is not one of her favorites.
