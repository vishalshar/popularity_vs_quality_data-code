I do not like that I purchased this because it was way to small. I had the impression that it was a regular size walker not a miniature one even though it said lil on it. It said it hold up to 25 lbs but it just seems to small in structure. It would be to much of a hassle sending it back so i just went to another site and found a regular size one for big babies. Now days it seems like everything made for babies is made for small babies.
