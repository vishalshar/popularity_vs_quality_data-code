Purchased this warmer with the first year quick serve bottle warmer to compare.  While this model can be more accurate in allowing user to pick the starting temp of milk, size of bottle, type of milk/food, and amount of milk, it took nearly twice as long (almost 6 min) as the quick serve to heat up a 5 oz refrigerated water in a medal milk bottle, while the quick serve only took almost 3 min and they both heated the water to approximately 103/104 degrees. In addition, while the instructions indicated there are green, orange, and red lights to indicate whether warmer is working correctly, there was no green light on the model I received.  The upside is that you don't need to measure the water needed to warm the bottle each time, and there's no trial and error needed to figure out which setting is best for the milk/food you are heating up.
