The pouches themselves are great. However, they are not reusable...so why do they package 50 non-reusable pouches and only 25 caps?? Not only that, no where in the description of the product in features and details on the site does it say 50 pouches and 25 caps. I am disappointed that I have to remind my older kids to not throw caps away from their school lunches so I can wash them at home or have to make sure when on the go with the baby that the cap gets saved and not tossed with the pouch. Other than that they are great!
