I bought this as a second swing for my moms. It's really cute with the little projection. I wouldn't buy it again though bc it's hard to get them in and out without hitting their little head and there's a Velcro strap across the back of the seat and it's got to be uncomfortable on their little back? Seat not padded enough.
