Like other reviewers, my gate also arrived with only 3 corners protected and with a broken hinge.  I was able to sorta fix the hinge, unless I move the gate, it is ok.  Know that you are getting a cheap product.  It is heavy but not well made (if it had bigger, sturdier hinges, it would be great!)  It is cute and works for me, all I'm doing with it is standing it up in a corner of a room to "hide" a potty pad, so no one ever touches it.  This would not be able to be used for a dog that will ever put it's paws up on it.  Great for well behaved, very small dogs who know their boundaries, who just need a gentle reminder. And know that you may have to mess with a hinge and use a touch up pen on the "wood."
