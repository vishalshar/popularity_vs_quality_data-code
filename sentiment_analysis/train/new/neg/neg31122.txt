We have twins and it split in the middle.  We contacted the company and they issued a replacement only after we sent them pictures proving that we destroyed the defective one.  We are now just a few weeks into using the replacement and it too is splitting.  Our twins are 2 year old girls and throughout the training we need to put them on the seat many many times a day back to back so I suggest getting another brand if you have a similar situation.  We appreciate the company sending us a replacement but I think we will just get another manufacturer for the next one.
