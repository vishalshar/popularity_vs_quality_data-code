I purchased these cubes less than a month ago, and have only used 1 tray. So far 3 of my 8 cubes have cracked, with little pieces falling off the lid and cube itself, and I no longer feel they are safe to use for baby food. I think this is a great idea with poor execution.  My freezer is no colder than any other freezer, the cubes have been handled carefully, and hand washed only. Big disappointment.
