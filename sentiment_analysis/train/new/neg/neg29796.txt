The way it looks in the photo is a bit deceptive. It looks like the thing wraps around and closes in the back (one velcro strip), but it's two velcro closures that drape around the handle bar. Therein lies the problem, as water will find a way around the small openings by the handle bars, and potentially drip down onto the bottom child. Also, the bottom seat shouldn't be in the reclined position as the flap barely will cover it. I haven't had problems with the front closure, but can see it being problematic if the child kicks at the cover and loosens it.Still, in light rain (not stormy) it works decently, and does cut down on wind.
