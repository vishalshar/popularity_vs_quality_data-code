You don't want this charger, you want a "smart" charger.  This is based on a steady charge rate and a timer.  Maybe it's OK for AAs and AAAs (but even those take eight hours), but if you want to charge 10,000mAh D-cells, you get to unplug and restart this charger FOUR times over the course of THIRTY-TWO HOURS!  100% my fault for not paying more attention to the product I was buying, don't make my mistake though.
