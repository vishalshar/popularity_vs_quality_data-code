I thought these would keep the bottles colder, it still warms up pretty quickly so I have to put it in the freezer before using it since it's too small to put an ice pack in. That kind of defeats the point of this, I assumed I could just toss a bottle in and have it stay chilly, not get lukewarm fairly quickly.The freezer helps but it still sucked having to throw out a couple of bottles of hard pumped milk because these don't work.Luckily they wash off okay in the machine though if a bottle leaks.
