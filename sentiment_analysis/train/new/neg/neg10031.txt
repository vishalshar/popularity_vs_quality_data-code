I finally gave in and got this stroller when my second was almost 3 months old.  My two are 19 1/2 months apart and I tried to do without it but went for a double buggy since getting my older daughter to consistently get on the buggy board was futile, and my best intentions of having my older daughter in the buggy with the other in the carrier also proved to be impractical in the long run.The benefits:- handles very well - good in tight shops with narrow aisles- no wider than our bugaboo chameleon, easy to fit on buses- older child sits up front - she is the one who would protest sitting in the back- looks greatThe cons:- the inner tires burst frequently and replacing them is a chore.  Takes at least 15 minutes to mess with the outer tire to fix. You will notice they sell the replacement inner tires in packs of three - there is a reason for this!- Because it is compact, the newborn setup does not last long.  My 2nd was a fairly hefty 3.6kg at birth and did not fit in newborn mode at 3 months which meant I had her sitting in the rumble seat which does not lie flat, long before she was six months.  She wasn't spending significant time in the buggy so it wasn't the worst situation for us but it is something to be aware of if you plan to be out and about for long periods.- I am fairly tall (5 ft 8) and the handle bars are just 1-2 inches too low for me.  It would be great if they could extend or be raised higher to make it more comfortable.- canopy on the lower seat flaps around and offers little protectionOverall I found most double buggies are flawed when I did my initial research.  I am not sure there is an alternative that offers the benefits of this buggy without other drawbacks.  It did the job for the short period that we needed it and now we will pass it on to the next family in need.
