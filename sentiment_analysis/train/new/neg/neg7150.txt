WASTE OF MONEY!! I ordered these wash cloth not really expecting them to be the best quality but  did not imagine the quality could be so POOR. The cloths are small and very very thin and have the feel of a rough, cheap jersey material. Not to mention there were loose threads in the package. This is NOT suitable for cleaning baby's mouth or bathing baby. Buying this product is pointless and NOT a bargain. There are some things, no matter how cheap they are; because the quality is so bad, it would be like throwing away money.
