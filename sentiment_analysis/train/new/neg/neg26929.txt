This was able to fit to my stroller pretty well but my daughter's face pretty much hits the push bar when she uses it. She leans back but then says that her arms hurt after a short distance. She likes being able to stand on it but I mean at this point we could just get her a razor scooter....if this would work on your stroller the angle of the front wheel bar to the push bar has to be pretty high to make it comfortable. If it goes back too much it will not be comfortable or feasible to use. On a jogging stroller that we had, we actually would have my older daughter stand on the bar in the back and the seat had a big opening behind it and she actually would go through that and stand up and it worked really well. It is hard to find strollers that do that though...it was a Baby trend jogging stroller in case you were wondering. I bought this because it said free returns within 30 days and would return it but then you read the fine print and it says that there is a 30% restocking fee, that if you assemble it, you can't return it, and that you have to pay return shipping. No one is going to do that.
