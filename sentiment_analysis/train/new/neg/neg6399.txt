Worked well when my baby was very small and the diaper was way too large (so I rarely used it). Now that it fits him, even with a pre-fold diaper underneath, he soaks right through it really fast. Perhaps with another cover over it would be fine but it is so incredibly bulky, I prefer to use my other cloth diapers.
