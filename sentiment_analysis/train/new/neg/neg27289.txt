Fast delivery but I was very disappointed in the toy.  Each block was supposed to have different sounds...a chime, a rattle, or a squeak, for example.  But.  Two of the blocks I received had the same bell sound, one had no sound at all, and the one that a child should be able to squeeze to make it squeak was defective.  The squeaker was actually loose inside the block.  Sent them back.
