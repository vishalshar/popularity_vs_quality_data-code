I just received these bowls - I ordered two sets.  I'm actually thinking about returning the set that I haven't opened...!  The suction base works about as well as what you'll find anywhere (sticks best on the plastic high chair tray), but as other reviewers have said, the base is difficult to put on to the bottom of the bowls.  You really have to tug hard, and then sometimes the threads on the bowl bottom aren't completely covered by the base.  Another issue is that once you have the lids snapped on (yes, that's hard to do too), you have an equally hard time pulling them off without the bowl jerking in the opposite direction.  That might not be a problem if the contents are solid enough not to spill, but loose food (e.g. Cheerios) or anything a little soupy is likely to go flying.In all fairness, I haven't tested them with food yet.  If this review proves to be grossly inaccurate, I will come back and edit it...
