We got this because it matched the Honey Bear bedding collection we received as a gift. The mobile is OK, but for the price paid it feels cheap and I'm just not impressed. The listing never states how it is powered, but for thirty some dollars I assumed it would be battery operated with electronic music. Instead it is wind up that only runs for about a minute and half and has a loud twangy music box thats kind of painful to my ears-- not relaxing for putting a child to sleep.  The mobile arm is a couple snapped together pieces of flimsy plastic. There is no way to adjust its height (its too tall for us) and the clamp system does not attach firmly to our crib. It stays in place but has too much wiggle. And while the bears are cute they occasionally fall off when in use unless you rig them. If I'd paid about $15 for this I'd be OK with it. We've bought other really nice baby items in same price range from amazon. As a comparison for only a couple dollars more than this mobile we bought a battery powered swing that has 8 speeds, a timer and several electronic lullabyes that sound much much better. This does not represent the same value.
