This was okay, but for my recipient I had to return it. It was nice, but it did feel cheap to me. While some people this would be an okay gift, my cousin I was going to give this to has pretty "strong" taste in things, and I did not feel this would make the grade. I should have gone with something that was like real pewter, but took a chance. Like I said, may be okay for some, but for someone who has picky taste or expects quality, I do not think this would cut it.
