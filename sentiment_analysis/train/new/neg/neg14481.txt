I love the idea of this high chair.  Love the color.  Love the design.  Love that it converts.***BUT**** I can put my 15 lb daughter in it in the lowest position and it seems to slip down into an even lower position (with her in it) even after I have pushed in the buttons to make sure I have it where it needs to be.  I've not had it do this in a higher position, but if it does I believe I'll have to return it.*The latch/buckle/snap is very difficult to fasten and unfasten.  I've almost pinched my finger in it several times.  And have to be extra, extra cautious to keep my daughter's little fingers away while trying to do this.  Not a good thing for someone with arthritis or carpel tunnel.*I don't care for the springiness of the legs*I feed my daughter in the high chair while I sit on the couch.  It's hard to push the chair back so that I can get up.  The wheels are on the front and the front legs have grips that don't slide at all.  Not a bad thing, but not a good thing either.Overall (at this point), it's not worth my effort to return it but if I had it to do over again, I would choose something else.
