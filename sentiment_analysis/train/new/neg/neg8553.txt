The toy is cute and was a great price, but I do wish it held the attention of my daughter more than a few minutes. She likes it, but is bored after taking the animals out of the tree. She is like that with most toys, so I guess this one is not much different. Reason why I didnt give a bad review. I was just hoping after reading reviews on this toy that this one might be different.
