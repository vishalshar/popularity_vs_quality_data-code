Ok i was a huge fan of these car seats i have the cow print and the ashley. Purchased both in Jan 2009...by Jan 2010 the ashley print seat buckle decided it no longer wanted to work and with no warning at a quick stop my 5 year old came out of her seat...After i inspected the seat i noticed that if you tug on the straps it was unbucking just like that. So i call customer service...they said what is the manufacture date on the seat...i read to them 12/4/2007. She says "it is not under warranty" What??? I said i bought it when my son was 1 years old i bought 2 at the same time. He is not even 2 yet??She said well you can try to wash the buckle out?....ok yeah i won't trust it ever again are you kidding me?So $600.00 for 2 car seats i can't trust.hmmmmm not much to think about here! I also asked well i purchased in 2009 then why do you sell seats that are out of warranty? That seems not fair you can't see the sticker when ordering. She said well if you have the reciept we can warranty it to that purchase date. Yeah with 2 kids i hold on to this stuf?? So that is my advice...if you want one cool but register it and keep your reciept. And last but not least check those buckles often by pulling on them to see if they pop...i am thankful it was only at a quick stop and not in an accident that we discovered this flaw of a life lesson! thanks Britax, hello sunshine kids!
