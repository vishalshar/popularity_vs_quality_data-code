We bought this insert when our son was a month and 1/2 (when we bought the carrier).  He didn't quite sit well in the carrier, so we hoped that this insert would help.  It is a nice insert, really well made, very nice fabric, nicely quilted, etc.  The issue was that it just didn't work for his size.  He is at the 95th percentile for weight and height, and this insert was just too bulky.  I tried using only the pillow for him to sit on, and that worked better, but I couldn't justify spending so much just for a little pillow (which I could make from blankets myself).I can imagine it probably works well for smaller babies.  But with bigger/taller babies it just doesn't work well.  Also, I find that when I have my son in the carrier, it is already warm as is, without this insert.  He would be overheated in this; maybe it works well in colder climates.  Now, at 2 1/2 months, I just fold blankets and have him sit on that and use something to support his head; the carrier works fine with my own add ons.
