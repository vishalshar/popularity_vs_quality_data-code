My baby's favorite pacifier and the only ones she'll use. The glow in the dark feature is actually useful since we do not use a nightlight near her crib. It makes it easy for us to find her pacifier quickly. The only problem with this pacifier (and other MAM ones I've used) is that water gets trapped in the nipple when you wash it. I've found that it works best if you pinch the nipple shut while you are rinsing it, and then give it a few good shakes afterwards. Sometimes this will work well enough to keep water (and soap!) out.
