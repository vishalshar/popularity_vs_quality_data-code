I'm not sure why these cups leak they way they do, but they are terrible! They are not the Nuby quality I have come to love. I purchased 2 of these 2 packs from Amazon. First they showed up pink/purple when I ordered red/blue. Not a big deal but it would be nice to receive what I ordered.I didn't read reviews on these cups because I already have the smaller Nuby cups with the handles attached to the lids and my Grandson loves them. This was my mistake! If I had taken the time to read the reviews I would have found out that these leak and to top t off I could have purchased a 3 pack for $2 less from another store that starts with a W. There is a difference in the 2 cups as you can tell by my photo. The Nuby from Amazon have a wider mouth and chunkier lid (which make it so you can not inter-change them).** Side note - my daughter and I tested the other stores cups. When you hold them upside down not one drop cam out. If you shake them then you did get little drops leaking out, but nothing like the pink cups.We love the Nuby brand cups, just not happy with this batch. :(
