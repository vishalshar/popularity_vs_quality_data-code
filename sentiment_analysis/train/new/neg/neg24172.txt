Just received the Amber turtle today and this is NOT a Cloud B product!!I have purchased these numerous of times for baby showers and this is not even close. It doesn't even say Cloud B anywhere on the box or the turtle, just a cheap print off sticker that says cloud b stuck to the bottom of the box (which I could do off my computer).I am all for buying generic on some products BUT if I'm paying for that brand and the description on the site says I am suppose to receive that brand then I expect to get it what I was told.  This product is much smaller in size and is already falling apart.  The soft part of the turtle is not even fully glued to the hard plastic shell and the stuffing is sticking out in one area???Very disappointed in Amazon for letting this company pass their stuff off as Cloud B products and then these orders are being fulfilled by Amazon.....  This is being returned immediately.
