You have to press the nasty diaper through a tightly closed, spring loaded enclosure. If this isn't annoying enough, or disgusting enough, the stupid bags have to be manually cut with the tool located inside the pale, so you have to open the whole thing up, cut the bag, tie it off, then tie off the bottom end to start the process over again. To top it off, the first time, and only time, we took the bag out to be tossed it ripped down the side and 15 or so diapers spilled out. This thing is absolute garbage. If I hadn't already tossed the box I would return it to the company with a poopy diaper still inside the thing just to make me feel better about my troubles with this horribly engineered piece of garbage.
