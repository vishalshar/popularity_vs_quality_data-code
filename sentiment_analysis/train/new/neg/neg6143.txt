Ok- so this is such a ridiculous product for the price. I cannot believe that BOB charges close to $100 dollars for this after you spend over $500  on the stroller. The tray itself is pretty $#%%$# it hold like a string of cheerios and the carseat side hold the carseat. Nothing special BUT it does make me angry that I needed to fork over more money just to get my stroller functional.
