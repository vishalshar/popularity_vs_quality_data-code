Great for getting through doors and down busy sidewalks since it's so narrow. However, my son is huge compared to his big sister and at 3 months the carrycot is already a tight squeeze. I also don't think the buggy is at all easy to push. Would have liked to compared it in person to a Bugaboo Donkey before purchasing.
