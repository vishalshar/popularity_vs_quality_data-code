Bought for my 1 year old to help with teething. We already own a cherry colored Baltic Amber necklace from a different company and it works wonders! But we left it at gmas, who lives in another state and we thought it was lost forever! Bought this one as a replacement ( I couldn't find the other company I purchased the first one from) and thought I'd try another color out. It's a very cute necklace but I just didn't feel like it worked as well as the other one. I don't know if the different colors make a difference or the companies they're from. You do hear a lot about fake Baltic Amber, so I don't know if this one is a fake. I did also buy a bracelet from this company for my husband and he said it didn't work either.
