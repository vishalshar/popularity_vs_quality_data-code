I liked that this mattress cover was inexpensive and claimed to be good for preventing allergens. It doesn't mention that it's a pretty thick vinyl, with no soft areas. Basically, picture a fitted tarp or shower curtain. It has a pretty heavy vinyl odor as well. I would recommend airing it out before using it. The cover doesn't mention being free of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) either, so I'm a little concerned, especially with the heavy plastic smell. It would be nice if you had to clean up a night-time accident, but it's still crinkly and vinyl-smelling.
