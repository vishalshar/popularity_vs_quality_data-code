Five stars for how much my toddler adores this set, particularly the spoon. He will eat with no other spoon, regardless of how hungry he is. He asks for his "wawee" (strawberry) spoon - the fork he is ambivalent about. However, after less than two months the design on the utensils is scratched and fading. At this rate his beloved "wawee" will be scratched off in less than a year. Also, although it works fine, there's another spoon/fork set I got that is easier for him to use (it's designed better for little hands) - but it doesn't matter much since he refuses to use it!!
