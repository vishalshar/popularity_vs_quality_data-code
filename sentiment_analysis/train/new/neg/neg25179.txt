When it arrived in the mail it wasn't as crisp looking as the photo, a bit wrinkled and small. Thought it would be larger than actual size. Same pattern I ordered but not as cute as picture shown w/ more balanced colors of yellow, blue, and pink. Instead it's one huge pink flower on one side and brown on the other. It'd probably be more of a pain to return it, but all in all it fits its purpose. At least it's large enough to stuff my daughter's WubbaNub pacifier inside.
