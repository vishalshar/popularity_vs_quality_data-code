This hamper is a little small but it does the job. It holds 1-1.5 weeks worth of clothes which works for me because I try to wash my sons clothes once a week.***Update 11/19/12**Because of the material of the hamper it did not last as long as I wanted it too. It is now dented in on one side so I bought a different hamper. I don't know how the dent got there, but i just wish the hamper was made of a stronger material.
