I have to update my tongue in cheek review below. No sooner did I geek out about my love of this bottle did I face chipping like so many others. When I read their reviews I assumed that they were abusing their bottles and being picky. But, I had to put a label on them for daycare and in less than a day the paint peeled clean off. I am not pleased and have an email in to the company, but for now I have to warn against these bottles. Amazon appears to be out of stock of the natural stainless, but I would not recommend buying the painted ones. I will see if I can figure out how to post a pic.___I chose these bottles so I could subtly look down my nose at all other parents out there who choose to feed their babies using *gasp* plastic bottles. If your daycare doesn't allow for glass bottles and you still need to fulfill your need for green mom mompetition, these are the bottles for you.The good:-No plastic-Nipple doesn't collapse-Cute colors-Chilled liquids heat faster in a cup of hot water than plastic or glass bottlesThe not good:-There are measurement lines up to 3 oz, but not a line for 4 oz, which is the size bottle we give our daughter. Why?!-The cap is slightly awkard since it is silicone-They aren't cheap!
