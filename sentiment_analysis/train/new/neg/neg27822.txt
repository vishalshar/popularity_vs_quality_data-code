I bought these bumpers for grandma's house and another brand (Cribwrap) for my house.  These Go Ma Ma's seems cheaply constructed.  Thread is just hanging at the corners and some of the ties.  The bumpers are not at all as pictured here.  I was hoping to get something that would wrap around securely like the picture.  I have a feeling my daughter will spend a lot of time pulling at the ties so I'm not sure if these will work out or not.  In comparison, for slightly cheaper, the other bumpers I received for my house are fantastic!
