1st bottles I used for my newborn baby boy,the bottles didn't leak except for one.Most of the gerber bottles worked fine except my baby boy was always getting gassy & colicky.He was getting a lot of air :(So decided to try DR BROWN bottles & noticed a HUGE difference. I switch from gerber bottles to Dr brown bottles. Wouldn't recommend gerber bottles, all I use is dr brown bottles
