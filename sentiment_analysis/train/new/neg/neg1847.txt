Before you buy this product, make sure that there's a bar going across the seat in front of your child.  This toy is designed to wrap around a teeny tiny bar, and I don't even know if they make strollers like that anymore.  We have three strollers for one child, made by three different companies, and this toy doesn't work on any of them.  I'm still trying to figure out where I can use this toy.
