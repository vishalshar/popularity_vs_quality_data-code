Pros: folds up easily, stores easily, very portable.Cons: does not fit properly on my toilet seat, which is a very standard round toilet seat.Not enough anti-slip material on the bottom to make me feel comfortable having my son sit on it.Small opening - he's under 2 years old but not convinced that all materials would make it into the bowl.Of course, not even a hint of a urine guard.This is HARD plastic, there is no give to it.  I can see this being mildly useful as a travel seat for an older child with control, but not remotely useful for potty training - unless you want them to be scared of falling in.
