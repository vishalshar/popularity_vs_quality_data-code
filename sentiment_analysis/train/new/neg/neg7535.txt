This pump is good but I needed something faster, quieter (this one moo's, so kinda awkward at work) and closer to Medela PISA without the pain that it caused. The pumping is much more comfortable with Spectra pumps, but I ended up upgrading to the S2 and the rest is history! Spectra 9 is good, but the S2 pump is much better...quieter, faster, and easy to clean. I recommend the S2. Good luck!
