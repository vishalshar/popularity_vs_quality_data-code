I purchased this product based on the reviews in one parenting magazine.  However, it just sits in the bottom drawer after several of my attempts to use it.  I agree with all other reviewers: it is too cumbersome to use, the light won't stay on unless you hold the button down while you clip, and you can't see what you're clipping!  I, too, clipped my baby's finger, and I've been using regular child clippers ever since.  At least I can see exactly where I'm clipping!  I would not recommend this product for anyone.
