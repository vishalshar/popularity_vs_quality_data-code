While I will agree with other users that the clouds look nice once on the wall, getting them there was a TERRIBLE experience.  I read all of the reviews before ordering and knew that it was going to be tricky.  What I didn't know was that it would end up taking over an hour to get them all up and I ended up having to use most of the small ones to cover up mistakes on the bigger ones.  You may read this review and think "they obviously didn't know what they were doing."  But I can assure you we are DIY'ers and have undertaken projects a whole lot bigger than putting some clouds up on the walls in our son's room.  The biggest problem I found was the clouds were not sticky enough to stay in place during the trasfer process (which is done using a tongue depressor) - this resulted in some of them shifting slightly and cracks being formed (i.e. the use of the smaller clouds to cover it up).  The clouds we received were also VERY difficult to get off of the backing - we could rub the same spot with varying degrees of pressure for 5 minutes straight and it still wouldn't transfer onto the wall.  The whole process was a hot mess and very disappointing.
