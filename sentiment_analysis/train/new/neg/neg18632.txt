I don't want to get this item no but since im not allowed to write a review without giving a star. I'd like to say its very sad that you have to pay so much for a item that any day the stone will fall off or rust on you.This is my second time buying this item and I'm very disappointed with this last purchase.. The first one last a little longer but rust on me this one the stone came off and I don't know where it went .. I'm just happy it wasn't in my baby mouth so she could swollen it. Think it should be a priced for less so if these things happen you could keep buying to replace. It's just beads on a string üôÅ
