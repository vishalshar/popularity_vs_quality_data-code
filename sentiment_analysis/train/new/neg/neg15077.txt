I messed up. Needed some more bottles, so I ordered these, not realizing that Playtex VentAire comes in both standard and wide formats. We usually use the wide. In comparison - I used these once then gave them away to charity. On their own, they share many of the beneficial features of the other Ventaire bottles, but there's that one drawback.Pros:- Vented system keeps too much air from entering the bottle, and gives me an auditory cue when he's done feeding at night- They're robust, don't leak at all, even after using the dishwasher on them.- Come in pleasant colors, not too bright- Easy to clean and no messing with bags, inserts, or drop ins that always seem to leakCons:- They're skinny. Very, very skinny. He didn't like the tiny nipples at all. More importantly...- They're rather tough to clean compared to the wide bottles! Those, stick a rag in, use a bottle brush, boom, they're clean. These, search for every nook and cranny.- Both wide and standard could be improved by another measurement scale showing the remaining milk when feeding. Would make it easier than taking it away to check how much is left.
