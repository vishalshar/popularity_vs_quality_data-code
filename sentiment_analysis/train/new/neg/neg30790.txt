You can't really ask a newborn what she thinks about the mattress she is sleeping on, so I'm obviously basing this review on my own experiences.  For the most part, this mattress is as advertised - VERY firm, standard size, the recommended weight, etc.  It fits well in the crib and has no discernible flaws.  On the other hand, it feels basically like a rock.  Our 6 week old manages okay on it - barely makes a dent; then again, she's small - but it has absolutely no give.  She SEEMS less comfortable on this than on any other surface we rest her on (including the floor), but again, that's just one mother's observation!
