We switched to this when my baby outgrew his summer infant Velcro swaddle because I figured we could transition to using it as just a sleep sack later. The swaddle isn't as good - the Velcro gets unstuck and it's just a looser, easier to get free swaddle. Then the Velcro is annoying to have when using just as a sleep sack so overall not so thrilled with it. But I do love that it zips from the top down so you can easily unzip for diaper changes without having to totally unswaddle.
