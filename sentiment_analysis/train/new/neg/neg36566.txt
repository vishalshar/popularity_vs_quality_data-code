I bought these bottles as I wanted BPA free and also something that may help in reducing the possibility of colic/gasiness in my infant.For the last 3, we have dealt with a very gassy (and screaming) infant all while using these bottles. We are now on our 3rd formula and she the gas has been greatly reduced; however this was due to the formula not the bottles. As others have mentioned, there are more parts to clean & put together than usual (which I was fine with if they were good bottles that also helped with gas issues). Unfortunately, they have issues with nipple collapse and leaks. In addition, the newborn flow of the nipple in this set seems to be too fast for my newborn as she choked every time she ate. I thought this was "normal" until I bought another slow flow rate bottle and found she does not choke with a different bottle/nipple.Note on the gas: We did try all the other basic remedies to reduce gas (i.e.: holding baby upright while feeding, holding her upright for 20 minutes after feeding, burping, feeding in a calm environment, etc)
