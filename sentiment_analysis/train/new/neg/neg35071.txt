I Received this item over two weeks ago and there were numerous things wrong. I immediately called target and explained the situation, they reffered me to simplicity's customer servive.  I have spoke to simplicity three times and was promised each time that the 3 drawers would be replaced and sent ASAP! After not receiving the 1st time, I called and was told they need the model number, I think they should have known that already. I gave them the Model number and was promised it would be shipped over night. 6 days later ( today) I called back to find out what was going on and was told every thing is on back order and they should have it in within 3 weeks. I was told they will call me when it arrives. I am expecting the kid in 1 week but still I have no functionin changing table, lets see how target wll respond? Target has refunded me 20% and offered to replace the item with another item, since I have the matching dresser there is not a similiar combo unit, so we may end up with something that does not match.
