I just got these yesterday. The spoons have a jagged edge, so every time I would wipe my baby's mouth, it would be scratching her. I know the product is made out of better material, but they look like something I would get at the dollar store-or worse. Why would it not be part of the quality control checklist to make sure these edges are filed down? Without being filed/sanded, there is no way I can use them on my baby.As a side note, the handles are really long, and the depth of the spoon is very shallow...so I don't even think I would like these spoons even if there wasn't a safety issue...But I at least would have tried them without having to go through the trouble of returning. I was also charged the same amount in shipping as the product costs. I would definitely not spend $11 on these spoons if I known the quality upon arrival. Very disappointed. I hope returning them is not a hassle.Update: Although I would not recommend this product until this defect is resolved, the seller "Earth Parents" gave me a full refund for the item, including shipping. I am thankful to them and would use them in the future for purchasing other products.
