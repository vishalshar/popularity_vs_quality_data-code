I have mixed feelings about this cover. We first tried using an Eddie Bauer shopping cart cover for highchairs, but found it didn't fit well. This one fits 90% of the high chairs out there. And I've noticed that a lot of highchairs in restaurants especially fast food places don't appear to be wiped down.Pros:- The toy straps were a brilliant idea but I think little kids are more interested in new things and the silverware- It's compact- It can be washed or wiped down easily- It's nice to know what your kid it touching, it's sanitary- It fits the majority of highchairs we've triedCons:- I'm don't like to take the time to weave the seat belt straps through the slots in this thing and there's not a way to go around the cover, and use the seat belt. When our son was younger and didn't need to be strapped in place it was fine.- It's just one extra thing to carry, especially when you carry a purse and a diaper bag- It's kind of slick for little kids (like for a child 6-7 months age )- The velcro parts you have to undo and then put together which is time consuming especially if you have a squirmy child- The back pouch is cool because I'd usually store his bib back there, but it often fell out, because of the slick material/ the way I stored it (which was basically throwing it in the trunk)In conclusion, we used it a bit when our son was first sitting upright. But then I've found it's actually quicker and easier if I wiped down the seat before I put my son in it. So even when we had it with us, we stopped using it when he was closer to 13 months old.
