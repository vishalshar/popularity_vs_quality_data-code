The buckle on this thing kills my soul. You have to literally put both sides of the lower buckle in at the same time. It is nearly impossible with a squirming child. Other than that, the seat is wonderful. For those of you who are reviewing saying that there is no brace to keep the rear-facing car seat from lurching forward and hitting the seat it's attached to, you're nuts. There is an attachment that you use to brace thecar seat to the seat in front of it that would prevent it from moving at all in a head on collision. It is a snug little seat and is VERY secure in our car.
