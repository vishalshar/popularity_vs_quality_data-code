I remember having so much fun when I had one as a kid. Getting in and out is a huge hassle if they have squirmy legs, also, setup was easy but not the greatest thing i've ever put togethor, could have had better directions. The leg holes are too wide for my daughter so I recommend putting a towel or somthing to boost her up. Overall the design is safe and clamps very well onto the doorframe, I tug on it to make sure its safe. 2/5
