I was incredibly disappointed with this seat. I was a bit hesitant about the "suction" on the bottom of the seat and I should have gone with my gut on this one. It does suction to the seat, but without any strength. My son kept moving the seat getting in and out of it. The worst of all is that it smells strongly of vinegar. I am not sure what they make or clean this product with, but each time we touched it, our hands smelled of vinegar. I already have the first seat ready for return and the second one that is to be delivered tomorrow already has a return label printed. I recommend finding another option.
