We have the crib from this same line, so decided to buy the matching changing table. Although we're satisfied with this table overall, it has one design element--I'll call it a flaw--which detracts from its design: The lower two shelves are 1/8" masonite and sit their supports, instead of slotting into them. This gives those shelves a slightly flimsy and unfinished look, and detracts from an otherwise nice design. I'll add a photo to the Amazon.com product listing to illustrate my point.
