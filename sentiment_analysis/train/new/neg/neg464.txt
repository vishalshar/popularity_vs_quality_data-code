These are a good fit for my chubby baby (just to give you an idea of how chubby, at 2.5 months his legs were too big for a bumbo). They seem to be decently constructed- especially considering the price!- and durable but I can't speak to them lasting as I've had them about one month. Colors are true to the picture and they took about 7 days for shipping which was much faster than what it's supposed to be. However, I have a problem with wicking on the front with these diapers so I keep them at the bottom of my stash. They leak about 50% of the time. I've tried different inserts to see if that is an issue but even with my good inserts they leak urine. I prefer Sunbaby diapers, even though they are fleece, for another cheap alternative. The prints are not usually cute on the Sunbaby diapers and they are fleece lined but I've never had leaking or repelling issues and they wash up well in hot water with my bumgenius diapers. If money wasn't a consideration my cd stash would consist of all bumgenius freetimes (for when others are watching my baby as they are so easy to use) and bumgenious 4.0s.
