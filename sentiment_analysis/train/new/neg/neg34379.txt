I hate this thing.  I tried to return it, but the guy wanted to try and explain how to use it instead of letting me return it.  The recommendations were to make the water shallower, and that takes away from her bathing experience.  If you use the tummy tub in a sink, you can't get your arms up and in to wash your baby all the way.  It doesn't keep the water warm like it claims.  It's difficult to add warmer water (once it gets too cold, which takes 5 minutes) because there is no drain plug.  It's hard to reach the baby bum, which needs the most washing... lol.  My baby is active during bathtime.  So when she moves, she ends up slumping, and nearly dunking her face, or when she looks down her face would go in the water.  So I have to hold her chin the whole time.  Who wants to bathe with mommy's hand in your face the whole time?  GDI this tub is so stupid.
