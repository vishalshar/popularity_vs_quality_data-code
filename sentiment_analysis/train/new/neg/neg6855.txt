The directions are not very well written at all. The template part of the package was stuck "lost" inside delivery box.... yes that would have helped, immensly! Although we ALMOST wanted to return this gate Im glad we didn't. The gate itself is very nice looking but a tiny bit less sturdy than I thought. However, my rambunctious lil man couldn't pull it down so that's nice. The opening mechanism needs to be more user friendly. The bottom hinge on the side the gate opens needs to play a better role in opening and closing so it can be sturdier. Overall ok gate. Matches our kitchen great. Not bulky like other gates but I guess that's the sacrifice of it being less sturdy.
