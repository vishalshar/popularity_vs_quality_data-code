I was so terrified my babies would stop breathing. Putting this on them was helpful during the first anxious period - I woke up all through the night to look at them, and it was good to see the yellow light. We had quite a few false warnings though when it slipped off the diaper or wasn't in the right place. It's hard to get it on to the diaper of a skinny, brand new baby. It was useful a few times when they were sick or had stuffy noses for my peace of mind.
