I bought this stroller due to the fact that it went with the Summer Infant Prodigy Infant Car Seat, Blaze.The product arrived promptly as expected with Amazon Prime and required minor assembly, which was not a problem. My mother and I did it without the instructions.I have had the product for 6 months and have only used it a handful of times, not because of the product, I just haven't needed to use it anywhere.The product is lightweight and VERY easy to open and close, I do it with my left hand while I hold my baby on my hip in my right.  (I am right handed).  It's very sturdy and I love that the car seat fits in it perfectly and I also love that it folds up to a very convenient size.The biggest issues I ran into with this stroller I encountered when I sat my child forward facing.  The incline only goes up to 45 degrees from the flat position, and the way it inclines is through adjustable straps. There is no locking mechanism like on other strollers I have seen which was a little irritating, considering the price.Also strapping my 5month old in, was quite the battle, again the adjustable straps to strap him in are not very user friendly and even on the tightest setting they were really loose. I will probably wait until he is a little bigger to put him in again.Other than those small design flaws, I have only one other complaint and that is when you try to do any speed other than walk with this product, the front wheel goes all whack and drags the ground.Overall, the product is of average quality. I would have liked for there to have been a place to put my phone and keys close to the handle but I knew that it did not have that before I purchased it.  The cup holder that comes on it is a joke, I removed it almost immediately.
