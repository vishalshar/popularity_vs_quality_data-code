I wanted a drying rack that could sit inside of my sink instead of taking up counter space.  This product fit the bill in that way - It’s compact and unassuming.  (we use it for the dishes that we don’t put in the dishwasher).  However, a BIG flaw in this product is that it has no drainage holes for the water! This would be much better if it had drainage holes and if one side were slightly elevated for the water to run down and out through those holes.
