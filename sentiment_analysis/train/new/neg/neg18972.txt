We purchased this bathtub thermometer because we are always struggling to find the correct temperature for our tub. We have had this unit for about nine months the display still works correctly however the duck has filled up with water. We think the bathtub ducky thermometers is an excellent concept however this unit could benefit from some better engineering to make sure that it last longer although our current unit is still in use and has not failed yet. One bonus feature about the duck is it also has a red light that flashes when the temperature reaches 100Â° or above all though we don't use this feature and it might be useful to some.
