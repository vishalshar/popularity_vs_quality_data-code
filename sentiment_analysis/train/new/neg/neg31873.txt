Okay so, I got these for my son after he outgrew the 0-6 months regular ones. Mam is the only brand he will take. The first one our of the 2 pack I gave him he used for about a month and a half and then I noticed it looked a little strange one day as I washed it. As I turned it over the whole base of the rubber going into the mouth was slit open! I of course freaked out, but after calming myself I figured it must've been that somehow his teeth bit a hole in it and it was a fluke. Reluctantly, I gave him the second one in the pack and just around a month- the exact same thing! The torn open part is right at the base where it connects almost and is nearly a straight line across, doesn't look like teeth did it to me. Now I'm terrified to give him another mam pacifier. All I can think is what if he had been in his crib and it broke enough to come loose?
