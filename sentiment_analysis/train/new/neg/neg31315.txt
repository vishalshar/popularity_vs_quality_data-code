The product is well made, but did not meet my needs. I drive a van and my sons seat is a britex. The mat did not cover the seat area where my son steps when getting into his seat. So for smaller cars or smaller car seat this mat may work, but I was not impressed. Pervious to this mat I was using a bath towel, I may go back to this method as it meat my needs and was simple to change out and clean as needed. The mat said it was grey, but the mat I received is black, not a big deal to me, but the description is not accurate. The two small pockets on the front are useless. They are too small to hold anything, one larger pocket would have been better.
