Ok, first of all, I'm an idiot for making my daughter wear this "visor-style" when washing her hair. Pointed down, the water and soap ran everywhere. I realized it needs to be worn flipped up "statue of liberty- style" and then it worked as advertised. You need to have a child that will allow you to fit it quite snugly on their head. The foam is flexible enough but some kids probably wouldn't like the sensation of wearing it before you get to test how well it works with water. If your child has longer hair, it can get tangled in the Velcro closure in back but wasn't a big problem. Over a year of use, the fabric has started to peel away from the foam but is still functional.
