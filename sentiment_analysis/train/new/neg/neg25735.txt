The walker is advertised for 4 months and up.  Our little one is 5 months old, normal height and is still not close to reaching the floor.  Maybe it should be call the hovercraft- because that's all baby can do on this.  To add insult to injury, it was difficult to fold up when we realized we had to put it away for a couple more months.  If your 4-5 month old baby is Wilt Chamberlain Jr., go for it, otherwise hold off.  Boo!!!
