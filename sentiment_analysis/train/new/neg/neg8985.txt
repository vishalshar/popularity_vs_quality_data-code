I purchased three organic cotton mattress covers from three different company and I feel that many companies are jumping on the organic bandwagon and pushing out inferior products with a bit of false advertising. This product states 100% organic cotton surface, but the pad, on the label, says 20% organic cotton blend. Again, that is very misleading (and the pad is thick and bulky anyway). I am definitely returning it.About the other two if you are searching for the right one. I bought the Colgate organic mattress pad as I have the Colgate Eco organic mattress and spent a lot of money on it ($250). I have been pleased with the mattress and was looking forward to buying this cover to match. I received it the other day and noticed that the underside of the cover smelled a bit like plastic. Obviously this was due to the waterproof backing. I could maybe live with that, but....and this is a big one.I would like to know how this is sold as organic ?? The care instruction label states 100% polyester. That's right 100%.I understand that it can't be 100% organic cotton AND waterproof, but there is nothing remotely labeled "organic" cotton, or ever COTTON except the paper product insert and the top of the pad says certified organic cotton. It feels soft like cotton, but is it? I am very disappointed. I would hope that the company would get back to me regarding this because it is VERY misleading to sell something as organic cotton, while it states that is 100% polyester....unless the label is incorrect. Please see my review for the update.The third product, the Naturpedic waterproof mattress pad felt like a piece of soft piece of canvas. HOWEVER, the label states 100% organic cotton.
