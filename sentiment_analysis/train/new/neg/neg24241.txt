*********WARNING:  DO NOT USE THIS GATE AT THE TOP OF YOUR STAIRS.************UPDATE #3: I moved this to the top because it is important.  The gate does not always latch if you close it too quickly.  When your child is old enough, they may try and help you close the gate - just like my toddler did this evening - and when you watch the latch fail and your toddler fall down your stairs, it is a horrible, horrible moment.  Our 18 month old was so happy and trying to help me push the gate closed.  As he pushed, I watched as it swung right past the latch, and before I could catch him, he tumbled down our hardwood stairs.  It was terrifying.  This product should absolutely NOT be used at the top of the stairs.  Thankfully, he is okay, but I am writing this as I sit awake checking on him constantly, stressed and scared, replaying that fall over and over in my head.  I am contacting the manufacturer, but I felt like I should update this review.  We will be removing that gate ASAP and finding something that will keep our child safe.*********WARNING:  DO NOT USE THIS GATE AT THE TOP OF YOUR STAIRS.************I really, really, really should have listened to the reviews on this product's installation.  It royally sucks.  Nothing "slides" anywhere.  And go ahead - try and tap it in with a hammer - you'll just rip it out of the wall.  So, I'm stuck trying to force this last latch piece in or tearing the whole thing out, repairing the walls, and getting the not-so-pretty pressure-mounted gate.  I really am regretting purchasing this gate.  I doubt I'll even be able to return it because it was such a nightmare getting it in, it will probably be completely destroyed if I try to get it out.I would like to add: I am a competent person who knows how to use tools and have installed many products prior to this nightmare.  It's not a user error!Last thought: if you do decided to try and do this, you MUST have flat wall where you are installing it.  If there is anything in the way up to 3 ft above where the gate will be DO NOT BUY THIS GATE.  Don't do it with a chair rail, any sort of banister top, etc.  It will not work.  Of course, even with the flush surface the dang thing doesn't install so it doesn't really matter in the end.  Just don't buy this.UPDATE: The Munchkin customer service was pretty great.  They sent us out a replacement piece.  I was able to get stuck piece out and install the replacement pieces.  It still stuck like crazy.  I just kept spraying everything with WD-40.  It saved the gate.  Now that it is in place, it does look really nice and is very functional/easy-to-use.  Just be prepared for a possible hellish installation.  I honestly don't know if I would buy this again if I could do it all over.  It is a nice looking gate, but a more than frustrating experience to put in.UPDATE #2: We have had this gate installed for over 6 months now.  It has been really great and we have gotten a lot of compliments.  I would still caution anyone on the install and wouldn't say it is easy to "slide in and out" - we can't do that with ours, but you can open it all the way and it will stay, so if you need to carry something through the gate, you can.  That is both a plus and a minus: the gate does not auto-close, so you have to be really conscientious about making sure to always close it behind you, especially before your child knows how to safely use stairs (ours is at the top of a staircase).  I would give the gate 5 stars for appearance, 4 stars for function and 1 or 2 stars for installation, so I split the difference and updated this rating to 3 stars.
