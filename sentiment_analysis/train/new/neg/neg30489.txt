We heard great things about these bottles so we bought a bunch thinking our son would like them. These are awful! Our son constantly chokes when eating from these and milk squirts out when he's sucking. We bought Dr. Brown's since and we love those! (Except for the billion pieces we have to clean) I would recommend those over these.
