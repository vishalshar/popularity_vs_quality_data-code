I bought this tray for freezing baby food purees for my son. It does what it's supposed to do, freezes the purees, but could use a few improvements.Pros: the plastic is easy to clean. Hot water loosens the food that gets stuck on, and you can then transfer to the top rack of your dishwasher. Lots of wells means you can freeze a good amount of food at once. The tray is twistable so fairly easy to pop the food out once frozen.Cons: not airtight, so definitely don't store the food in it, transfer to a freezer bag once frozen or it will get freezer burned. The sliding mechanism is fairly difficult for me to open. I have natural nails that I work hard to grow out, and I broke one of my nails sliding it open (ladies, you know how tragic this is!)So, it's okay. Does its job but nothing more. I am sure there are better products out there, but I am content using this one for now.
