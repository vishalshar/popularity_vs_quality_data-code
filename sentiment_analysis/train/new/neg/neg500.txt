This was the first teether I bought for my daughter who at six month started to gnaw on everything and drool all over the place. These keys don't hold much appeal to her as a teether. I think the main reason for that is the hard plastic. She prefers to chew on soft materials like the ubiquitous Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether or even the Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys. The other problem is that she doesn't have the motor skills yet to always find the skinny part of the keys, so most of the time she chews on the grip or the ring instead, which turns out to be rather unsatisfying. I have since bought a couple of other teethers including the Vulli 2 Pack Vanilla Flavored Ring Teethe, Colors May Vary. But her favorite thing to chew on by far is a cold, wet washcloth.In summary, these keys didn't work quite as well as a teether for my baby, but I might think of other uses for them down the road. In all fairness, if it turns out your baby doesn't like it, your risk is pretty low given the price and Prime shipping.
