The stroller is very nice. It's lightweight enough for me to get it in and out of the trunk with one hand as I hold my son in my other arm. Easy to open. Love the harness strap. And absolutely love the part you can flip up or down for the babies legs. BUT, the canopy is a JOKE. Completely useless. The only reason it is still attached on mine is because there is a pocket on the back that I keep my phone in rather than having to pull it out of my pocket. I will be purchasing a different canopy for it.
