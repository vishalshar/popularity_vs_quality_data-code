The side wraps are great and keep my daughter from chewing her wooden crib to pieces but the front long rail wrap has the shortest attachment strings I've ever seen on such a useful product! We had to improvise and attach more fabric to the strings to be able to tie it around the front of the crib!!!!! This is def a design flaw but for now it works good for this teething period!
