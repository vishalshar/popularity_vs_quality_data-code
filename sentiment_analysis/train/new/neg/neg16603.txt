I bought this as a quiet toy for my son to play with in church and it does it's job, I just thought it did more stuff and he gets bored with it easy, but that being said, he hasn't quite figured out how to put the ball in the hole or the rattle in the pocket as he is only 8 months, he does however like to lay on it and gum it (because it's soft and he's teething) at home when it's on the floor.
