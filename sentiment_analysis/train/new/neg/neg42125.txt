After two months of normal use on a toddler bed, the cover on this mattress cracked. I contacted customer service, and they were helpful and responsive - which is why this product is getting two stars instead of one.It turns out the warranty only covers manufacturers' defects. This means if you open the package and find something wrong, they'll replace the mattress for you. If it begins to fall apart because it's a flimsy product, you're on your own. In other words, there's not really a 10-year warranty, because what manufacturers' defects could you suddenly notice after 9 1/2 years?The company did offer to replace my mattress for free, as long as I pay $27 for shipping.My girl is average-sized, and she isn't allowed to jump on the bed, which means it only happens once a month or so. I suspect this just isn't strong enough for a toddler. It'd probably be fine for occasional use or for a small baby.To recap:- The cover is flimsy, and broke after two months.- The "warranty" doesn't actually cover anything except an immediately defective product.- It's not sturdy enough for a toddler.- Unless you only need this for occasional use, I strongly recommend a different brand.
