I bought mam bottles for my baby, and she loved it, I thought she would love this one too, but when she drink milk from it the nipple went invert into the bottle every time, and she seems confused. This one is not like the bottle I bought, which can be taking apart at the bottom, it's the venting system design cause the problem, don't buy this product.
