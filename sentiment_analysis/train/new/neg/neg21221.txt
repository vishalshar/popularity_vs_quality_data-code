I usually don't write reviews, but I don't want another parent to go through what we went through with this product. So dangerous.I had high hopes for this blender when I bought it, and was so excited to be making food for my beautiful new baby. However, to my horror after making a couple of batches of baby food, and subsequently tasting it before storage, I noticed something that felt like a grain of sand in my mouth, I took it out and it turned out to be a little piece of metal!! I then went through the baby food I just made and found other bits to my shock and dismay. I can only assume that with heavier  foods (I put in thick, but softened, sweet potatoes) the blades just don't hold up.Save your money on this product. Really at the end of the day, its safer that way.
