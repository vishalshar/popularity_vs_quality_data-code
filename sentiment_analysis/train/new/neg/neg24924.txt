This is a cute keepsake to remember our daughter's first Christmas.  My only issue is that the clear plastic cover over the picture slides out easily.  I can see it getting lost sometime in the future when I pull it out to hang on the tree or right before I put it away to store.  But I do think its cute and I like that it holds a picture of our baby and that you can enter your baby's height, weight, length, and birthday (I think, its stored away with the Christmas stuff now).
