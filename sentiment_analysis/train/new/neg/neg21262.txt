I ordered these toys for my son since theres no way these can really grow mildew;they are hard plastic with strainer holes but, these were not worth the price in my opinion. I was reminded of a toy from a happy meal....and its not the fact they are plastic, its just not enough going on for the price. And i dont mean loud noises and lights its just this couldve been cheaper. Also the penguin came with scratches on it out the package. Buy it if you want mildew free toys but, you wont be getting much. P.S. the package says 12 months old and up but i got it for my 6 month old, i cant see a child older than 12 months being into these.
