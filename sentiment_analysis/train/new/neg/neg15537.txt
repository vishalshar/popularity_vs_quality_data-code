I bought this bag some months ago and first time of use it ripped near the wheels. I contacted Maclaren customer service and all they could say is that their product never had any complaint, and that it was probably mishandled by the airline I traveled with. However, the problem occurred on my way to the airport, before being handled by the airline, and I had to make a quick tape repair before shipping. Now I'm stuck with an expensive and ripped bag, and no intentions of the manufacturer to investigate this further.
