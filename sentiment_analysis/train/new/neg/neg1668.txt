My baby loves it and seems to keep it in his mouth better than a regular paci. I believe the one I received though is a knockoff. The packaging wasn't the same as what I had seen in the store, and seems kinda cheap. It's also not as soft as some of the real ones I have seen. All of that would have been fine if I hadn't paid the same price as one that I know was authentic cost.
