We bought a single Savvy for our daughter when she was born 7 years ago and we loved it. That stroller went everywhere with us, through every kind of condition, and held up beautifully. The twin savvy started falling apart as soon as we got it out of the box. The clips on the straps broke, the bar pops off, and the hinges on the umbrellas are so flimsy that they bend if you try to use them. This stroller is made very cheaply and you'll find that out quickly as soon as you use it. The recline on the seats is not very far so sleeping children can not truly recline. The one drawback on the single Savvy was the small and inaccessible basket and that holds true here, as well.I used to tell people to buy Combi but now I tell them to look elsewhere, especially for the money.
