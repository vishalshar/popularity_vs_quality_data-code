I am not the person who wrote the review, but I have to do this time.I really really wanted to have this swing, because my daughter liked the swing. So, I bought this swing, the swing was broken on the motor part. However, I wanted to try once again, so I ordered the new one. Unfortunately, the 2nd one was also defective. The silver part to connect between the legs wasn't there. How they did not check the part carefully. I am so disappointed. I think they did not confirm their product, and didn't care about baby's safety. Before buying this swing (discontinued by manufacturer) I bought the newer version, I tried twice of newer version the puppy one and the bear ballerina. THOSE ARE ALSO DEFECTIVE!!. ALL 4 BABY SWINGS ARE DEFECTIVE!! I HATE FISHER PRICE BABY SWING!  FISHER PRICE SWING IS SO BAD!!
