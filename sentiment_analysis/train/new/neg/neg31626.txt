We've got 2 of these gates, having ordered them because they were similar to an older style my parents and grandparents use for their dogs.  This does the job, but I have a couple of complaints:1) You have to loosen 4 screws to adjust the gate size, then tighten them back down without letting the new size slip.  The other gates I'm familiar with just had 2 knobs you turned to 'release' the size, then turned the knobs back to lock it in.  This is a gate I don't want to be moving to different sized doorways very often.2) The pieces that move in and out to put pressure on the door frame don't move quite enough.  If I'm not using the hinges, then when I adjust the gate so it's almost too tight to get in the doorway, it still doesn't quite show all green in the little 'intelligent' diamonds.  If I stretched the gate out any bigger, I couldn't get it in the doorway at all, much less latch it.  And if I DO use the hinges, the intelligent feature may as well not work at all.  It takes a bit more clearance to swing the gate closed in a doorway than it would to just set it in place, so it has to be adjusted a bit smaller to make up for that.  This means it's slightly less 'secure', but also that the 'intelligent' diamonds never turn more than just a sliver of green.This gate does the job, and gets 3 stars for that. But a couple of relatively small fixes could make it a 5 star product.
