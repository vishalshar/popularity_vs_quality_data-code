The saddlebag arrived as expected and works fairly well. I needed something for my separate master bath tub that doesn't have high tile around the edge to stick bath toy collectors to.I would recommend tying the rope around the knobs like shown instead of shoelaces so that the bag drops further into the tub and you can dump the toys out easier.I do think this was pretty overpriced but I wasn't willing to make it myself.Also, I don't understand the blue flap other than to have it look like a saddle bag. It gets in the way so we just tuck it behind the bag and forget about it.The emails you get from this company are plentiful (thanks for your order, here's your ebook, your order will ship soon, it shipped, it's arrived, did you get it?) and pretty obnoxious. Also, I don't need a digital book for my baby. I just want a toy collector.This morning, I received another email from the company with tips on parenting. This is a "tip":"Tip#2 - Keep baskets compartmented for certain toys. Boys could have a basket just for cars. Girls could have a basket for dolls. This is an easy way to learn to sort things."Okay. Because only boys play with cars and only girls play with dolls? Look, I'm not looking for ways to be irritated with the company...they're just freely providing reasons to be irritated with them.I do not need tips on gender stereotyping parenting from the maker of a bath toy collector.I think this company is trying to be more than what it is. Just sell a bath toy collector and be done with it.
