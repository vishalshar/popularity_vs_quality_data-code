I bought this for my newborn nephews room, It looked fine, with a nice finish UNTIL it was washed for FIRST time... and completely LOST COLOR. Now it looks like is 10 years old and washed a thousand times. And dont think I put that on the washer machine and forgot for 6 hours running, it was washed on gentle/soft circle with very light/soft soap. Bought another 2 ones and now we're scared to wash it.
