The booster seat itself stays secure on most chairs with flat seats. The rubber disks on the underside of the unit grips to most flat surfaces, but the surface of the booster seat itself is hard and slippery and our son kept sliding off of the chair. This booster seat might work for older toddlers who don't need a back rest and can balance on a hard seat for a period of time, but for younger toddlers (our son was 2- 1/2 when we got this), it didn't work very well. I am a big fan of Baby Bjorn products in general, but this one was thumbs down.
