Took two starts from it because: 1. it is NOT very easy or comfortable to get our 4 mo old in or out of it.2. the bottom part/foot rest though covered in fabric is still very hard for an active infant who likes to move his legs and feet fast and bang them on it. AT times it'd hurt his heals and he would get upset, so I added extra padding to that.3. While it is a great idea for impatient supported sitters, who force you to hold them in sitting position for long periods of time so they can enjoy "sitting and playing" :) Our little one wanted to sit so bad on his own while his body still couldn't support him, and he got very mad if you tried to recline him, so when this arrived it was very exciting. However, he got bored very quickly with the two toys upfront, and insisted on going back to his playmat and me holding him so he could play with the overhead toys, rattling them and pulling on them and looking at little mirror he likes to "talk" to. So my fianc√© came up with a solution and created a support box to attach the overhead toys from his mat, to this sitter toy and our 4 mo old is enjoying it once again. I will have to sand it and paint it and it is kind of bulky but our LO loves it and that's all that matters. That said: it is a lot of extra work and solutions to make this toy comfortable and entertaining for the price we paid.
