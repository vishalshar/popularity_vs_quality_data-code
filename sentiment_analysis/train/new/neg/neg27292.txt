I bought this to cover our TV stand and other furniture with sharp edges and corners. Our son is now 11 months old and is cruising a lot, so I worry that he'll hit his head. However, this product did not work at all. It does stick to the corners, but only if you don't have a curious little one around (and why would you buy this if you didn't?). My son was able to pull all of the corners off within 5 minutes and they became teethers for him instead of serving their intended purpose. I don't know if any other products have better adhesive, but this one was useless.
