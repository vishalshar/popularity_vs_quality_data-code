Great item and my Daughter loved it.  Kept it in nice shape for my son to use soon.  BUT!!!  The only thing I DIDNT LIKE was that they actually had a 'fake cell phone' attached for the child to use and store in a holder while they are riding?  Really!?! You put a cell phone on a tricycle for a child to talk on a phone while learning to ride?  stupid idea
