Bought this to replace the babies r us brand wipe warmer that I received as a shower gift. The one I had was dropped down the stairs and didn't survive. I though this would be better because it is more compact, looks nicer and has a light but I was wrong. It works well enough that I don't feel the need to replace it but I get annoyed with it. Heres my list of pros and consPros: compact  Looks niceCons: light is so dim it's useless  Door not easy to close because it is thin plastic and you have to line it up and press firmly  Wipes are not as warm
