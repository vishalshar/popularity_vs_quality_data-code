Wonderful FULL set of dinnerware for your toddler and they will enjoy the decorations if they love the book they will love this set.A bit pricey for it but my grand daughter loves the book so a great set for her.Love the matching fork and spoon and cup and the divided section plate plus a nice size bowl.
