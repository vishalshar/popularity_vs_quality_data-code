Parts don't fit together quite correctly. Packaging is ok but some wood suffered from dents during shipping. I'd rather pay the $130.00 I paid for this than the Stokke it was modeled from, but be prepared for imperfection. The two steel poles included in mine are too short to fit properly without bowing the wood legs. A couple of black washers will fix this, but ideally I shouldnt need to make the parts fit myself. I would probably buy another one; as my daughter loves it and is much better than a regular high chair. However I think for the quality $130.00 is still too much money (but I wouldn't pay $230.00 for the stokke unless it were made from gold).
