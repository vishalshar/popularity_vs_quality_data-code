I wanted a soft and cute Easter present for my grandson, and found that almost all of the "baby" toys that I could find in stores were Made In China.  Since China has been a source of so many poor quality or even dangerous toys, I came to Amazon in the hope that I could find a better choice.  North American Bear Company gets really good reviews, so I investigated the company even more on the internet....nothing indicated that their toys were made anywhere but in the USA.  The Sleepyhead Bunny gets really great reviews also, so I purchased it.  I think that the bunny is well-made and very soft and cute which is why I am giving it a generous 3 stars.  I was sad to see the attached label on the bunny that read "Made in China". It seems that if I want a toy made in the USA that I will need to sew one myself next time.  If that seems overprotective....well these are our children we are talking about and I don't want a toy that is anything like the garden hoses or Christmas lights from China that say you must wash your hands after touching them due to lead content.  Until we as a nation have better control over the quality of imports , I think that we ought to at least know up front where the product is coming from so that we can make informed choices.  North American Bear Company should state clearly that they are not making the Sleepyhead Bunny, but are importing it for sale with their company name on it.
