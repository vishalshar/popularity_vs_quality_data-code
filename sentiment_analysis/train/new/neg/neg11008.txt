I bought this walker based on the comment in the "From the Manufacturer" section, which at this writing (Mar 2015) reads "child must be taller than 32 inch."  Our 10 month old is  between 30 and 32 inches (it's hard to get an exact measurement).  She outgrew the walker we had and she was tipping over in it.  So, I was happy to see that this walker would be for a very tall baby.  Except that apparently this is a typo.  The instructions that come with the walker say that the child "must NOT be taller than 32 inches."  So, that was initially disappointing.  However, we decided to try it anyway and were happy to find that at the highest setting, her tiptoes are on the floor, as they should be.  The wider base keeps her from tipping, so that's nice.  The only thing is, it's not as easy for her to steer as the last walker, and the wider base makes it hard for her to turn around in or near doorways, which she had become proficient at.As for rolling on the carpet, it won't initially, but there is a way to fix this.  Turn the walker over, and you'll see that around the bottom are these white, rubber  pieces.  They actually pop out.  The baby's weight, at least in our case, pushes these pieces straight to the floor, making it impossible for the baby to move the walker when it's on the carpet.  So, you pop out these rubber pieces and it totally fixes that issue.  Our carpet has a medium to thin nap.A final note--and I don't know if other users have experienced this, but we sure have--the wheels tend to gum up, hair and dirt and whatnot gets in them and renders them useless.  We solved this by getting caster wheels at Home Depot.  They can really be gotten at any hardware store and they're about $5.  Anyway, you can remove the wheels that come with the walker and replace them with these, and they won't get gummed up.
