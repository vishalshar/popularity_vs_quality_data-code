If greasy food touched the mat, the color rubs off on to the napkin. The color ink doesn't wash off with water, but will release the color with plain cooking oil. Imagine what happens when the child eats French fries and rubs the greasy hands on the mat.... I would imagine color on the hands and possible ingesting the dye. I've emailed the company and they said they don't use chemical to seal the ink(non toxic according to the company) and said I can flip it over to use.
