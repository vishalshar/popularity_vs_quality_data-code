Although this is a beautiful and soft mat for our daughter to lay on, it is almost impossible to wrap around our car seat's carrier bar. We have a Graco, and it has a slight bend at the top of the handle. With that bend, I can just barely get the wrap to velcro around it, and it looks like it could pop off at any minute. I tried rolling it a little differently, but that didn't help. I considered keeping this item just for a changing pad/playmat, but we really don't need another of either. So it's going to have to go back, despite how cute it is.
