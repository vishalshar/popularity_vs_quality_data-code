The main problem I have with this product is the fact that my son slumps all the way over when he falls asleep.  It's the most frustrating thing because it doesn't make me feel okay that he's safe in the seat.  I've tried making sure the seat belt is locked to hold him but he still falls right over and I constantly have to reach back and push him up.  Also, the cup holders are not that deep to prevent cups from falling out.  Also complains about his bottom hurting and he's not sitting on anything except the seat.
