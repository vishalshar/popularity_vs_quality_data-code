Cons:•The nipples are all supposed to be different but they didn't come labeled nor do they have any discernible differences so I have no way of finding out which nipple is low flow, medium flow, or high flow.•The markings for oz and ml are REALLY difficult to see, so I have been drawing the oz lines on the bottles with a permanent marker.•I hate the round brush... A generically shaped bottle brush works so much better.Pros:•I love the shape of these bottles and how easy they are to clean.•The nipples are great quality and the bottles don't leak at all.•I especially love the caps and the colour (greeny-yellow).•My little one has a much easier time holding these bottles than longer ones because he can reach his little hands to the bottom.
