I ordered these fitted sheets in both blue and off white to go over our Seamless 2 Stage Naturepedic Mattress.  I also had a thin waterproof mattress liner in between the mattress and the Under the Nile Fitted Crib Sheet.I washed the sheet in Method Baby Detergent before putting the sheet on the bed.  The sheet came out of the dryer very soft and I love the color, but I do not think the quality of the sheet will hold up.  I've already noticed a small hole along the corner seam and feel that the sheet bunches up in the middle of the mattress a bit more than I'd like.
