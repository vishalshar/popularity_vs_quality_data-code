I ordered this product to use on my (very standard, typically sized) double hung window, in order to prevent my toddler from opening the window too far.  The suction cups work fine, but the "steps" aren't nearly deep enough and don't stop the window at all.  They would need to be at least another inch larger in order to work.Of course, because I'd already tried them on my (newly Windexed) window, the seller wouldn't let me return them.  A disappointing waste of money.
