The picture showed a pink blanket with brown  owls. It came in YELLOW with brown owls! Very ugly color combo: yellow & brown.  I did not want YELLOW! I wanted PINK!!! The muslin blankets themselved are GREAT quality!!! But I do not want that ugly color combo. I tried to return, but it's so confusing! I have never returned anything in my life so am not experienced at returning things! This is the FIRST time I have ever been dissapointed with an order on AMAZON.
