Notes on the room: I put these up in my nursery.  My wall was clean, and the light yellow paint was done over a year ago.  Works well with a pond theme!Some of these are a bit close together, so cutting them with enough space to be able to hold them to the wall tightly can be a bit tricky.  The directions say "press firmly", what they mean is "press and scrape as hard as you can without breaking the tongue presser stick on the wall".  You arm gets pretty tired after only two dragonflies.I didn't have any troubles with air bubbles like the directions warned, but I did have troubles with the tiny dragonflies.  The smaller the dragonfly, the harder it is to get the adhesive to stick.  The instructions warn you that tiny pieces and edges (like the antennae or tip of the tail) can be troublesome.  I find that if you can get all the edges stuck down, the middle shouldn't be a problem.  If you peel some off, and it doesn't stick, only about 50% of the time will putting it back down and re-scraping work.Honestly, on some of the harder dragonflies, the adhesive won't entirely work.  You just have to say "screw it" after working on one dragonfly for 10 minutes, and tear it off the wall.  The body, tail, and most of the wings will stick.  Everything else is a maybe.  THe instructions say you can fix it up with paint, which is true - but it's a pain.I do love the colors, design, and ability to put them anywhere.  But next time I'll try other things first before I go back to these.
