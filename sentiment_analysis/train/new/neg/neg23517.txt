I purchased this because I wanted that ultra soft dot blanket you see all around and also because this blanket has a great rating score. The product image doesn't really tell you the whole story. The material of this blanket is not the "minky" ultra plush that you probably imagine from looking at the image and dot pattern.  This blanket is not as thick as you think. There is a satin trim on the front side but full on satin on the underside. I would purchase this if you're looking for a lightweight summer blanket that goes well on an infant car seat. This product page needs to be updated with more product images.
