These diapers come in soft colors and they are wonderfully fluffy and soft. I ordered the purple one to try first, but unfortunately after only 2 washings (following the manufacturer's instructions correctly) the insert came detached! But it is very absorbent and fits inside the covers I have (not Kissaluvs brand) so I'm not that upset by it.--UPDATE--Since my first purchase of the purple diaper I bought two more in orange and green. I loved them because they were super soft and very absorbent. Like wrapping baby up in a nice warm towel. Unfortunately I have very hard water and they started to get hard and yucky. No matter what I did I couldn't make them nice and soft again. I tried literally everything there is (RLR and Calgon too) and nothing helped. These are just not great for very hard water I guess. I hate that I couldn't use them because there aren't many fitteds that are OS that will fit a larger toddler, and these definitely would have fit my little girl who is in the 95th percentile for her age and needs bigger diapers. I do recommend trying these if your water is softer though.
