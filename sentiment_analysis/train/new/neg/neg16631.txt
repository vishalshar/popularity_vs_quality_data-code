Well, I took a chance on this product and, even though I have bucket seats, was disappointed to find that the seat did tip over (not a little, but a LOT) with most turns. I read this in several reviews, but since I have bucket seats I thought this item might be ok. I was forced to return this item to Amazon within about a week of use. I believe this is due to the base being substantially narrower than the body of the seat.Saying that, I was impressed with the fabric, cushioning, and head support. Arrived on time. Excellent customer service from Amazon, as always.
