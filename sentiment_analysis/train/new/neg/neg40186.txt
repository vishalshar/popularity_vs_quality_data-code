Purchased the Animal hooded towel, found out after I bought it that it wasn't the best size for our baby, and called to try to return the product.  They wanted to charge a restocking fee (for a towel!), and the remainder would only be given as a credit to THEIR website.  The towel was good quality, though (not great).
