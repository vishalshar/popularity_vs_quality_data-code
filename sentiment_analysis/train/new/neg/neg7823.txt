I ordered this product on may 19th, two weeks later nothing! I emailed the company and they give me some lame excuse that there was a glitch in their system. Like any customer I wanted to know when I would get my item?! Customer service rep was very vague and didn't answer my questions- I asked for my item to be rushed delivered to me since I waited so long and still no response to my direct question! I give it three stars bc it's nothing too special or big that they couldn't spring to ship to me sooner.
