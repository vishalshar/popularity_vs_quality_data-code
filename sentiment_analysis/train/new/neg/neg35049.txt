We have a power strip for our entertainment center that we use to plug in our TV, DVD player, modem, router, and Roku. Three of those appliances have large rectangular boxes at the end of the plug with the cord coming out of the side. These do not fit in the safety cover at all, so we can't use it. This product needs to be redesigned to be roomier on the inside so that it can actually fit these larger plugs. The product would ONLY work if you are just plugging in standard two- or three-prong cords, such as the power cord for your PC or phone charger.
