These turned out to be useless for us, because my son is left-handed. This means that the fork and spoon point the wrong way for him. Most babies are fairly ambidextrous, so it's not an issue for most parents, but if your kid shows a pronounced tendency for left-handedness, these utensils will only frustrate them.Aside from that, though, these are still only mediocre. The handles are too thick for my 1-year-old son to grab, but the gap in the middle of the handle is too small for his fingers. Even as a toy, these aren't very good.Also, the color change takes 30 seconds, which is a lifetime when your irate toddler is begging for food, and only kicks in at 105F, which is way, way too hot. Just stick your finger in the food to see if it's a good temperature. It's faster, easier, and more informative.
