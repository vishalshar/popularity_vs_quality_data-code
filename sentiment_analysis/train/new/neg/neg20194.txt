Very cute print and design to transition from swaddling but it runs small. The only reason for the 3 stars is that based on the stage sizes on the product, my son is a small (12lbs and 24inches) but when I put it on it is too small around the neck even with out washing it. Once washed I am sure it will shrink a little. There was only a one finger gap, I could leave the snap buttons open but I didn't feel comfortable with zipper rubbing against his skin. I would recommend ordering a large if you have a chubby baby like mine.
