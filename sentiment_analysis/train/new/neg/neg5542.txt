This booster and the shells are the only part of this hybrid system that are designed and work well.I use these boosters on top of a prefold with the GroVia Shells, and used alone with the shells they would be good for potty training.Overall I do not like the snap in soaker inserts for this system, see the review on them on another page, but I do use these nice, soft and trim boosters to protect my son's bum from wetness and chaffing and provide a little extra absorbency.  They are surprisingly absorbent for as thin as they are.
