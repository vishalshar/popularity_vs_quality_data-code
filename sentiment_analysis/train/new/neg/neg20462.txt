I have several soft spout cups I am trying to replace.  They aren't made anymore so I thought I hit the jackpot with this listing. When I received the cups they were NOT SOFT SPOUT!  They were plastic covered with rubber. These are not for sensitive teeth, for when you touch the spout it doesn't move or give.... Because it is HARD, not a SOFT SPOUT!  Really disappointed and wish this would have been an accurate listing!  Plus the cups are different than what is pictured!
