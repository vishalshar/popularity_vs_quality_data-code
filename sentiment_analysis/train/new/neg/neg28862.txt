I purchased the Contempo chair for my in-law's house in Arizona before I needed a chair here at home.  It was very easy to use.  When I returned home and needed a highchair here, I found this one on sale.  The main reasons I prefer the contempo to this chair are:1: The swivel wheels and brakes are in back on this model which actually makes it harder to manuver.  When you are trying to orient the baby to you, you will need to move the back part of the chair-- and if you already set the wheel locks, then you must just drag the chair into position.  This isn't a big deal if you have a set location for your highchair; but if you need to move it frequently, this can be a hastle.2: The lift-gate that you open to place your child in the chair is really stiff and can be hard to open one handed.  It is just a plastic latch-type like the Graco swings have.Other than those two issues, it works well, is easy to put together and operate.  I have a younger baby and haven't used the tray often-- the lift-gate latch has a nice mini tray-like space that works for her (about 3" x 8") that I use for her toys or will use for finger foods soon.
