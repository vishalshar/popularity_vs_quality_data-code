I had an issue with the first mirror that I received where the straps frayed about 3 months after I started using it.  A replacement was sent to me by their customer service department and it's been so far so good with the new one.  Had the straps not frayed on the original I would have been thrilled with the purchase as otherwise it's a fantastic mirror.
