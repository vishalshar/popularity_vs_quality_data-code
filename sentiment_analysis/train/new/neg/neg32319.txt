Unfortunately I live in the Philippines and couldn't return the item. This straw bottle doesn't look brand new. The color of the flip cover is faded and doesn't match the shade with the rest of the body.The straw sticks out a little too much. I have to push it back to cover the top. The plastic hinge has signs of over bent? Turned white like any plastic that has been stretched beyond its limit.
