This bag is in my office sitting on my desk as I type this message.  When I host meetings or am away from my desk during pumping time, I am comfortable zipping this baby up and nobody knows it holds a pump.  However,  I also travel for work and find this bag won't quite work for travel.  For example, the strap is just a little too short to easily go over my shoulder when I have a blazer and coat on.  Also, the pump is on the side so when I pump in a bathroom stall (and it has happened) the pump is at an odd angle.  Also, there is no outer pocket and since I take metro, a small little slip pocket for a metro card or a plane ticket would be perfect.  So for travel I use a plain blue backpack but this is my daily bag but I leave it at work...not carrying back and forth.Plusses: This bag is beautiful and there is no way anyone can tell what it is.  The zipper is strong, the storage compartment generous.  I really want to encourage the designer to make a back pack, and a storage "cozy" for the pump that I ripped out of a medela bag.
