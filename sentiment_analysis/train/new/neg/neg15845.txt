I can't believe the good reviews this mobile gets. Sure, a baby might love looking at it, but I couldn't get to that point -- it's on super thin thread that has no way to attach it to anything. It's just thread. That's it. And not enough of it to hang from a somewhat tall ceiling (older house). The whole mobile is extremely delicate as well. If you are trying to set it up and lay it down, good luck getting it back to shape. It is seriously the equivilent of an art school project -- really thin wire, really thin thread (not string... thread!) and heavy paper sheep cut outs.
