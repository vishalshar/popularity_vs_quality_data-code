Good concept, with a major flaw: it's incredibly bulky. No way to fold it neatly or store it in any way, much less fit it in your diaper bag. So it'll sit on the floor of your car, getting dirty and taking up space. Other than that, seems to do an OK job for its intended purpose. Note, however, that it is NOT cushy or soft. It's just thin fabric. It will keep your baby from touching germy surfaces, but it will NOT cushion their head if they lean too far forward or back.
