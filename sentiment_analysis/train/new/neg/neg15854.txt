No matter what I did, I could not get rid of the strong chemical smell these bottles had.  My daughter absolutely refused to drink from them, and I can't blame her.  I tried to drink from one and the smell was just overpowering.  I washed them several times and finally ended up tossing them.  It would cost me more in gas and return postage than a refund would be worth.Also, the directions say to boil them for five minutes before using... and after just three minutes the bottles were misshapen from the heat... the bottoms bowled out so that a couple of them could no longer stand up, and the ones that could were extremely wobbly.
