This toy is larger then I thought it would be (about 18in long) my 5 month old can't hang on to it very well and maneuver, its best to lay in front for tummy time but he seems to get bored with it quickly. I also thought the feet would be good for teething but the back two are a wool type fabric and the front two are a hard thin type of plastic, he doesn't like either in his mouth, but this could be a preference on his part ;)
