It appears to be a studry, well built seat that is easy to install/un-install. I couldn't quite tell where the serial number was when completing an online regristration, so I made a notation in the comment box. Apparently when I hit submit, the Regristration went into an employees inbox that is no longer with the company, the e-mail (regristration) was returned to me undeliverable. Wanting to be notified of recalls, etc I choose to email Kiddy directly. I explained I wasn't certain if I had retrieved the serial number correctly. What was their response? "I'm sure you have the correct serial#", basically I was blown off. It was not confirmed nor denied and I really don't know if it's registered or not. Secondly I complained that the seat I received was UNDER 7 years of use at the time I had even ordered it. They advertise 8 years. I could see 7 & some change, but under 7, c'mon. I was told by their Customer Service Rep that he recalled having this conversation with me back in 2013. Not true, I didn't even know Kiddy was a Company in 2013 nor was I shopping for a booster seat then. Again, I was just blown off. The whole too bad, so sad lady response. I hope I never have to contact them for replacement parts or anything ever, they have been just terrible on their service end.
