It's a nice looking plastic carabiner, slightly larger than the non-load-bearing aluminum ones you can get at grocery stores. I must say, however, that it looks and feels pretty flimsy. Especially at the pivot point for the latch. It isn't snug, and shifts from side to side. I'm confident I could pop it off if I applied the right amount of pressure. But, time will tell. My rating will go either up or down (from 3 stars) depending on my long-term results.
