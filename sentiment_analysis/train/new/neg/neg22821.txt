Reviewer: T. Hepple wrote"I returned this chair because it lacked tethers and LATCH. Although tethers and LATCH are not required for boosters at this time in regulatory history, I'd feel safer when I find a booster with at least the tether."Whoa! Jeez! NO "booster" seat is EVER supposed to be used with a latch system and that is why the newer ones do not have them.As the transportation Dept says: "Never install a car seat using both the LATCH strap and the vehicle safety belt. This restricts the belts from absorbing crash energy."Boosters are for use with the car seat belt, meaning you NEVER use the latch. Some older systems could be used by consumers who NEVER READ THE MANUAL with both. But these are called "toddler seats." They could have both a latch which you use when you are using the integral harness , as well as guides for the shoulder belt to use later as a belt adjusting booster type seat, but in that case the manual aways says to DISCONNECT the latch system - and for good reason.Without getting to deeply into the specifics, if you use both the latch to secure the seat, and the seatbelt over the child the child will move forward alone in a crash and the belt will not be in the right position relative to the child when it reaches stop point.  When done properly with NO latch the seat (which is light) moves with the child holding them in the correct position for the two to four inches of increasing tension travel until the belt stops.Again:1) Booster seats NEVER have a latch, and it is not a questin of them not being required "at this time," there will be no such requirement ever, since it it is a known danger.2) If you buy a toddler seat that has a harness and later booster capability, use the latch with the harness, but when you change to seat belt, disconnect the latch...AS ALL MANUALS emphatically state.
