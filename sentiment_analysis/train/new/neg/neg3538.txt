I really wanted to love this stroller, but it's just terrible.I wanted to use a sturdy and versable stroller for my new baby and thought this would be it. I was so wrong and have had nothing but problems. My first Quinny was broken right out of the box and the seat wouldn't attach to the frame. The second one has had constant flat tires and the seat attachements have broken again.My Quinnies have been difficult to use, difficult to collapse and totally unreliable. I will be returning it again and buying something different and hopefully better.Do not waste your money.
