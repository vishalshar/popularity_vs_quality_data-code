It was suggested that I have a few of these baby swaddlers for my daughter prior to her birth. After she was born, she never wanted to be that confined so I never used any of them. I suppose she was tightly swaddled in the womb so to finally be "free" was her favorite choice. Product wise, this is a well-made, simple design. I have no complaints about the product - just didn't work for my daughter.
