I bought this seat for my 4 year old so I could have him in a harness longer than his other seat that went to 40lbs. This is a nice seat and we loved the side impact protection. Unfortunately, when we put him in the seat his sat on top of the crotch strap instead of it being in front of him. So, in other words, his " jewels" we crushed when we tried to buckle it. Needless to say, he kept saying "TOO TIGHT, MOMMY!" I'm returning the seat tomorrow. Try your child in this before you buy. The decathlon does have a 3 position crotch strap, the marathon and roundabout do not, but there's more room in those compared to the boulevard.
