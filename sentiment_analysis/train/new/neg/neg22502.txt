This product is designed to work best on doors where the casing is flush with the door surface, not too common. If you have a casing around the door you will not be able to get the door guardian installed with the strike touching your door unless you chisel out a large portion of your door casement. Cutting into you casement might not be a problem if you want this for intrusion protection and you own your home.This product is close to being perfect for renters because the only holes are a few screw holes in the door frame that are covered by the door. Remove it when you leave and the landlord will never know. Unless you have the casing problem.Thankfully I only need this to prevent my toddler from escaping the house. So I was able to install it flush with the casing which leaves a gap between the door and the strike. This will allow you to open the door 1/2" before it hits the strike but then you are stopped. Not great for preventing forced entry but more than enough to prevent child exit.The unit feels solid and well made, i expect it to last. Installation was a breeze minus the casement issue.Update: I've added a product image to show what this looks like on my door with a 3/4" casing.
