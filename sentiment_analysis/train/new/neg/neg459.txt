Just received and they are very inconsistent. The first medium I tried wasn't flowing at all, there is a problem with the hole. The second I tried was too fast and my son was choking on the milk. So I tested a few more before feeding and one was a drip per second one was several drips per second etc. I am going to try to return these I have no idea why they are so inconsistent
