I am editing my review, which was pretty glowing at first. In less than a month, the entire product fell apart. The interior lining ripped all along the seams, making it unsafe and unusable. The wheels have fallen apart with minimal use. I have tried and tried and tried to contact the company to no avail. I used this for a few weeks, and now it is taking up space in the garage until I can figure out how to get it going again. The one positive that I have is that it is roomy. For those few weeks that I could use it, it was very nice.
