although a super cute rug, I did not realize that the backing would not be slip proof. We are using it under our cradle for now which works fine but after, it will be useless because little ones will slip on it on our wood floors. I also did not realize how small it would be but I likely missed that detail when ordering. Would be fine for older kids but not those toddlers and under.
