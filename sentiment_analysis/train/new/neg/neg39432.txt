I liked this bathtub ok when my daughter was a newborn (ok, but  doesn't look very comfy). Before her belly button stump fell off, I would put a big cushy towel in the bottom, & give her a sponge bath.. But around 3 months, she learned how to straighten out her body so that she would slide up and over the green hump, which was very dangerous when I attempted to bathe her on my own. However, she was still too small to remove the bump, as she would bend & straighten her legs quickly & slide all the way down into the water. If I were redesigning this, I'd put a divider between the legs (perhaps detachable for times when it's not needed) on the green bump to keep babies from sliding downward. Now, I've finally resorted to strapping my baby in her bouncer chair and bathing her in that, with the tub 2/3 full. Works great, and I don't have to worry as much about her sliding into the water as I'm trying to rinse shampoo out of her hair.Also I've seen an updated version of this tub elsewhere with an arch (FYI in case you're thinking about buying it)
