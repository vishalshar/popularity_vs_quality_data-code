We got this as a travel high chair for our 8 month old. The things we didn't like about this is:1) the seat is really low so baby's body is like armpit high to the table so it is awkward for them to reach up to grab food off the table and puts the table edge into a perfect hight to hit their head on.2) the tray doesn't stay in place and is easy to remove by little hands.3) the harness is awkward to use4) hard to clean and so many nooks and cranies weird crusty food can't help but find a place to linger.I did like that it came with a great little travel case and folded up easily. But that said not anything we kept or would use again.
