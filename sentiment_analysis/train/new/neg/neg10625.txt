This Halo blanket for some reason is just not as effective as its fleece counterpart, which we really love. This one has very long "wings" and is much harder to wrap around the baby. The openings also often cause his arms at the bottom to be outside the blanket. This is an excellent product and definitely helps with swaddling, but the fleece Halo blanket is better at wrapping our baby up and keeping our baby warm and cozy.
