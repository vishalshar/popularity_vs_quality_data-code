I bought these based on the reviews I read online.  I found them to be too thin.  I also felt they got stiffer after repeated washings rather than softer as better quality diapers usually do.  I would not recommend buying these.  I thought I would use them at least for dusting but did not even care for them for that task.  I finally donated them to Goodwill.
