I wish I had kept the box!This arrived as a gift off our registry.  I attached it to a box of wipes two days ago and plugged it in.  My goodness!  It bakes the top piece of the wipe that is sticking out of the pull-slot, but the rest of it is cool.Plus, the adhesive on the gizmo doesn't really stick.  How would this be good for travel?  You'd have to keep your original wipes box for all the years you have babies!Lastly, the fire hazard thing freaks me out.  It's probably not a huge deal, but I feel like I am leaving an iron on a stack of tissues.  Just my paranoia, maybe.I like the warm wipes idea because I don't think my child is going to be the type to tolerate a cold wipe on her bottom.  (Her Mama isn't that type!)  But someone needs to invent a wipes case that is battery operated and durable.
