I have 2 Ergos. One we've had for 9 years now. We still use it with our third child. I decided to splurge and get myself a purple one for our new baby, and the buckle broke only two months after we got it. We now can't use it safely. And the manufacturer is telling us there is not way to fix it or replace it, and they will not replace the Ergo. It's very disappointing that I spent a hundred dollars on something we only used for a month. We can no longer safely use it with our child.
