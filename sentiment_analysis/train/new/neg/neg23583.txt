These were the only crib guards I could find that had enough padding to protect from a head bump. They look nice on the crib and are very soft. The only negative I have is that I believe mine specifically were a return. One of the straps popped off while I was tying them on even though the others were sturdy enough, and there are 2 separate stains on 2 other straps. One looks like lipstick and the other looks like melted chocolate. A little gross. Even still, I do believe it's a good product.
