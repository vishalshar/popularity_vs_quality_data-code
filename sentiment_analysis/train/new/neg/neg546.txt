these are cute little things but kind of small and don't do much for the pretty steep price of 30 bucks! my 4-month old does like them but they don't really keep her entertained for long. my money was better spent on the manhattan toy car seat gallery (poster with switchable cards on hang on backseat: $10), which has lots of pictures she loves to stare while riding in the car.
