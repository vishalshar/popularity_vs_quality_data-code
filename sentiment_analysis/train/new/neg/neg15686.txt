At first my 7 month old son was afraid of it but as the batteries began to wear out, it wasn't so intimidating.  The music was softer and Pooh didn't stomp so loudly.  There was a day when Pooh had a meltdown.  His words and music cycled randomly and made no sense and then he turned himself off.  I thought he was possessed.  I immediately changed his batteries.  It has not happened since.  The toy is cute and I catch my son hugging it from time to time when he is not pulling Pooh around by his ear trying to make him play music.  =-)
