This is by far one of the most annoying boosters I have ever purchased.I am trying to find another to replace it so I can finally toss this thing to the dumpster!To begin with, whichever reviewer said that this booster has no cracks or crevices (which was why I bought the booster in the first place) was entirely incorrect. Not only does it have 1/2 inch gaps between the armrest areas and the blue booster base/frame, but it also has holes in the seat and in the bottom of the base. That means that any little crumb or spill makes its way either through the holes and then gets the whole hollow base a mess and then the chair a mess (which you have to constantly have to lift the booster up to wipe off the chair's seat area and wipe out the booster base - annoying in itself because the rubber grippers that keep the booster on the chair are poked through the base so the washrag always catches inside and you just can't get out all the crumbs because they get stuck by these gripper things) or even worse - spills - roll right down the holes in the seat, right into the holes in the base, and then slowly seep all over your chair and down the floor. Not to mention the gaps by the arms - TONS of food falls down there to remain until you take the thing off the chair, disassemble it all, and clean it out.This is made very poorly. You shouldn't have to unfasten a booster from the chair, take the whole thing apart, and clean it at the sink after EVERY SINGLE meal.
