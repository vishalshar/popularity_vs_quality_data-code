This toy is cute and engaging and my daughter really likes it but the lid is very heavy which makes the entire thing tip over.  It also makes it difficult for her to open the lid and get the coins out without help.  It's even awkward for me.  I understand that all of the electronics are in the lid but they could have added some sort of weight in the bottom to balance it out.
