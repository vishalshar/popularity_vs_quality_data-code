I consider this to be a very low quality product. The company never states what the foam is made of. Even when I called them they couldn't answer the question and I have waited 2 days to get a call back. It is firm but not overly firm. I have a safety first pack n play and it did fit it. My main complaint is that it is covered in plastic vinyl that is very noisy. I don't want a noisy crunching sound every time the baby moves. I will go to a local foam company and have a pad made to fit my pack n play. I have decided that it is too risky to trust ordering one.
