I bought this to use during over night diaper changes (and, for our daughter to play with...)When it first arrived, I went into a room without windows and turned it on - a nice soft light filled the room. I thought it would be perfect! Unfortunately, that test happened while my eyes were adjusted to the light. When I turned it on in the middle of the night, it was FAR to bright (even our 5 month old son was squinting and blinking). We've gone back to using the screens on our cell phones.As a toy, it's fine. My 2 year old will play with it occasionally. Like other reviews mention, she will simply hit the button repeatedly, so I'm not sure how it would have worked as a night light. She loves to play with flashlights, so this is a nice alternative (especially if she lands on one of the settings with the timer).Would I recommend it to  a friend, probably not. Depends on what you wanted to use it for though. As a night light for the middle of the night - no. A night light for going to sleep with - maybe (but not in bed with the child as the packaging suggests). As a toy... meh. As an alternative to draining the batteries in every flashlight in your house - yes.
