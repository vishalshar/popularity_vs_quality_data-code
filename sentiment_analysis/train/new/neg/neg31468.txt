This is compatible with the car seat.  I checked before I bought the darn thing.  I have the Graco Aire3 Click Connect Travel System and needed a second base for a second vehicle. It is SO DIFFICULT to get the carseat out of THIS base.  The first time I tried, I spent close to an hour fighting with it.  It seems that with this particular base, if you don't have your hand pressing the release latch on the carseat PERFECTLY EVENLY, it will.not.come.out.  I do not have this problem with the base that came with the travel system.Over time, it has gotten a little less finicky, but I still have to jiggle and wrestle with it and can't take it out of the car with the baby in it.  This isn't a huge deal for me since I wear him everywhere, but I'm pretty sure that it should be easier to get out of the vehicle.
