The playard below is very nice because it is larger than the standard Graco Pack n play playard for singleton, however the hard board of a mattress that is used for the bottom and the top (difficult to "weave" into the 2 bassinets attached together) is a pain. Only 1 fitted sheet is sold by Graco that fits and it doesn't even have elastic corners and is super thin and only in beige (see through beige). I have been trying to find a waterproof mattress pad and other higher quality fitted bedsheets but couldn't. I've returned several fitted playard sheets and mattress covers and even mattresses and foam pieces. The dimensions of this board-like mattress are 40.5 inches x 28.5 inches (standard are 39 x 27) so even if you try to stretch a slightly smaller fitted sheet or cover, the board-like mattress bends and doesn't hold form. If I had known this, I would have bought 2 separate bassinets instead or a larger crib for newborn twins. I ended up having custom fitted sheets made by a tailor (using flat sheets that we had at home).update: After 3 weeks I bought 2 mini cribs (da vinci) and put them side by side length wise and 2 colgate mattresses (bought mini crib sheets and Gerber regular size sheets that shrunk after washing. The playard portion is now in the living room but we dont use the top double one large piece of 2 bassinets as it is too difficult to change sheets and not see thru (vs cribs can see thru the bars easily). I wish I had bough 2 Graco single bassinets or just the 2 mini cribs to begin with. Did I mention that the board-like 1 piece mattress that the 2 top bassinets share also caves twds the middle?
