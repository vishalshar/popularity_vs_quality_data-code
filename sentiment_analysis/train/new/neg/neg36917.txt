It looks like a great carseat. I drive a Cadillac Escalade and installing it took roughly 45 minutes. Im not a weak person by any means but the straps for the latch system would not tighten. I literally was sitting in it trying to push it down as far as possible but it wouldnt tighten to how it should be. It was exhausting but after many efforts it finally did it. I never want to move this car seat now tho. It looks comfortable for her but her bottom doesnt sit back in the chair all the way. It is set up weird where their backs dont hit the corner of it. The reclining is very hard to operate too.
