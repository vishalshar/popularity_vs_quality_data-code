These shades look tacky once on the window.  No matter how careful you are (we cleaned the window and rolled the shade onto the glass), it is almost impossible to achieve a smooth finish with no bubbles underneath.  They do block the sun, although they block visibility more than they stop the bright sun from bothering our two year old.  The worst part for me is how bad they look.I guess the perks of these shades are how cheap they are - and how easy they are to remove/reposition.  I won't recommend these, nor will I purchase again.
