8 month edit:After about 8 months of use I would not recommend this product. After about 1 month a nice creeking noise came from the bottom of the glider, one that could not be adjust/fixed. 3 months later 2 new noises started to occur, 1 from the fabric rubbing against the wood and 1 from the back poles. 4 months later the back pole now makes an extra noise on top of everything else, one when rocking back and another rocking forward. Now at about 8 months later mid rocking the are piece decides to detach and almost throw me backwards with the baby in my arms. This is just from normal use, no abuse to the glider and I'm only about 180lbs 5'10" (the husband, original review was from my wife). I will definitely be avoiding this brand from now on, it was nice using this chair for the first month until it slowly degraded.Original:The glider is very pretty in person with the dark brown wood and beige fabric, but it is too small. I am a very average size person, 5' 5 and I am not over weight. This chair feels like it was made for a short person, and I have had to add padding for lower back support. When I sit in the chair the back length is perfect, I can rest my head while i rock my baby, but the base of the chair only fits my butt and half of my upper leg with the rest of my leg having no support, and no I don't have a large butt. I love the pockets on the side of the chair, but with only half of my upper legs having support it gets uncomfortable fast.
