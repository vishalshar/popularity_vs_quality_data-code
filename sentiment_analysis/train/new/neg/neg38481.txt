This stacker only has three rings.  I assume that if we didn't already have the Fisher Price Star Stacker that lights up and plays music: Little Super Star Classical Stacker that we may have liked this stacker okay.  But it is not nearly as entertaining as the star stacker (above).  My son (5 months) much prefers the lights and music.  The rings on this stacker are supposed to crinkle and rattle...the crinkle is pretty weak and the other two rings have very similar rattles, not as much variety as I would have liked to see.
