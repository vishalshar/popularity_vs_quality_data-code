I suppose it's my fault for not measuring correctly, but I really didn't think these were going to be that huge. I wanted some cord cleats to tie up my blinds cords because my cats play with them, but these cleats are so large they would look extremely tacky on my windows. They'd be great if you don't care about having a huge eyesore to detract from your lovely windows, but if you're looking for something to disappear behind the cords, keep looking. That's what I'm going to have to do.
