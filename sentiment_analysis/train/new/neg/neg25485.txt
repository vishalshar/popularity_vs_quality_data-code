For the first year, this was one of my favorite diapers out of our large variety of brands and styles. I liked the ease of use (no stuffing, no need for snappis) and the fact that it wasn't quite as bulky as many of our other diapers. It held just as much or more liquids as our other diapers, and it wasn't prone to leaks.But then the elastic in one of the legs wore out, making it loose and stretchy on one side and more likely to leak. And then I noticed this was one of our smelliest diapers when wet -- despite regular treatments to all my diapers, this one is a real stinker. I now use it only occasionally, when I know we'll be at home and I'll be changing him soon. He only has to pee in it a little bit for the yucky smell to start coming through, so I don't like to use this one when we'll be in public.I'd like to try another Flip diaper for a future child to see if the one I got was just a dud. Hopefully all Flips don't wear out so quickly.
