The description clearly states 4 packs of 4 pins,  16 pins total.  they sent me only a single pack with 4 pins.  Ordered these for a family member throwing a baby shower. These pins were going to be used in one of the events.  4 is not going to cut it, Needed the 16.  And even if they could fix the order it is too late at this point unless they got it to me over night.This happened to someone else on here so seems to be a common issue.  I would suggest the seller change the description of the item or have all these prepackaged in sets of 4 stapled together or in a bag so someone packing boxes can not screw up again.Not worth the trouble of sending back.Gave 3 stars because not fare to one star a quality item because of the seller or shipper screwed up the details.The item itself is nice and good quality.Will not be buying from this seller again, mainly because a past buyer review stated the same problem and it since has not been corrected and now I and I am sure others are still getting inconvenienced.I do not need seller to tell me they are sorry and will send me the rest of the pins, I can't use them now, don't want them,  Just fix the issue for your future buyers.
