These baby cups are often so annoying with all their many parts.  About 5 parts in all per bottle and I understand its for cleaning but honestly they don't prevent spills totally.  But then again I haven't found ONE straw bottle for my baby that doesn't leak. These are a lot better than some others I have. So I would still recommend them but just know the numerous parts are annoying.
