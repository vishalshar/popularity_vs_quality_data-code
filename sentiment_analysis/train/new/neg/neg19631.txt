I bought two of these for my children for Christmas.  Within two months, the first one had a leak, and then the second one had a leak the next month.  Then the one replacement I bought in February had a leak 2 months later.  So all three that I purchased were leaking their chemically filling out by 3 months.  I've been buying various freezer compresses for years and using them with children.  None of the previous ones sprung a leak so quickly.  It's unfortunate, because these are absolutely adorable looking.  But, they are obviously poor quality.
