I like the bottles themselves as they're light and fit perfectly with the flanges. I also love the way the close for storage. I've been using these about a month so washing a few times a day and haven't had problems with the markings wearing off. However I agree there's no indication that it's imperial oz vs us so it's confusing...but once you know it's not a big deal.Also to note this listing is for the 8 oz jars despite the picture being of the 4 oz...I didn't realize that when I bought them.
