I have this seat and stroller.  The seat itself and stroller are great.  Narrow and light and they fit. But this seat sounds like it's clicking into the base when it is NOT.  It makes clicking sounds but when I pull up, the seat comes up.  I am constantly having to re-seat it in the base just right and pull up on it to make sure it's clicked in, which greatly decreases my confidence in my baby's safety.  What if I'm in a hurry and it sounds clicked in and isn't?  They need to overhaul the base/seat clicking in system ASAP.
