Hello!  I don't review much, but I thought I needed to on this carrier.  when I first started using it, I'd have rated it a 5.  At this point, I'm giving it a 3.  I'd rather give a 2.5, but... I had initially registered for a different carrier and after trying that out and returning it and trying another and returning it, I settled on this carrier based on a review that said it was good for petite people.  It also included the rain/sleep hood, had an expandable crotch, had memory foam pouches, looked good and didn't need an infant insert.  All those things all those things are still true and wonderful, but I'm having comfort and safety issues.My main complaint is that the waist strap always gets twisted in the buckles, especially when I have the support belt, which is 100% of the time.  It is constantly twisted.  It makes the already sort of comfortable waist strap, even less comfortable.  For the first time last week, the waist buckled undid itself.  That's pretty bad.  I'm not an alarmist.  I can fully recognize, that maybe it was user error, but I've been using it for 10 months now and this is the first time it happened.  It's happened another time since.  My daughter weighs 21lbs.The other issue is that I was having extreme should pain.  I think it's due to the waist strap not being as supportive as I'd like (even with the belt) now that baby is heavier.  I'm not really sure.Bottom line, I wish they had a thicker waist strap.  I'll update with a photo later.
