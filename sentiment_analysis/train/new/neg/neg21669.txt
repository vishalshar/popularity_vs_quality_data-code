I've had issues with the tires on my Phil and Ted's Sport ever since I got it. One tube was defective and kept leaking air. That had to be replaced. Another tire was mishapen which resulted in a bulge when it was inflated.  Now, tonight, I was putting air in a tire because it had deflated a little over time. Because the tire does not fit snuggly around the rim, it increases the possibility of the tube bulging out while it is being inflated. It happened as I was pumping air into the tire tonight and before I noticed what was happening, the tire tube blew up in my face with the sound of a gunshot. I small piece of rubber flew into my my nose. It must have been blown out with a tremendous amount of force because it not only left me with a cut on my nose, I feel like I was punched in the face. A few inches in another direction and it would have surely damaged one of my eyes. Phil and Ted's needs to redesign the tire so that the the outer tire fits snuggly around the rim. This is basic design neccessity in an air filled tire. If you have ever tried replacing a tube on a bicycle tire, you know what I mean. Because Phil and Ted's tire fits very loosely around the rim, it dramatically increases the possibility of a tube bulging out creating a dangerous situation.
