I have mixed feeling about this teether, on one hand my son loves it, however someone he can get it at just the right angle that it goes all the way to the back of his throat causing him to spit up all over with gag reflex. Don't allow you baby to be more than an arms reach away without constant supervision while they use this teether in my opinion because in my case, if I don't monitor his play with it, he will gag and spit up. The little teeth on it soothe him and he likes that part, I just have to only allow him to use it when I'm literally right there with him guiding it with my hand to keep him from gaggin on it.
