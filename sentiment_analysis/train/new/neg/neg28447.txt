I bought this to replace a 3 or 4 year old hand me down of the Learning Curve Massaging Action Teether.  I really like the John Deere theme, but not so sure about all the rest.  My son likes it, but the star seemed to have stronger massaging action and is definitely easier to operate.  The vibrating mechanism in the star is triggered in the points where are easing to get in little mouths and hard to miss.  The trigger for the corn is almost exactly in the middle so you have to get it pretty far in the mouth to be able to bite the right spot to set it off.  My son is 14 months old, so he was able to figure it out and reach it but he seemed to struggle a little with keeping it in his mouth in that position.
