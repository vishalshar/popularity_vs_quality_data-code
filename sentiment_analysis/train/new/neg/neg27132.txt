I purchased two of these for my kids. Within a month or so I started noticing discoloration on a bottom corner. I didn't think much of it as it just looked like a small water stain. In the next few weeks the stain gradually grew bigger and turned black. Eeeeek. Black mold on the lunch bag? I called the manufacturer and told the call center rep that I had mold on my lunch bags. I also told her that I cleaned it according to manufacturer instructions. The lady was very friendly and told me, that if anything spilled or if you had lots of condensed water on a cold drinking bottle, the liquid would/could enter through the inside seams and ends up trapped between the silver inner liner and the laminated canvas outer shell. The laminated outer shell prevents the spill from drying which results in mold in between the layers. She also mentioned that this was not dangerous for the kids (yeah right) but she offered to replace both of my children's lunch sacks for free. I was told to be more careful with the replacements and to always make sure to put a few layers of paper towel in the bottom to help absorb possible spills and prevent moisture from getting into the stitching again. I received my new lunch sacks and did EXACTLY as I was told. I wiped the bag with a damp wet cloth if something spilled and replaced my paper towel liner daily! It's been two month now and again I'm am starting to see the mold spread in between the layers on both kids lunch sacks. This is ridiculous. This is disgusting, this is not made for children, this is unsanitary and most of all this is a complete waste of money
