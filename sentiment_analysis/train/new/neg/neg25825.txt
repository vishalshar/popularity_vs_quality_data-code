Bought it for my 11 month old son who is walking. Other reviews are right - the sound it makes is quite pleasant. One problem I have, though, is the fact that the top and the bottom of the toy keeps getting unscrewed (it comes unscrewed so that you have to put it together, which is not that difficult).
