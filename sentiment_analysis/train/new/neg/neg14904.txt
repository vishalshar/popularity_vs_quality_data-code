My lactation consultant recommends this pacifier because, as she says, "It's round.  Your nipple is round, and I want your nipple to stay that way."I'm having a LOT of nipple issues in my breastfeeding, so when my daughter started wanting to suck for soothing, I decided to go with my lactation consultant's recommendation and use the soothie.I had some of the same falling-out issues that other parents are reporting, but I got around them with a few days of practicing the following:1) Tickle her nose to get her to open up wide for a latch2) Hold the pacifier in place until she really latches on well3) Once she's got a good grip, tug gently and steadily on the pacifier to get her to suck harder and fight your pull.  It's pacifier tug-of-war and it trains her to keep it in her mouth through suction alone.When she falls asleep, it still falls out, but by then she doesn't care.I agree with some of the negative reviews:This pacifier is ugly.  It makes her look like a fish!  (I think it's funny, but it definitely isn't my daughter at her prettiest.)It really does roll into far-off places when it falls on the floor.It takes a bit of investment. It's not the easiest pacifier out there.On the other hand, if it helps her to keep her tongue down and treat my poor, cracked, sore nipples gently, then I'm all for it.  I wouldn't risk a flatter pacifier with my breastfeeding problems.
