We used this carseat until my daughter was 12 months old. It was light to carry and well made. When I disassembled it to clean I was shocked that it was only made of plastic. I just assumed it has some steel bars somewhere. It did have the highest infant car seat rating when I bought it so I was trusting in that. However, I had problems with the straps being short. My car seat had a defect that I didn't discover until months after purchasing. My daughter is in the 1% so it took a long time for me to need to extend the straps. When I went up to the middle setting the straps became to short making it hard to get her in and out. Chicco WOULD NOT replace my straps and basically said it was a USER ERROR. I'm not an idiot. I even took it back to the store and they swapped out the straps from their store model with mine. THANK YOU BABIES R' US!
