These cups are nice!! The flaps are soft so they don't hurt the little one's hands. My 1 year old discovered though that he can pull one of the flaps in or out and all the snacks fall out:) This is not the manufacturer's fault at all. I am just mentioning it because babies are clever:) I am sure he will figure it out how to use it in the future. Overall a great cup, easy to use, easy to clean, very light. So far a great product and it's not expensive at all, which is awesome for parents who do not have a large budget. I will definitively buy these in the future. Great product!
