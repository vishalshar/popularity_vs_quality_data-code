Having braved Disney with a Bob Revolution Duallie, (way too wide for a crowded park), we picked up this Board Rider for a subsequent trip with our 4 and 2 year-olds.  Installation was a bit of a pain only because I had to pick up new hardware to get the board to sit level (the holes were drilled in the correct position, but the nut did not have enough clearance to install up against the board so I had to pick up a different nut.)  The adaptors fit fine, although they do fly off when the board is not installed on a stroller.  We managed to lose one when the board was in a checked bag on a flight (TSA?).  For those who are wondering, you can use it with just one adaptor, but it is definitely a bit more wobbly.  Our 4 year-old handled it like a champ and Engalcha did eventually send us a replacement adaptor.As far as use, our now 5 year-old loves it.  He sticks his head up through the handlebars and makes faces at his little sister below.  For mom and dad, it is somewhat awkward to push around.  It helps that we are tall and have long arms, but our feet definitely hit the board from time to time. Also, one of the things I love about the Bob Revolutions is that you can pop them over a curb pretty easily.  You cannot do that with someone riding on this board.  I would imagine that's an issue with any buddy board, though.
