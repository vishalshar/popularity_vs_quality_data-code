I was really disappointed with this order. The description of the item said it included a quilt, dust ruffle, fitted crib sheet and bumper.Acutally received quilt, dust ruffle, fitted crib sheet and diaper stacker. Called amazon and representative said she would have a new item shipped immediately. It arrived two days later as promised, but still with no bumper.Actual print on the quilt is very cute. I ordered this for a baby shower gift for twins, one purple and one pink. The pink set stated that it did not come with a bumper, but included a window valance, diaper stacker and a three piece wall hanging, along with quilt, sheet and dust ruffle.  I ordered a separate bumper for the pink set. Funny thing is that the purple set was actually more expensive than the pink one, and I thought that was because it included the bumper as described on the web site.Amazon was kind enough to send a return label so I can send one of the purple sets back. I have ordered from amazon for years and this is the first time I was totally disappointed with an order.  :(
