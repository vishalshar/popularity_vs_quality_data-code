I used to drape a blanket over my twins car seat during their nap times and thought this item would help them sleep better because it would be dark. It does make the inside very dark, but unfortunately it didn't help either of them sleep better. They still sleep (or not sleep) the same with either a blanket or the SnoozeShade. In theory it's a great idea but I don't use it as often as I had hoped. For $30 each and having to buy 2 for twins, it was an expensive experiment.The product fits well over my Chicco Keyfit 30 car seats when covered completely, but I couldn't leave it half open like shown in the picture. I tried draping it over the handle and over the canopy, but the elastic would make it fall back down and cover the the kids face. I only use it when I want to cover the car seat entirely, otherwise I have to take the whole thing off when they're awake. Not worth the price in my opinion.
