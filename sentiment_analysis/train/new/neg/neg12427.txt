My baby loves the Nuk style pacifiers and nipples, BUT these became "worn out" after just a couple of short weeks of routine use and sterilizing. I know the latex nipples are not good for long term use, and "break down" much faster than the clear silicones, although the latex are much cheaper. BUT these, didnt last half as long as they shouldve. my newborn could barely get milk out, as they became sticky and unusable. I wish I hadnt wasted so much money on so many packs of these! Even for cheaper latex- these were AWFUL! Go silicone all the way!
