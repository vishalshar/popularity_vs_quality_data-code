I was excited about this tub design because it was basic and compact.  It folds up nicely and is easy to rinse off.  The mesh sling is removable for machine washing too.Unfortunately, the bath sling doesn't suction to the bottom of your tub or sink so it slides all over the place and is very difficult to control while holding onto your baby with one hand and bathing her with the other. My daughter is now four months old and I need to discontinue using this tub b/c she is much more active and I can't keep the tub in place.If it had a belt to help secure the baby and suction cups on the bottom, this product would be ideal.  Unfortunately, this product was a big disappointment!
