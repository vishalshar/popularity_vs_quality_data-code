I really liked this stroller while it lasted.  We used it every day, on rough sidewalks, often loaded up both with shopping and/or library books in the bottom, plus two girls 14 months apart.  I got it when the younger was maybe just turning one, and the older just over two.  It was great in terms of size, and we loved the big shade and rain covers.  Easy to maneuver, and they always seemed comfortable in it.  Surprisingly easy to fit in doorways.  BUT, a couple of months ago -- just 18 months into owning it -- the main metal bar of the stroller just snapped in two, while my partner was tipping it to get it up the curb of the sidewalk.  It was completely useless, unfixable. Fortunately the kids were not hurt, but they easily could have been.  Really dangerous!  And this was normal city use... you can't avoid curbs!UPDATE: I contacted the manufacturer, and they responded, after a week, saying that the frame does sometimes break if you use it on stairs or curbs, and this is not covered in the warranty, because you aren't supposed to use it on curbs.  It's obviously a problem with this model that they have already heard about.  I checked through the warranty, and in fact it mentions stairs, but NOT curbs.  I don't see how you can avoid curbs in the city.  A stroller that is likely to break irreparably if you push it up or down a curb is not a very useful or sturdy product.  Very disappointed in babyjogger.  For this price, you really should make a sturdier product.BUT, I ALSO WANT TO SAY KUDOS TO AMAZON: I explained the issue to them and they actually REFUNDED me.  THAT WAS AMAZING SERVICE.  SO, one star for babyjogger, but five stars for Amazon.
