This is my second Floppy seat. The first one had a wrap around cover attached, but this one needs shoved in to a pouch. The pouch handles are on the shopping cart handle and adds bulkiness. The child safety strap is too high and sits around my 18mos olds arm pits not her waist.I like the coverage of the cart and the extra padding it offers, but I like the old style better, MUCH better!
