This product is one of many teethers I bought for my daughter. It's great that she can hold it in her hands so easily, but she doesn't really seem to be satisfied when she bites on this. Between this and some of the other teethers we have been trying, this is one of her least favorite teething toys. I am guessing she'll like it more when she's older and can control what parts she puts in her mouth, but at 3.5-4 months old she's not impressed. I do recommend trying it, though, because every baby is different and has different preferences.
