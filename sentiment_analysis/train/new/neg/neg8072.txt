I loved the idea of this toy but it could use some improvements. It is easy for littleones to grab but the rattle in the core is not loud at all. You have to shake really hard to hear it. And the leaves are just cloth- no crinkly material inside to make noise with them. Both of these improvements would greatly improve the long term "playability" of this toy.
