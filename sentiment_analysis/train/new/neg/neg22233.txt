I had this case for 6 months and I absolutely loved it, now in the past month or so, the case is no longer holding it's charge the way it used to, I'm constantly plugging it in and it not charging or a message on my phone pops up that " this device is not compatible". I really did love this product and told everyone about how awesome it was. Now I'm telling them not to waste their money.EDIT:I want to add that this company has great customer service. After I posted this review I was contacted by company. When they verified my purchases ( I had bought a case for myself and my gf) and they were still under warranty. They sent 2 new cases with jn a week! And provided prepaid packaging to send back old cases.
