I'm so disappointed. We bought this little "emmie" duck when my now 19month old was born. She, of course, has loved it to death and I was going to buy her a replacement/backup "emmie". The newly shipping "emmie" duck doesn't have any feet! Like, none. At all. She mostly looks like the picture, but even my toddler grabbed her, flipped her upside down and demanded to know where her feet were.They've evidently updated their animals, but neglected to update their photos.
