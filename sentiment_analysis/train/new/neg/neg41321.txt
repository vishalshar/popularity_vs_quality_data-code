Bought in December 2011.began using in January 2012.began losing suction by February 2012.Stopped working completely in April 2012.Need I say more?-UPDATE-WOW!  I wrote the above review the day the pump broke (April 14 - a Saturday) and first chance I got on the following Monday (today) I checked their website and called their clear, easy-to-find number for defective products.  They picked up immediately (no robotic answering machine) and Veronica on the other end was extremely sympathetic and helpful. After determining that our unit was, in fact, on the fritz, she offered us a replacement, no more questions asked. We have moved overseas since purchasing the original, and so she arranged to have a replacement sent overnight to a family member who will bring the new unit when he visits in a couple of weeks (this seems to me the simplest and safest way. really).  She then helped us find a local distributor we can rent a pump from temporarily and arranged to reimburse us for the cost.  Very impressed with this prompt, personal and decisive response.  Thanks Veronica!Really.  A little bit of empathy goes a LONG way.For this I am upgrading the initial review from a 1 to a 3, taking in account the 5 star response.The Purely Yours is an impressive unit when it works.  My guess is they must have changed the manufacturing in some way and probably have some major bugs to work out.  They seem prepared to handle the defective units, which tells me they are serious about getting this right over the long run.  Let's hope so.
