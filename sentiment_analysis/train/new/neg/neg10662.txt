Wanted a cheap pair to replace the lost tubing of an old pump. These aren't compatible out of the box. They have the same adapter at both ends. Mine had a different adapter (bigger hole) on one end and one that matches this product at the other end. I ended up cutting off one of the adapter ends and putting the tubing straight up against the pump nozzle to get this working. I found it to be a good secure fit this way. The only disadvantage is that taking the tubing on and off the pump may not be very doable every time since it does not have an adapter at the end for easier handling.Having said that I never felt the need to pull the tubing off the pump. The only reason that I felt I would need to take the tubing off was to sterilize it. But I did not feel the need to sterilize it every time either since the milk does not come in contact with the tubing and it is just the air flow. So it wasn't a big deal installing the tubes straight up on to the pump nozzles without the adapter and leave them there without having to take them off. Water vapors show up at the bottle end of the tubing at times but it dries up quickly if the pump is left ON with the bottles off the tubes.They are good quality and should last for the time we plan to use them. All in all not compatible but you can make it work with few easy tweaks since it was cheap price worth trying.
