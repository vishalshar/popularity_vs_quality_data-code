The mosquito net is fabulous and is easy to install. The rain cover is cumbersome to install and the temperature inside with the flap closed gets to the point where my LO's face is turning red and dripping sweat. Works better when its cold out, but not recommended during warmer months. (and opening the vent flaps on the seat bottom doesn't help). If I had to I would give the mosquito net 5 stars and the rain cover 2.
