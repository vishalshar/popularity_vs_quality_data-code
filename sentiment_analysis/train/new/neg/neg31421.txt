We absolutely love this light BUT the charging is a major issue! The charger makes a slight buzzing sound when plugged in (not a fault with our outlet as other things do not make this noise when plugged in) so I only charge while home and able to monitor it (just to be cautious, maybe overly cautious...maybe) But then there is the issue with the delicate placement of the light on the charger so that it actually receives a charge and the red light lights up...it takes quite a bit of effort to get it to sit just right - place the light (we have the Dino) rotate it, ooh it was lit, let's move it back, nope...back the other way, oooops the light came on, take it off, turn the light back off, place again and rotate.  Most of the time this happens at least once or twice.  Very annoying for something that shouldn't take more than a few seconds to place on charge...  With that being said, once it is charged it is adorable and all the features work and my son loves it! The charger definitely needs to be improved!  I would purchase one for my younger son but I don't feel like wrestling with one more bad charger!
