We bought this bassinet because it had all the bells and whistles and was the largest at Babys R Us.  I think it's absolutely beautiful, too and works wonderfully for either a boy or a girl.  It is more of an ivory than the picture shows.The Good:The light is perfect for checking on Baby without disturbing them.My son loves the music with the lights flashing in rhythmI love that the volume of the music and vibration intensity can be adjustedThe storage underneath is *very* handy.  I kept diapers, wipes, a burp cloth, receiving blanket and extra heavier blanket in there.The wheels move easily on carpet.  I've wheeled it all around our house.The Bad:The mobile is annoying!  It's in such an inconvenient spot, it's hard to get the baby out with out one of the little lambs smacking him in the face.After awhile, I also found that the mobile makes a bit of noise while turning.  Not terrible, but definitely a noticeable, "whirrring".  It's gotten worse as the time has passed.I wish the lights, music and vibration weren't on a timer.  They turn off far too early, and my son is nowhere near asleep by the time they go off.  If I am not vigilant about turning them back on, it can get ugly.The canopy clicks LOUDLY when putting it up/down.I put it next to the bed with the controls facing me, so I could turn on the vibrations if he started to stir.  With the canopy up, there is almost NO room to get the baby out from the side.  I keep the canopy down because of this, even though it's so pretty while up.The arm with the controls comes a bit loose, I'm assuming from the vibrations.  Not a big deal, a couple turns of the screwdriver and it was fixed.The Final Verdict:I would probably buy this again. There were quite a few annoying idiosyncrasies, but I've been able to live with them easily enough and I use each one of the features regularly.  However, because of the number of issues, I can't rate it too highly.
