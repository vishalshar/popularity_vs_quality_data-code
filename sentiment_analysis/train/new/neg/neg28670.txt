I've owned 5 different swings. This was my least favorite BY FAR. For one, it takes up an ENORMOUS amount of space. And the batteries did not seem to last very long. The "toys" on it were not at all engaging for my son. He also didn't seem to enjoy the swinging motion of it. We gave it away to some friends very soon after purchasing it. And they ended up donating it a month later. Ha!
