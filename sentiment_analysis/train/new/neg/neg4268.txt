Both back wheels fell off first time we used it.  Sending it back.  Bummed we really liked the idea of this wagon and love the seatbelts.  I try to give the benefit of doubt to both parties when reading a review, but the wheel falls off and you can see the poor glue job inside.  Not for this price!!!!
