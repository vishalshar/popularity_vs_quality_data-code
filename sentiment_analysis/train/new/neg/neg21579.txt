This is a cute idea, but it doesn't work.  In the picture the animals are in the ark, backed by the polka dotted Portion of the boat.  After setting up the decals, I immediately realized the animals are transparent somewhat, and the polka dots show through the animals. Strike one.  I use decals in a public, kid-friendly setting and have worked with 5 different brands of decals.  These are the only ones that peel off.  Strike 2.  Bummed.
