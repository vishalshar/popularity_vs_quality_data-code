I sprayed it on my wrist and the scent was almost gone instantly.  Then I sprayed all over and after 40 minutes or so, you couldn't even tell I had perfume on.  The fragrance is ok, if you can smell it at all.  It is just your classic fresh baby cologne with a hint of citrus.  I feel like I just bought some watered down perfume, or just tap water in a cute bottle.
