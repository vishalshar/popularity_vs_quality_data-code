My husband and I debated long and hard between the Safe Seat and the Graco Snugride.  We ended up picking the Safe Seat because of its versatility (it could handle babies 5-30 pounds rather than 5-22, and up to 32 inches long rather than 29), its safety (one comparison website said that the Safe Seat had Side Impact Protection and the Snugride didn't), and its reviews.However, if we had known what a headache it would be to get an extra base for the seat (to put in our other car, as has been recommended by friends and other reviewers), we would have gone with the Snugride.Amazon does not carry Safe Seat bases.We ordered a base through Toys R Us only to have them tell us (three weeks after we ordered) that our order was canceled because they were unable to complete it.Then we ordered a base through Comfortfirst, and found out shortly after our order that "the product is currently on backorder."Most recently, we ordered one through CountryLiving Store but the order hasn't shipped yet.Each time we've ordered a base, the company has said they had them in stock; and each time the base plus shipping has been expensive (over $50).It makes us wonder if Graco has discontinued making the Safe Seat and/or the bases for it, or if demand has outpaced supply.
