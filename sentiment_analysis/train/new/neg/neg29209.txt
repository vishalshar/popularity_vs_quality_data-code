We purchased this seat for our 3.5 year old daughter in December and she absolutely loves her "Big Girl" seat. She also has the Evenflo big Kid seat in another vehicle and she says she likes that one better. Overall, I like this seat. It's easy to use, and the fold up option is nice. I wish it would also convert to a backless booster as many others have the option for. I think the biggest disappointment was that I ordered it in December 2010 and it had been manufactured in 2008. So, I thought I was getting a seat that would last until 2017 when I ordered, but this one expires in 2015 so we'll end up needing another one. I don't know if there's any way to find out the manufacture date when you order. I would advise not letting your little one be around when you take it out of the box as mine was. She instantly ripped all of the tags off so once I realized the old manufacture date, I could no longer return the seat :(
