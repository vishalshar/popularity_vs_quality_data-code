The item in question holds water, that was the intention behind the product and it does so well. I have a hard time getting it filled due to the width of the front and back; I can't get the tub part under my faucet easily for filling. However this is negligible and in no way is reflected in my ratings.My 6.5 month old daughter LOVES her bath. While I would never ever ever walk away from her in here, and while she still can't sit up all that well on her own, I feel as if she is safe. She's fallen over a time or two and hit her head on the edge, which is an air pillow. I am always grateful that I got this inflatable tub when she's done this and didn't just use the bathtub.I have no need for the shampoo holder part. But it does get filled with water so I squirt my baby shampoo in there and wash her using that. Sort of like the separate bowl I used when she was in the little baby bath.I love love love the suction cup to stick it on the shower wall. It works very well at keeping it out of the way.I have never had any issue with cleaning it as another reviewer had. Nor have I had mold/mildew grow on the velcro. After my LO's bath I tip it over. After bed time is over I wipe it down and stick it on the shower wall. It remains clean and air dries for the rest. Only she uses this tub, but if we took showers in it I would remove it so that it could dry elsewhere. Any complaint about it being difficult to clean or it growing mold/mildew is from someone who isn't drying it out adequately.My 3 star rating comes with the temperature gauge. I don't use one honestly, I just touch the water to see if it is too hot/cold, however some people do. The gauge on my tub not only wasn't glued on completely (half of it was just flapping around) it also didn't work! It never read the temperature of the water. I tore it off and tossed it. The bath works just fine, but if you want this feature I'd be wary of the product.
