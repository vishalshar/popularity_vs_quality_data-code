I gave this to my toddler to help her transition into a big girl cup. She chews on most everything, and the products I purchase need to be able to hold up to the fact that she's hard on things. She was able to chew on the spout opening to the point where there was a big hole where the spout was within a day. In order to wash this cup, you need to remove the top silicon cover, which I found to be very thin, but it did wash okay. However, you need a back up cup while the other one dries. If you use this cup when it's not completely dry, the silicon cover leaks. Plus, my toddler can easily remove the spout on her own. I won't be buying this product again.I checked with my daughter's daycare, and they've experienced the same issues.
