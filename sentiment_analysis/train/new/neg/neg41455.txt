I purchased this chair cushion set and though the color was cute and the fabric comfy, I would not purchase this product again. There is really no thickness if you need to sit for longer than 20 minutes. I would only purchase again if the price was significantly reduced and was used for mostly decoration. In fact, I had to order a different cushion in order to comfortably rock.
