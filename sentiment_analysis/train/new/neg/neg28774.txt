I really want to like this thing as it was one of the first items I purchased for my daughter before she was even born. It is cute, arrived quickly, and has plenty of different sensory stimuli for babies to enjoy. BUT......my baby is scared of it! I have no idea why because we have similar items: toys with mirrors, toys that make the scratchy sound when grabbed, and toys similar in color. She is scared none the less and hates this toy, while it was slightly amusing at first this toy is useless if we can't really use it.
