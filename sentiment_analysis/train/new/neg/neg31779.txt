While it was nice to have a baby bath to hold my little angel, and it does drain well and help you control temperature, the thermometer was broken off the bath when it arrived. Although they had good customer service and quickly sent a replacement, the replacement broke as well within a few months. Worked well while it lasted, the incline was nice, but I had to put a towel down under her because the foam padding is not comfortable at all. Will buy a simple bath for my next baby
