Very disappointed. We had a last minute road trip that we had to plan for so I ordered this to help make pumping on the road easier. It was delivered the day before we were set to leave and frustratingly enough, the product arrived damaged and unusable. One of the prongs was damaged and would not fit into the plug in. The box that it came in was damaged and torn up as well. I had even opted to purchase this more expensive Medela brand adaptor versus the cheaper by half generic brand for fear that I would not be getting a quality adaptor that would work with my pump. Needless to say, the item was returned.
