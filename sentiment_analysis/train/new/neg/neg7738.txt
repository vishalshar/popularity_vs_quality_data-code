Although this is a nice product, it is in NO WAY crib size. Bassinet size maybe. We will keep it as a back up for the portable sleeper, but I was hoping this would actually be crib size, because that is what we needed. Guess I'll have to go braless while donning my pajama set and miss matched slippers and stop off at (picture me sneering) Walmart.  :(
