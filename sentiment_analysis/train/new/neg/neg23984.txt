I recently purchased the Summit X3 stroller, and intend to use it with my Graco Snugride 30 Classic Connect Car Seat.This document: http://www.babyjogger.com/uploads/CSA-Guide.pdf on the babyjogger site, last updated 2/19/15, lists the BJ90123 as the appropriate car seat adapter for this stroller and car seat.  However, you'll see that BJ90123 is no longer available on the babyjogger site, and it is listed as discontinued on Amazon.If you look under babyjogger's FAQs, you'll find this question: "Is my car seat compatible with your car seat adapters?"  Scroll down to the X3, and the Graco Snugride Classic Connect car seats list the BJ90123 adapter, but if you click through on the linked text, it brings you to the item page for the BJ90127 adapter.So I emailed customer service for more information on which adapter I need to order and here is their response from 5/1/15:"Thank you for contacting Baby Jogger! Item#BJ90123 has been discontinued and item#BJ90127 is correct however, once you buy that item you will need to contact us at Baby Jogger to have a D bar ordered for your BJ90127 car seat adapter. This can be ordered for you complimentary and is necessary to fit the Graco car seat."I hope this helps others!
