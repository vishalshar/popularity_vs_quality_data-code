I purchased this for my daughter and it has never stuck well to any surface. My daughter at 6 months can pull it up easily and when it came "unsuctioned" it smacked her in the face. I've tried it on our table, her highchair, bumbo, and it just doesn't seem to stay put. After her hitting herself in the face with it twice I decided to give up on it. With all the other toys like this out there I wouldn't recommend spending the money on this particular one. I bought the Sassy Wonder Wheel and she (and I) love it!
