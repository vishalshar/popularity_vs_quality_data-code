We were very excited to try the puj flyte but found that it didn't fit either of our sinks. The kitchen sink was too big, and the bathroom sink would probably have been okay except the faucet protruded low enough that there would hardly be any room for a baby in the tub. Maybe if you had a faucet that was taller it would work. I'm a bit disappointed that we will have to use the in-the-tub tubs. I would consider keeping it for travel, but you can't guarantee that it'll fit hotel sinks either.
