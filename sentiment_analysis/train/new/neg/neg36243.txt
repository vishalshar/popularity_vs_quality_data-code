Bought these for our graco pack n play because we wanted something softer and not as cold as plastic for our baby to lay on during diaper changes. It lasted 36 hours before becoming soiled and requiring to be washed. It's difficult to justify these when they'll need to be washed so frequently. They fit our design perfectly (in the changing table section). One side is soft and looks like quilted northern toilet paper (which is also why it absorbed so well). We will probably throw one in our bag in case we need somewhere to change our baby when we are on the go.
