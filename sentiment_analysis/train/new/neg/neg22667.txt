Although we like the look of this chair and the shelf under the seat, there are a couple of problems with it which affect its daily use.  The first is that the smaller inner tray is easily removeable by our son.--He's been able to do it since he was only ten months old or so.  It makes a big mess when he picks up the tray with all his food.  We don't even use the inner tray anymore.  Also, the trays have stained with just normal use.  Lastly, the chair is somewhat difficult to clean because there is a large plastic piece that does not move.  We also can not remove the straps to put them in the washing machine.  However that plastic piece successfully keeps him from climbing or wiggling out even when he is not strapped in.  There's something about the angle when the tray is on which makes it next to impossible for him to bend his legs to get them out (so far!) which is great.  I hope they'll re-engineer the tray, so it's more useable.  I do like that it's removeable by adults--just not the baby/toddler!  (I think I'll contact the company to ask if they have a solution.)
