Brought my swing out getting ready for my new grandson. I used it for my granddaughter and it worked fine. Now it won't swing. I read and found info on YouTube about replacing the motor. Seems like a lot of trouble and more $$. Lots of people complaining about the motor going out when they felt it should still have some life in it for what the swing cost new. No help from Fisher Price and now the swing is discontinued and parts aren't even available. Boo Fisher Price!
