I couldn't find any comparative reviews on different brands of nipple shields when I was trying to decide which one to purchase. I ended up buying the Medela Nipple Shield (20mm), the Philips Avent Nipple Protector and the Tommee Tippee Nipple Shield. Here are my reviews and pictures of the 3 different brand:Medela Contact Nipple Shield (20mm)This is the brand recommended by my lactation consultant. It's made of the thinnest silicone of the 3 brands and "sticks" the best. The height of the nipple part is a little too high for me and baby often makes a choking sound when trying to latch in the beginning. I LOVE how the Medela brand makes these in two sizes: 20mm and 24mm. It comes with just one shield, which makes it the most expensive of the 3.Philips Avent Standard Nipple ProtectorI purchased this based on looking at the product pictures, hoping that it would not be as high. Unfortunately, it is just as high as the Medela Nipple Shield, but also wider and thicker, making it difficult to stay in place and get baby to latch. Comes with 2 shields.Tommee Tippee Nipple ShieldThis nipple height was the least of the three brands. In theory, the extra cut outs along the side of the nipple part is supposed to promote more skin to skin contact, but as another reviewer stated, all it did was making my nipples sore because it would get sucked through the holes. Comes with 2 shieldsTake a look at the pictures to see the differences side by side. I hope this is helpful to those in search of nipple shields.
