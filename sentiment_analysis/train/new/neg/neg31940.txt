When I received this swing brand new, the motor didn't work.  I called FIsher Price customer service and the lady I spoke with was wonderful.  She apologized profusely and immediately got an entire new motor in the mail.  When I tried to assemble the swing with the new motor, I found that the motor I had been sent was missing all of the wiring needed to attach it to the swing, the holes that should have been drilled through the metal tubing to attach the motor to the rest of the swing were missing, and it was a very different color from the original.  When I again called Fisher Price to explain the problem, I was treated to a lecture by a different customer service rep about the importance of giving the correct model number every time I call.  I explained to her that I had given her the model number off the swing base that I was asked for and that I really didn't think the mix up was my fault.  After placing me on hold for several minutes, she informed me that they were no longer offering the motor I would need as a replacement part and that I would need to choose a replacement swing.  Out of the half dozen models of the swing that were comparable to the original, none were available as product replacements.  The only one that is available is very different and not one that I would have ever chosen on my own.  When I asked the rep when exactly I could expect to receive the ugly replacement (I am due with baby #3 any day), she told me that if I want to receive it quickly, I need to order it new and pay for it again ($115).  She said it would take approximately 2 weeks to process my return, followed by 5-7 business days to issue a refund for the broken swing.  I will never again purchase a piece of baby equipment from Fisher Price.
