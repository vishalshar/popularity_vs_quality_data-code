I bought this for my son's nursery. It is very soft and will work great for embroidering his name on it, but the coloring is much lighter than the picture. It did not wash up perfectly but nothing major. Just a little lose of color. The matching sheet however was terrible. It lost most of its color in the wash and crinkled up badly. Everywhere there was a wrinkle a washes out white line was present. Blanket was nice but matching sheet, not wonderful.
