It would have been great if the one I got was ok. It had one defective side so I had to return it.If not i would have rated it 5 stars for what it is.We wanted something portable we could move from room to room and it is just that. Aesthetically pleasing to the eye and lovely soft textured fabric. Very easy to assemble and disassemble. I suggest you disregard the instructions that come in the package because they are just pictures that are not clear. If you need visual directions there is a very nice video on YouTube that makes it easy otherwise you snap the sidebars into place first then push down the bottom by unzipping the side fabric to get at the joint. Once the bottom snaps into place you cannot adjust the side bars so do them first. For disassembly just reverse the directions.It's a shame we didn't get one that wasn't defective otherwise I would have been very happy with it.
