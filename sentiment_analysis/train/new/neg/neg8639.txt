I looked at these at a local store but found them cheaper here. I thought it would be a much more convenient way to bathe my baby since it had a built in sprayer and temperature gauge. However, the temperature gauge is just a cheap sticker on the top (useful, but cheap), and the water pump is heavy and mildly obnoxious to deal with when you have to fill it up. The bathtub part is good, and the drain plug in the bottom is convenient--I wish they would have done that with the pump, too! Overall, I think the cheaper baby tubs that are just tubs are a lot better choice in the long run--I've used this a handful of times and my baby is going on 6 months old.
