I ordered the bench seat in the picture, a tan one, only to receive a black fleece seat cover. In calling customer service at One Step Ahead I was told that "colors may vary" and then told I would have to pay to ship the item back. The customer service reluctantly emailed me a slip to mail the incorrect item back, but I will not be reordering or ordering any future items with this company seeing as it will be a guessing game as to what I will receive and also that the picture is a false representation of what is actually shipped. Dissatisfied. No where on the amazon site for this product does it say "colors may vary."
