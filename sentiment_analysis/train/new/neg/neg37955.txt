I hope someone creates a usable version of this product.  Great idea, good looking product, poor implementation.It looks good.  It is too small for me, and I'm only 5'8 150lbs.  My daughter is 2 and weights 30lbs.It pulls my head forward, I am more comfortable without the device.  The straps are far more complicated than need be, takes about 5 minutes to put it on.  tangles to a mess when sitting on a shelf.Design suggestions:have the strap attach lower than just under my arm pits, or have adjustable height.Have the seat further back.Have the foot straps be adjustable for height.Think about how to make putting this thing on easier. (maybe slide over my head and tighten it down?Use some more tame colors to make us look less silly.Use an average sized man in your product photos.To make matters worse, they said that my Christmas gift was too late to return (Less than 90 days, only worn once), so this thing collects dust on a shelf to remind me of the $90 wasted on it.
