These are very absorbent, but they are difficult to keep in place. I have to constantly keep a hand on this to keep it blocking. I was hoping with the cutout it would help it stay in place, but that doesn't appear to be the case. Also, after washing you have to take some time to get the foam back in place, otherwise they are an awkward shape. I really wanted to love these as they were highly recommended by a friend. I guess you have to choose, a non absorbent wipe that stays in place or the weeblock that is super absorbant, but must be held in place.
