Pros: Super cute when worn, and super soft to the touch. Cons: Very roomy, but that's not so bad. It's just the fact that the inside is also the same plush fabric as the outside. I wasn't expecting that. The waterproof-ness is on the inside of those fabrics, I suppose. Our kid uses the traditional pre-fold cloth diapers and we don't have a washing machine... we use a diaper service. So, I like the diaper covers to be truly waterproof on the inside so I can simply wipe them clean and reuse. This one can only be used once, which is fine if I'm only taking a picture of his cuteness and then switching covers. Otherwise, it just creates laundry that I don't want to deal with. The fabric is absorbent if that's what you're looking for, but I would rather it be resistant.
