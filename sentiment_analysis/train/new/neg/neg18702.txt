I bought two of these for our two little ones before we headed to St. Mountain, GA for a middle of the winter trip.  The zippers broke immediately after testing them out before we even left for our trip.  I brought the covers with us anyway because I had  no time to find a replacement.  So I can say that these covers did work as far as keeping the kids warm.  But when the zipper doesn't work well (pulls apart after zipping closed) and the zipper pull is gone (about 4 of them broke off right in my hand) it makes using this cover very difficult.  And anyone with children (so anyone looking at this product) knows how many times you will have to zip and unzip.  So it is really a shame.  I don't understand why a company would make a great product and then put the cheapest zipper system ever on them.  I bought mine in Dec. 2009 so maybe newer models will have better zippers.  It would be worth a phone call to the company before purchasing.
