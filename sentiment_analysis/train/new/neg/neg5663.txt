We actually got this contraption as a gift.  We used it for our first child for about 6mo.  I was blown away at how much they were charging for this (basically particle board and staples).  It worked fine, we ended up getting a new chair that was easier to get the child in and out of and took up a little less space.As for safety, it was fine.  One issue I had with it, was there were no locks on the wheels so you cannot place them on uneven ground and if you have dogs or another small child this can be rolled by just bumping into it.  Its obvious that you need to be with your child when they are in high chair regardless, but I didn't feel any safer having my daughter in this chair vs our new chair(which cost a lot less).If you have money to spend on this type of thing, it's fine.  Otherwise I would say just get a decent high chair at a fifth of the cost and put the rest into their college fund.
