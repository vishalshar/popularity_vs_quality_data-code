When I first started nursing, I was a heavy leaker, and I was going through pads at an expensive rate. I tried washable cloth pads, and they would just start to smell sour after only an hour or two. My OB suggested Lily Padz, and they got such great reviews, I gave them a try.I loved that they were self adhering, so they wouldn't slide around in my bra, and they did double duty as a "nipple hider" under my shirt. Those are the only positives.Perhaps it's because I had pierced nipples and I would leak out the sides as well, but I could never get a perfect seal around the nipple no matter how carefully I flattened it, so there would always be a little pocket of space in the pad, and that space would very quickly fill up with milk. The milk didn't leak out into my clothes, thankfully, but when I removed them to nurse, it splashed all over the place!I had to wear them 24/7, which is probably not the intended use, but even so, they lost their stickiness completely in about ten days even though I washed them with the special Lily wash after every nursing time. I would not recommend them as anything but a really fantastic nipple cover for ladies who don't want to be poking out of their shirts on cold days.
