I purchased this blanket because of the great reviews and reasonable price. But, the owl blanket I purchased is a gift for a friend and no matter how great the blanket may be, I am not impressed with the pattern. Some of the owls who are hiding their eyes just aren't right - wings are out of place, some wings are missing ... Something isn't right with the print. I'm disappointed with what I thought would be a really cute blanket. It's just ok.
