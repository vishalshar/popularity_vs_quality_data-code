Not my favorite.  We purchased this to assist with some "tilt" our daughter had from being breech...but it didn't really help all that much while she was in her carseat.  It seemed comfy enough but it didn't really keep her head straight enough to leave it in there.  Sometimes it was more hassle than benefit.
