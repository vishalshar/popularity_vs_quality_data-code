I wanted to love these bottles. and I did for a long time. Had them since my baby was born. Unfortunately be aware, these bottles, because of the thick white plastic inner rim that holds the blue vent - they are MAJORLY prone to mold. MOLD! This is not only inconvenient, to be replacing ALL bottles 6 months out, but simply scary and gross. Save yourself the heartache, look for a bottle that does not have the vent system. It really just provides added nooks and crannies for mold. ps- i wash my bottles everyday.
