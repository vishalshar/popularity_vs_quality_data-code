Couldn't beat the price and took a gamble.Didn't need them for every day use just for when we flew on a plane to make changing easier.Firstly the ruffles have to go on the top of the leg as the other end is too tight on my 6 months legs.She is not a big baby either. Doing this means that the logo is upside down.If you care then buy something else but as I said good for the price.
