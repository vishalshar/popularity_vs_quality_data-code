I bought this for my friend who is a new mom. I was expecting it to have soft foam cushion on diaper pad just like mine - Ju-Ju-Be PackaBe Diaper Bag, Marvelous Mums. However, it was just a pad with no cushioning. felt bad about it. It was just a plastic sheet with no cushion. They should have cut down other embellishments and made it comfy for baby instead of making other things pretty. That's my only big concern. I wouldn't recommend it without foam cushion on baby's changing pad for this price. I already gave the present so there is no way to change it.
