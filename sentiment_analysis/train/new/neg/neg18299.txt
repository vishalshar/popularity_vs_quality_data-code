It was not as good as I expected. Every time he has pooped in it, it leaked. I have some of a cheaper brand that I like much better. I have this one in my stack at the changing table but I only use it if I'm out of the ones I like and I'm pretty sure he won't need to poop. I wanted this kind to start with because of the simple look, but the only one they had was the intro set. I'm glad I didn't get the big set now.
