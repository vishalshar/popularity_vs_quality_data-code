I bought this as a gift for a baby. I love that it is stackable. Children love stacking. However, when I opened the product, and built it as advertised, its very unstable.There isn't any interlocking cuts in the wood... When you place each animal in top of each other, with a slight blow from your mouth will knock the pieces down.I still think they are super cute, however, I do think that children are going to be terrible frustrated when they try to stack them to gather.
