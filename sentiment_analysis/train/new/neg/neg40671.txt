This fitted sheet for the Travel Lite crib is very thin material.  There is also no elastic at the bottom (as with most fitted sheets), so it is also quite hard to put on.  Doesn't provide much comfort or support...  I ended up returning mine and purchasing a Summer Infant Change Pad cover to fit over the mattress instead - fits perfectly! :)
