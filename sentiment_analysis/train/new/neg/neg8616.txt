My daughter is a porker (10 months, 22.8 lbs.) and judging by the picture, I was expecting this to fit a little more snugly around her neck, but it does not. The reason I am giving this 3 stars is because even though it does help head from drooping to the side while sleeping in the car, it does not help it from falling forward. I expected it to keep her head from falling side to side AND forward because pictures indicate the extra padding at the ends of the pillow are firm enough to not only touch ends once around the child's neck, but thick enough to keep the head from drooping forward too much. While the pillow is not so loose that it is unusable, the pillow ends definitely do not touch or come together in such a way to prevent my daughter's head from falling forward.So overall, not a bad product, it just doesn't do what I anticipated it would.
