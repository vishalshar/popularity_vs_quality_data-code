The necklace came off twice while the baby was wearing it. I screwed it on and tightened it. There was no way it should have come off of her that easily.  That makes it really dangerous for choking. It was scary that it happened twice and I was not letting it happen again. Returned it immediately.  That could have been an AWFUL outcome...just AWFUL.
