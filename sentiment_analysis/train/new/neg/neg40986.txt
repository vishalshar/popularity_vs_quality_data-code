We love having a base in each of our cars, but in one we don't have the latch system and had a hell of a time trying to get this in securely. At 8 months pregnant I had to climb in and push down on it with my knees while my husband tried to get the seatbelt tightened and make sure it wouldn't loosen up. Now that it's in we love it.
