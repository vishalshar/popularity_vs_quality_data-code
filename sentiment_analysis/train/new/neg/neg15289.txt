The nipples have been redesigned from the slit to a hole. The slit wasn't perfect, you had to be extra careful when washing it or it would tear, BUT it did a pretty good job of keeping air out (unless your kiddo is just nawing on the nipple, which is reasonable) and did not leak if your baby put the bottle next to them upside down after playing with it. It was not a perfect system, but it was great. The new nipples are a little hole, which leaks, and does not keep air out if you place it standing up on a table for a moment. I am seriously disappointed.
