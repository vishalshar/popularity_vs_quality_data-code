I picked up this plate because my 20 month old has decided that tossing her plate is the best way to signal she's done with her meal (even if there's food left on the plate).  I followed all the instructions - hand washed and dried before use.  I stuck it to our wooden kitchen table  and checked it to make sure it was sturdy.  Mind you, I'm a 34 year old with excellent fine motor skills -- the plate felt like it was securely fastened.  I sat my daughter down, turned around to bring dinner to the table and heard a loud crash.Not only had my TWENTY MONTH OLD (who struggles with gross and fine motor skills) been able to remove the plate (thankfully empty) but in the process of tossing it to the floor - the plate cracked into two different pieces.  Both cracked pieces had edges that were dangerously sharp.  I was highly disappointed.  I never even got a change to put food on the plate.  You would think that the manufacture would know that if you're buying a plate with a suction cup bottom that its because you've seen dinner plates go flying -- and said plate should be able to withstand a crash or two.  Additionally - perhaps it shouldn't be made out of brittle materials that could cut whoever ends up having to clean up the broken mess!!
