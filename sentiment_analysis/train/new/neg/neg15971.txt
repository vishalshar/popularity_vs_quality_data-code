We thought that this bottles would be great to use for formula for our son.  Well, I can't stand these bottles because every time I think that they are closed the way they should be, they leak.  I have ended up having formula all over my son and myself.  They are really terrible baby bottles, and I will probably end up returning them ASAP.  The only nice part is that they have very few parts which makes it easier and faster to wash.  They don't have the travel part like other bottles do to prevent the spilling of liquid while traveling.  They have a travel cap, but the bottles have to be in the upright position or they will leak all over your diaper bag or everywhere else.  If there was an option of "-5 stars", I would give them "-4 stars".  These are the worst bottles I have ever bought or used so far!!!
