This toy would get five stars if quality control caught all the defective ones.  I had this toy for years and it was a big hit with my babies... then we lost a piece in a move.  I got on amazon and got two for twelve dollars each (one for a gift): the square didn't work in both.  Did the returns process.  One replacement was fine.  The other: the triangle didn't work.  Luckily, two had the same color theme, so I was able to switch out the good pieces for the defective pieces, and I ended up with two working sets out of four, even though THREE out of FOUR were defective.If you're willing to play with those odds, go for it.  For me, it was worth the returns process as this toy is quite fun.  OKAY it's not going to entertain your baby for hours - no toy does.  But it is an educational toy, and baby has to do more than wave her hand to get an onslaught of lights and sounds and motion for entertainment.  These kinds of toys are getting few and far between.This toy can be used quite early.  My current young'un is 8 months old.  She cannot sort these by herself, but she likes to pick up the shapes and blow in them to make the kazoo-like sounds.  She likes to play with the shaped beads on the base unit.  And her siblings guide her hands to sort the shapes correctly.  I like this toy because she actually has to DO something with this toy.Incidentally, this toy was my hearing impaired daughter's favorite toy as a baby.  She would take the shapes with her everywhere when she was crawling and toddling, so she could blow in them and get that buzzing kazoo-like sound.  She didn't care for electronic sounds as much as this funny buzzing sound.  Interesting.
