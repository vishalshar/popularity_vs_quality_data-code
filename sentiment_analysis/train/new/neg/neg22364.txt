It has been challenging to find a sleep sack that fits my toddler.  He's not quite 2 yet and is off the charts for height.  He still cannot keep a blanket on him, so we rely on sleep sacks to keep him warm at night.  I have purchased other Halo sleep sacks in the past and have been very pleased.  This sleep sack is a jersey knit cotton, with a slight stretch.  It's lighter weight, which is perfect for our climate.  Watching him walk in this blanket is also very, very cute.  The reason for me giving a 3 star rating is that the material began pilling after three washes.  I have not had this issue with my other cotton Halo sleepsacks, and greatly disappointed me.
