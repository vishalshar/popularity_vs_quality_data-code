I really like this, and it definitely does the job, but without a wipes warmer, like it's shown being used with in the photo, there is a slight flaw.  When the wipes container runs low and becomes light, we found that the door between the diapers and wipes rises and doesn't stay down properly.  It uses weight to keep it all together rather than some sort of snap in connection for all pieces.  We also wanted to use it through toddler years, and that unfortunately wasn't an option because of the fact it's connection is a simple drop in rather than click in.  Every time my 18 month old would push it around on the counter it would completely come apart into pieces.  If this product had a more permanent or childproof installation, and the wipes door had a way to secure down rather than be dependent on weight, it would be a 5 star product.  I realize that the second issue could be eliminated by the wipes warmer, possibly even the first issue.  By having something heavy on top, it may make it harder for a toddler to push it around on the counter and cause it to become disassembled, but in my opinion, even with a wipes warmer, this is very easily destructible.  As a matter of fact it kept falling apart while I tried to put it together because it uses weight to keep everything together.  I had to lay it down on the actual counter I wanted to keep it for it to stay together.  Originally I connected it on my kitchen table and went to move it to my babies nursery, and half the pieces just fell to the floor.  So all in all a good product for the newborn years as long as you keep the wipes at least half full or use a wipes warmer, or don't mind using some tape on a brand new product.
