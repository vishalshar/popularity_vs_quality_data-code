I do like this toy, but mine may have been defective. The bell came off in my baby's mouth! CHOCKING HAZARD! Also, I wish you could choose which one you wanted... The duck was the one I was hoping NOT to get, but sure enough-- that's the one that arrived! I was really hoping for a green or purple turtle. Does't matter though, since I had to trash it to keep my baby safe.
