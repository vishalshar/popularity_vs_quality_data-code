I bought this Trend Lab Flannel sheet along with two other Trend Lab Flannel sheets. This sheet after 1st wash- never used, ripped or rather shredded in the washing machine. I sent it back right away and requested a replacement, as the other two Trend Lab flannel sheets had no issue whatsoever. I received the replacement and inspected it thoroughly before putting it in the wash and found that it too had small little tears in it- so back it goes. This sheet is completely different from the other two, it is thinner and less soft- It also has elastic straps at each corner. Price was cheaper but so was quality. The other two are awesome- one is plain the other is a chevron print, highly recommend those over this one.
