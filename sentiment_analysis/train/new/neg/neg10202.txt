This is tiny. I also wasn't paying attention and didn't realize it was coming all the way from China, so it took forever and there was basically no tracking information until it was out for delivery. I also thought it had a strap underneath to keep the lion's "legs" together if my child was sleeping, but there is no strap. Overall, the biggest disappointment is the size; it says it's for 1-4 year olds, but it's tiny.
