I've had the Britax Roundabout, Companion, and Boulevard. The Companion chest fastener was kind of chintzy, but otherwise all three lived up to the Britax reputation - safe, comfy, well made, easy to use and easy to install.Not the Frontier. It is not well made - in two months, the mesh area in the middle of the seat cover is already starting to look a bit ratty, because it snags on my daughter's shoes. I hope Britax will redesign the cover to be like those on its other models. (And send past customers one for free!)It is also not easy to use. The straps twist up constantly, and I am getting tired of having to take the time to straighten them out while two impatient children fret in the chilly Chicago winter.That last flaw compromises the seat's safety - what if I don't notice the straps are twisted when I buckle my daughter in one morning?What a disappointment. I guess the rule that you shouldn't buy a new model of car in its first year also applies to car seats.
