I agree that this did add height to my dining chair so that now my toddler can sit to eat with us at the table. I was disappointed to find how small this is. It does not even fit my standard dining chair. The cover is just a thin fabric. A product for a toddler who make so much mess? Is there no way to make it water proof? There is no ease of cleaning this cushion. It is a piece of foam with thin cloth cover for $40. I will not buy from this company again. I did however liked the way the product was packed and shipped. It arrived on time and in a proper box.
