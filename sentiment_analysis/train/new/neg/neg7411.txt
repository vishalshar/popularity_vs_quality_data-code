Lamaze Toys have cute designs, but I won't buy any more new ones because they are made in China and don't even pretend to use ethical labor. You can also tell the make is not that great, as ours is coming apart at the seams a little bit. No toy is cute enough that I would want another mother (or even worse, child) to be treated horrendously to make it. If Lamaze ever moves their manufacturing, I would buy more of these toys. I used to buy them as gifts, but unless something changes, I won't again. If you want to get a baby you love a more ethical toy, look at something like Bears for Humanity or Green Toys.
