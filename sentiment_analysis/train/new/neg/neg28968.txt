I purchased this item to help out to correct my son's torticollis and provide some support to his body given his hipotonia. I even bought the torticollis kit to go with it. It turned out that it didn't work for his torticollis not matter how many times I adjusted his head and torticollis pillows. My son's head kept defaulting to the side despite of the Snuggin Go and Snuggin Go torticollis kit. However, I must admit the one thing it did help with was keeping his body straight up in his stroller and bouncy. What I didn't like was the smell of the fabric and the amount of lint on the fabric. I got the black one and the odor is very strong and smelled like cigarettes. I sent it back thinking that maybe it was an item that has been returned from a smoker household but the replacement came in with the same issue. The torticollis pillow set were also made out the same fabric and color but didn't smell as bad. Anyways, I took my chances and put it apart in pieces and washed the fabric out in the washer and dryer. The lint and the smell were gone.
