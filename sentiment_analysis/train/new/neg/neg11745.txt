Buy different hangers.Whatever the hangers are coated/covered with--it looks like flocked velvet--smells absolutely terrible.  Upon opening the package, the odor filled the room and immediately made me nauseous.  We hung them outside for 4 days hoping to air them out, but there was no change.  We then soaked them overnight in the bathtub -- still no luck.  Even submerged under water, the chemical smell from the hangers was so bad I couldn't go into that bathroom.  The hangers are now outside in the garbage.  What a waste.
