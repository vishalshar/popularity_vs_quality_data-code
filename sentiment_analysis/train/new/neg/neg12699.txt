I got this chair because my 5 year old needed the support of a feeding seat, but was too big to fit in the one she's had since she was a baby, and booster seats typically don't have enough support. The benefits of this chair are that it has child-sized back support, and she can get in it herself using the foot rest as a step (though I watch her closely and tell her not to stand on it for any length of time, as it's not meant to be a step.) I also like that the seat and foot rest are adjustable and the padding is comfortable. The safety belt keeps her in the seat at dinner time. The major downside is that the seat cushions are not firmly attached. The bottom just sort of slides into the side grooves, though not very well, so the seat comes out pretty much every time my child gets out of the chair. I seriously have no idea why for approximately $200 they can't find a way to secure the seat cushion a little bit better (the grooves in the chair don't even line up exactly with the reverse groove on the cushion???). The top cushion is slightly more attached but that can pop out or twist around pretty easily too. The other downside is that the base is very wide--I'm sure for stability reasons--but it is super easy to stub your toe on it, like, all the time. Every day. We still use the seat for every meal and will probably continue to do so until she's tall enough for an adult chair, which may be well into her teen years since she is small. I couldn't find anything better on the market.
