I purchased a Summer Infant Video Monitor 28035 that was advertised as NEW, when in fact it was obviously not. The box had been opened and then resealed. When I opened the box, I found that the handheld unit that the parent uses to view their child was covered in scratches, dust and finger prints. As if that wasn't enough, the screen that's behind the glass had slipped down, exposing the green circuit board behind it. This is the 4th Summer Infant Video Monitor that I have purchased over the years, and I know exactly what a new, factory sealed box and product look like, and this was not it. I am appalled that the seller (who I cannot mention apparently) would advertise a used, refurbished item as a NEW product to unsuspecting parents. I took several photos of the item that they tried to pass off as new and intend on posting them. Shame on them for their horrible business practices!
