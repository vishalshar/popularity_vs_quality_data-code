Like many others, we wanted a stylish rocker that could easily transition into the living room.  It had to be comfortable for us too.We looked everywhere, and there are only a few nice ones to choose from.  The Nara was by far the cheapest of the nice ones, so we said, "Amazon has incredible return policy, so let's give it a try?".  We had found the monte designs Luca glider was the perfect size and fit for our nursery, but was $1000.  The Nara glider looks very similar, has similar dimensions, and was only $599?  Let's try it.Well, it arrived quickly.  The shipping company was only supposed to drop it at the curb?!  I talked the guy into bringing in the front door.  So make sure you have help.The chair looked nice, and was very firm at first.  I'm sure that it would break in after a few weeks.  Then I started to notice little things about the chair, that shows it is not put together that well.  The fabric is not tight across the chair, so it has ripples in the arms and down the sides.  Very noticeable.  The seat also does not sit flush with the chair, it pokes out an inch or two.  It just looked funny.  When I emailed Babyletto support, it took them a week just to respond, and they said it was normal.  That even couches were designed that way.  Really?  My couch cushions are flush with the frame.  Sorry.The main thing was that for us, it just didn't fit.  My wife is 5 feet, and her feet were not touching the ground.  The Luca glider was a perfect fit, despite the similar dimensions.  The seat depth was just a bit too much, making it uncomfortable.  The lumbar pillow is a joke too.  Doesn't do anything.To recap:  Stylish and very affordable.  Some minor design/fitment issues that probably relate to the relative cheapness of the chair.  Not the best for smaller women/men.  If you're taller, it might be great for you.Amazon return policy?  The best in the business.  They sent a shipping company to pick up the HUGE box, with no return fees.
