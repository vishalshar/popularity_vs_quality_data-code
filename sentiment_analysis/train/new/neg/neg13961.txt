My Toddler son likes to chew on the original straws and eventually manages to bite a hole in them. These replacements work but not nearly as well as the originals. First, they do not have the little flaps that keep liquid from spilling out so if these tip over, all the liquid in the straw is coming out too. Second, they don't seal nearly as well as the originals where the two pieces connect. In fact, there is enough wiggle room for the seal to fail entirely and then when the cup tips over everything comes leaking out. Third,they have to be cut to size which isn't too bad for the taller click lock cups but for the smaller ones, you have to cut the hard plastic bottom piece too which is not as easy at it might sound (launches across the room nicely when attempting to cut with scissors though). I'm just not sure why they don't sell the original version which was superior in most every way.
