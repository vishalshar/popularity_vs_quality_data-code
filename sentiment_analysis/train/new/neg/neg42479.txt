We bought & loved a total of 5 Britax car seats.  With our 2nd son I saw the new Chaperone line was coming out around the same time he was due so I pre-ordered the infant carrier seat & stroller.  I now know why you should never buy something without testing it out first at a local retailer.  The stroller is very heavy & EXTREMELY CUMBERSOME.  The folding "process" is ackward.  You need to first lift the tray up (our's has a faulty latch that doesnt release properly), then pull a strap on the seat (which isnt so bad), BUT then the seat folds outward so where the baby sits is exposed (our other stroller -a Combi- folds inward so the seat is protected when traveling).  To me this is bad designing.  The basket at the bottom has a bar that flips down & ours sometimes drops on it's own (not enough tension in the spring???).  It is also very difficult to lift over a curb, etc. by pushing down on the handle.  There's nowhere for your foot to step on to leverage the handle-push motion, for the front wheels to go up & over curb.  Again, we love britax... but are VERY DISAPOINTED with this buy & therefor do NOT reccommend this stroller.  Sorry britax:(  We liked the infant carrier (even though it's on the larger side & a bit heavy) and will buy another forward facing seat when our son is ready... but you definately need to improve on this stroller (if you haven't already).
