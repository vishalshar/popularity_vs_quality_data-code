I'm huge on reviews! I read them, write them, they really help in my choice in buying something online.First the shipping was super fast! Loved that. It came looking just like the picture, all the sea creatures were there and it wasn't damaged. Cool, right? That's what I thought.My little one is almost two weeks over four months and Hayes tummy time, so after reading reviews and being desperate to wanting to help her enjoy tummy time more I purchased this. I knew all about the animals stocking but after everyone giving solutions around that and the price I went ahead and ordered.I did just as so many other reviewers mentioned, I pulled out all the animals which wasn't hard since the water opening was a good size, I slicked them up with virgin olive oil & poured some vintage in the whale and filling the rest with water....Terrible!!!! I was so disappointed! They still all clumped! I shook that thing so hard over and over and still nothing! I was determined to make this work for my little one, so I pulled out all the sea creatures which were so slippery it was hard to hold them! I repeated all my steps over and still nothing. Ugh.So annoying! I will be returning, even though it's fthe be dollars, it's ridiculous this didn't work!I'll be buying a much better model here on Amazon for just a little more money. You get what you pay for. DO NOT BUY THIS!
