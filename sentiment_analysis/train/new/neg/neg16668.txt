I ordered this crib for my brother and his girlfriend. I read the reviews about the missing parts and also about the quality of the crib and that the owners loved the crib. I decided to take a risk on the missing parts and hope it didn't happen to me. I was wrong. On one of the draws there were 2 lefts sides to form the draw, it was missing the right side. I called amazon who told me it was out of stock and would take 1-2 months to get replacement part. They told me that I could get another crib and they'll expedite it. My brother's girlfriend did not want another crib and liked it despite the mix up on the sides. My brother will go to home depot and try to fix it while we hope the side comes in time for the baby. Be aware that many reviews are missing parts and that it may take 1-2 months to fix the issue. Overall the quality and look of the crib they loved. If I didn't have the mix up it would be 5 stars. If you are in a time constraint I would buy the crib else where because this is a hassle for people with babies due soon.Amazon if you're reading this you need to fix the dealer on this crib to straighten up the missing parts because this is ridiculous. Too many complaints on this and it seems years after its still an issue......
