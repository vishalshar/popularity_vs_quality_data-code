These cups are great -- our favorite.  They are some of the only ones that don't leak when the baby throws it over the side of the high chair, or when in the diaper bag.  It was fine not to be able to choose a color for our daughter, but it seems silly for our son to have to walk around with a cup that is the brightest pink I've seen.  Not just one piece of it is pink, as shown in some of the pictures, but EVERY piece is a bright, hot pink.  It's also disappointing that you cannot order more lids separately.  We now have 6 cups in total and no lids left.
