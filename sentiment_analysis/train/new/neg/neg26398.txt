Ok so I got this pillow after my boppy got a little flat.  It's 4 years old so I'm not surprised. I chose this pillow instead of the boppy because of the nice features.  First thing I did was rip the tags off and the seam came apart.  So that was obviously my fault but I noticed the seam stich was poor. The front and back side of the sham are only held together by a very thin piece of additional fabric with a single stich.  Another thing about the sham is that it fits poorly.  It's very bunchy at the top where the baby's head is. It should have been held together with another strip of velcro to prevent the bunching of excess fabric.  The pillow itself is nice and puffy except for at the top.  It sort of bows in when nursing and when baby lays on it. I can not see this helping to support a sitting baby.  This is definitely not wOrth the $40 I just spent on this.  It's good enough for a nursing pillow but I recommend going with a different nursing pillow.EDIT:After trying the pillow for a few longer feedings,  I've come to the conclusion that I absolutely hate using it.  It's way too small (and I  am by no means a large person) and digs into my stomach. It also bends in so badly that the baby cannot be positioned correctly for feeding. Also,  not a huge deal but of you're wearing shorts, the velcro o on the other side scratches your legs.  I'll leave it at a 2 only because I have tried the lounger part aND baby seems slightly more comfy in it than the Boppy. Bottom line,  don't waste your money!  Get a boppy!
