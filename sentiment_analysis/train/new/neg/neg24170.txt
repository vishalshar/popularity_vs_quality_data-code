I really enjoy this product overall because my son still mouths everything in sight, including restaurant tables. He is also a messy eater, so I view this product as both a germ preventer (nothing against the restaurants, but who ever cleans the underside of the tables? Yuck!), and a mess preventer. So it both helps him and the person who cleans the table when we leave.However, the reasons this only gets three stars are:1. The adhesive backing strips are just obnoxious. They always stick to my hands and arms when removed. This is from static, not adhesive, but annoying none-the-less.2. This is minor, but it does leave a bit of adhesive behind on the table when removed. It comes off fairly easily, but I can see the outline when I take it off.With that being said, it still gets three stars because it is useful, but it could be better. These issues haven't deterred us from using them.
