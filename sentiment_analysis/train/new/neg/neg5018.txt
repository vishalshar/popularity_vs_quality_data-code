I used this pump approximately three times a week (ONE, single-side pumping session each time) for the past four weeks, and when I went to pump today it just didn't work.  I tried running it off battery power, plugging it in to different outlets, etc.  Nothing.  This is hugely disappointing for such an expensive product.  Not sure if this is an anomaly and I should purchase the same product as a replacement or try something else.
