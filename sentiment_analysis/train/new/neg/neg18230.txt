I am so disappointed. Loved this bag at first and it has wonderful storage. Unfortunately,  after less than 4 months of use ( bought it 5 months ago while still pregnant), it has a huge rip in it. I didnt snag it on anything,  it just began to tear over time with use.  If I had the bag a few years I would've expected it, but I've only had it a few months! Wanted to love it, but I am definitely disappointed.
