It's OK but we only use it for water because it leaks more than a bottle. It's also quite heavy for my 11 month old to handle, even nearly empty. Also the plastic parts cannot be entirely removed. If you want to use it like a cup, there's a plastic ring around the edge. I recommend the Safe Sippy over this, by far. The Safe Sippy isn't insulated, but frankly my baby doesn't care about that.
