This monitor set is ok.  We got our unit on sale at Target.  It gets three stars because the cons outweigh the pros and this unit could function a little better.Cons-Too much static on every channel.  We have no other devices in the house on the same frequency as the monitor and all of the channels have static.  Our house is only 932 square feet and baby's room is next to our room.  This unit shouldn't be struggling with static.The battery life of the receivers is terrible.  Even though the instructions say not to leave the receivers plugged in all the time, this is the only way to make it through the night without them quitting on us.  This doesn't speak well of the dependability of the receivers.The receivers have a nice green backlight so you can see the screen in the dark but the backlight doesn't stay on long enough to be useful (like at 2:30am when you start getting too much static and need to switch channels and you don't want to turn on every light in the house so that you can see the screen).The receivers are big and bulky, though better than a lot of other products out there.Pros-The monitor actually picks ups breathing sounds from the baby, even if there are other noises in the room such as music.  It's nice to know that they made this product extra sensitive to baby's noises.The unit is easy to operate out of the box and the controls are easy to understand and use.Shop around a little bit more and look at the rest of the reviews on this site.  There is a really good review that outlines what frequencies your different electronic devices should be on (your wireless network, cordless phones, etc).
