I was so excited to get this . . . as a new father, I'm still learning how to do a proper/good swaddle to keep my daughter happy, so I figured the SwaddlePod would help (and keep me sane).  Overall, it's easy to use.  Just zip your child into it and you're done.  However, once you zip up the zipper, it basically sits right below my daughter's chin.  The SwaddlePod does have a little flap to help cover the zipper once zipped, but it's so small that once my daughter starts moving her arms, the flap basically moves and doesn't cover the zipper.  Its basically useless.  I had put her in and put her to sleep but within 30 min, she was screaming - when I went in to check, the zipper was jammed right in her chin and she had several scratches.  I don't understand why they didn't make a bigger flap, or have a secondary snap to cover it or even use velcro.  Again, I loved the idea and really really wanted to use it, but I will not, given what it did to my daughter.  I do not recommend this.
