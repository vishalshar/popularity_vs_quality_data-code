DO NOT ORDER THESE,now let me tell you why,bought these in jumbo,we recently bought new wedding bands that CANNOT be resized,they are wide,so going by reviews these sounded just like what we needed,nope they suck big time,they are extra hard not flexible at all,will NOT stay on the rings,would most definitely wear a blister on your finger and palm if they would stay on which they will not,we got the jumbo because they were labeled as perfect for girls who like to wear their boyfriends class rings,or extra wide bands,they came in super fast,i can't find fault with the seller only the product,these are worthless pieces of very hard plastic that you are very lucky to even gety on your ring but they WILL pop back off,not worth losing a ring over,STAY AWAY,these are WORTHLESS PIECES OF JUNK.
