I like using these on public toilets for my daughter, but they are quite expensive and don't really stick well on the toilet.My daughter no longer likes to use these since they move out of place on the seat when she sits down. I do like how long they drape over the seat to cover near the base of the toilet. I feel like that area is always dirty and my daughters short legs and bottoms end up touching that part of the toilet.
