This is a perfectly fine, useable diaper bag for the money, but the diaper bag the hospital gave us was just as good, just a little smaller. This one holds quite a bit, it seems decently well made, and it looks OK, although kind of boring. Dads should not be embarrassed to carry it. If I had it to do over, I would not have bothered with it, but there is nothing wrong with it.
