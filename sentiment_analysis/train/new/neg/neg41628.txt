I bought the bottle warmer as a separate piece. Overall I would not recommend it. It does not have an auto turn off and when you are a new mom and sleep deprived I can assure you will forget to unplug it or switch it off. If you forget to switch it off the water becomes so hot it will evaporate in a very short amount of time.Also beware formula may get extremely hot. Always test it before feeding it to your baby.I do use the Avent bottles and despite the fact I would prefer to use glass instead of plastic, it is almost impossible to find glass bottles with decent nipples. The great thing about the Avent nipples is they do resemble a breast nipple so the transition from breast to bottle was much easier for my daughter. If you are like me and you do not like the idea of warming up the formula in plastic you can get the Evenflo Classic glass bottles, warm your formula in those and then pass it to the Avent bottle when the formula is not very hot.
