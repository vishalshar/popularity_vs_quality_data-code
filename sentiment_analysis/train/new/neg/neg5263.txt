I purchased this for my 4 month old grandson for a 1300 mile drive he was making with our family.  We were in the car for about 11 hours a day.  My goal was to give him enough different items to look at while on the long drive to keep his interest and keep in from getting bored and therefore cranky.  I was able to attach this to the headrest of the seat he was in with little problems.  But, he got bored with it very quickly - and maybe that is the goal - to help a child go to sleep.This product plays a couple of tunes over and over again and the "scene" changes from spring, summer, fall, and winter with a light show in the background.  Basically, the scene is on a scroll.It will hook up just fine to his crib from IKEA and I am sure he will get some enjoyment out of it.  The product was made well and it is actually larger than I expected.
