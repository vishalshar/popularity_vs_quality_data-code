I wanted a simple, lightweight, easy-to-haul, and fairly-cheap stroller. That is what I got! Overall, the stroller is OK. I don't really like the steering, although what can I expect for the price? I like the adjustable seat. I like that it has a shade, although every time I fold the stroller the shade canopy goes flying off! A little irritating, although it does it's job when it is on the stroller and being used. Except for when my son plays with the shade constantly and moves it down past his head, therefore defeating the purpose of shading his head!! I also like the cup holder and the little bag in the back for holding small items. Overall, a good stroller for the price. Another thing - I don't care for the three point harness. Too easy for my son to squirm out. Should have thought about it more and bought one with a five point.
