After trying (and disliking) the Bumbo seat, I decided to go for this one because of its attractive kiwi green coloring and apparently larger leg room. It is an improvement over the Bumbo, but in my opinion it's still not a great buy. Here are the pros and cons as I see them:Pros: (1) It is really cute to see my baby sitting in this chair, especially when the kiwi placemat is on. (2) The leg holes are bigger than the Bumbo. (3) The tray is relatively easy to attach.Cons: (1) The major con is that sitting in the seat causes my baby to spit up digested milk curds. He almost never does this, as he doesn't spit up that much in general. I think it's the fact that the seat causes him to double over a little bit, and that position causes him to spit up. However, this also happened with the Bumbo, so I don't think the problem is with this product in particular. (2) He doesn't tolerate the seat for very long. He's a very active baby and the seat is apparently too confining (although again, that is not a defect of this product, just a problem with infant seats in general). (3) The cute kiwi placemat doesn't stay on, and the toy definitely doesn't. It would be better if this product had no toy and the placemat simply came in kiwi or watermelon (both adorable). He's not at an age when he's eating solids yet, but if he were, I imagine it would be difficult to clean out the little crevices where the toy is supposed to go. (4) It's quite annoying that the chair straps won't come off. We can't use them because our chairs don't have a lower back brace, so it wouldn't be safe, but it's hard to keep them out of the way on the floor.All in all, if you want your baby to sit up, I would invest in a multi-positional bouncer rather than an infant seat.
