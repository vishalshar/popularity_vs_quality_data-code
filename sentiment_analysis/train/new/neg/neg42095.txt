I have to admit, what attracted me the most was the price, I was looking for a cellphone toy for my 6 month old boy and this one was the cheapest.On the positive side, this toy seems really steady which is good. The rubber is good to chew on, which is nice because my little boy like to chew on everything. The mirror is also a nice addition.On a more "negative" side, I was surprised by the low volume of it, sometime baby's toys are loud and annoying, but this one is really to quiet, you can not almost hear it. The sounds are also very limited.The cellphone is pretty bulky as well and it made it a little bit difficult to handle with little hands. And to finish I don't think this toy are really a educational value, I could have a little bit if you could hear the numbers, but that's not the case.Would I recommended it, not really.The good thing is, it was cheap!
