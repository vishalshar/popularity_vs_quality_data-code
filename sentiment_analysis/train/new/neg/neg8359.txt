I paid for a new set of baby bedding. My order did not have a receipt of any kind in my bag. Nothing was wrapped like it was new. Everything was shoved into 2 plastic bags that were taped together. Who sends items like that?! I do not know if these were new items or garage sale items. I had to look up my order on Amazon to see if all I had ordered was in the bag. I am very displeased with this order. I will not order from them again. This people made money off of me and I was scammed big time. Paid about $140 for garage sale items.
