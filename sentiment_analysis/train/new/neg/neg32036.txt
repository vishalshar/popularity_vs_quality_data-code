Feels flimsy to me. The Velcro doesnt stay where it should. If you load up the pockets it will fall off. It's ok for a small water bottle, keys, and my phone and that's about it. I am still searching for a better product. It does fit my City Mini GT Double but like I said not securely enough that I feel it is not going to let go at some point.
