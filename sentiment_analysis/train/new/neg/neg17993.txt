I bought this to replace a similar tug toy that was on a bright starts play mat that had stopped working. I've had this a few months now and it started out working great but now it only plays half of the song when pulled and sometimes it only plays one second's worth. My daughter still plays with it, but it sounds like it's "skipping."
