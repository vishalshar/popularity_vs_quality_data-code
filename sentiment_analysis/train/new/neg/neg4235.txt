I bought this item based on a 4 star review, unfortunately this item was essentially useless as the readings varied widely.  I'm wondering if any of the reviewers actually tried multiple readings to see if the item was consistent.In trying to use this on my son I got readings that ranged from 98.2 to 100.0 in the span of only 2 minutes!  This is a dangerous range when dealing with a toddler.I thought perhaps it was just too difficult to use on a child, so I tried it on myself.  Holding perfectly still and aligning the thermometer with my ear canal did not help to get a consistent reading.  My 4 readings ranged from 97.9 to 99.8.  A little more acceptable, but only under ideal conditions on an adult.After my frustration with this thermometer, I checked Consumer Reports.  It turns out that they don't recommend using Tympanic (Ear) Thermometers at all.  From their site: ""They aren't recommended for young children because there are lots of chances for error," Paul Horowitz, M.D., a founding pediatrician at Discovery Pediatrics in Valencia, Calif., said. We've found that you have to align them in the ear canal perfectly for them to be accurate.""Don't waste your time on this item, it will frustrate you and is potentially dangerous for your child.
