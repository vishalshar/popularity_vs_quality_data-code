After reading a 1-star review, I decided to try my luck and there was no LUCK on my side either. The same experience here: I received the beautiful bag from the seller "What's Hot". It arrived in time, and the bag looks beautiful. No stain, no scratches.But two things are missing (They are on the description of the product):Built-in zip-out changing station with detachable changing pad ----- NO CHANGING PAD.PPB-monogrammed plastic wipes case ----- NO WIPE CASEAt this point it doesn't seem like an accident because the other reviewer mentioned the same problems (and even worse). That makes me wonder if the seller is dishonest.I am going to return this bag. Too bad. This is THE pattern I want. 2 stars instead of 1, because the bag itself is a good looking bag.
