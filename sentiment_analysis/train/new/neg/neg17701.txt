while this is definitely one of the nicest looking exersaucers i've ever seen, it was competely useless. my 5 month old is bigger than average and she couldn't reach the floor on this thing, even on the lowest level! i had to stick a pillow under her feet and it's not as sturdy so she didn't end up turning around. before buying this, i was concerned that the arch (judging by the picture) would be hanging on top of baby's head but it was actually placed very well. regarding the toys, well, i've never seen anything my baby was less interested in. and this is a baby that genuinely enjoys playing with toys. the tke along toys were too advanced for her to play with- she never even touched the green frog, not his hand to play music, nor the spinner in his belly. the apple toy was very stiff so she couldn't pull it to her. the toys hanging from the arch only lit up IN THE BACK where the baby couldn't see them. honestly, her favorite toy was the TAG on the 'bird nest' rattle. all that said, this exersaucer is VEEERY PRETTY...and very useless. it doesn't fold up, but it seems that most newer models dont do that. construction requires a screwdriver and takes abt 20 min.
