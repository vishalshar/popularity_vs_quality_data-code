I ordered these because during one of my sleepless nights, I decided to feed my baby a "night time" formula that turned out to be so thick, it clogged the nipple of my bottle. In a silly move of sleep deprived desperation, I cut a hole in the nipple for my baby to be able to drink her milk, but of course I nearly drowned her as the hole was now too big for her to manage the flow of milk coming at her. I decided to buy new bottles and saw that the price had shot up to $90 per pack! so after I recovered from the shock it hit me I could just buy a nipple replacement, so I did. All was good in the world again until I tried to use them, one of them doesn't really fit the bottle so milk spills out from the seams on the sides, the other has a problem with the valve that lets air in, so as the baby suckles, the bottle starts getting squished until I have to interrupt the feeding, open the top, let air in and start over. My baby has by now caught up to this routine and doesn't cry anymore when the feeding is interrupted, she now patiently waits until I "fix" her milk and looks at me with a mix of pity and understanding while I scramble to do this as fast as possible. Needless to say, this is extremely annoying and I dare not use scissors again on these guys to open the air valve.I have 6 bottles total, so it is like a game of roulette I play to see when I will get the defective nipples, I still use them because I need all 6 bottles not to go insane or spend my life washing bottles, but for the price of these bottles and replacement nipples I was very surprised to find such poor quality.
