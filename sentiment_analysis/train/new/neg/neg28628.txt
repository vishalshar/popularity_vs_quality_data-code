Even after using a spray adhesive and rubber cement... these decals will not stay on the walls.  They are super cute, I love them and they really go well in the nursery... but they fall of all the time.  I've had to throw some away sadly because of the way they fell off the wall they were unrecoverable. A lot of money for something that didn't last a week before they fell apart.
