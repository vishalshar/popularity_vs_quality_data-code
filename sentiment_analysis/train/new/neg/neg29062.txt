I'm really irritated with this thing. The music cycles seriously only last minutes. I don't know how to make it last longer. It came with no instructions. The entire cycle lasts a half hour from music to silence and every time it turns off it wakes my baby up. Either mine is defective or it just plain sucks. No wonder it was discontinued. Glad I didn't pay original price for it.
