I'm sorry to say that this did not work. My friend had one from motherhood and I loved that one. My baby has a bad habit of not wanting to be covered. I don't blame him since most covers are hot and stuffy. My friends was breathable and he was able to see threw it while he nursed. I was barrowing hers while at a conference and it worked great because I didn't have to leave to go nurse him. This one however is not breathable and was a disaster from the beginning. He exposed me right away and refused to be covered with it. It was a waste of money and should have put that money torward a Motherhood one. Luckily my friend got me one and he nurses with that one. The only good use for this one is my husband says I look like bat women with it one.
