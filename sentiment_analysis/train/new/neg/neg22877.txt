We ordered this to protect our newborn from the super cold and windy winters we have. This is one of the few covers that is actually safe to put on your infant, as it does not go under the baby, but around the edges of the seat. Don't use the ones that go under the baby! This cover is extremely warm, fit our infant seat fairly well and seemed very well made, however, we will be sending it back. One of our main reasons for purchasing this cover, was that it said we could safely pullthe face flap closed,which we wanted to have the ability to do with our freezing winds. There was no way this was possible, her 2 week old new born head already poked above the edges of the cover with the flap open, to close it would mean laying it directly on her face. Our infant seat is by BabyTrend, could be the seat and may work well for other brands, but not ours.
