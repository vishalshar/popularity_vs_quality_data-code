I registered for this carrier because with my oldest daughter (8) I had their previous model.  I have to say while this carrier is easy to use and definetly very safe and the price is great it's hurts a lot to use.  The carrier has a support belt for behind the neck.  While it's nicely padded it tends to distribute a great deal of the weight on your neck. My son is seven pounds and very small. I used it for ten minutes and my neck was killing me when I got home.  They need to go back to the way that their previous model was made where the support belt was around your waist.  I will be exchanging this one.
