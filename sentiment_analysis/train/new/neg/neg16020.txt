This item is a great idea, but the reality is that even when I drank from the feeding system I got so much air, not food for colic or babies in general. I tried it with my triplets. One baby pulled the formula about five times, got air each time then choked when the liquid finally came through. After he coughed he tried ahain. It took so long to get the liquid back to him that he eventually decided to treat it like a pacifier. Fail.
