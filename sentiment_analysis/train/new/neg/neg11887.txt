I bought this divider for socks, but ended up using it for underwear instead.  It does a nice job of keeping everything neat, and the price is great.  The only complaint I have is that the outer edges do not look as good as the picture that accompanies the product.  Nobody sees it but me, so I guess it doesn't matter!
