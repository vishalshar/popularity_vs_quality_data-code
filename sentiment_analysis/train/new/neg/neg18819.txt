There are several good things about this diaper - reasonably priced, good quality material, easy washing/drying, super adorable patterns, no poop leaks ever!.My major problem with them was urine leakage.  Our baby boy was 7 lbs, 21.5 inches at birth.  They fit great around the waist and legs (because of the adjustable snaps) but the rise is too short.  We had frequent (probably 50% of the time) leakage of urine from the top of the diaper because, as is the case with boys, the urine is directed upwards. Having said that, the absorbency seems to be very good, as when it doesn't just run out the top of the diaper, it holds a lot of liquid. It seems that these would work great for baby girls!They definitely grow out of them quickly (as is the case with most newborn things!).  So, its hard to make a financial argument for using them over disposables (just be happy with the environmental impact, and save them for the next kid!)  My boy is 7 weeks old, now weighs 11.5lbs and is pretty much grown out of them due to the short rise.
