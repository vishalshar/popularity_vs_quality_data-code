I purchased this for my baby and I'm sad to say the quality if horrible. The 1st one arrived filthy in the original packaging so I returned. The second one arrived and had a faulty snap but i was still able to get the bars to stand because of the pocket it slides into. I didn't want to return again. I was a little busy taking care of a new baby. I kept it and baby used it for 3 mon then today I noticed the tail is missing from the zebra. All that remains is loose thread. So I really like the feel and features of this mat but the quality is just terrible and this is quite pricey. I feel this is a safety issue. Now I have to find the tail!
