Man made fabrics aren't for me. Cloth diapering without using natural fabrics doesn't work for us. These leave the skin moist and hot. The PUL does not let the skin breathe. On my 6 week old I even had 4 night time leaks. They fit fine from 7.5 lbs on up. They left marks on my son's thighs becuase in order for them to fit correctly woth out leaking they must be pretty snug. Pee will fit it's way out if there is anywhere that is loose even a tiny bit....that's what's wrong with microfiber. I researched a lot before buying these and u was very excited to try them. I now use organic cotton tie diapers from Disana and will covers. I figure if your going to wash diapers they might as well be as pure, comfortable and less prone to leaks.
