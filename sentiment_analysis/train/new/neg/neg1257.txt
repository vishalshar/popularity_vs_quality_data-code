Bought these to support dog gait on an angled opening.  Not sure how they are supposed to hold on stair rail spindles as they don't hold well on stable dry wall corner.  Angle of adapter is wrong (too big).  Padding with felt helps somewhat...a little disappointed they don't work better, but then again I'm trying to use them in a creative way, not the way they were intended.
