I have 2 of these cups, both purchased from Amazon. The first one has been in use for 3-4 months with no issue. Liquid will get trapped in the top "valve" and leak out if the cup is tipped, but the cup itself does not leak. Others complain about the difficulty with the plastic insert valve part of the lid, but I have no trouble cleaning it and inserting it back into the ring after washing. The second cup i orderd slightly over a month ago and was used only 4-5 times before liquid somehow seeped between the inner cup and outer insulating layer. My mother had the same cup for my son that did the same thing. Nuby gave her a replacement cup. I have another friend with 2 of these cups that have not had the liquid seepage. The cup still functions with the liquid in the space, but i feel that if liquid can somehow get in there it is not completely sealed and the old, stagnant liquid could lead back out and my son could possible consume it.As far as the product before the seepage- it worked great. My 20 month had no issue drinking from and spilled less of it. It was easy to clean and reassemble. I prefer the large plastic gasket as opposed to smaller ones that i have in sippys from other brands. If Nuby could fix the seepage issue, we would buy more of these cups.
