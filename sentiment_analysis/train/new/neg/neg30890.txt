Have to say I unfortunately disagree with all the glowing reviews.  These just didn't work very well for us.  First of all, they came with absurdly long and difficult to follow prepping instructions.  I'm not a newbie to cloth diapering; these instructions were just over-the-top.  The "gussets" have never scrunched up for us, even with repeated washings.  More disturbingly, after only a few weeks they REEK of urine.  I'm very assiduous with my cleaning and I've not had smell, discoloration, or problems with any of my other inserts (grovias, flips, etc.)  Everything else comes out of the wash clean and fresh.  These do seem to hold a lot of fluid and they're relatively trim, but they take forever to dry (and obviously they aren't giving up all the urine in the wash). They also tend to get a bit lumpy.  Overall, I'm very disappointed with these and don't plan to continue using them.  I think I'll have to just throw them away, since I can't imagine who would want them, smelling as they do...
