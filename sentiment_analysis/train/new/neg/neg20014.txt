This bouncer was awesome the first month of heavy use... then it stopped bouncing. Since I bought it while I was pregnant, It was past the 90 days when it broke and the seller would not return. I called bright starts and they sent a replacement bounce unit, but that was ALSO broken (and the wrong color). I called then again and they were kind enough to exchange the bouncer for an entire new one. The new one does work, but buyer be ware, these do tend to malfunction. During the 3+ week period when we were without a bouncer, I ended up buying a graco glider swing because my daughter has to sleep sitting up due to her reflux and she wont go to sleep or stay asleep without motion. I now use the swing more than the bouncer, so maybe that's why it is still working.Edit: The replacement bouncer has officially stopped working today, and right when I need it for going on vacation too. I would expect more for the $60 price. If I had known that I would have to bounce this myself, I would have gotten a cheaper chair with a vibrate function. I am convinced that The first one not just a freak occurrence since it has busted a total of 3 times already with normal use.
