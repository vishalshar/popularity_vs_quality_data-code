The gate is OK. The thing I don't like about it is that when it slides back when the door is opened, it can get off the track which is a pain to deal with it since I got it because of my dog. It seems to keep him out as intended. It works... the thing is to be sure you don't slide it off the track completely. I wish there was a stop so it would slid just enough when the door is open, but it did not slide off the track. It might be better for a child as it is intended. It does look nice as is pictured. My dog does put his paws up on it, and it does scratch the finish on the top a little, but a furniture touch-up can fix this. One thing I will say for it that is definitely a plus for using it for a dog for the purpose of keeping him out. There is NO WAY for him to open it. I've seen other designs that have a button that is pressed to release the door. He was able to ram this type of gate and jostle the door enough that he could get the gate open. This door has kept him out, so for that purpose it is very good.
