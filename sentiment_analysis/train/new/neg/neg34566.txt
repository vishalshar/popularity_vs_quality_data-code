Easy to install on the stroller, and can leave it on even after folding up.  However, I find that the drinks in there spill quite a lot due to the bumpiness, even just going down a sidewalk.  Even coffee and drinks with straws will spill, even when they are not full and half empty.  You can only really put closed bottles or thermos in it.
