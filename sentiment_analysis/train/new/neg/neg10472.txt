I should have listened to the other reviews on here for sure! I am on my second child and with my first we used the Safety 1st brand and had absolutely no problems. With these, they are practically impossible to get apart to even put on the door and then once you get them on there they are extremely hard to get open especially on a round knob. I put one on my pantry door and my husband came home and couldn't get it open! So I tried to and sure enough it does not grip it at all no matter how you try to do it. Then I tried to get it off the knob which took me another 10 minutes because of how impossible it is to break apart. I finally had to get a knife and press down on the little button while trying not to stab myself lol. It definitely will keep your child out of the room you have it on but it will also make it very hard for you to get in. I will be buying the Safety 1st brand and throwing all these away!
