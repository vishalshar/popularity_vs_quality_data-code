I purchased this seat because it was reasonably priced, the recline feature was easy to use, and I liked the ease of adjusting the harness height. It also seemed that the seat would grow well with my child. However, when I installed it in the car I realized this seat would not work for us. Our intent is to use this rear facing first, as our baby is 8 months old. I had to stuff a towel under the base to attempt to bring the seat to the correct angle, which then the seat did not feel secure. I tightened the restraints but still could not get it secure. The first of our vehicles I attempted this seat in was our 2010 Ford Focus 2 DR Coupe. Our smallest vehicle. I think the seat would work in this car as forward facing, however we won't get there for a couple years. In addition to the wobbly install, the seat reclined stuck out about 38 inches from the backseat, which forced the two front seats of the car practically up to the dash. The seat itself is tall with no way to adjust it as in some other models with a shorter shell. The height of the seat and angle of recline just made it impossible in our car. Long story short, returned the seat.
