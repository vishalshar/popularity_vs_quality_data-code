The quality was very nice however the idea is to have the baby actually wear the bracelet, so that the sentiment in the poem is true. Well, it is quite difficult to get the bracelet out and close to impossible to get the bracelet back in. I used it for a baptismal gift and now have to figure out how to get the bracelet back in.
