I bought this mobile for nearly 14 dollars more than the $20.00 price it is going for now. Although I love the mobile, I was highly disappointed with what I got(or what I did not get--rather) for the high price of the nearly $34.00 that I paid. I opened the box to see that I had to assemble the mobile, which would have been fine-- had all the pieces been included and the some of the ones that were there not been chipped. I was pretty irritated with the product, but because I figured that I would rather find a way to create some wings of my own to replace the missing and broken ones rather than risk shipping it back and ordering another mobile again that would probably come in with more defective pieces and more missing parts, I have decided to work with what I have. So now, I, basically, have mostly dragons and a few wingless Loch Ness Monster-looking creatures throwing off the balance of the mobile until I can figure out how to fix the situation without sending the product back. It's a cool mobile, but I'm sure had I had gotten all the pieces and they had been in tact, it would have been a wonderful purchase. However,  based on the fact that I got the incomplete, chipped version of the mobile, I cannot recommend buying this product unless you are the gambling type of person and live for excitement.
