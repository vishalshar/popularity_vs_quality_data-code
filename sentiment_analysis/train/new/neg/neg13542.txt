Do not buy this product. We received several damaged pieces. Numerous attempts to contact the manufacturer by phone and email went unreturned to this day. We did speak to the seller who coordinated some replacements parts but when the parts arrived they the wrong sized holes cut and one was the wrong stain so the color was way off. We were also told one of the damaged parts was still usable by the seller, and a replacement part would not be sent. This was indeed true...but as i pointed out,all the damaged parts were indeed usable but we were not paying $400 for a damaged item. We were given a refund but after numerous reviews I've found where parts are shipped damaged or have bad workmanship i have to warn everyone to avoid this item.
