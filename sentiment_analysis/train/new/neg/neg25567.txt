I loved this car seat for when my daughter was first transitioning from rear facing to front facing, as the deep seat and incline supported her well. However, after two years, she is too tall for this seat to work well for either of our vehicles.Most distressing, was when I went to remove it yesterday (to install the new upright booster we bought), the styrofoam around the headpiece broke completely off from the molded plastic! I am by no means Wonder Woman, so I was horrified to think of what could have happened in a collision.
