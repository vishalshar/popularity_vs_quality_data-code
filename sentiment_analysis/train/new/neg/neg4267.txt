This product doesn't work as a bib or anything else ....after using to for few weeks I just got tired of changing entire outfits, even bathing my babies because the upper part "around the neck and half of the bib" IS NOT WATERPROOF is just fabric. I've even try to put an cloth wipe under but still they get wet .NOT RECOMMENDED WASTE OF MONEY .
