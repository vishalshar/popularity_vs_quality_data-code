This basket is great and absolutely dishwasher safe. I love all the different compartments. I used Dr. Brown bottles with my son and they were such a pain to wash by hand because of all the parts (and at the rate babies have bottles, that can become EXTREMELY time consuming!), so it was great to have this basket that essentially does the work for you. It fit the bottle parts (except the bottle itself) of up to 5 bottles at a time. Once my son got older, I started using this basket to wash his sippy cup parts and it worked just as well. Now that he doesn't use either of those, I still use it to wash small things such as medicine cups, travel cup lids, etc. The main issue I had with this basket was that over time, the bottom front portion of the basket started to warp inward, so I wasn't able to click the top closed anymore, and I wasn't able to fit as many parts inside.
