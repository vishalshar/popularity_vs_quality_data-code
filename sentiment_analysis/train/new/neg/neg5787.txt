This sheet will last a year with moderate use.  Mine has turned brown/gray from use and the material is very thin.  The elastic has worn out so it wont stay on my toddler's bed.  If you are buying for a crib and plan to move to a twin bed in a year then its worth it.  If you have more than one kid and toddler beds then I suggest another sheet.
