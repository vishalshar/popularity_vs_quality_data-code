Cute design, not super roomy, quality not made for wear and tear, outside pockets nice, but I would have preferred zipped pockets, less chance of a spill when bending over, not enough peripherally to fit diapers, wipes, change of clothes, snack, medicine and shoes not to mention misc items.  RUNS SMALL for storage.
