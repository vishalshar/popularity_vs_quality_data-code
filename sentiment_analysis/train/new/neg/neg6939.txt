I was looking for a teether that was just basic and didn't have a lot of other things on it so I ordered this one because I couldn't find anything similar where I live. This is cheaply made and pretty disappointing.  Other people mentioned that they had trouble with their baby biting on the star.  We haven't had this problem yet, but the ring is not flexible like other similar rings so if you have an older baby, when they pick it up on their own they will bite the star.  The "string" that holds the beads on is actually harder plastic in the shape of an oval.  When I ordered this, I pail $3.95 and when we were on vacation I saw the exact same teether for $2.95 at the grocery store.  You get what you pay for.  I would say that the $2.95 price tag is appropriate for the quality.  Don't let the amazon list price of $9.99 fool you.  It is $3 quality, not $10 quality.
