I am a huge fan of Combi products but unfortunately with regards to this Kobuk booster seat, Combi has failed me. It is cheaply made and does not feel safe. I have had mine for less than a year and the styrofoam is falling apart. The seat has a foam which cannot be removed and is very difficult to clean... if your child throws up- not an uncommon occurrence- you will never get it out. The cupholder is in an awkward position so we've never used it, and it is annoying to have to make both straps go under the bar each time you strap the child in. Do not recommend :(
