I have used these trays for sweet potatoes,  plums and ice so far.  I haven't tried chunkier foods yet,  but I have been impressed so far.What I like:1.They stack nicely and are a good shape and size.2.  The semi-circles come out easily after running the back of the tray under warm water.3. They are easy to clean too without the corners of normal cubes.4.  When the baby food stage is over I can still use these for ice! (I've already tried it!)Good to know:1.  It doesn't come with an actual recipe book, just an e-guide.  Kind of a let down given that we have Pinterest!2.  Food will last frozen in these for up to two weeks. That's 42 semi-circles or 3 meals a day for younger babies.3.  Food does stick and can be difficult to get out, so you have to run it under warm water.
