I didn't find this to be too useful for me. I tried it with my son when he was about 18 months, when he was just learning to sip water. I was looking for something to help him drink water bottles, but we found the opening on this too small. So I cut the opening a little wider, which worked, but I didn't like that I had to keep track of the cap because the silicone made everything stick to it, so it ended up being more trouble than it was worth. To keep it clean in my purse, I had to keep it covered with a cap, and then put all the caps in a small plastic bag. Anyway, I ended up finding that the water brand Smartwater sold some of their bottles with caps that were perfect for my use, small enough hole so my son didn't choke on the water, has a cap that attaches to the spout, and is very lightweight (much lighter than this option). So, I ended up carrying a couple of those in my purse and just bought and/or carried around Smartwater bottles until my son figured out how to drink from a bottle.
