I bought this before our baby was born just because we could fit it with our bed. Luckily for our little queen bed its level was just at the right height for Mom to easily get to the child. For a normal King size bed with box spring this bassinet is wayyyy down.Also it is a pain to "disassemble". There are two joints in every horizontal "pipe". Although there are buttons that are supposed to make them loose. But typically one joint would get loose but other won't. I was relocating and I decided to took this bassinet with me for the baby during our stay in the hotel. It was a real struggle to get it to "disassemble".You can get cheaper "pack n play" that would be a lot more convenient than this.
