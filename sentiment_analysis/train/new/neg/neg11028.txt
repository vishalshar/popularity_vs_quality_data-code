So, my 2 1/2 year old loves the boombox.  She keeps trying to take off the figures, though, and that makes me, as a parent frustrated.  So I am going to take the advice of some of the reviewers and unscrew the figures.So, 3 stars because my kid LOVES it, but gets upset when she can't play with the figures.  3 stars because it is VERY loud with no option to turn down the volume.Editing my original:  Within 20 seconds of reviewing, the glue for the cardboard backdrop failed.  It looks old and crusty, and was just waiting to fall off.  2 stars now
