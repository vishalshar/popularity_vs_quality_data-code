Do NOT buy this item if you value your child's safety.  We purchased this item from Armitage Direct, to be used with a Combi Shuttle infant car seat.  They advertised that the Flash EX and the Shuttle car seat were compatible.  They were not.  The seat simply sits on the frame, only held on by a thin strap.  Nowhere does it lock.  With this model of seat, there isn't even a notch for it to stay in place.  It's much like putting your car seat on top of a wheeled table and rolling it around, and about that safe.We contacted Armitage Direct (who runs [...]) to return it, and were told that the seat and frame were compatible and that it was our mistake, despite the fact that the Flash EX lists compatible seats in its owner's manual and the Flash EX is NOT listed.  We got nothing but the runaround from them.  Despite that, there's no way I'm putting my child in this.  I'll be purchasing the Graco Snugride and the Graco Snugrider frame.  Those actually fit together safely.Short version: do NOT buy this frame if you value your child's safety, and do NOT buy from combistrollers.com if you value customer service.
