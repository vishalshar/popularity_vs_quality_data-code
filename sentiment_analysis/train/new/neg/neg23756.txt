I'm not too sure how accurate this scale is, but it has helped keep a close record of my baby's growth. I love that I can keep track of my baby's growth instead of relying on some doctor. It's just one more thing that empowers parents in their quest to raise healthy, beautiful children. I like that it plays musi as well. It helps keep my baby calm while on the scale. For the price, it's pretty good. There might be others that are better though with accuracy and would last into toddlerhood. Also, I may have just misplaced it, but I can't seem to find the measuring tape, and my husband doesn't seem to recall there being one. It's quite possible we both just have baby brain!
