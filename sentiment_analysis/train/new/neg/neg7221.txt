We went from a single chicco cortina stroller to the britax b-agile double stroller. Having a tray in the stroller was a necessity so we bought 2 of the double stoller. I feel like we were spoiled with the size of the chicco tray. The actually tray space when you have a cup in the holder is minimal. The cup holder is great though. It's deep and holds a sippy cup great. Because of the way the tray was designed when you pull out the cup your snack items can fall into the cup holder. This is annoying because the space to put snacks is so small, you'll typically always be fishing out some goody from the cup holder you so can put the cup back in.The tray it's self sits pretty far forward. I've notice that when I have my 2 year old strapped in with the 5 point harness she has to really stretch to reach the tray because of how reclined the most upright setting is for her seat.None of these things were a deal breaker because I'd rather have a tray especially with a cup holder then not have one at all.
