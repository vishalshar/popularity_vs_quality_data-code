I have used this cover on one trip. It was very helpful, and easy to use. The whole side opens up so that the stroller can fit in quickly, and the bag has wheels for easy moving. The only bad thing about this cover is that when using the wheels to move the stroller the cover drags on the ground and it wore a hole in it. I was very disappointed that it was so fragile. I only used it on it's wheels for maybe 100 feet and it already has a fairly large hole in it.
