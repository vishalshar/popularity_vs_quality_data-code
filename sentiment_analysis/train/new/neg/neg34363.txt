Several parts for the dresser arrived scuffed/damaged, but the manufacturer was pretty good about replacing the parts.  Luckily it was only parts for one of the drawers so we were still able to assemble the rest of the dresser.  We're still waiting for the replacement parts to arrive, so hopefully they come in good shape and we can finish assembling.  The dresser matches very well with other Delta dark cherry furniture (we also have the Delta Canton 4-in-1 convertible crib).  The dresser isn't as sturdy/beefy as we had expected.  Overall good value, but expected better quality.
