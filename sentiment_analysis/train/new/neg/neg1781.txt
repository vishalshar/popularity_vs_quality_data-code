I ordered this set of plates because they are truly great plates. My son's school uses them daily at snack time and I volunteer to help with the kids sometimes and have been able to see these plates in action. BUT while the plates are great and I knew what I was getting, the description of what the buyer may possibly receive is NOT accurate. I received two plates, one red and one green. I don't mind the colors, but that color combination is not one mentioned above. Also, each compartment has a cutesy picture in it on each plate. I'm not much for cutesy pictures and would have much preferred the colored dots as they are pictured. It is what it is and it's not worth the effort to return the plates. I would have just liked to have received what I thought I was initially purchasing.
