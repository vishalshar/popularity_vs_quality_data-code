Good durability. Has lasted my for years. My review is after years of use. Too pricey for a bunch of steel tubes wleded togther and painted. Just goes to show like the other Kidco product I bought, at the right time even the flimsiest of marketing info makes you let go of your senses (good luck controlling that of yours and your spouses at the same time) due to the hormones coursing thru your blood stream. If you are buying this at the time your kid is baby, try to evaluate "true" value gained and compare. (Agian good luck with that) The bay doesnot care how the product looks any ways and think of it as hindrance it has chew thru and pull at as you see.
