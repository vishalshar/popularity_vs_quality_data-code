Half of our newborn stash were prefolds. I had a dozen of these and a dozen NB size Green Mountain Diaper prefolds. When we have a second child I plan to invest in more of the GMD and maybe skip these.We did get a lot of use out of them. They absorb great and wash good but the fit is a little weird. My baby was 8.6 at birth and we started using these right away. There was a lot of excess that had to be folded down. That's not really a big deal, but it made for a bulky diaper. The thing I didn't like was that by the time they didn't need to be folded down anymore they would not reach around his waist. They really should be a little wider and shorter.That being said I do still use them today for stuffing pockets, burp cloths, and protecting the floor during diaper free time. So they were worth the money, but I'd skip them if you plan to snappi them under a cover.
