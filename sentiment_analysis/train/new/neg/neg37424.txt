I was expecting more for the money.  The sheets and pillowcase are not soft at all. You want soft especially for a toddler.I had to update my review and include a warning.  I washed the banket a second time and found that it was shedding all over the other clothes and my washing machine. I tried to get as much of the fuzz and fluff off, but when my grandson got up the next morning, he was covered with it.  The last thing you want is your little one getting all of that in their noses and lungs.  This is a dangerous blanket for children.
