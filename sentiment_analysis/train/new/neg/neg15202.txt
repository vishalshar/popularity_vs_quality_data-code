This product is described as good for small frames.  I am 5'2'' and 110 pounds, this was too wide for my shoulders.  On top of that the way the weight is distributed hurt my shoulders.  I returned this product and found the Becco Gemini a much more comfortable carrier.Pros- purse strap snap and cell phone pocketCons- Painful
