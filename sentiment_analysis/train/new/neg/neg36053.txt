I bought this extra camera along with the monitor and the camera that comes with it. The image is grainy and of poor quality. Both cameras and one of the adaptors broke within 9 months of using them. If there are so many defects with a product in such a short time, it is not random any more. It is poor quality. I wished I could go back in time and buy another brand.
