I bought this for my second child b/c I was too fat for my other fitted sling.  He was in that first 2 months period where they just want to be held all of the time and my arms needed a break.  When I got the sling, I was quite pleased with how pretty the pattern was (the floral dark brown/white pattern.  But, when I tried to put my son in it, he ended up being swallowed up in the pocket and I didn't feel like I could get it to fit me right.  There's no way I'd leave my baby in there for fear of suffocation (plus, he didn't like the feeling of being in there, anyway).  I should have returned it right away b/c my son is now 4 months old and I've never once used it.  I much prefer the wrap style carriers for the really new babies and then the stiffer front carrier for the rest of the time.
