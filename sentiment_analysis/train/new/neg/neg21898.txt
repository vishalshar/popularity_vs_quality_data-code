This is a piece of crap... grab a fork and you'll have better luck mashing food up for baby. I'm so disappointed; I had the same thing from when my brother and I were young (in the 70s) and it would grind up ANYTHING... it was amazing - I could grind up whatever we were eating so baby could enjoy it with us (salads, chipotle burritos, chili, you name it!). I used it all the time. Sadly, the round metal piece got stuck in our garbage disposal and came out in two pieces. This appears to be the same thing, but the quality is just not there anymore. I struggled grinding up boiled broccoli... and the little blue knob handle at the end broke off from the stress. Complete waste of money.
