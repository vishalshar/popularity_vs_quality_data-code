I would give this one star except that it is a well-built sturdy product, which seems rare in the babyproofing product world.The major problem with this is that the button that unlatches the doors is not only too easy to press (very little pressure required), but also is made out of a ultra-shiny chrome silver plastic that drew my 9-month old's attention right away (not easy to see in the photo here). Instantly, he was touching the outlet that he had previously ignored (when it had standard caps on it). I imagine that as he gets a little older and watches me open the outlet a few times, he'd have a great time pressing the shiny button to see what's underneath.One of the key ingredients to babyproofing is stealth, and this big colorful shiny piece of plastic hanging on your wall inches from the floor will not escape unnoticed by your little ones.
