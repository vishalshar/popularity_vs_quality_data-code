We bought this to hang our Maclaren Twin Triumph stroller.Upside: Good quality materials and sturdy enough to hold our stroller, which is a beast for an umbrella-style stroller at 30 lbs.Downside: the hooks move to allow you to adjust the size of the hook for your stroller and while they have ridges to ostensibly hold the hooks where you like them, in practice if they're even barely touched, they move. The result was as I lifted my stroller to hang it every time a part of the stroller touched it, the hook would move. It made it quite the frustrating game to get the stroller hung. If your stroller is on the heavy side and you're a petite mom, this might not be the solution for you. Also, the stroller stuck out far too much to be useful. We were hanging it on the back of our coat closet at the front of our apartment and when hung, it was far too obtrusive to work. Granted, we're in a small apartment so we have to walk by the closet frequently, but I think we're the target market. If we had a mud room or basement or lots of storage space, I wouldn't need to be hanging our stroller on doors, right? I was also concerned that given the stroller winds up about head height for my toddler, it might be possible for her to mess with it and it fall on her. It never did, it just looked like it could.In the end, we decided it wasn't worth it and returned it. But I think with the right door in the right place, this could be a lifesaver. I wish we had that as my stroller is now on my floor. Sigh.
