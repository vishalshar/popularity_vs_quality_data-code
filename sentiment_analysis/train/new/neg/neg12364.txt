After trying and hating the snap n go and the McClaren version of the SNG (I didn't like the fold mechanisms on either), I decided to get the stroller I really wanted and worry about the carseat fit later. After reading the reviews here  I figured it would be pretty easy to get the carseat to snap in by following the other reviewers tips. Even with their tips it took me about an hour of messing with it before I finally got it set right. The adapter needs to come with better instructions/be easier to use right out of the box. Now that its set up properly, I'm like it, but it was frustrating to get it set.
