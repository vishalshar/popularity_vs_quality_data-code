Before I had my first baby I thought I will need some place to put my baby to sleep and change his diaper at living room but now when is my baby 3 months old I see I wasted my money on this. This is very expensive bed and now I realize I really don't need all these features and I think no one really does. I thought that removable diaper changer is awesome and that I will need it. But guess what, I never ever had to remove it because it is just useless, why I would need to do it anyway. I just go and change diaper on it. Its better to buy one of these changing travel pads if you need to go on vacation and take it with you because that pad cost only 10 dollars..Another thing is travel bed. I thought I will remove it sometimes and put it next to me on couch or somewhere but guess what, I never did that. Once you put baby in you can't remove it because it doesn't hold together. It is actually pretty hard to put it out even without the baby inside so that s why I never do that anyway. I thought it will be useful once my baby gets mobile and start crawl but at 3 months my is baby already almost same long as the travel bed. So I guess in next 2 months my baby will be too long for the bed and he will not be able to sleep in it.And when I look on the last feature to use it like cage when the baby will play around it looks very small to put baby in, he will be able to fit in but it is just feels wrong to leave baby in such a small space to play.So in the end I would better to buy one of these much cheaper versions where is only long bed and some cheap diaper changer on the top. Because in that my baby could at least sleep more months. And btw my baby is average tall so don't think my baby is too tall or something like that. I think no one need this kind of "smart station" because it is all pretty much useless and I'm pretty mad that it has been too long to return this useless thing...Save your money and buy cheaper version...
