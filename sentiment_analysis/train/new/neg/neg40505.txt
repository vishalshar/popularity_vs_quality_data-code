Alright alright, I agree with cheap looking etc. comments. Very thin layer of fabric, not a fabulous organizer and small pieces are really small probably hardly useful. But I mean it indeed IS cheap. And there is no misleading product information. There is nothing to fool the consumer. The color that I ordered is exactly how it appears on pictures. I machine washed (and hang dry) all parts before any use. Color still is brilliant. No loose stitches, no zipper issue so far. I am pretty OK with the product. I was not expecting the function or stylishness of a $100 bag. It satisfies and goes a bit beyond my expectations for $20. Deserves 4star.OK, update after using a couple times: zipper of the big bag died :( Changed my rating to 1 star, because now is became garbage without even really using it! I am glad that return window is still open.
