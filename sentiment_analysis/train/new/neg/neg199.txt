The timer does not always go off. Also I have to set it a little more than 2 min. for a bottle because the steamer shuts off before it gets to zero. The water reservoir bubbles water out of too much water drains from the reservoir to the steamer when you turn it on. Overall I wish I went with another one. The best part about it is the cooler so I don't have to run down to the kitchen at night to store milk.
