My son is mildly autistic. He finds comfort in vibrating things. He really likes to hug this bear to comfort himself. It is soft and very cute. I would have given it a higher review if it were not for two major flaws. It goes through batteries really quick even on the timed setting. It needs a very small screwdriver to open the case and even with the right screwdriver the screws stick. We have to change the batteries often so this is a pain. The heartbeat function is barely perceptible. I cannot return though, because once my son likes something he has to have it!
