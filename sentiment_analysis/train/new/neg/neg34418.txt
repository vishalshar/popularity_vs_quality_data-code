This sheet did not fit our standard size mattress very well. We had to really stretch it to get it to fit over every corner and even then, it was very close to coming off. I don't like the idea of it possibly coming up into the crib with my baby at night, so we have chosen not to even use it. I ended up getting another good quality sheet from Babies 'R' Us
