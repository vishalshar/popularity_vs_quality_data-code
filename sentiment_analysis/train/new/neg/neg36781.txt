I'm very disappointed that I did not receive the blanket pictured. I was so excited to find the same blanket that my toddler can't live without and ordered a second one for backup. But when it arrived, it was a blanket with just the monkey faces and polka dots. Returned it. It was a very soft blanket, but not what was pictured and I would still like to have the one I ordered (the one pictured).
