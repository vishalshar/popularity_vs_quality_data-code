It was very cute. I was looking for some thing for my oldest son's hand and foot prints seeing as his father never let me frame them and this matched his crib set he had 17 years ago! I was a bit disappointed with the construction of the frame it's just pressed paper, the ones I have for his younger siblings are ceramic. But I was just more happy with the fact that I had found his crib design after all these years. It does look great on the wall.
