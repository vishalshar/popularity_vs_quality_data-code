My 3 month daughter loves the Nuk pacifiers, so I thought we'd give the bottles a try after she suddenly started refusing to eat from her Como Tomo bottle (which she used to love).The nipple on this is definitely not slow flow as described. I tipped the bottle over and milk dripped out quite quickly - thus may explain why my daughter screamed bloody murder and was coughing from the fast flow.I've ordered Nuk slow flow nipples to see if those will work. Otherwise these are going in the "maybe use when she's older" pile. Sigh.
