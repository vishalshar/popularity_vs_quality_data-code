Pretty crappy bottles. My mOther- in- law bought these and she's forever just going for the cheapest stuff she can find.  These nipples leak and get crud built up in that vent so you gotta wash it really well. If you miss something, black stuff starts growing on the inside of the silicone and you'll drive yourself crazy trying to get the spots to wash out. The numbers rub off on the outside over time. I etched a mark with a knife on the side to mark 6 oz to remedy this. I don't think much of these bottles but the ones I'd been using before are discontinued and I was tired of watching all the parts too. Also be careful because the caps sometimes are so tough to get off that the whole top will come off and you'll douse your baby in the face with formula. But these will work for the few short months I have left until my 9 month old us completely in solids. Glad when I can toss them in the trash.
