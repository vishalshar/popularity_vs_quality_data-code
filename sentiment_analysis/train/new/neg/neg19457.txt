You might say that it was discontinued for a reason, but you would be wrong - it was most likely discontinued for MANY reasons.  Good price, but not a good value.  Worst complaint is that it doesn't steer right.  I followed the directions, but maybe still assembled wrong.  Front wheels don't work together, making for a rather unpleasant pushing experience.  Also the canopy doesn't stay put.  The clips that are supposed to hold it to the frame don't hold, and it is forever attached only on one side.  Not a good look.  Cargo bags were missing from package (Manufacturer's Customer Service promptly send replacements).  Foam on handles is sliding down.  The bottom is starting to wear out - it is too low-hanging, and drags on ground.  The cupholder must have broken off somewhere along the line (it was too small anyway).  But my son loves the Jeep theme, so we're still using it.
