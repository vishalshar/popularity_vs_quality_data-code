I ended up returning this seat after 2 weeks of trying. It is made for '1st born baby' only. If one has active toddlers or older kids in the house, this seat is not safe for the baby. The hanging toy is heavy and stays loose, it would fall of with slight touch, which is not very child safe. The seat has great looks but that's it. The product has no use for kids older than 4 months. I found conventional rocking chairs more worthwhile and long lasting. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
