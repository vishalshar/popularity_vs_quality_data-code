I orginally bought this outfit in October and it had a two-fold purpose: 1) Child's pirate themed birthday party, and of course 2) Halloween.  Well my daughter wore it for the birthday party and she looked absolutely adorable.  It was a beautiful fit and had some very cute details.  After running around outside and playing of course it was a little soiled and had to be washed before it's next use.  I washed this is a laundry bag in cold water and on the delicate cycle.  After getting it out of the washer the ribbon that criscrossed the bodice had completely come apart from the seems and unraveled leaving it completely unfixable for subsequent use.  I ended up having to buy another costume for Halloween and trashing this one.  If you are okay with a one and done outfit then this is for you because like I said it really is adorable, but if you need it for multiple use or you want your child to be able to play dress up in it, this probably isn't your outfit.
