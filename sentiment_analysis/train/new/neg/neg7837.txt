I have three of the size small. It worked great and needed to upgrade to a large for my growing baby.  The product features said "Leg pouch opens for easy diaper changes." This is not true.  There is a pocket which the babies legs go into and then the flaps wrap around the arms.  There is no opening on the leg pouch other then a small 2" slit in the back which I have not figured out the purpose for.
