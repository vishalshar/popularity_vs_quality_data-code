Pros: -adorable design-does not come undone at the neck when baby pulls on the bib like the Baby Bjorn bibs do.-easy enough to washCons: -The material is extremely flexible/floppy and not stiff like the Baby Bjorn Bibs. This means baby just wadded the bib up into a ball like a cloth bib and chomped on it like a teething toy. I think he liked the texture. He frantically shoved the whole thing at his mouth often, and teh food he was eating ended up smeared over both sides of the bib and his shirt below. Had he spilled anything into the "scoop" part of this bib, it would have been sloshed out with the grabbing often. By the end of the meal, he had managed to turn the scoop part completely inside out easily.-Because the material is floppy, if it folds just right under the chin when baby brings its arms together, it creates a sort of ramp below the chin for any food to simply fly off without even coming near the scoop. The lip of the scoop flops inward to touch the bib pretty closely so the "opening" of the scoop is small as well. An easy target for food to miss.I wish I could combine the neck hole and buttons of this bib with the firm scoop at the bottom of the Baby Bjorn bib. We will see how this one holds up when baby gets past the "grabby stage"
