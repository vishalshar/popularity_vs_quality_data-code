I like the design of this pouch and the size.  I use it as a small purse.  The problem is the quality of the pouch.  The velcro on the back of the pouch started coming off after about a month of using it.  Then the strap fell apart too.  I found another Ergobaby pouch on sale at a local store, so I bought that one.  After a few months of using the new one the zipper on the pocket inside the pouch broke!  The quality is not very good.  If you get it cheap and don't mind fixing it a few times, it is actually a nice little bag.
