This stroller fits as a nice double stroller but it has some drawbacks -1. it is very difficult to close - the hook for closure keeps coming off and does not remain locked.2. The back seat is really tiny and my 2 year old keeps slipping from it.3. the front seat handle (which is non-removable) makes it difficult to make the child sit on his own.4. Some of the airlines do not allow.
