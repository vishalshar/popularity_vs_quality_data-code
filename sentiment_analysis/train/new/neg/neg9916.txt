had such big hopes for this one. sigh...our son is walking and we don't need to carry around so much stuff, we decided to get a lighter, easy-folding, and compact stroller.we narrowed it down to this one and uppababy g-luxe. we really liked how small pliko is when folded, so we went with the green color.build: flimsy at best. creeks. screams weak plastic! not all plastic material, but feels like it is. we have been using bugaboo cameleon3. big difference between the two. of course it's unfair to compare them, but still... if pliko were to be as sturdy as the cameleon, i would guess pliko would be twice as heavy.maneuvering: good movement. easy to steer.seat recline: demo unit we tried was much easier and smoother to recline and pull back up. seat gets stuck on notches and difficult to recline. seat sides/flaps are wider, so catches when pulling back up. i'm hoping its the case since its new. after some use, hoping to be a smoother process.folding/un-fold: folding is super easy. hand squeezes and a pull. that's it. as someone already mentioned, front wheels must be in right place for it to stand by itself. wish it was designed better to have wheels be in place automatically when folded. unfold is just as easy. however, must always remember to snap the side frames. sometimes, it just doesn't latch.so far, just tolerable. couldn't find another stroller that's so compact when folded, stands on its own, reclines, and light weight.priced at $250, i feel it's over-priced. i thought >$1000 cameleon was over-priced. this one is more so.sticking with this one for now, until we find a better option.
