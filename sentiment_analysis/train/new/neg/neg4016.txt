When you have a baby taking a bottle, time is the most precious thing. Infants can go from zero to hysteria-milk-hangry in two seconds. Despite the high reviews, cute design, and apparent efficiency of this product, after a few tries both my husband and I opted out of this product.The major issues were that it created hotspots on a few models of bottle (including Medela and Platex), where (depending on which bottle) it would get really hot on the actual plastic and overheat the milk if it wasn't carefully monitored. I'm not some breastmilk elist or anything, but the whole point of going to the trouble to pump and express milk is to give babies the antibodies and helpful properties that are broken down in excessive heat. I just wasn't comfortable worrying that part of my milk milk be getting scorched in this little contraption (though I kept it for months because it was so cute!).We found heating our pumped bottles of breastmilk in mugs of warm/hot water or in a pinch just running a bottle under hot/warm water was a lot more efficient than trying to wait for this to heat up.
