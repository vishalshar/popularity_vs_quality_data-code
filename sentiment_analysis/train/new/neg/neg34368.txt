We bought this toy for our 8 month old daughter for Christmas.  She loved watching the balls go around and it was neat that she could turn it on by herself with the big red button.  She played with it for a couple of days -- nothing rough either -- and on the third day the wheels stopped spinning so the balls could not roll around.  I tried everything to fix it but ended up calling Fisher Price who were nice on the phone and are sending a voucher to get a new one.I'm hoping we just got a defective one because our daughter really enjoys this toy when it works properly.  It still plays music but she is not interested in it at all when it doesn't spin.
