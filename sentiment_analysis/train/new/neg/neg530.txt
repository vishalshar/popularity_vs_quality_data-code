Maybe I misunderstood all the great reviews for it being "non spilling" or "non leaking" but this is basically just a sippy cup--if it falls on the ground it leaks/spills.  There is no leakage around the neck or anything but I was thinking it would not run from the spout so freely like it does.  My grandson loves them, they are easy to hold but other that that, I'll keep shopping!
