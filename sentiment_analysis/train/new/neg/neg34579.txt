we purchased this stroller for our two kids that are 13 month apart.  We chose this one maily because our carseat fit with it and it had a tray on each side.  The wheels do shake if they are not locked.  Most double strollers are large, but this one takes up teh majority of the room in our explorer (third row folded down).  I have had the stroller since christmas, but havent had much chance to use it until the recently because of cold/windy/rainy weather and it already has a flat tire.  I have the single baby trend stroller and I have never had an issue with it.  This one seems to be causing us trouble.  I am disappointed that we have to deal with a flat tire and of course it is one day before a trip that we need to take it one... what a pain!
