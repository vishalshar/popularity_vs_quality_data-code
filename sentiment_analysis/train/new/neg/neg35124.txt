My daughter (almost three) LOVES this thing.  She will pee on it literally every 5 minutes, squeezing out the tiniest drops just to make it sing.  Which is awesome, if you don't mind dumping, rinsing, and drying it out all the time.  I don't mind; anything to get her toilet trained for preschool.A couple of things: you HAVE to dry it out after each use or it will just. keep. singing.It will also, randomly, start singing at, say, 3am.  At top volume (since there's only one volume).  And if this thing is in the bathroom by your bedroom, for example, you might begin to become hostile toward your daughter's special potty friend.So it works, as far as getting my kid to want to use the potty instead of her drawers.  But I can't give it more than 3 stars because the thing drives me nuts.
