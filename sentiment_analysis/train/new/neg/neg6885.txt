This doesn't work well for any food pouches with the thin "wings" tops, such as the GoGo pouches GoGo Squeez appleapple, Applesauce on the Go, 3.2-oz. Pouches, Count of 48 Since we buy mostly that type this organizer doesn't work for us. This does work perfectly with the Buddy Fruit pouches Buddy Fruits Pure Blended Fruit To Go, Multifruit and Apple, 3.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 18) & any other we have used with round tops.
