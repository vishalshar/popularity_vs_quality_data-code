not to happy with this product  the motor sound part broke after 19 days  for it being $43 i think thats ridiculous  it is a pretty mobile but come on  i did just contact the seller right now so we will see  i will put up new info asapthey sent me a new one very quickly  but when i set it up that one was broken too  so now there sending me another one  i must say still a little upset  my son is already a month old and only got to use it for 19 days
