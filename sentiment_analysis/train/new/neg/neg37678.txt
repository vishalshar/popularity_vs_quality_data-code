This is  really by any means a "mattress." Mine does not look like the picture on the sides of it. It's more of a pad, like a bigger sized flat changing pad that comes with some cribs. Not what I'd expect as a mattress for my baby to sleep on. Nothing resembling any sort of crib mattress.There's a gap if you leave the original Pack N Play mat in. It doesn't fill the whole bottom without it, but doesn't seem to pose a danger like with the mat in. Safe to say I'm disappointed.
