This is not a true one-size diaper because there is no way to adjust the leg hole openings to be smaller for younger babies.  My two month old is able to fit into all of his other one size diapers (which are a variety of brands including Fuzzibunz, Bum Genius, Oh Katy, Sweet Pea & Charlie Banana) but these may not fit well until he is a year old because of the leg opening non-adjustment issue.  Which means I will probably end up buying more of the other brands to make up for it.Update: My son is now 22 months old.  I was able to start using these when he was 14 months old and so far I haven't had any problems with them.  They only come with one insert and he needs them double stuffed so I have only been using 3 of them (have an extra liner from another diaper).  One of the two extra liners I used as a cloth swim diaper over the summer a few times.  Because of them not having any issues since starting using them I've upped my rating on these from 2 stars to 3.
