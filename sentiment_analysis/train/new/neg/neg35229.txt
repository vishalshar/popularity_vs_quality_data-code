As a mother of 6 I have had a lot of pushchairs, none of these have been as expensive and disappointing as the quinny buzz.  In my opinion, the quinny buzz is the biggest waste of money ever. To start with can I just say its a great looking pushchair. Its just so unreliable. I have used this pram for 5 months now and had nothing but problems.  After 3 weeks of use the back tyre popped, I had to get it fixed and it popped again. Both back tyres took turns to pop for the next few weeks  until I replaced them with expensive off road tyres.  Also the brake does not work! I have tried for months but its so stiff. You think you have managed to put it on and then the pram rolls. Very dangerous! The shopping basket is too close to the front tyre so now the shopping basket has a friction hole in it from rubbing on the tyre. (The basket is useless anyway it doesnt hold anything.)  The 2 back tyres are very wide and I struggle getting in some doorways.  The pram is so fiddly to get down. Impossible to hold your baby and collapse the pram. You have to take the whole (bulky) seat unit off then push one circle while twisting the other then pull towards yourself. Its a two hand job whilst trying to stop the pram from rolling all over the place. Nothing like the simple one hand fold prams I've had in the past.  Its such a big bulky pram and its only good to look at. Very good looking pram but an absolute nightmare to use!
