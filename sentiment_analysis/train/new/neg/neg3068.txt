Very dissapointed. We were using the Hard Spout version of this cup for my 16month old but the pediatrician recommended we switch to a straw cup. I went with these because we love the hard spout version. They are easy to clean and very rarely leak and even then only a few drops. The straw version however isn't working out. They are easy to clean and assemble which I was happy with, and the sliding cover is nice however the suction created when closing is very strong -much more than our previous Playtex cups-and pulls liquid up the straw. It shoots out every time you close it. Also, the valve in these has 2 crossing slits instead of just one like the spout cups. This means it lets more liquid through. Combine with so much suction and you get a cup that leaks everywhere! I expected any liquid left above the valve in the straw to leak out but the suction is so strong that the valve is always partially open and so liquid pours out anytime the cup is not totally upright.
