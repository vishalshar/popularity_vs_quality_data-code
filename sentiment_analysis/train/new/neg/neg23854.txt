I'm torn on this JJ Cole bib - it's cute and provides good coverage to catch food, but it's a real pain to clean! I wash it out after every meal and throw it in with the laundry, but it still stays gross looking. It takes awhile to dry after it's been washed, so if you plan on using it for every meal, plan on it staying wet all the time and mold eventually accumulating. Yep, you heard me right, MOLD! So gross! Also, the bib is cute, but gets faded very quickly.I wouldn't purchase this again. Instead, go for something that is harder plastic that the water will just wick away from and that you can throw in the dishwasher with your dishes every night rather than feel like you have to scrub it hard to get all of the food off.
