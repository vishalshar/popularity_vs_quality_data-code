This is a great product, conceptually, particularly when you have a toddler (as I do) who is prone to running ahead; however, I just don't believe the handle is long enough to promote its actual usage for a toddler who is prone to running ahead.  Although he grasps the concept (Hold on to the handle; stay by me), that doesn't mean he is going to actually DO it.  I think that if the handle were a bit longer, allowing him to walk at a bit more of a distance, he would be more likely to comply and hold it.  As it is, I can't get him to hold it for very long (as he wants to "lead" the way).  Nevertheless, if you have a toddler who IS compliant with walking along side you, it would be a great tool to ensure your child is safely by you when you don't have a hand to hold theirs.
