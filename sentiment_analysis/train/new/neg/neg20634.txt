Although I really loved so much about this mobile, I had to return it because of the motor noise. The noise wasn't an even type of "white noise", but it became louder when the mobile rotated to a certain spot, each and every time.  When the volume of the music was turned down to the 2 lowest settings, the motor noise would overwhelm the music so it couldn't be heard.The melodies on the mobile are really lovely...exactly what I wanted.  And the little figures are very cute, with the bellies that light up.  It was easy to assemble, with very clear instructions, and fit securely on the crib.  But because of the uneven motor noise, I couldn't keep this mobile.
