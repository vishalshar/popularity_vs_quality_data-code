Not sure what all of the stars are about. Cute and good sized bottle, perfect for lunch sized drinks. Easy to take the cap on and off (it's a twist type), however the cap that attaches/detaches at the top is terrible. It doesn't secure and pops off easily, which is pretty darn useless. My solution is to use a rubberband to secure it... not the greatest fix.On another note, the company fixed the sticky label issue, probably after reading all of the other reviews here. It was easy as pie to remove.Highly do not recommend.
