As soon as I set this seat up and tried it out with my daughter I decided to take it back.  The tray is difficult, time-consuming, and possibly hazardous to attach.  You have to move it back and forth a little to find the right slots and then you have to press down REALLY hard.  It took me multiple attempts.  I had visions of fingers slipping underneath and getting pinched while I was trying to put the tray on (this didn't happen, but it made me uneasy).  I can't see doing this three times a day with an impatient, hungry toddler.Another thing I didn't like is that the waist belt straps are very tight.  The harness straps may not fit an older/larger child.  We have higher than standard dining chairs, so we need to use 3-point safety straps for a while longer, even though our daughter is 17 months old.  She is small for her age (still in 12-month pants), but the waist straps barely close around her waist to buckle.  The straps come out of the middle of the seat back instead of at the sides, so they don't reach as far around as other seat straps of the same length.  There should be excess length to compensate for their location on the seat back.  Design flaw in my opinion.  No room for growing toddlers or extra big babies.The removable top tray is a nice idea but it doesn't snap very tightly into place, so an older baby or toddler can whip it right off, along with any food on top of it.I give this booster one star for the rubber grips on the bottom that keep it from sliding around much on the chair seat.  Nice design feature and the reason I chose this chair over others in the first place.  It does seem to be pretty secure on the chair seat.  It also looks easy to clean.If you just need the extra height of this seat and don't ever need a tray or safety harness around the child, then this seat would probably be fine for you.  Otherwise, buy a different booster seat.
