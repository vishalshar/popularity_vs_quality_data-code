I believe I reviewed this product on Amazon, maybe for another shell set/color.  We loved the idea of an AI2, because really, it seems more green than an AI1 when you aren't constantly going through outer shells.  At first, these worked great.  They fit fine (yes, the extra insert seemed a bit long at first) but it was absorbent and kept everything in.  We were thrilled.  We only used Rockin Green laundry detergent or Charlie Soap and are always careful about tucking in the Velcro before washing and drying the covers by hand.Well, at 8 months, it all changed.  My daughter's bladder could hold more and after a good pee, the diaper would leak.  I cannot keep her in this diaper for much more than an hour for fear that she will leak everywhere.  I unfortunately recommended this product to a few friends and they are all experiencing the same issue with their babies (all around 1 year of age).  My daughter is now 10 months old and we have to put her in a disposable when we go out for a period of time (2 hours!) and I am extremely disappointed.  It is too bad I only purchased this system.  I do not want to spend money on a different system as she is in daycare most of the day and they don't let us use cloth there anyway.I will probably use it on future babies for the first few months and figure out what to do when they get older.  I would love to say I can go 100% cloth from birth to 35 lbs, but unfortunately, it is not the case with these GroBaby diapers.
