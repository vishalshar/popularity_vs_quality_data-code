My daughter spits up a lot and I read several reviews these were great burp cloths. I don't agree. They just smear the spit up but don't really absorb much. If she spits up a lot, it just runs off these cloths and onto my cloths. The patterns are cute but I rather use a different product for burping.NOT recommended for diapering based on my experience.
