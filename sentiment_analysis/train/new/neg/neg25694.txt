This bag is gorgeous and really spacious. I bought it because I had to try it out and see if it would work for my 5 year old and my newborn.  Too bad I couldnt fit everything I needed inside.  This bag would be great if you have all older kids and you just need to carry snacks and a pull up for quick outings for you youngest.  I could see myself using this in the future but for my newborn and possibly another in the next 2 years this bag wouldnt work for 2 kids still in diapers.  I had to return it and I got the storksak olivia instead.  Best bag ever!
