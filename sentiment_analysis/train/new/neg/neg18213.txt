With a newborn I think everything is trial in error, but I have found these covers to "leak" often.  When they are wet around the legs they seep onto the cloths.  As he gets bigger it happens less, and I'm sure it has to do with the diaper I am using, but I feel the cover should contain more moisture.  I feel it's an alright product for the price.
