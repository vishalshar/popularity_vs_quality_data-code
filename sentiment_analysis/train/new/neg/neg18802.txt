I was disappointed that there was not one of each color with a coordinating lid.  I bought them for my classroom, along with color buttons for a sorting activity (these cups were recommended on a teaching website- I teach Special Needs K-1).  There is a picture in the description that shows each cup with a different lid color, but I saw that each cup had a corresponding lid to match.  When I received the item, it was all two orange, two red and one yellow cup with 2 blue, 2 green and one yellow lid.  Very disappointed.  I wish there had not been that pic, because I would not have purchased them.
