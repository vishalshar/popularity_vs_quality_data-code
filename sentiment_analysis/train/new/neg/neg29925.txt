I have several One Size (OS) diapers in several different brands and this is by far one of the biggest. Both inserts that come with this diaper are the same size and if you had this diaper on the smallest settings the inserts would be too large to stuff in. The pocket opening to stuff the inserts in to is quite small but the inner fleece fabric does have elastic on it as well which is nice for keeping in messes as well as not having to tuck in any extra fabric in once you put it on your child. When this diaper is being worn the inserts tend to bunch up in the middle of the diaper instead of staying flat like a more narrow insert would. I would give this diaper just an average rating. I like it, but don't love it.***UPDATE***I have had this diaper now for about 2.5 months and the PUL fabric has COMPLETELY delaminated. This diaper isn't in my regular rotation so it doesn't get used a lot and it has never been dried in a dryer, only line dried. I have returned this diaper and will be using my refund to purchase a different brand completely. (Today when I noticed that this had delaminated in the wash I took a peak at the Facebook page for this brand and noticed several of the most recent posts were about the same exact thing)
