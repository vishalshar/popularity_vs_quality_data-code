Sooooo disappointed with this product and the lack of a warranty past one year.  We bought this for our son when he was a newborn.  Very carefully and correctly used it for 1.5 years nightly.  Then, one morning, we realized it had just stopped working.  Contacted the company and they said that, bc it's outside a year, they can't do anything for me (they directed me to their website where I could buy another product).  I didn't spend $100+ on a monitor to use for one kid for 1.5 years... I was investing in this thing (vs. the many $20-30 options) so that it would last for my son and a future, second child.  Now they want me to drop another $100 - what, just to get my son to age 3, and then I can buy another 2 for my next kid?!  No thanks.  Stand by your product.
