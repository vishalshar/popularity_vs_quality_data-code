I was extremely disappointed with these sheets.  I'm pretty sure they claimed to have the velcro strips that attach to the velcro on the co-sleeper, but they do not.  They are so thin that you can see through them and they are rough to the touch, too.  I was really shocked that these are even something you can legally sell as a sheet.  Thats how bad they are.  And of course, I haven't had time to return them, but definitely plan to.
