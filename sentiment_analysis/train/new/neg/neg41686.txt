My child loves these things.  We bought the first one at Toys-r-us and it lasted a year.  The nipple ripped so we bought a second at Amazon which was a better price.  However, the nipple ripped is less than a month.  Thinking that maybe it was defective, I bought a third one and the nipple ripped on this one as well in little over a month.  Don't think they are worth the money because the nipples don't seem to be made of high quality plastic.
