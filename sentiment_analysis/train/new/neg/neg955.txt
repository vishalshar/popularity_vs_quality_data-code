I was pretty shocked at first about the size of the package when it arrived, it was really small, but cute. It came in a little backpack. I had to remind myself it was a toddler bed set and they are supposed to be small.  The set it pretty good quality, but the comforter is quite thin, however I do love the feel of it, it is kind of a microfiber feel. I would recommend it as a summer bed set and I would advise getting a better one for the winter, especially if you live where I do, in Montana.
