Material is really low quality. Actually product looks cheap. Sewing quality is not nice at all. My friend abroad requested me to order it. If it was my order, I would definitely send it back as soon as I received it. I sent it abroad, but my friend didn't like it either. Thus next time I go back, I will bring it back to the USA if I can still return it. It totally doesn't worth $28.
