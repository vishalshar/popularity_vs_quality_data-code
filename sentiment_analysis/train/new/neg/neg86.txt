I bought this toy storage because I'm a big fan of Boon products. I put this up a few months ago using the adhesive and it seemed fine but after being up for a few months on our smooth bathtub tile it fell randomly one day and almost hit my daughter on the head. I followed all of the instructions putting this up and also made sure none of the adhesive strips were on grout lines. It was only holding a handful of plastic tub toys, so I'm not sure what happened. I had the lady bug version of this years ago with the suction cup attachment and it never stayed up well with that either. As I don't want to drill this into my tile I won't be able to use it now - unfortunately the return window has passed and I'm stuck with a $30 tub toy holder I can't use and need to buy something else.
