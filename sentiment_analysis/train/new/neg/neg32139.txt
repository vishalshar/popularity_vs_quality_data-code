These bibs are really cute and I thought they'd be good for my son who just turned one and I felt was still a little small to wear the Baby Bjorn soft bibs. On the plus side, the clasps stay together really well because of the friction of silicone so my son isn't able to pull it off like he can with his other bibs.  On the con side, however, the "lip" of the bib doesn't stay open that well so it doesn't really catch that much food. It's also a little small so perhaps these might be better for like a 6 month old just starting solids. I wish I had tried these earlier. I think I could have gotten more use it out of them when my son was smaller.
