I was very disappointed in this Carter nursery suit.  This is my second baby and since we pretty much did everything simple for the first we wanted to continue with our second.  We did however decide to go with a carter nursery because we used carter clothes so much with my first and have loved the brand.Well this nursery outfit was horrible.  When we got it sent I liked the colors.  So it was time to wash everything and set up the nursery.  The thing practically came apart.  There was so much lint on the bumper etc that I have a very hard time getting it off.  I vacuumed it and lint brushed and still ended up picking some lint off with my fingers.  I thought it was a blanket that I washed with it but it was the bumper shedding.  Then because of the lint cleaning the I noticed that the stitching on the pattern started coming undone.  It made the first wash look like I had used it for generations.  Not to mention even after following the washing directions it shrank!  Hard to put on and the bumper didnt even cover the crib correctly.  Will not be buying another Carter nursery outfit!
