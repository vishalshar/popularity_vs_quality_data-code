First of all the safety guard thingy won't stay still so I can't even use it.  I think it's defective.  I still use it though because the baby likes it, I just have to be right there watching to make sure he doesn't gag himself which surprisingly he hasn't done. I just place it in his hands up near the top so he gets a good hold and only has a short part to put in his mouth.  The toothbrush is too sharp!  He makes a face when I give it to him so I don't even use it.  Upon closer inspection, it sure is sharp!  Not soft at all, not sure why they made it so tough.  I'm a huge green sprouts fan but not of this set, needs some work.  The Noli's look better, think I'll try those next.
