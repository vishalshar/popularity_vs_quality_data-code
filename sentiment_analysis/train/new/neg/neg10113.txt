This is a good product and I really like it. However this isn't really something I Would want to carry around with me. The size of this pad is quite large. I much rather carry a small blanket to put down on the diaper changing station. I keep this product in my car trunk in case I need to change her somewhere without a changing table. All in all, this product was a good price but very bulky.If you found this review helpful, please press the helpful button, thanks!
