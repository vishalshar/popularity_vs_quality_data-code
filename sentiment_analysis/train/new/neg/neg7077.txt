I saw the reviews about the allergy warnings and thought it wouldn't matter. My kid never had allergy issues with milk or eggs. We've been using this toothpaste for awhile and my kid loves it, but tonight she broke out in hives and a rash within an hour of using it. Usually we use colgate but ran out so this week we've used only this.I listed everything she ate or came into contact with and the pediatrician believes it is the toothpaste.
