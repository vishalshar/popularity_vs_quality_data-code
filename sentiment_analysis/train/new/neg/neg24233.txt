This unit is too wide. It sticks out about an 8th of an inch and bumps into my door frame. However, I was able to file down the semi-cheap plastic (with a metal file) to the point where the door BARLEY squeezes shut. So I guess it technically works, not without doing some slight modifications to the design. Blood. Sweat. Tears.It should also be noted that my cat has some how developed the power to open doors. That's what I use this lock for, my cat. It works great on John Lennon (my dumb cat's name) but Camden (my friend's three-year-old) was able to figure out how to unlock it within a matter of seconds! SECONDS! Soooo works great on cats, works horribly on children.Oh wait it doesn't work at all, because it fell off after a few months.
