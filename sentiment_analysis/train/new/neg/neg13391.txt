These are just okay.  I don't think they work as well as some other kinds of patches we have used.  We tried these out since the other kind we liked was out of stock.  Some people complained about the overwhelming smell in their reviews, but these were not very strong compared to the ones we usually use.  I imagine that's why they didn't work very well for us, there wasn't much citronella smell.  These are also stickers that you put on your clothing.  My son's classmates were always messing with the stickers, so we had to try and place them on his clothing where the other kids wouldn't mess with them.  That caused us to have to put them nearly out of site and that probably contribute to them not being as affective.
