I bought this becaus my son is a tummy and side sleeper and it's soooo difficult to find diapers that will keep in his night time output. I thought this would help. Well it didn't seem it fit very well it his body and did not help at all, he still leaked through. I meant to return it, but I think somehow I replaced the item before I sent it back. Oh the life of an easily distractible mother!
