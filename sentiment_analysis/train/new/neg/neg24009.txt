This is the perfect bag for shopping carts. I really love it at the grocery store, especially since I can store diapers and toys in the deep pockets and leave the diaper bag at home. However, I've found it way too big for most restaurant high chairs. It's also huge to be carrying into a restaurant (think medium or large duffle bag). If you are looking for one cover that does double duty, I'd try something else. This one is too expensive to not work absolutely perfectly.
