I am disappointed with this product, as my average to petite sized baby seemed to outgrow the small size immediately, even though she is only 14lbs at present.  I also don't like how the velcro tabs are designed.  You have to be very careful how you close the diaper, or else it will scratch and cut baby's delicate skin on the legs.  Just got a similar Grovia diaper cover and I like it much better.
