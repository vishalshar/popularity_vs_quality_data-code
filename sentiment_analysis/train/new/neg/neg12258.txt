I got this for my 3 month old and I thought it was an adorable rattle when I bought it and was really looking forward to getting it. But when it came it was much smaller then It looked online and the two larger leafs are wooden and seem dangerous to me. I love the shape of the handle, its perfict for little baby hands and the little bird is very cute but its not really a rattle. You have to hold it with one hand and use your other hand to make it clack and if its shaken too hard it hits your hand and hurts. I plan on taking the wooden leafs off when my daughter starts to really play with things so she wont hurt herself but I still over all like it.
