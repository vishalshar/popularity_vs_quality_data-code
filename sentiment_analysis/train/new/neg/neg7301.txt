Our son loves the nature sounds and vibration, and it gets him to sleep quickly.  Plus, we can bounce him in this lightly with a hand or even our foot while we read or watch TV.  However, this thing will eat batteries for breakfast, and the sounds/vibration only last for about 20-30 minutes.  3 C batteries each week, which can be expensive.  Worth it for peace and quiet and a happy baby, but expensive and really big carbon footprint.  Also, it makes it difficult to sleep when the baby sleeps (as all new moms should try to do at least once during the day), because as soon as it stops vibrating and the sounds stop, the baby stirs and wakes.  So it's blissful for about 20 min or so.  Wish this had a plug in option or could last longer than 20 min.
