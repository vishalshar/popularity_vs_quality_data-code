Nuby has changed their design three times in the past 2 years which is annoying. This most recent design has a centered spout and both the straw and the spout are a larger diameter. The oldest design had a single colored lid, next came the 2 color lid that had a rubberized grip strip for easier lid removal (the strip matched the cup color for easy pairing). Both of these designs have interchangeable spouts and straws. This most recent design's grip strip does NOT match the cup, you match the cup to the hard plastic part of the lid. This is annoying to a person that has mild OCD. =/ My son is not a chewer and doesn't destroy things but for some reason he LOVES to bite the crap out of these larger spouts and has now ruined 3. I can't seem to find replacement spouts for this larger center spout design. Brand new sippy cups rendered useless.*UPDATE* I located replacement spouts! buybabydirect.com
