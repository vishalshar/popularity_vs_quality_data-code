It off using the typical cheap pocket diapers, G diapers, and the All in One BG, I absolutely love this BG diaper. It says in the description it is organic but there was no making on the dipper that it was and i later ordered another that said organic on the tag. I love the cotton lining the plastic outer and the attached cotton soaker clothes. I ordered another BG diaper that was titled the same as this one and organic but it didn't have the cotton lining the plastic outer so be clear from the pictures which type you are ordering because BG has several styles in their brand of similar diapers apparently. The other one was listed as BumGenius Elemental All in One Cloth Diaper - Snap - White - One Size https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BYGMM1O/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_awd_R. If it wasn't for ether confusion and disappointment of my second order of what I thought was the same style diaper I would have given 5 stars.*Update* ordered another one a different color (sassy) from this same seller and it was without the inner cotton lining like shown in the pictures and like my originally ordered one was. I don't like these and don't understand why they have the same name as the one I ordered with the lined cotton. I love my original order from a month ago but now this company is making me mad with this confusion! So I knock it from 5 stars to 1.
