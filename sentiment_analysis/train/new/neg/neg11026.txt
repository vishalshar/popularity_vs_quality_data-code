This seat has a nice appearance in terms of crisp, neutral colors. It is lightweight, which will be nice for mom when recovering from a c-section and still rebuilding upper body strength. The fabric, hood, and plastic do not seem to be made of super durable material...but good enough...particularly for the nice price that this seat can be purchased for.
