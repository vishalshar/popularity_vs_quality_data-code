this stroller is great! easy to open, good steering around, sturdy & great suspension system on the wheels. Definitely well worth the price, IF YOU HAVE TWINS!if you have kids of different ages, it gets hard to maneuver the stroller around because the difference in weight on the stroller itself, Besides that I would say this is a keeper.I went for for the tandem instead of this one, because my kids are 2 yrs apart. Baby jogger strollers are pricey but the quality that you get is without comparison.
