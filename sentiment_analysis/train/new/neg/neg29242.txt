I'm not a fan of these pads. They absorb fine (but I do not leak heavily at all) but got really lumpy in the wash and look terrible under clothes.  They are also not very soft and are fairly linty even after a couple of washes and uses.These have gone to the back of my drawer and I don't use them unless I've run out of other pads. And I can't wear them at all to work.
