I purchased this and another set for my twins. It arrived on time, no issues with shipping. Overall the set was as cute as expected and did it's job for the most part. The ties on the crib bumper popped off the moment my daughter learned how to use her hands, so the bumper didn't last long at all. The quilt has been wonderful, the size was perfect for her to drag around and was more plush than the the quilt in the Pink Minky Chenille Roses set. The fitted sheet faded after one wash, but I've been using it on and off for two years now so that must say something about it's durability. I used one of the valences for a couple months, though I couldn't get over how cheap the material looked and took it down. I didn't use the toy bag, the pillow, bib (it was very thin material), but kept the diaper stacker tied to the crib thinking I would use it but never did. I gave away the diaper bag, it looked functional and cute enough like one you could get from Walmart. I would have used it but I had two already. Overall it's nice for a tight budget but don't expect super plush soft fabric or you'll be very disappointed.
