We bought this to replace another brand that stuck on the wall.  I made sure to scrub the bathroom walls really good before trying to placing this in our tub.  When I tried to attach the suction cups to the wall..they wouldn't line up with the tiles.  One side of the Cubby was sitting right on the grout line keeping it from making full contact with the wall.  I found out if I angled the cubby just a bit, it would make full contact with the tiles.  Unfortunately, the suction cups won't stay on the wall at all.  We ended up just leaving the cubby in the tub until the toys are dry and then storing it in the corner of the bathroom because it kept coming unsuctioned and falling off.
