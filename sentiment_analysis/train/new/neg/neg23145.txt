Okay so if you are short on space this is nice becase it fold up so easily but this is such a difficult seat to clean.1. The ridges where the tray clicks into are on the arms of the chair and they get gunk in them all the time. The only way to clean it is with a stiff brush or a toothpick. ANNOYING!2. The padding does not come off and therefore is hard to wash, the straps too. SO if you have a messy baby you have to just take it out and hose it. Not just a simple wipe and clean.3. The top tray comes off BUT because of the tray not having a lip overlapping the bottom tray the food and mush gets under the top tray and you have to take it apart and clean both portions.4. The sides are fabric that do not remove and gets dirty, again the hose comes in handy here.I have resorted to using this tray outside, I wipe it clean and after a couple uses I just hose it off. It was not a bad price but I did end up buying a more expensive and EASIER to clean chair for inside. AIN'T nobody got time to clean a highchair that often and that thoroughly and if you do I am so jealous.
