Loved this at first! It goes over different surfaces as if it really were 4WD! It's cute too. But I have to give it one star because it's so cheaply made. We've had it for about a week, and a wheel already fell off. The screw is so loose that I can't fix it. I would have to use wood glue, which defeats the purpose as it would immobilize it. It's a shame too because I would have ordered other products from this company since they are sustainable and non-toxic, but the quality of this product was so low that I can't risk buying their other products.
