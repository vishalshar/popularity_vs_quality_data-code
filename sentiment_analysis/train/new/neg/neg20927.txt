I LOVE the Halo SleepSacks, but I am so very disappointed that larger sizes are hard to find for my larger baby!! My baby is long for is age and has been since very early on.  He had to stop wearing the swaddling SleepSack when he still needed it simply because Halo did not make one large enough for his bigger body.  And now, during this winter season, I would LOVE to buy him something like this cute Sage Pooh Bear Micro-Fleece SleepSack, but sadly it's again not available in his size!!
