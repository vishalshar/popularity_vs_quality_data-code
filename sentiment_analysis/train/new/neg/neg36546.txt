I purchased this potty seat for my 2 1/2 year old son.  While the quality is excellent, it simply doesn't function as a potty seat for my little boy.  Considering there is no shield for urine, and given the size of the opening, the pee would just go all over the floor and not in the potty at all.  Will have to send this one back and purchase another seat with a shield for little boys.
