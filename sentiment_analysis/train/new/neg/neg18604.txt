I purchased the grow with me activity gym ball pit on October 26th from amazon and I really love the product but there is a major issue with the one I recieved. I'm not sure why/how but the head of the turtle has an opening on the top of the head just big enough to fit my hand in (seemingly intentional). I thought this was very inconvenient, so I went to look at the package and it shows the base of the head with a large opening and the top sewn closed.  I even went back to amazon to look at the Picture and sure enough, it's just like the box but not like what I have.Again I really love the product. It is adorable and I think my children will enjoy it but I will not keep this one because it is very inconvenient/annoying to stick my hand in over and over to pull out one ball at a time.
