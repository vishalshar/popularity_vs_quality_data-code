It's convenient but really not very well insulated. I like to use it to carry around apple sauce pouches and tetrapack milk, which can all be stored at room temperature so I don't use any ice packs for this. I wanted to use an insulated bag so that when we're out and about (like at the zoo) on cold days, the food wouldn't get too cold or if we're out and about on very hot days, the food will be protected from the heat and humidity. Unfortunately, this bag's insulation is very bad--almost as if this bag isn't insulated AT ALL! We were out to a farm last fall and it was 40 degrees out. The apple sauce pouches and milk I kept in this bag got very cold as though they had been refrigerated. If the insulation were better, the food's temperature shouldn't have been affected by the ambient temperature. I now only use this as just another convenient little bag and not to protect food from ambient temperature. I have a different cooler for that that that actually works.
