I purchased this car seat. I received the car set in just couple of days sicne I placed order. This has problems with car seat. First of all product dimensions do not match with what is stated on the web site. Secondly, the box that I received had some labels taken off .. I assume this was due to repackaging. Also taping on the box was in bad shape. Most importantly, based on the information on the web, this product has been recalled. I EXPECT AMAZON not to sell recalled product. Since this product has been shipped by Amazon to me, I am expected to call manufacturer and get this resolved. I absolutely do not feel comfortable using this car seat after reviews on the web. I expect Amazon to take ownership and get this resolved as other people may end up in same situation. The reponse from Amazon was very poor when I asked for total refund including shipping charges.
