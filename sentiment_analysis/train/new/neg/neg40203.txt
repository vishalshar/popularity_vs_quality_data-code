This is like those collapsible shades that are used on car windshields.  It has this wire in there that is springy and wants to collapse.  This first time I put this on I almost hit my daughter in the face with the end of the springy wire.  You have to be extra careful when putting it on, but it's not that easy because the thing wants to slide off as you are putting it on. So with one hand you are making sure it's not sliding off, and with other you're dragging it to the bottom and making sure it sticks there while trying not poke or blind your kid.  I didn't give this one star because once you put it on it stays on and does the job.  But, I'm always concerned because it's streched out all the way and with the springy wire and the elastic I'm afraid that it could whip out and hurt her/
