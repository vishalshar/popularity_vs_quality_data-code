The product itself is great. But beware, if you buy this single bottle and then later buy another one, even if it says 4oz bottle and the exact same description, the bottles may not be exactly the same. This becomes an issue once you use them, wash them and put them back together. The threads on the twist-on parts are not the same and the seals aren't exact for where you want to keep the dry formula. The bottles will leak if you mix the parts together. So my advice, get a few in the same package on the same order, or make sure you are diligent to which pieces go wit each bottle.  If you can make it work, the product is definitely a life saver.
