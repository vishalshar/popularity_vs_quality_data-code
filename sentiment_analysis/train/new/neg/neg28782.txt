This review has nothing to do with the product, but with the seller. I received the sheet in the mail in a general post office box. I was not provided with a tracking number. Upon opening it, the sheet was bunched up, unfolded, in a cellophane bag. I took the sheet out and upon inspection there isn't a single tag on the sheet, as if it's been used before. There was also a small hole where the elastic connects to the fabric that I had to hand stitch. I'm not sure what went wrong, but I'm severely not happy at all with this purchase. This sheet is too expensive to tolerate a bad seller.
