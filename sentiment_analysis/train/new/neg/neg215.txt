Really, Really Disappointed.Bought this problem 1/2012.  Worked great - was happy with the video quality, range, etc.  The battery has been starting to discharge quickly - will no longer last through a nap.  So - you have to keep it plugged in all the time, which is annoying, but livable.However - on/off button just broke.  And - a friend of mine who I had recommended this to - the sound stopped working.My friend called Moto - and they did not seem surprised, sent out a new one - it was still under the year warranty.However for me - since it was passed 1 year, the cust service would not do anything.  After expressing to them that I paid up for this expensive model, only to get poor quality in return, was put on hold while the rep "talked to a supervisor"  or more probably "got a cup of coffee"  there was again nothing they could do.All I can do is share the poor quality with others in the hope you will find a quality product to buy.
