UPDATED:  After about three months of use, I found that this changing pad became extremely difficult to clean.  The imprinted pattern of dots would collect urine and stool no matter how much I cleaned it.I eventually bought disposable pads to use on it, but it felt wasteful and sometimes wouldn't collect everything.  After a while I was only using the disposable pads so my son wouldn't touch the pad beneath it.  Even though I really liked the shape and sturdiness of the foam, I would not purchase this again. Not being able to adequately clean it made it seem completely unsanitary and a waste of money.RECOMMEND:  I would recommend purchasing the Serta Perfect Balance Organic Changing Pad.  It is a little more expensive, but I feel like my son is on a sanitary surface and that is worth it.  Some people complained about it being too noisy, but my son moves around when I change him anyways and I can't tell the difference. Not a huge fan of the print on it, but its so light you can't really see it.Having the four sides of a changing pad was a life saver.  My son would occasionally pee all over the place and the side walls would make it a lot easier to catch all the mess.  I placed my changing pad on top of a dresser and it worked really well. To prevent it from slipping, I used a non skid rug pad under neath it (just cut it to size).
