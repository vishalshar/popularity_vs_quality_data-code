I purchased the baby knee pads since my little one was on the go. As soon as he figured out he could crawl, all he wanted to do was crawl. We have hardwood floors throughout the house and his pants were always making him slip. I found these knee pads and thought they would be great for him. Well getting them on him was a challenge since you have to slip them onto the knee rather than just strap them on. At his age he did not want to sit for a single second. If I was able to actually get them on him, as soon as he was on the go they would ALWAYS slip right off. For me they were a hassle and a wast of money.
