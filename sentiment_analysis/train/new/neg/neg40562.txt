Initially, I really liked these cups for my two young children, and I purchased several different colors and sizes. They seemed to be truly leakproof and durable as expected with OXO products. However, after having had these cups for a couple months I'm extremely disappointed.1 - the most upsetting part is that black mold gets into the valve at places where you cannot clean it. This is after regular use and timely washing in the dishwasher after using a pipe-cleaner type brush to clean the air valve and liquid valve. I do not want to give something to my children that has black mold in it!2 - the rubber seal at the top doesn't last. It has to be removed occasionally to really clean the lid well, and after awhile it is no longer a tight seal and the cups leak.3 - the quality of the plastic cup is not good. After awhile, the cup starts to crack along the threads at the top.Overall, these are a waste of money and  after an initial honeymoon period you'll be disappointed. I prefer the cheaper and simpler playtex nuk sippies.
