Thought it was such a great idea for design elongated toilet seat covers for the little ones.  However, even though the description says it fits standard elongated toilet seats, which ours is, it still does not fit properly on our toilet.  We are not sure of the return policy for an item like this and decided not to bother with the return considering the hassle for a less than $10 item.  The width of the connectors are too short for our toilet.  If the cut was a little longer, it might have fit.  There is absolutely no way of knowing until you order the item since it states the cover fits standard elongated toilets.  Since we can't use it the way it was designed, we might just have to hold the toilet seat each time our toddler decides to sit on it as it wobbles a great deal because it cannot be connected to the toilet seat. Should have just stayed with the traditional potty chair pieces that come apart and fits all toilets, regardless of style. Those are very stable.  But overall, it was a great idea, especially for little girls.
