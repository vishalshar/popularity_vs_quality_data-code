Bought this for my 8 month old to have a play area in the living room. Super cute. Love that it matches my living room, and we LOVE dogs. HOWEVER, Dun dun dun....... Super cheap!!! The paw prints come out SOOOOO EASILY. My little baby after ten minutes of play has all the borders pulled off and tiles all wonky. If one of the dogs walks across their nails pierce right threw. I guess you get what you pay for! I'll be moving to use in his "reading corner" and get a heavy duty nicer one for our high traffic living room!
