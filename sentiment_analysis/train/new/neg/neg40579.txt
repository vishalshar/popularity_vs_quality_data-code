Used 4 of the guns within the 12 purchased & all of them quit working w/in 30 minutes of normal use.  While they worked they were fantastic.  I supervised play with a 3 & 5 year old & their play did not contribute to them no longer working.  Meaning they were not rough & did not treat them inappropriately. I'm a handy guy & took one apart to try to resolve the issue w/no success.  My 3 year old had some difficulty squeezing the hand trigger with 1 hand, 2 hands worked no problem.  If you want short term entertainment & teaching gun safety skills these may work.  Just be aware of the durability.
