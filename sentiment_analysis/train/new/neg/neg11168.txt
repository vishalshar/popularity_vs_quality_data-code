I have two problems with this. The first is that it only comes with the nipples, not the caps. The caps are surprisingly hard to find by themselves, so you'd better not lose them. Still, they don't advertise that they come with them, so there's no dishonesty. I just wish that for the price they did come with caps, since these are pretty pricey.Second, the holes are freaking huge. Your milk or formula will spill EVERYWHERE all the time. We find that whether even with the Stage 1 nipple (which we prefer and would give 4-5 stars to), our daugher can drain a 9oz lifefactory bottle in 30 seconds flat. She doesn't need a higher flow rate as she gets older, and all this nipple does is increase leakage.Stick to the earliest stage nipple, which has little or no leakage.
