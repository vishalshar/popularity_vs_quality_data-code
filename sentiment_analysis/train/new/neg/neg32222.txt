The mat has few errors on the picture displays. Ex: it says, van for V, but pictures a truck. ; says radish for R, but shows a carrot; and says little dog, but the picture looks like a combination of a dog and a pig... Little diappointed. How can a big company sell these products to children, young minds who are eager to learn, and teach them completely wrong expressions and words and pictures. No good at all!!
