My 4-yr-old son has used a SleepSack most of his life. We recently traveled to Houston, and I knew that his fleece one would be too hot. I ordered this product in a size 4T-5T so that he could wear it for a while. We had it shipped to Texas and used it while we were there. I was quite pleased with the SleepSack, and I had read the other reviews on here and was prepared for the unusual fabric. The only thing that bothered me was that it didn't seem much bigger than the one he had at home, which I believed was a 2T-3T. When we got back home, I decided to compare the two. I got my first surprise when I looked at the tag on our old fleece one and discovered that it was actually an Early Walker XLarge, 18 to 24 months, and not a 2T-3T. So our new one was 2 sizes bigger, not one. I got my second surprise when I  measured the two together and discovered that they are exactly the SAME SIZE. I couldn't see any measurable difference, except for possibly about 1/2 inch in length, at most. The width is the same, and most importantly, the arm and neck holes appear identical. I can't believe that an 18-24 month child and a 4T-5T child need the same size SleepSack! I am going to contact Halo directly and ask for an explanation, including photos I took of both sacks together. We will keep this one, as it fits fine for now, but I am disappointed that there is not more room to grow in it.Except for the strange sizing, the SleepSack is a great product. The leg openings work nicely for a toddler/preschooler, and it is a great way to keep kids covered who kick regular covers off. They are well made and attractive.
