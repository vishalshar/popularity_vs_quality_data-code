I knew that these decals were the kind that you have to rub onto the wall, but I wasn't prepared for how hard it was to put them on, especially when standing on a ladder!  I had the dots and the flowers, and the flower petals were very hard to get right.  There were several decals which got ruined because one or two of the petals didn't come off properly.  These might make a nice project for you and your child to do together, but I wouldn't recommend it to pregnant ladies who want pretty flowers on the nursery wall!
