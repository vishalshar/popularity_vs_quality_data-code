I thought this product would be great for middle of the night feedings and diaper changes. However, the lantern part would never charge. I tried 2 different outlets to make sure and let it charge for over 48 hours. The red charging light never went to green. This obviously was a a defective product, but it may (or may not) say something about overall quality.The other downfall is that the light can not be on if it is plugged in. You have to disconnect the power cord for the lantern to emit light. I thought I could leave it charging while it was lit next to the crib to offer comfort to my child, and take it off the base when we got up to carry with us. Since the light is only supposed to last 6-8 hours between chargings, this means it would be impossible to leave it on all night.I do like that the product is soft and portable. It may work for someone who only wants it for when a child gets up and not to leave on as a night light.I will be sending it back and not requesting a replacement.
