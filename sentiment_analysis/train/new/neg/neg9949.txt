My daughter received this toy from my Mom last year for Xmas, it's pretty much NEVER worked since then. I actually spoke to someone in the Leap Frog customer service dept. & was told how to return it to get fixed or replaced, but oddly enough it started working again after that. Then it stopped again. I think we just got a lemon. I've tried new batteries a couple times but it doesn't work at all now. When it was working, sometimes you'd have to shake it a little or turn it upside down to get it to start working. Something in the wiring I guess. (...)I'm going to look into getting it replaced again...
