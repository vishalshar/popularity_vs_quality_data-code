Purchased in November 2014  and as of February 2015 it is worthless.  It lasted 3 months (not in continuous use).  Apparently the weather shield intended to block wind, snow and rain is not meant to be used in the cold.....  The plastic gets hard and brittle when cold.  I have a ripped seam near the handle and holes in the very front from where the plastic cracked while unfolding it in the cold.  Very disappointed in this product.  I would expect a product intended to protect baby from the elements would be able to withstand the elements.  Wish I could return it :(
