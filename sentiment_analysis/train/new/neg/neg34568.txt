In my first use I washed both bottles, and put them in my Avent Microwave Sterilizer, but one of them melted, what appeared to be a product quality fail.The fact is that I bought it before my child start bottle feeding, and now that I found out this problem, I am no elegible for returns anymore.I'd like an answer from NUK to replace this deffective item.I am wondering what could happen to my baby, seen that it simply melted while microwave sterilizing, could it have any more serious quality issues?
