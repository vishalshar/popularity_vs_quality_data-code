Although it says colors may vary I figured the colors would vary between the white and green and the blue ones but instead my son got all pink which by the the way my order was x3 since our sitter gets some keeping a few extra in the diaper bag and what not. Also the nipple is smaller then the ones you actually find stocked in walmart  (same brand and name) so hopefully he will take these. Not a happy camper with this order and it's not worth sending them back to ge the right colors....
