I was very optimistic about Thirsties brand of cloth diapers as they got such good reviews on Amazon. I have had almost the opposite experience with these diapers. Here are my problems with this diaper1. It leaks everytime. I have followed all the suggestions from the thirsties website. My son's penis is tucked down. The diaper is closed tightly so there are no gaps for leaking. We use Rockin Green cloth diaper detergent. I use a thirsties waterproof cover with the diaper. It doesn't matter. Everytime, they leak within like 15-30 minutes. They leak through the top of the diaper.2. These diapers take FOREVER to dry.My recommendation is skip these diapers. I have had great luck with fuzzibunz, bumgenius, rumparooz, and flips. All of these brands do not leak for my son.Don't waste your money on these!
