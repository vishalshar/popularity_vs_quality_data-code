Our kiddo was outgrowing the s/m size SwaddleMe normal sacks at 3 months, so we thought we'd upgrade to these, in preparation for him to stop full-swaddling.  But wow, the leap between these two sizes is HUGE!  I can't wrap him in the Large at all, maybe because my kiddo is much longer than he is wide, the velcro goes past the attachment point, I can't get a tight enough swaddle.  He can't wear the s/m ones anymore either, because they are so small he's busting out of those.  I wish either the s/m were a bit bigger or these were a bit smaller.  Or heck, that there was a size between the s/m and the large.Update: bought a Halo WrapSack size Small that is working great.  I think their sizes go newborn, small, large. The newborn one we have appears equivalent to the SwaddleMe s/m. The Halo Small seems to be a much better fit for my kiddo for the next size. The velcro attachment area on the Halo is also much larger.
