This stroller is ok. I bought this on Amazon prime day because I got such a good deal, and I was thinking that I'd like to use it as a travel stroller since it's a few pounds lighter than the city mini 4-wheel that we have. It's a good stroller, but it doesn't fold up to be any more compact than the city mini, and the few pounds of weight difference was not noticeable.The stroller felt a little wobbly. Not unsafe, just not as solid as a city mini. I also noticed that the sunshade and the under seat basket appeared to be slightly smaller than those on the city mini. While it does look heavy-duty, the seat and sunshade fabric is not the "wipe-able" fabric that is used on the city mini. The City lite has the child-seat handle for a one-handed fold. However, the city lite requires the additional step of pushing a button prior to folding. I actually prefer the parking brake on the City Lite. It was easy to engage and disengage the brake, even when wearing sandals Finally, the real deal-breaker for me with this stroller is the lack of compatibility with most baby jogger accessories. There is no car seat adapter for the City Lite, and you can't use the ride-on board with the City Lite.If I didn't already have a city mini, I probably would have kept this stroller and been perfectly happy with it. However, I ended up returning it because it didn't live up to my expectations for a baby jogger stroller. My recommendation: spend the extra money and get a City Mini.
