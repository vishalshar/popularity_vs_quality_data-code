I really like pigeon bottle and nipple at first. It is soft and doesn't leak milk to force baby to eat. But the problem is that it's easy to crack. I have bought a middle one and a large one, both of them cracked within one month. Milk leaked quickly from bottle. I have ordered another large nipple and this will be my last try. Hope it will work.
