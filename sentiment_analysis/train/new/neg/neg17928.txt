It's cheaper, that's how. The most glaring con to these is that the bottle caps don't close off the nipple holes like the Avent's do. Which means you can't keep water in them to bring in your diaper bag. Otherwise, if your bag tips onto it's side all your stuff gets wet. This has happened to me multiple times so forget about bringing them along. I don't see any difference in my son's gassiness so there goes that pro. Finally, it has parts inside that are a hassle to clean and I like to clean my baby bottles good. They provide one (that's right, one) tiny brush to clean these small parts so be careful not to lose it. The only thing I can say about it that made me give it 3 stars is they are cheap and the nipples don't collapse like the Avent nipples when the kid is sucking on it.
