These were a really cool concept, baby soccer shoes with cleats...except for the fact that they don't fit a baby's foot at all.  The shoes are too puffy on the inside to allow a real baby foot to fit.  Lengthwise, these are comparable to a size 1 (6-12 weeks). They're very cute to keep as a memento or use as a decoration.
