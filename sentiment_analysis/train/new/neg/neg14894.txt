Bought this set for my 3rd son's nursery.  Looked great right out of the package, until I washed it.  I washed it per the instructions on the bedding and the colors bled REALLY badly.  I even used several of the color catcher sheets and the colors still bled, even on the sheets.  Very disappointed.  Will be sending the set pack for replacement.Updated, just received my replacement.  I was VERY careful in treating and washing the bedding.  After several washes with color catcher sheets in cold water on the "handwash" cycle, it came out with much better results than my first.  I hope that the first set I received was just improperly treated in the factor and that is why it bled so badly.  Overall I am more satisfied with my product, and VERY satisfied that Amazon was so quick to send a replacement.
