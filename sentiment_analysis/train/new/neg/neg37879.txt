First off the lip to catch pee is useless if you have a boy, the "junk" hovers right over it allowing the pee to flow easily all over the floor! (Like we need anymore cleaning added on to having a child)Second trying to sit my kiddo on it is a challenge as there are no grips to hold it in place, causing it to slide back pushing against the wall making the lid fall/push against his back...Third issue the lid locks when it shuts... making it hard to get them on in a hurry as you can imagine trying to help get diapers and pants down for your kiddo only to find you are now going to fight a locked lid...Much happier with our pourty,  got it for 10 bucks its one piece and super simple and my boy actually enjoys potty time now, so much for the 4 in 1 they might as well call it a step stool thats all we can use it for, but even then... not worth it...
