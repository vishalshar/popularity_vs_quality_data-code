We've been through three of these. Two were total junk out of the box. One worked very well.The first one we got didn't work at all. It was totally useless. The static was so loud we could barely make out noises from the babies room. But, we sent it back and exchanged it for a new one. The new worked great. So, we ordered another one for the other kid's room. This 3rd one was total junk. So, 2 out of 3 were junk. But, the one that did work, we really like. For me, this explains the mixed reviews on this product. Poor quality control.As far as the one that did work, here are some more details about why I liked it.We've tried a few monitors. This one had the least static. For us, static is the most important issue. We hate it. We use the baby monitors primarily at night, so that we can hear if the kids wake up in the middle of the night. If the monitors have a lot of static it keeps US from getting to sleep.The next most important issue is unnecessary beeping. Some of the other monitors we've used periodically loose the signal from the baby's room, and then automatically reconnects after a few seconds. Each time they loose the signal they beep loudly to let us know. This always wakes us up. This can happen a dozen or more times each night. No good. THIS monitor does NOT beep when it looses the signal, or maybe it just never looses the signal... either way we're sleeping much better now.
