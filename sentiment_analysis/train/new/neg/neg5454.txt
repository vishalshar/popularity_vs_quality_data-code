I wonder if all the good reviews are written in the first 5-6 months of use. Otherwise it's impossible  anyone would write a good review because it will stop charging. We were very happy with this monitor when we first got it and as I said earlier for the first 5 months. Then it suddenly stopped charging. I would have to press the cable really hard in the monitor to be able to keep it charged. I talked to the company and they agreed to send me a replacement while we still had the old one as we needed the old one to keep monitoring the babies' room. It would stay charged only in a certain position but at least we didn't have to buy another one until the new one arrived.After a few days we received the new one and we were happy with it, thinking the problem we had with the first one was rare. It's 6 months now that we received the second monitor and it started the exact same problem we had before. This time it's worse, as now it doesn't charge at all anymore. We talked to the company again and they agreed to send us a third one but at this point, because it stopped charging completely we will need to buy another one asap as we can't be left without a monitor until the new one arrives. Plus we are sure the third one will not last more than 5-6 months.As I said in the beginning I am really surprised about the good reviews and I do believe they are all written in the first 5 months of use when we were also happy with the product.
