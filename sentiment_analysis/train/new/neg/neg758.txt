The seat protector itself is ok, but if something should spill then it runs down to where the LATCH system buckles in or where the seatbelt buckles, staining the seat underneath since the securing of the belts causes the ends of the seat cover to expose the cloth seats.  Liquids did not soak through the cover itself, but it seems a little flimsy.  We were able to purchase other, more sturdy seat protectors that performed much better to our liking.
