I ordered a red racing chair for my grandson and after 2 weeks the big box came.  I opened it and to my surprise it was hot pink.  The box said red, the packing slip said red and my original order was red, but somehow I got a hot pink chair.  I sent it back (AMAZON IS WONDERFUL WITH RETURNS) and ordered a replacement.  Sure as sugar, the darn car was hot pink.  I am done with these colored blind misfits.  DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THEM; YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.
