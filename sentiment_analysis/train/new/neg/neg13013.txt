Our baby boy seemed to always be so sweaty when we pulled him out of his carseat so I thought this might help that issue. It fit perfectly into our carseat (britax) but did not seem to make any difference at all in keeping him cool. He was still sweaty and seemingly uncomfortable. The other problem I had with this product is that the mesh didn't seem very soft. This wasn't an issue except on the back of his head, I could imagine if you used this all the time that it would rub their fine baby hair right off their head, but we didn't keep it long enough to find out. The color was nice, it seemed well made, just didn't seemed to help keep our baby cool.
