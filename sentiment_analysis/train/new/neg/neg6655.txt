I bought this when my son started busting out of his swaddle too frequently. I wanted to love this swaddle, and it does work well, but it was just not for me.  Swaddle is very easy to put on and my son never busted out of it due to the little arm restraining pillows and major amounts of Velcro. And I liked the idea of dressing him in normal PJs and not having to worry about whether the swaddle would make him overheat. But I found it very awkward to nurse my son during middle of the night feedings while he was wearing due to the bulkiness of the arm pillows.  Really hard for him to lay on his side on the nursing pillow w/ it on. And the final deal breaker is my son just started looking so miserable when I put it on - he would start wailing as I strapped him in. I took that as a sign that he really didn't like it, for what ever reason. Could have been uncomfortable or maybe it worked too well and that's what he didn't like. I don't really know. But I ended up sticking with the Summers Infant swaddles and just being a lot more careful on my swaddling technique to prevent breakouts.
