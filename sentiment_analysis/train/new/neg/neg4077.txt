I bought this for my baby, thinking it would be a good deal and easy because I was getting all the stuff I needed in one package.  When I received it I was extremely disappointed.  I haven't used all the items yet, but of the ones I have every single item has been cheaply made.  First of all, the package itself is cheap quality plastic, about as thick as a plastic bag.  The zipper broke off in my hand right away.  Secondly, the hairbrush bristles are so rough that they hurt my babies head (I have a Swiss Army hairbrush with softer bristles).  To top it all off, one morning my baby woke up with a very stuffy nose.  I hurred to get the nasal aspirator from this kit, having taken for granted that it was a functional aspirator, and it broke apart in my hand.  It wouldn't work at all!  I had to go to the drugstore to get a new one.  Thank God it wasn't an emergency.  Well, I completely wasted my money on this product, and hopefully no one else will.
