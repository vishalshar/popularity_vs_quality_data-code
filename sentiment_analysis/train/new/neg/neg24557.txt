I have a few gripes about these sleeves.  First one being that they only come in pink or blue, but the one free sleeve that you get when you buy a set of bottles is green.  What genius thought of that?  It makes it incredibly hard to purchase for a baby, or a baby shower when you don't know the sex of the baby.  Also, what about the babies that follow for that couple?  Forced to use pink for a boy baby.  Does this really matter, no, but then everyone assumes you have a girl when you have a boy, and that can get old very quick.  Let the people buy green sleeves!!!!!The second issue I have, and this is far more important, is that the sleeve pretty well covers over the volume measurements on the side of the bottle.  You do know that those measurements are important, right?  Becuase whoever designed your sleeve didin't have a clue about that.  Also, why not also put volume measurements on the sleeve itself?  All the cutouts in the sleeve to make it look fancy are just quite annoying.  There needs to be an area on the sleeve where you can look in and clearly see liquid level and volume measurements.  Seriously, how did this thing get through your product testing?  You must have an abundance of single male engineers.The bottle has survived being knocked around, so I guess the sleeve is working, but honestly, with the issues stated above, I prefer to use our Born Free bottles that don't have a sleeve.Lastly, the green silicone sleeve DOES have the measurements on the outside of the sleeve, and an area where you can read the liquid level.  The fact that the green sleeves are designed differently, and better, than the pink and blue ones, is just lunacy.If you have any questions, just ask in the comments and I'll try and respond promptly.
