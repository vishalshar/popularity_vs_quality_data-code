I chose this spout cover because of the idea that it's inconspicuousness would keep my baby from messing with it. The first bath she took with it (and every bath following), she would not leave the thing alone! It did not cover the sharp part of the spout, which is what I wanted it for. After a bit, it got moldy so I finally threw it away. I would rather let my baby play with the spout than a moldy spout cover.
