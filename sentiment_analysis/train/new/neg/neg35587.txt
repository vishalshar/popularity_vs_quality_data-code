I have used the cups for about a month and only have three lids left.  The lids crack at the top where the lids go over the cups and then they are useless.  I love these kinds of sippy cups because they are simple and easy to clean, so I was delighted to find some that didn't cost a fortune like tupperware, however this product doesn't really help if the lids are all broken.  I might as well have ordered just cups!  The lids need to be improved.
