I purchased this gate for my pug who is average size for her breed at around 21-23 pounds. I was pleased with the ease of propping it into the door, although one rubber stopper didn't squeeze in the way the others did. It wasn't as "under pressure" as it should be, but it could just be my door. Well, it was also a bit shorter than I expected. When I tested it out, my pug stared at me and tried to hop over, failing in the process. She stared and then again tried to get over. She hitched onto the top and pulled herself to the other side, bringing the gate toppling down. I guess if this is being used for a relatively smaller child or dog, it should work a better. I am going to try to make it work for me, but before purchasing the gate, please be aware that it is wood, the plastic  is a bit flimsy, but suffices, the whole thing is a bit flimsy, but it should be okay for room division as long as the child or pet isn't too determined to get out. A more athletic dog can probably clear it with some ease or multiple attempts. A child that really wants to pull it down may be able to. It is a simple gate, for the small that either can't figure out how to pull it down, or doesn't have the strength. I don't hate it so far, but be wary when purchasing.
