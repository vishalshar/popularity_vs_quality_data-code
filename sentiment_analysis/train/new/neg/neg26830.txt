This rattle is great!  My daughter and all of her friends (aged 3-4 months) love it!  I am a bit disappointed in the quality.  Within 2 weeks, the thread became loose where the red satin side meets the white cloth fabric on the handle.  Also, fibers began to loosen on the red satiny side.  I found a piece of string in my baby's stool.  So the toy has been taken away, even though it her favorite.  I have ordered a replacement and will return to this review based on the replacements performance.
