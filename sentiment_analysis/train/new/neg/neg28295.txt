I think you have to get used to these?  The first time I used this it worked perfectly... The  next several times were a waste. A pretty expensive waste.  A few times it hardly got warm and a few times too hot. I ended up just nursing my baby. It's a little hard because you can't see how much milk is left in the bottle while your baby is drinking unless you take it off.  Not something you really have the time for with a hungry baby. All the bottles were made with refrigerated breast milk.  I think it would be perfect if you figured out exactly how long it needed to heat the bottle.  Not something you would use regularly unless you have a lot of money to spend.  My guess is about 1 hour for 4 ounces refrigerated breast milk to get it warm.
