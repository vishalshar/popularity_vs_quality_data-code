...don't.The shoulder straps serve NO purpose, really. The fabric they are attached to does not attach to anything holding it in place, only at the bottom, so baby can flop in any direction. You COULD fix this by spending a few bucks on some velcro and sewing it in to make the back of the harness actually stick to the cart cover, but you shouldn't have to rig it up! My baby hasn't quite mastered sitting, and I thought this would provide enough leverage for her to sit in the cart, but she always winds up leaning to the side. I still really like it, for the price. And I still always use it. But not the way I intended. I had to bring two big stuffed animals to stuff on either side of her to keep her from tipping over, until she mastered sitting.Also, the colors fade with every wash. I've only had it a few months and it looks old and worn.
