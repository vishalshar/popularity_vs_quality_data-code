The worst cups ever. So many things wrong, that I don't even know where to begin!? ... Firstly, this cup is very difficult to clean, as there are so many grooves, that your typical sponge or straw cleaner is not able to fit and clean. Secondly, the top is so hard to screw on properly that there has been so may times that we were in a rush and lo and behold, all her juice winds up spilled in our bag! NO BUENO!!  Save  your money and get a different cup!
