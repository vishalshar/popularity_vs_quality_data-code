We have been using the green to grow bottles and have just recently switched to the sippy trainer cup. My son is 9mo old and has had no issues switching from the bottle to this cup. He loves it and we love greentogrow!UPDATE: After using this cup for 2 months we switched to the born free. If you don't tighten this lid properly or the right amount it leaks EVERYWHERE! You can't tighten it too much or it leaks or too little. Very disappointed.
