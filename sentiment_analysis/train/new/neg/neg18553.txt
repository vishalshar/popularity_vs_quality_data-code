The toy is decent and has a variety of textures that my daughter finds appealing, however the size of this fish is fairly small (4" more or less).  I was under the impression it would have been at least a little bit larger, but baby's have small hands and I guess its appropriate, however the price should be lower for this type of toy for what it is.  I would rather of bought something else for her.
