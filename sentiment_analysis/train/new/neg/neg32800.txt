When I first bought this product for my almost one year old I really liked it.  I loved the vanilla scent and they were the perfect size for my daughters little hands.  She used them for a couple of weeks without any problems.  However, I then started noticing that the material was pulling away from the toy.  I just saw it in one spot so I cut the material off and figured maybe it was just a fluke.  Chunks continued to peel and fall off of both of these toys so I had to take them away from my daughter.  I was really disappointed because she really liked chewing them.  These would be fine I imagine for a baby with no teeth but watch out once your child gets teeth.  It is scary to see chunks of a toy that is supposed to be chewed on fall off.
