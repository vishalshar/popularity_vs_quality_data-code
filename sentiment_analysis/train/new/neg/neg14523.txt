This is NOT the same quality as the Little Giraffe blankets I've bought at the store. My daughter has two Little Giraffe Chenille Blankets which we absolutely love. I bought this for my son and it doesn't compare. The fabric seems to be made of a VERY cheap thread, that seems like it will rip in half and not make it through the wash. I'm so disappointed in this. My husband already removed the tags otherwise I would have returned this in a heart beat.
