I ordered this swing for my brother & SIL.  Initially worked for an hour or so before started quitting unexpectedly and spontaneously if you can get it to work at all.  Various brands of new batteries tried with no improvement.  Green light comes on and signals that it is recalibrating but is unable to sustain swinging motion.  I called after failure the first night they were home.  Customer service was polite and assured me that a replacement base would be sent immediately and would only take a couple days to arrive.  Now, a week and half later, there is no sign of it and I can only reach voicemail at customer service.  Extremely disappointed in this as it had gotten good reviews.  Embarrassed that I gave this piece of ^%^*# as a gift and feel bad that my brother and SIL gave away an older, hand-me-down swing when they got this one prior to baby's birth and now have nothing.
