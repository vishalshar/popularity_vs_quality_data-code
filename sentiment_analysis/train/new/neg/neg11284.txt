Soft and nice - I am concerned the string will come undone in the future. Some had straying strings I had to remove, nothing that affected the wipe itself but I would think they could be sewn with more accuracy. They are holding up in the wash though just fine. No complaints for usage - my 2 year old understood I got her new, special wipes, and it makes her feel especially loved to know we are paying extra attention to her lady parts. She is sensitive there, as many little girls are, so I have been making natural balms and powders for her. Although she's had a rash maybe 5 times, I have been able to clear them in 3 days or less with my natural products. And I wanted to use cloth wipes to 1. Better care for her 2. Stop buying as many wipes..we still buy disposable for home or face messes. Note: you will need to make your own wipe solution to use with them (maybe you can buy but I wasn't interested) it can be as simple as water with aloe but I used water, aloe, essential oils and distilled vinegar - make sure you look up a recipe to get proper mixing levels. Mine smells great, the oils/vinegar disinfect and deodorize her and we have had no irritation with these wipes and a home made solution.
