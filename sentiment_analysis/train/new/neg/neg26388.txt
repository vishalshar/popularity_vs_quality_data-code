My 4 month old really, really liked this toy. She prized it over her Winkle, Freddie, even baby Einstein play along. Then she threw up on it and I tried to wash it by hand. No good, the smell was still there. I put it through the wash and then tumbled dry on a very low heat setting. Even so, I can hear squishy water noises inside the squeaker and I know for a fact that there is going to be mold inside in no time. Feel very disappointed that a child's toy cannot be easily washed. I will be contacting the manufacturer.
