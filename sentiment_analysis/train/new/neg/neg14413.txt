I bought this toy for my 7 month old daughter.  She really enjoyed playing/sucking with the bow tags.  However, less than a month after having the toy, the stitching on the head of the caterpillar came apart and my daughter could have easily taken the stuffing out.  I'm very disappointed with this product.  Just shows that we as parents and caregivers need to regularly inspect the toys that our little ones play with.I have contacted Sassy about this and I'm hoping that they will resolve the situation.
