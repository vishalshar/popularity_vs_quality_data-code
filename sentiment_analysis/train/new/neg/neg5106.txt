We have had our monitor for 5 months now.  The reason I gave this a second star is simply for the piece of mind of having the SIDS motion sensor alarm.  However, we found very quickly that our little one was a squirmer and set the alarm off all of the time because he would move off the center of the bed and into the corner.  My biggest complaint with this monitor is the incessant static that comes over the monitor. Many times, there is nothing you can do to clear the static noise so you can actually hear your child. I do not recommend this particular model.  Maybe another model would be better, but this model is not worth wasting $90.
