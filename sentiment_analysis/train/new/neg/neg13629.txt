Since our house has no insulation it can get really hot or really cold very quickly, so we knew it was important to  get an indoor thermometer for the new baby. I'd read some of the reviews and many people indicated the egg's temp reading was off. I would agree with that but I wouldn't say it was "way off". I'll give this three stars because it does give you a pretty good sense of the temp in the house. If you want extreme accuracy, I would not recommend this. My biggest complaint? The color indicator stopped working only after a couple of months. It will occasionally light up but then turns off again. The thermometer still seems to be working ok but wasn't the fact that it changed colors to indicate temperature one of it's main selling points? Otherwise, I would have gotten some plain old thermometer from the hardware store (and maybe that would have been a better choice).
