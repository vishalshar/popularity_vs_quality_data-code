This is a very cute and soft sleeper. I returned it because I was looking for something thicker then cotton one that woudl help replace fleece. ( I don't like that fleece is not breathable).  When I got the sack i felt the thickness it it was rather thin and did not seem worth the buy to provide anymore warmth then the cotton Halo Sleep sacks.
