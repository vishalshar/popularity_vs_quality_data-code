Ok first I own a convertible it only has the latches for the seat part of a car seat, nothing to anchor it at the top of the car seat over the back seat.So I was only looking for a booster seat that had the latch system in the seat. These do and that's great for me.On this model you have to push a button like you would on a seat belt to release the latch system. The model above this one had a strap in the front of the booster seat that you just pull and it releases the latch system with one pull. I want to be able to leave the seats in my car, so this model is perfect for me. But... if you want to be able to transfer the booster seat in and out of your vehicle you should invest in the higher model.This Booster seat also has no amenities; there are no cup holders, no side pockets. It's a booster seat only. So be aware of that.The arm rest seem a little hard. If you're going on an extended trip it might be a little uncomfortable but unsure on that yet.Lastly I read a review that stated you don't want a booster seat with latch system. That the booster seat needs to be able to move with the child during the initial hit. Unsure if I believe that or not... Does anyone else have any information regarding that?
