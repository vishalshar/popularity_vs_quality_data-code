I'll start with the positive. The fabric used is beautiful and Baby loves staring at the contrasting colors. It is also very light, but sturdy. While the "umbrella" can get in the way, it easily moves to accommodate an arm.Now, for the negative. I drive an old Lincoln, and the rear seats are rather slanted. The base for this seat, even on the lowest setting, sat Baby up way too straight for a newborn. I would find her head and neck in an uncomfortable position after each and every ride. If your rear seat is a little more flat, I do not think that you would experience the same problem.The seat is also very uncomfortable, and has no padding for Baby's bottom and back. Baby grew to hating car rides because she was so uncomfortable. I tried to combat this by adding my own padding, but that only seemed to worsen the head positioning problem.This seat is now in my parents' car, whose seats are flatter. I may put this seat back in my car once Baby can better support herself, but I doubt it.
