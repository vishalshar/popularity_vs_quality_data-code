I ordered this thinking it would be warm - the picture made it look plush, plus it said it had two layers. The inner layer, cotton, is so thin I can see through it. Even with two layers, its not as thick as the fleece sleepsacks. Would definitely not purchase again. If I had seen it in a store I would not have bought it.
