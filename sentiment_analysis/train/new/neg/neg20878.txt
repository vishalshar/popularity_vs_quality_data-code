I like all the Medela products, but this came with a few items that I really didn't need.  On the plus side, the bottles are sturdy, the caps seal tightly, and the whole thing works with the 'pump in style' breast pump I was using.  Also, the nipple-rings are great and work with any brand of nipple you buy.  The bottles are also great for freezing milk.On the negative side, the little discs that go with the nipple rings that they include to create a 'temporary' cap is pretty useless.  I wish they had just provided a few more 'full' caps which provide a better seal.Also, the nipples for all the Medela products were never a favorite with my son, though that might be a personally preference of his.  I just use the Playtex or Evenflo nipples with these bottles, and they work just fine.Last, for some reason, the other caps they provide that are supposed to fit over the nipple & nipple-ring never really fit, so it would often leak out into the diaper bag.Bottom line:  Worth it, I suppose, for the items that work, but ditch the other items as they are not very good.
