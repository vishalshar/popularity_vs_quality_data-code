I am very disappointed with both the seller and Amazon regarding the Baby Chef Ultimate Baby Food Maker. I sent this machine in May to a couple who registered for the item. The baby was born in September, and last week, was ready for baby food. The couple opened the gift, and it was broken. They tried and I have tried all day today to get a replacement food maker to no avail.  When I called customer service at the seller (K & D Kids), I was put on hold for 15 minutes and then was transferred to a voice mail. When I talked to Amazon, they said there was nothing they could do.  They looked, and the manufacturers website was under construction, really? They did provide me with an email address, but I am not holding out much hope. It seems that the 30 day return policy applies to even broken machines. I realize that there are rules, and that normally rules need to be followed. However, doesn't it stand to reason that parents to be might not open the box of a food processor until they needed it? I am deeply disappointed and a bit embarrassed. I've sent a 90 dollar broken gift to a dear couple, and I can't do a thing about it. Seriously?
