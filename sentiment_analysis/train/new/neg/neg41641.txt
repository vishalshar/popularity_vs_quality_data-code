I have two kids. My wife and I bought this and it was terrible to useWe read and read and try different kind of technics to improve the manual extraction process but nothing workedAfter many hours and frustration and two health issues we decided to buy this producthttp://www.amazon.com/NUK-Expressive-Single-Electric-Breast/dp/B0070U6QK6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1399060651&sr=8-3&keywords=nuk+breast+pumpAnd that is when we realized that this LANSINOH product pulls the whole breast since the opening or cup is too wide and, on the other hand ,the NUK breast pump estimulated just the nipple and some of the areola which not only replicated much better the baby mouth moment but it does not hurtI want to clarify that my wife did produce enough milk to achieve 7 or 8 oz in 30 minutes with the NUK breast pump, so it was not an issue related with how much milk did she produced.
