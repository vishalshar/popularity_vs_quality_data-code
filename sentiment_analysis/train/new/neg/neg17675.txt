I ordered this and it is very cute.  However it has already cracked down the lower right side where the infant sling attaches to the plastic.  My baby is only 13 weeks old, so it hasn't been used that much.  I tried to get a replacement but the return window had already closed.  I'm going to have to replace with something else soon because the scrawled plastic is jagged and now unsafe.  Ugh.
