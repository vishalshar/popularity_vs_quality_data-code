UPDATE: I'm changing my 5 star review to a 1 star review because the remote on this mirror stopped working for us 6 months later. Since my child was older and didn't need the entertainment anymore we used it only as a mirror. Now I'd like to have the option to use the music and lights again but when I emailed the company about the remote I was 1 month past warranty. They didn't offer any troubleshooting or helpful advice or anything. They also implied that since I could still use the actual mirror it really wasn't broken. Munchkin is the parent company and this isn't the first time I've had a horrible customer service experience with them. I'm very happy to see that Amazon has put a hold on selling this product because of so many complaints about how it arrives defective. Don't waste your money!!!!This mirror was well worth the cost. It made me 3 month old who screamed every single car ride without fail, begin to enjoy the car. Now he loves falling asleep to the more lively tunes. He especially loves watching the lights at night I think it helps him feel like he's not all alone back there while I'm driving. The songs are catchy and not too annoying. My older child loves to sing along. It was very easy to install on the headrest. You just have to remember to power on the mirror when you load up baby. Then you can turn the music on and off and control the volume with the remote. Would highly recommend to anyone whose baby Is miserable in the car. It's still working for us months later.
