I really wanted to like this product. I've been thinking about buying it since my 2 year old was an infant. I decided to try it for my newborn, but the other bad reviews are right. It's a great idea but a bad design. At best, if you find just the right placement under the car seat, you get a small, jerky motion, but in most of the places I tried to put the dozer, it gradually fell out of position and stopped rocking or there was no motion due to the weight of the car seat (I have a 7lb car seat and a 10 lb. 1 month old baby). When I first turned it on I didn't think the noise was that bad, but after a few minutes it gets really irritating. I use a white noise machine to help my babe sleep but even that didn't drown out the annoying noise of the dozer. I wish they would figure out a way to improve the design and reduce the noise. I think I'm going to return it.
