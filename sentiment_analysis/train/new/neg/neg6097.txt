Terrible! DON'T BUY...the color, flower, material and overall appearance are not as described or pictured. There's this hideous, .5" thick black elastic (can you say overkill?) conveniently hidden in the picture. I wanted to return it (even though I only paid $3.09, but after repeated requests and the seller continuing to deny the return request, I filed a claim through Amazon. Terrible customer service just adds insult to injury. I wish there was a no-star option, I feel  like 1 is being too gracious.
