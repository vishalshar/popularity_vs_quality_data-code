What's worse than trying to take a photo of a fidgety baby? How about taking one with a sticker that won't stay on! I could tell from the moment I opened these that they were complete junk. Hardly any adhesive whatsoever, very thin and flimsy. Don't waste your money no matter the price. I've had much better luck in with Sticky Bellies brand which were much better quality.
