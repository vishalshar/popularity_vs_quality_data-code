Not sure if I got a defective one, but both of my sippy cups leak.  When my daughter sucks on the drink, the little hole on the other side doesn't seem to let air in, so the plastic cup collapses.  I have to physically press on the sippy cup to let the air in. On top of that, it leaks on the side.  Too bad that the cup is cute but not functional.
