I buy lots of things and usually never write a review.  I find myself easy going and easily pleased!  This is not the case here and I feel it is important to inform future buyers.  BEWARE.  I bought this snap n go back in May when I first had my son.  Since he was number 3 I figured it would be great to have when running quick errands to the grocery store and light enough that one of my older kids could help me out by wheeling it around!  It completely broke.  The car seat almost fell off and the baby could have been injured.  When looking at the product after this incident it seems that it was not properly made.  The rivet holes don't line up to even fix it and it was most likely a manufacturer defect.  The front piece completely gave out and the car seat started to fall off (even with the buckles which are supposed to be for safety).  Luckily I caught it in time.  I would not recommend this product.  If you do go ahead and purchase this product please examine it carefully before use as your child's safety is most important!!
