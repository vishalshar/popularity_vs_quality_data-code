I like Kushies. I like the product, the print and its intended use. I've actually used the same product previously when my son was 6 months old. What I hate about this particular diaper is the fit - or lack thereof as the case may be.At 24 months, he does not fit in the size recommended based on his weight: large. My son is not above average; he's 35.5 inches tall and 30.4 pounds. We bought the large which indicated it fits 25-50 pounds. Clearly, based on these numbers, the diaper should fit Sebastian as he is closer to the bottom weight then the maximum. Instead of fitting, the diaper cut into his thighs leaving red welts. Additionally, the diaper kept coming unvelcroed at the waist. Thankfully,the ties were there to keep it on or we would have had a peep show!I'm hesitant to try the extra large, as I am afriad it would then be too large and any maybe poops would come out leaving us more embarrassed.If you're looking to use this diaper on a baby with the same stats as Sebastian, I would advise against it.
