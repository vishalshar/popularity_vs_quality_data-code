Very cute, but not too functional. The plate and bowl are rather lightweight-- although they have made it through the dishwasher cycle and were not destroyed. The spoon and fork handles are SO cute, and offer great grip for small hands, but the design of the fork doesn't allow it to pierce food items easily, so we don't even bother using it anymore. The spoon is way too shallow, there's very little curvature to it so it's hard to keep food balanced on it. I guess if you're eating pudding or sticky oatmeal or mashed potatoes it would be okay, but doesn't work for cereal/ peas, etc, in our experience.
