I purcased this teether for my 10 and a half month old daughter.  When I gave it to her she really liked playing with it.  About 15 min later I see that the had bitten off some of the orange part and had it in her mouth.  I looked at the teether to confirm, then I swiped her mouth to get out the orange rubber.  I am so happy that we were at home and playing together, otherwise she may have choked on the rubber.  I do not recommend this product.
