Of course I made the mistake and ordered this when there were only 2 reviews.  There is very bad reception when the units even connect.  We can't even use this from one side of the house to the other, much less upstairs to downstairs.  The blue lights are bright and annoying.  The worst part is how if you don't have a parent unit turned on, the blue light on the base unit just keeps brightly flashing. I have used several monitors over the years and never come across one with such poor range, reception and ease of use as these
