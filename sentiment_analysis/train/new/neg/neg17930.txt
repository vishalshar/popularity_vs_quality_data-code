I purchased this product for when my grand baby visits. I always leave the play yard set up so the play yard hasn't even had to be folded away for storage. Now 10 months later even after minimal use, the play yard bottom or mattress section has a gigantic ridge in the middle and the panel pieces of wood are sticking up.  The play yard is all but useless. I've tried to fold it back in shape, push the foam back into place; tried everything I could think of but I can't fix it. The baby only weighs about 24 pounds. I am very disappointed.
