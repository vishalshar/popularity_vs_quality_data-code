I purchased two mirrors for use with my twins in an SUV. One mirror was in the middle where there is no head rest & the other was behind the driver's seat attached to the head rest. I couldn't see either baby with the mirrors. I feel like I should have been able to see at least one of them since they were being used in two different fashions, but no. They really just got in the way whenever we needed to move a seat around. Based on so many good reviews, I'm guessing that maybe it is better used in a smaller car? I'm not sure. Just didn't work for me. They are larger than other baby mirrors & and the four-way attachment is pretty simple.
