I received this high chair as a gift from a family member when I was expecting my first child. It took some time assembling it, but it wasn't too difficult. The high chair itself is gorgeous. It's sturdy and the solid wood is a plus. I love the removable tray and the adorable fox and friends pad that goes over the seat. However, the pad is a real pain. It's a shame because the fox theme was my main reason for purchasing the high chair because it goes with my son's bouncer and bassinet. When I place my child in the chair, the pad makes him slowly slip lower and lower, giving him terrible posture which can be a choking hazard. I either have to continue pulling him back up (which requires undoing the seat belt and putting it back on) or removing the pad so that he will not slip. I haven't even figured out how to remove the pad. The high chair is also heavy so it's not something you can quickly transport from one room to another. So regarding the looks and sturdiness, this would definitely be five stars, but for the pad and other minor issues, it's just an okay high chair.
