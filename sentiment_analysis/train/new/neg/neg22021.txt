My daughter prefers these pacis.  What I reduce in stars for is the designs you get.  I didn't get anything even remotely close to what was shown on the many pictures on the description.  How hard would it be to let you chose, at least boy vs. girl or animals vs. prints?  I've ordered a few of these and always get the same ugly styles.  A little variety would go a long way....
