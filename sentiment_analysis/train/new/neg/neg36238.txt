I had sore nipples during the first most of nursing and got these with hopes they would provide some space between my skin and my bra. They accomplish that but also put a lot of extra pressure on the breast which I feel isn't healthy and could lead to infections and clogged ducts. Also if you have a heavy let down like I did then when they get full the little foam piece at the bottom no longer holds the milk and it goes spilling out the top where the little holes are. Just use nipple balm.
