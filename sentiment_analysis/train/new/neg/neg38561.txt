I ordered this product, paying almost four times the price, under the impression that I was receiving 12 hard cases as it is stated throughout the reviews.  Upon explaination, The company ToysOnline, was unwilling to work with me on correcting this misconception.  I will not order from this company, for the following reasons... they were significantly overpriced comparatively, misleading reviews were not corrected, unwilling to correct the problem, did not provide tracking number, and a long delivery time.  After explaining to amazon that I had just spent $11 on 16 wipes, with the understanding I was receiving 12 cases, the customer service representative agreed that there is something wrong with the way this product is advertised and attempted to correct the problem for me.
