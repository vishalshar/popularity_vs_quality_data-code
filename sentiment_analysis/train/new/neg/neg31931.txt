I own two other Baby Trend strollers (frame for infant carrier and jogger) and am very happy with their design and use.  I decided to buy the Passport since my daughter has grown out of her infant seat / frame stroller.  I was hoping the Passport stroller would be similar to the frame stroller that holds the infant carrier.  It is not.  It is a much cheaper design.  The stroller was easy to assemble.  The wheels are made out of a cheap plastic and are not a solid rubber like the frame stroller.  The red release handle does not function and the grips of the handle bar are of a lower quality than the frame stroller.  I was hoping the Passport would be like the frame stroller and I was sorely disappointed.  Most concerning is the folding and locking of the Passport.  My one hand fold handle does not work so I have to use the two hand method at the folding joints.  This causes a pinch point for your fingers by the baby tray when folding the stroller.  Also, the locking red latch does not hold the stroller closed.  I called Baby Trend to get resolution on the defective one hand fold button and they told me it couldn't be fixed and to return the stroller to Amazon.  Overall dissatisfied with the stroller.  I liked the concept of the stroller but the design is of poor quality.  Next time I will pay a little more for a lightweight stroller.
