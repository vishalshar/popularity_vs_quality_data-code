I purchased this guard with the intentions of the length measurement (15 inches) actually being correct, as stated in the technical details information for the product. The product's box clearly states that it's only 14 inches long. I didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of sending it back and am using it anyway. Since it was shorter than anticipated, it will not cover all of our Blu-ray player's buttons (one each on either side of the top of the device). So, I had to decide which was more important to cover, the "on/off" or "open" button. I really wish both buttons were protected. Other than that, this item works for our needs.
