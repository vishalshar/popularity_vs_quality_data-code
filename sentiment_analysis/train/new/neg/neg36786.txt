I am using this with the Dreambaby retractable gate.  It fits on my bannister nicely and securely.  The one issue I have with this adapter is around how the gate parts attach by screws.  The screws lineup with the spaces intended for the strap.  Luckily the screws went all the way through the space and attached to the other side, otherwise the screws holding the hooks, in my case, would have only been sunk into about 3/8' of wood.  I would recommend this product, just be aware of the mounting procedure.  My 13-month old daughter has pulled and yanked on the gate and it hasn't budged.
