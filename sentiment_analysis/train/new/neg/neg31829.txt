We ordered two of these gates because the wrought iron look matches our banisters.  We immediately returned one since one of the latch pins had not been swaged and welded into the unit properly.  It was just loose in the package.  The latch mechanism is poorly designed and awkward to use and even after some significant adjustment, doesn't latch consistently.  Lifting the gate by one centimeter allows it to clear the latch and open smoothly.I didn't buy the wooden block/bolt units (sold separately for $12 each.  I needed 4 of them for two gates and easily made my own).
