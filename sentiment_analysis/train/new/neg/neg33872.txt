These gel pads do provide relief however one of them opened up (after only a few uses) and oozed gel all over the place.  I kept them in the freezer in a bag as suggested so I'm not sure what happened.  Defect, perhaps?  The other one is still ok but I won't buy them again as I'm doubting the quality of manufacture.
