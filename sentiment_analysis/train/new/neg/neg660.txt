I purchased this product for an autistic child in my kindergarten classroom.  He was happy to have something to chew on other than his shirt and I was pleased with the product for the first 30 minutes.  After that, he bit through the rubbery cord the chew slide was attached to.  I retied the cord and before the end of the day, he had bitten through it again.  The next day, he wore it for the first hour and then I noticed the chew slide was missing.  He was either biting through the cord or twisting it until it broke, and the slide was missing.  So, lesson I should have learned was I should have found a string to attach it to the first time he bit through it.  If you purchase this for someone that needs to bit something, replace the string right away.
