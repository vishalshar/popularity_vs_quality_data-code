When you fully recline the seat, the back folds to a 90 degree angle and it makes the bed too short.  At the bottom end of the seat there is a edge that folds down and does nothing.  It only folds down our straight up....straight up stops your babies feet from hanging down.  My baby is only 28" and can't fully recline. Please let me know if I am doing something wrong!Maneuverability good for one handed pushing.Removable tray is good for snacks, but not deep enough to hold an average size sippy cup.  Upper cup holder not deep enough, but nice lidded compartment comes in handy for keys, or small phone for quick access.Ample storage, good balance with a full diaper bag hanging on back (even without baby in it)Wish it was lighter, on heavy side.Folds easily once you get the hang of it, great stand up feature when folded, and folded locking mechanism handy.Great with infant seat, clicks in and one hand trigger release, but you have to use with snack tray in place.Took this on a airplane trip alone and it did very well to hold lots of stuff in it.  Just a bit difficult because it is a bit heavy and bulky.
