Although the sheet is really cute and completes the All-Stars ensemble, the quality is definitely lacking so I have to give it only 2 stars.  The sheet is too tight for our standard crib mattress (especially with a mattress pad in place).  The sheet ripped at 4-5 different places along the elastic band.  As one reviewer wrote, perhaps hang drying is the solution (and should be done before the very FIRST use).  The manufacturer was to skimpy with fabric allowances...very disappointing. Oh well, I hand stitched the rips and still use it just so the crib looks good :-)
