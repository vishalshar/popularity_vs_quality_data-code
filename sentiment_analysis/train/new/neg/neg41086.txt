you've got to be kidding me! if I still played with Barbie Dolls I could use these and think they were great but I don't and I don't. They are so tiny I don't know what to do with them. Also washing instructions say no bleach which to me defeats the purpose of white washcloths. I had planned to wash makeup which includes mascara off my face and in my experience the only way to get mascara off a washcloth is with bleach.Will find other white washcloths that are a decent, normal size. These were a waste of money.
