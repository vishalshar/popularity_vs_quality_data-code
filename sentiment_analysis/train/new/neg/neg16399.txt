I gave this chair an honest benefit of the doubt. I desperately wanted a rocker that also swiveled. Upon arrival I was very excited. It came put together and ready to be placed in the nursery. It is small, but I still liked it. I breastfed and rocked my son in this for several months comfortably. But, then it started making a terrible sound. We flipped it over and sure enough one of the brackets had broken. For the price, the quality is very poor. This is the only purchase I've ever made on Amazon that I regret. I would not recommend this product.
