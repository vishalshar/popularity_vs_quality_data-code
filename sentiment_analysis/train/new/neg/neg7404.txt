We used it for almost four years, so selling or donating it when we were done with it was not an option. The majority of this car seat is plastic, but it is not labelled for recycling, so to my dismay it is now taking up most of the space in our garbage bin. If I could go back in time and pick something that wouldn't end up entirely in a landfill, I would change my choice. What a waste.
