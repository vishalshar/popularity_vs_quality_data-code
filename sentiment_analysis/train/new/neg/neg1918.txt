After using pocket diapers of a few different styles for 18 months, I wanted to convert to All-in-One's, because we're just tired of stuffing.  Unfortunately, this one isn't it.Benefits:  All in one style means no stuffing. Overall, the fit is good for my 8 month old.Failures:  Leaks.  Every time we've used them, it's leaked.  I did a test with a 1/4 cup of water holding the diaper in my hands, and I can see that the liquid is absorbing quickly (i.e., this isn't a problem that can be caused by not properly breaking in a new diaper), but it immediately starts to bleed through around the leg holes. The waterproof material doesn't appear to extend all the way through the elasticized legs.  Eventually, when my son has worn these, the entire diaper ends up feeling wet.Another down side is the drying time.  These always came out of the dryer still damp, when all my other diapers are fully dry.  I ended up turning it inside out between the washer and the dryer, which helped, but coupled with the fact that it leaks every time basically just means we're taking this out of the rotation altogether.I'm giving this 2 stars because if you wanted to use it and just use a diaper cover over top, it would probably be fine.  That defeats the purpose for us, though, because we really just wanted to have an All-in-One solution. We'll be sticking with our pockets or the BumGenius Freetime All-in-Ones.
