To the manager of the Amazon store,I am writing to express my concerns about a recent experience I ‘ve had at Amazon store. Though I have been buying a lot of different goods in it (and was always satisfied), this time I’m really disappointed.On the 21.12.2013 I purchased a stroller Bugaboo Cameleon 3 – All black special edition (its price $1,059, the Order №112-7328859-4761804.)But on 30.10.2015 the stroller got broken, and now we have problems with the base. It is impossible to “fold” it, the mechanism doesn’t work. We got the response to our letter, written to an official representative of Bugaboo company saying, that a guarantee maintenance doesn’t spread to the goods bought at the Amazon store.I would be grateful if you sort everything out. To resolve the problem, I expect that you either return my money or replace the stroller with a new one.
