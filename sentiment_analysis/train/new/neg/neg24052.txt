This carrier was one of multiple carriers I bought for my baby. He was less than the maximum weight listed, but he is very tall for his age. When using forward facing, the straps were tight & looked as though they would hurt his shoulders. I wasn't impressed with this product & while it's a great concept for all the uses, I didn't believe that it was worth the money.
