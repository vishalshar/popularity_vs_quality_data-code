These bottles are more trouble than they are worth.  Milk collects in the nipple that you have to squeeze back into the bottle.  When you shake the bottle to mix up formula it then sprays out of the nipple and a lot of times the milk would flow freely when you turned the bottle upside down.  Sometimes it would do this and something it wouldn't.  We could never figure out why.  Finally got fed up and went with a different brand.
