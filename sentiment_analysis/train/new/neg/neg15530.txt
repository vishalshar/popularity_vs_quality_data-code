I absolutely love the idea of this tub. I love that I can put it inside my bath tub and sit on the toilet seat to give my baby a bath because the stool part makes it the perfect height. But the infant insert part is absolute crap!! It has way too steep of a tilt and my baby slides right down to the bottom to where she is smashed into the nub. If I had a little boy there would be absolutely no way we could us this part. I did use the insert a few times and out a wash cloth rolled up to give it a little more padding and make it a little more comfortable. But I will be throwing the insert away today. We bought a used prince lionheart seat that we will use in the tub part until she is able sit unassisted
