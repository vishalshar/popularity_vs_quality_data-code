They're too big. It didn't specify a size on the web page so I assumed they're all one size. But when I got the nipple shields, it said "size L". I tried it but doesn't work well plus it doesn't stay on as well. I recommend the Medela brand nipple shields better. They come in different sizes and better quality though a but more expensive. One thing I did like about the Nuk nipples was that it came with a case.
