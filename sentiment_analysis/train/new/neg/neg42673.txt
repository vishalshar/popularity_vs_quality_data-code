I used these to secure a bookshelf in my son's room.The installation process went pretty smoothly. So thumbs up for that.Unfortunately, it is much harder to detach the straps.  I wanted to access the outlet behind the bookshelf. To do that I need to move the bookshelf.  I tried for about ten minutes to detach these straps before giving up.  I'm sure I could do it, but it wasn't worth the time it looked like it would take.If you want to secure a piece of furniture more-or-less permanently these straps would be great.  If you have a piece of furniture you'll want to move occasionally you might do better using a different strap that detaches more easily.
