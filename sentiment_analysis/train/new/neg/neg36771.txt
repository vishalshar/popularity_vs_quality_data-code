The stroller has a smooth ride and is easy to push. Only complaint so far, the hood or sun cover seems flimsy. I am comparing this to our (single) City Elite. Our City Elite seems a little large and can accommodate an order child. My 3 year old's head is already at the top of this BOB. If you have the cover pushed back, it bunches at their head. Wish I would have just gone with the double City.
