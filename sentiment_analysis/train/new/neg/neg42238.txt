THe previous poster said it all. I ended up using this maybe 2 times and I had to wait till my daughter was older than a newborn due to it eating her whole as it seemed!UpdateI still cannot seem to use this with my new baby. She is uncomfortable like she is being squished. She hates it, and I do not feel comfortable wearing it. Off to sell it on ebay!
