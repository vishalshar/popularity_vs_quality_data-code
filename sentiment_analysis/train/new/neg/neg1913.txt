I really recommend another product - anything would be better.I couldn't get the bath to clip togther properly, my husband couldn't either - so we gave up. We just pushed it together and the water leaked out. My baby was small and he was very uncomfortable in it and slipped around alot.The only bit I finally used was the sling over my knees when we were both in the bath - and its use was limited. This is too gimicky - try a good old fashioned tub.
