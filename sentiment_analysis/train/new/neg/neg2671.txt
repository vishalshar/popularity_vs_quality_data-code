My son is 1 month old and about 10 pounds. I use these covers with the Bummis and Bumpkin pre-folds. They do a great job at preventing leaks as long as you change the pre-fold immediately which is difficult to do unless you want to constantly stick your finger under the cover and check it. I very rarely get a "blow out" with these diapers which is awesome because my son constantly blows out of the Pampers or Huggies every time he goes poo.The MAJOR downside to this diaper cover is the velcro. The more I wash these covers, the more mangled the velcro tabs get. The rough velcro tabs do not sit flush on the diaper cover which causes the corners of the tabs to poke out and rub against the soft skin of my son's belly. The velcro doesn't bother him when he is lying down flat, but once I sit him up (and his belly sticks out) or I cradle him (and his waist is bent) then the velcro rubs and irritates his delicate skin. This downfall is enough to make me discontinue use of these covers. I'll be sure to never purchase velcro covers ever again!
