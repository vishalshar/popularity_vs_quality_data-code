The Tot Wheels Activity Center is a good walker for the money.  The price we found to be very comparable to other walkers.  We really didn't notice any pros or cons to this particular walker over others.The main problem that we've run into with both of our daughters is the fact that that they really enjoyed the toys for about 1 month at the maximum.  After that they got bored and soon started fussing to get out and roll around on the floor.Our first daughter used the walker part of it for almost a week before again getting tired of it as the fact is, something along these lines is just too tough for a little one to control by themselves.  If you can imagine pushing a shopping cart that wants to go it's own way that's the way it is with the walker.  It's too big and bulky for them to easily steer not to mention the fact that little ones often don't realize what steering is.  The only know walk forward and crawl away when they can't move forward anymore.  With that said, understand that you'll have to walk with them to help them steer.Overall I remain convinced that a walker is good for kids to have so they have something other than their parent to hold onto to learn to walk but be prepared to help them walk in it because of the above mentioned bulkiness of the walker and the fact that I've never come across any walker from any company that's been easy enough for a little one to steer and push at the same time.5 stars for the idea and the toys but I had to take 1 star away for the difficulty to steer and another star for the limited time that my daughters used it.
