When you're pregnant, you just want something under your stomach, supporting the growing girth that is your baby. This seemed like the cheaper alternative to a pregnancy pillow which usually rings up at a whopping 65 dollars. at least.Unfortunately the wedge just doesn't come close. The foam is so hard, you might as well wedge a countertop under your stomach.You can also use it between your legs to ease back pain, and it actually helps for that, but realistically, you'll never keep it there for longer than 10 minutes. Not really worth it to me.HOWEVER...we have found some alternate uses for it, since it's so uncomfortable as stomach support.You can use it to prop yourself up under all your pillows to watch tv in bed.You can use it as arm support while reading a book at nightyou can use it for sexSo....i guess for the price, after all, it's got some nice multi-uses. But i wouldn't buy it again if i had the choice.
