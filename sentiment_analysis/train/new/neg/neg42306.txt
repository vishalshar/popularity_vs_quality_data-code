They work and I'm glad replacement valves exist, but: (1) They should be cheaper next to the overall cost of the sippy cups. (2) The design of the valve attachment could be better. The valves often fall off; a better design would be a clip to keep them in place or have them twist on and be held by a grooved tab. Seems clear they want the valves to fall off to force you to buy more.
