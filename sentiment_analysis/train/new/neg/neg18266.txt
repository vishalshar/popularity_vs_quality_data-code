I find it quite difficult to fully open.  YOu really have to push hard on the foot pedal to get it to lock.  There was a defect in the original which caused it to collapse even after it was locked.  It was driving us crazy and then we received a note for the recall.  After it was replaced this problem never came back, but it's still darn hard to lock.  It is light weight and it's comfortable for my son, so those are the pluses.  I think it's a bit expensive over all.
