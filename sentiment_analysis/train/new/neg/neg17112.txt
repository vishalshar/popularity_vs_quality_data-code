The puppy itself is cute. But I think it's important for consumers to know that the Soothie pacifier is attached to each animal and cannot be changed out or replaced. This means:1) You are paying $11 and up for a pacifier.2) This cannot be washed unless washed in the washing machine. I don't know about you but with a new infant and already a family of 3, I've got more laundry than I know what to do with. I don't need more. And I certainly don't need to do laundry at 3am when this hits the floor. I need to walk to my sink, wash and go. The fact this is attached makes this hard without getting animal wet. Then what? I give a wet WubbaNub to my baby? No thanks.We looked and looked on the package - there was no mention they are attached. I went to the website...no mention. Maybe we missed it but we can't find it. If I had known before, I would not have purchased it. I won't buy another.But the puppy is cute and our son looks cute using it. It is made well. But I just find a pack of 2 pacifiers for about $5 to be a better buy.
