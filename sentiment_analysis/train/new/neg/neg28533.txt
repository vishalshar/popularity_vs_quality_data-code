I love OXO and this masher is made well. However it is the exact same product as their potato masher only with a green handle. I bought this because I used to mash up bananas when my daughter first started eating them and I thought this would make it faster. It didn't. A fork is easier and quicker. The bananas got stuck in the OXO masher and I had to use a fork anyway to get them out. It could double as a potato masher, however it is easy to mash potatoes with a spoon or fork, especially if you cook them right. I have owned this masher for 3 years and have not used it except the few times when I first bought it. I keep thinking I'll find a use for it; something that it will do better than a regular fork. So far, no luck.
