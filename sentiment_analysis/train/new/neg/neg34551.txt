I got one of these blankets from Babies R Us before my daughter was born in 2011, and it's now her favorite blanket, so after looking forever, since this blanket is no longer in stores, I bought it here. This blanket is VERY cheap in quality, soft yes, but cheap. It's thin, not as soft as the original, and the silk lining is stiff, and it's missing the original tiny Carter's tag that is part of the reason my daughter loves it so much. Disappointing that it's not the same considering it says it's from Carter's :(  I'm keeping it, but only because it still looks like her other blanket.
