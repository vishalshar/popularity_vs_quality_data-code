Very handy to put frozen fruit pieces for baby to chew on while teething. However, for the younger kiddos I wish there were an easier way for them to hold onto this, the shape isn't very easy for babies to hold onto and eat themselves, so I've had to hold it a lot for him, and push the fruit towards the front of the mesh.
