I really wanted to like this bag, but the first time I used it, the red of the Cat's Hat bled pink everywhere from the condensation of having an ice pack inside the bag. I tried to wipe the pink off, but it just made it worse. Since then, other red parts of the bag have also bled, and it basically looks like a cheap piece of junk now. Also this bag is not tall enough for the 8 oz Dr Brown's bottles unless you use just a travel cap (no nipple).
