I only bought this for the adapter. Although I'm a huge supporter of medela breastpumps, I dislike the bags a lot. It is too small and takes up a lot of space in the freezer, which is a huge minus if you are storing breast milk. The white bit is difficult to write on.On the contrary the adapter is incredibly useful and convenient. I now pump straight into my Lansinoh bags. Lansinoh bags are the best I've used because they take little space in the freezer. Check the picture for comparison.
