Very disappointed by this snugseat.  I have 4 mo old twins & in order for this to work the rumble seats have to recline.  I did not know when I purchased the stroller that I cannot recline both seats at the same time!!!  So I used it on a slight angle & both of their heads bob out of the headrest- totally unsupported.  This stroller was marketed for twins & clearly it is not ideal.  Also with the Snugseat in the rumble seat, my baby's feet are pressed up against the back of the other seat- there is barely any room & my babies are not big!
