I liked this case at first.  But there is nothing holding the folding cover in place, and since it's such a large tablet, the top third of the folding part often flops down. Also, I've only had it fo about a week, and one corner of the plastic snap-on back has already broken off.  While I put on and removed the cover somewhat regularly, I didn't use a lot of force.  I was hoping it would last longer.  Still, it was only a $10 case.Edit: Bumped my review up to 3 stars to acknowledge the helpfulness of the customer service for this product. I was able to quickly get a refund.
