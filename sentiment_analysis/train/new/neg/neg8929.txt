We bought this swing three months ago and almost immediately, the orange fabric came off of one side but since it's decorative, I didn't think it was a big deal.  Then I started noticing little white pellets in the carpet (our swing is inside) and it turns out that the seam on the side had also come undone.  It is going to break my son's heart, but I am returning it as it is too expensive to keep if it's not going to last us another three months.However, since no one else has mentioned having problems with the craftsmanship, I will say that my 3 yr old son LOVES this swing and it seems to be very, very comfortable as it molds to his bottom.  Not to mention that the wings are super cute.
