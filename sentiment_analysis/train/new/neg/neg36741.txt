It's hard to rate baby/kids things because every kid/baby is different. My baby started teething at 3months and was about 10.5 lbs. I thought she was going to love this but she did not. The pacifier part that goes in the mouth is relatively small compared to the outer part with is thick and heavy making it hard to keep in her mouth. I even tried to get her to just chew on it, but it is so heavy. She ended up liking the hand held gummy things which look like a wand almost. They are much lighter and she could grasp it to put into her mouth. I bought a few different things to see what she would like. I wanted to buy the raspberry pacifier but I'm too paranoid about her choking if you read the reviews. Hope this was helpful.
