I purchased this for my 7 month old when she outgrew the leacho podster.  At 9 months old she is still too small for the lounger.  I have also found that the middle webbing is not as tight as it is on the poster so her butt just sinks to the floor.  I expect she wont fit well in it until she is at least  a hear and a half old.
