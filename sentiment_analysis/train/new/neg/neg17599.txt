Two of the three cribs I ordered arrived on time. I bought these for my daycare. Based on these being real wood, having free part replacement and coming with a pad, they seemed perfect. The cribs color is more of a walnut than cherry. Which I love because nothing is worse than a bright red cherry color. Everything was perfect except for a slight ding on the inner front panel.(Which I will be contacting for a replacement) Sanded well and stained perfect. No odor that I can tell. Instructions were clear and I had all parts. The first one took about 30 mins. The pad is perfect thickness to me. I won't be buying another one for daycare purposes. It has corner elastic so little ones can't pick it up. I used my sheets from my regular sizes crib. Only thing I should have paid attention too was it is made in china. Bummer. We will see how it holds up. Hope thisHelps.Edit-- 1 day of a teething baby and the teething rail has half the stain removed. Crap.
