This is my second order of this placemat because of the poor quality. If I could handle breaking my son's heartbreak, I'd just throw away the original, which is almost completely worn away. Instead, I'm replacing it, fully expecting to replace it again in a few months.These placemat are not up to usual Crocodile Creek standards, which is very disappointing. I echo other reviews about flimsiness (it doesn't lie flat on the table, but this is rectified by the weight of dishes), durability (the picture started to disappear in the first week), and slipperiness (it skids with the lightest push).Tip: if you're a sucker like me and buy anyway, layer some Griptex Wonderliner or its equivalent under the mat, and it won't budge on the table. I also use the liner under the changing mat, between cooking pots, as a shelf liner, under the Tripp Trapp when kids are using it as a stand, and countless other uses, so you won't be wasting your money by buying the big roll.
