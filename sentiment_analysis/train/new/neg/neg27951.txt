I was unable to use them since they only work for a convertible bed.  We had similar rails years ago when our children transitioned to a twin bed, and the rails at that time had large metal prong-like attachments that slipped under the mattress and held everything in place. I foolishly assumed these would operate the same way.  Not only do they function just on convertible beds, but the instructions consisted of drawings that were so puzzling that I could not make heads nor tails of them.....so even if we had been using them for a convertible bed, I would not have been able to put them together.
