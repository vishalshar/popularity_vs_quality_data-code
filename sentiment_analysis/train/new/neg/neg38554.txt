We like our Brest Friend nursing pillow, and figured we'd get the stool to go with it.  The adjustable feature is nice, and helps get the proper alignment for feet while nursing.  As other reviewers have noted, the thumb screws aren't appropriate for frequent adjustments, and you'd want to screw them down tight, so toddlers don't unscrew and run off with them.The non-slip sandpaper top is great to keep sock feet from slipping off, but is incredibly scratchy for bare feet or toddler's bare skin.  You don't want toddler knees or hands on the top of this stool - rubber would have been *much* smarter and safer.While un-boxing and assembling the stool, the quality was incredibly poor.  As delivered, the legs were already broken in half.  Not surprising, since the legs were simply strips of scrap wood glued together (not plywood), without proper joinery.  This type of cracking is especially scary if you intend to stand on this stool, as a crack along this dimension would certainly cause you to fall.  Also, the pre-drilled holes weren't aligned well, so even if the legs weren't broken already, they would likely snap trying to bend them to fit the misaligned holes.Bottom line: this is not the level of quality and precision I would expect. After some gluing and clamping it works, but not recommended.
