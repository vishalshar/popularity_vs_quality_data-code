I like the handles, but wish the pee guard in the front were more robust. Prince Lionheart makes another seat that is soft foam and it has the best pee guard for boys as it is very tall and wide so it catches pee even if the aren't sitting perfectly still and straight on the seat. While mine likes to use the handles for positioning and getting on and off, I am wiping up about 50% more pee from the seat and floor.
