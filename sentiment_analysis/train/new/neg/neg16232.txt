While this LATCH retrofit kit may work great with some vehicles, not all LATCH equipped vehicle, seat, and retrofit kit combinations will work.I recently took this kit, along with a seat it was approved for use with (an infant, rear facing seat) to a car seat installation inspection provided by the California Highway Patrol.  It just plain old won't work.  The belt of the kit is too long for the belt path in my vehicle (a 2002 Saturn Vue) and we wound up ditching it for the good old seatbelt.PLEASE, regardless of whether the kit is approved for use with your particular seat, go get the installlation checked out by a professional, to make sure it is safe in YOUR vehicle.
