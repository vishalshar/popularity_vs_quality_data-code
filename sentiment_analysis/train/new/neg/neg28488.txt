Now im a mom of 3, so i know a thing or two about bottles! I purchased these bottles for their cute girly designs, affordable, and breast like appearance. Big Mistake! The hole of the nipple is located on the side! Yes the side! Making it very hard for my daughter to suck out any formula! A feeding of 2 or 3 ounces of formula would take 2-3 hrs! So all day it seemed like i was feeding her. Her Mouth & Tongue would get red from sucking sooo hard! I tried making the holes bigger & even bought Mediam Flow! Nothing Worked! Finally i bought the inexpensive GERBER Bottles because it had always did the job with my other children! Now feedings lasts 15 minutes! and My daughter is satified. She sleeps longer because before she would be up all day & night trying to suck 3 ounces out of each feeding.
