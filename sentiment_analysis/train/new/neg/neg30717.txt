We got this for my 5yo to bring breakfast since she goes to school so early. She can disassemble and reassemble it by herself. We love it.So why 3 stars? Because at only 3 weeks of use it's growing mold under the cereal bowl. We hand wash it every day so it's not from sitting in a humid dishwasher. Hopefully ours is a fluke
