I didn't research much before purchasing, because cup holder for my stroller was "must have" . Now I regret. You should be really careful when put your drink, because it flips over most of the times, and might even spill on your child. It consist of two parts: the one that attaches to the frame, don't worry it will stay there forever, even if you want to move it, but the actual cup holder always falls off. I don't blame the seller, it came fast and nice. I think it's more of manufacturer defect. Unfortunately, there is no another Quinny options.
