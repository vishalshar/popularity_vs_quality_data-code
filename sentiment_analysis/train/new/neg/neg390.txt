My LO is 7mo and I thought pouches would be awesome for us on the go. WRONG. I've used it 4 times. We ran to the grocery store and I packed sweet potato and pears. Two pouches and the pears had leaved out through the seal. Later that night trying to wash them by hand with soap and warm water it was a joke. Sweet potato was somehow in behind the zipper seal and I can't get it out. Same for the pears. I've tried and tried but there's no getting it out! Next night peas and apples again two different pouches. No leaks no problems until I was washing them. There's something wrong with all 6 seals water is getting trapped behind the zipper seal part. It's now day three going on four and there's still water trapped in the seal part. I've tried everything to keep it open and let it drain so it don't mold. But I'm not willing to risk it. looks like I'll be returning these. Super sad I really wanted them to work.Btw if your wanting something made in the states. Theses are made in China. I bought these cause the couple that designed and created them are from Washington. But I could never find any info from the website and amazon about where it was made until I got them.
