I love the "non-baby" colors of this bag.  After two other babies, I was ready for a bag without Pooh, bunnies and pastels.  The brown & pink were great colors that went with everything I was wearing (as opposed to all the other bags that just coordinated with the baby!)The ONLY draw back that I've found is that there isn't much "Mommy Space" in this bag.  There are two small front pockets that don't hold much and certainly aren't secure enough to hold a wallet or cell phone.  The only other space is a zipper pocket inside the bag, which is just a pain to get to when you need something quick.Overall, it's not a bad bag, but I would look for another small bag for shopping or quick trips... this is definitely an all day out, only baby stuff sort of bag.
