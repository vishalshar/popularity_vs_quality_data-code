These were my favorite diaper covers when I first bought them because they were the least bulky under my daughters pants, and really easy to get a perfect fit with the wide velcro panel and elastic wings. HOWEVER, in only a few months, the velcro barely secures anymore and I have to keep pressing it on when it starts to curl off. And the elastic on the wings have gotten stretched out and I have to pull the wings tighter and tighter to keep it on. Also, the leg openings are starting to gape open, leaving lots of space for leaks now. Terrible! It is not worth saving a couple bucks buying these because they will not last one child, let alone more! Disappointed.
