Small parts loose off within 3 month !!!! very very dangerous to child !!!!Very poor quality and Bad customer service!!! I bought this playzone in May 2015. I put my 7 month old son playing in the zone. 3 small parts came loose off within 3 month. Those small parts are very important to support the zone firmly and were damaged through normal daily use, and today I even found my son bite one!!! The worst thing is some part was missing from the fallen parts, I doubt whether my son swallowed it!!!!! I contacted  the customer service in written, but no reply yet!
