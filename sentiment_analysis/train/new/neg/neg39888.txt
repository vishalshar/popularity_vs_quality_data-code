This is a piece of junk. The blades are dull and I mean absolutely dull after SINGLE USE. I used it once to cut the nails of a newborn baby (10 Weeks old). Why are the blades dull. I cut the tender nails of a newborn NOT a tree trunk. Ugh the blade isn't smooth along the edges anymore. There are tiny dents so to speak.  I have the photo attached. You can see the blade edge isn't smooth anymore. That's the best pic I could take.
