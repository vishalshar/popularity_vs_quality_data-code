I doubt that with almost 400 other reviews this one will carry much weight, but I truly do not recommend these for anyone after my 14 months of experience with them.As a first time parent, I spent a lot of time researching reviews and forums across the internet to decide what to use for my boy. After spending the first couple of newborn months in GMD prefolds with Thirsties and Rumparooz diaper covers until he grew big enough for a pocket diaper, my husband and I road-tested Bumgenius 4.0, Rumparooz G2, and Blueberry pocket diapers. We ultimately felt that the Bumgenius fit his lanky frame the best and bought a couple dozen more of them (and received a few more for free as a promotion). They worked fine at first, once we learned the importance of using a liner even for "cloth diaper friendly" bottom balms, and seemed easy enough to care for. Our daycare didn't seem to find them too challenging to use either.Fast forward 14 months and, of our approximately 26 bumgenius 4.0 diapers (in a total rotation of 30 pockets) only FIVE have PUL that hasn't failed (leaking from the middle of the diaper). That is awful considering the amount of money and time spent purchasing and caring for these. The Rumparooz G2 and a couple of Blueberry Pockets are still going strong. We have cared for them as recommended: dry diaper pail (except for diaper rinsing for solid poo, washing every 2 days, Planet or Allen's Naturally Detergent, soft water, stripping about 3 total times during their lifespan, always dried it lying flat and never in a dryer. The only other measure we have needed for our overnight SBish diapers was a FunkRock pre-wash, so that became part of the regimen too a couple of months agoI'm so frustrated and disappointed at their failure that I could cry. Of course this is 2 months after the warranty runs out...
