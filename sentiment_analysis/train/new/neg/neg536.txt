When I ordered this toy, I liked that it was made of fabric and wood, rather than plastic, given the concerns about endocrine disruptors and children these days. And with the variety of colors and shapes it was still visually stimulating, unlike some plain wooden toys. But after some use, whatever lacquer utilized to seal the wood was peeling and I discontinued use for fear of my child ingesting anything harmful. I wish some non-toxic vegetable glaze/sealant had been used instead or at least, whatever was used, was clearly labeled, so a choosy parent would know in advance.
