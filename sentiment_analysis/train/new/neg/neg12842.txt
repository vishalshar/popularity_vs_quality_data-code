I bought this for my 5 month old granddaughter. It's all fabric and whatever is inside the block in the middle to make noise , does not make enough noise to attract attention.  Also it must get stuck inside the block sometimes and there is NO shaky shaky!The tags that are shown in the picture that are supposed to be sticking out, do not and they just lay flat against the ball. My granddaughter has tried to get even part of the whole ball to chew on and gets frustrated when it doesn't happen!  About all I am able to do with this ball is hold it in front of her because the strips that it's made with are too wide for her to keep her little hands around it.  It might be ok for some babies, but my granddaughter loves to chew on stuff.
