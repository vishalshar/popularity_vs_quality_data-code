I have to stuggle to raise and lower this high chair. It does look great in my kitchen--but, the fabric seat gets dirty so quick. one big mouth wipe against the side and i am working on taking the thing apart & off to wash.(New mothers certainly do not have this sort of extra time!)  i assume having the pad washed this much will fade and look worn soon. THe wheels do not help roll the chair around..it seems more like sliding even when the little brakes are off. And, lastly...the tray doesnt seem too sturdy when attached. There are better ones out there for a better price! P>S the dishwasher safe trays do not fit in any normal size dishwasher!
