It soothes my little one to sleep.  Have been using it since she was 3 months old.  it uses 3 AA batteries.  Sometimes vibration continues after the songs finish, so it drains batteries pretty fast!  So I need to keep checking if it actually stopped vibrating after the music stops.  There is no volume control.  There is only demo mode, on and off.  It is soft and washable (remove battery compartment inside before washing, of course).  Press and hold for at least 5 seconds to suspend music/vibrate.  There is no music only option.  There is no vibrate only option.
