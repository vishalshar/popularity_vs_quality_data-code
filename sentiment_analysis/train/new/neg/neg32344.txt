I had a similar experience as many people on here.  Mine completely broke into many, many pieces.  i thought I'd finally found a brush similar to the Libman brand soap dispensing brush that I had for years and Loved!  That was not the case.  I had only been using it for just a couple of weeks, when I put it down on the sink next to the faucet, only hard enough to get the suction cup bottom to stick.  It shattered.  Bristles and little bits of plastic went all over.  Unfortunately, many little pieces even fell into my garbage disposal, rendering it useless until I could fish out the last piece.  The plastic may be brittle, but it's hard enough to stop my disposal from running.I still miss my Libman.  It was awesome, but they don't make it anymore. :'-(
