This glider is okay. Not great but good for the price. The colors are a perfect neutral and match out crib perfectly. The fabric is a great natural fabric and hides stains well. The actual size of the slider is slim. I am not a small lady- but I am normal sized and I found it to be tight. My oldest is now 3 and there is not room for us to sit and read a book together on it; there is not a lot of cushion.  Also, if you rock the chair without using the footrest, it clicks. It has something to do with the angle of the rocking but I found it to be a little annoying.  One good thing is that we have had it for other 3 years now and it's still going strong and has no fallen apart yet!
