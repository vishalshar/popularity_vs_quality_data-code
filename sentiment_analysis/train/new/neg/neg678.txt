We use the Tommee Tippee bottle with our little one and I like that they have different nipple flows to choose from. We've loved them and they have worked well for us but the reason I only gave three stars is because I was hoping the Fast Flow nipples would be quite a bit faster than the medium flow. Otherwise it worked well and in great shape! For as long as our baby has been on the bottle they have held up nicely with no rips or leaks.
