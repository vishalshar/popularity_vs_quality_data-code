I bought this when my son was 3 weeks old because we found he would only sleep if he was being held or on a pillow in our bed(only when I was awake watching him). Obviously a baby sleeping on a pillow is NOT SAFE so I looked into the snuggle nest. The extra features sound great but they could use improvement.Pros:- baby is close by for nightime nursing.- provides peace of mind knowing my husband is not going to roll over on the baby.- lightweight makes it easy to travel and baby is comfortable to sleep anywhere because he's still in "his" bed.Cons:- my son is very tall/long so this only lasted until he was about 7 weeks before his feet were hanging off the mattress.- it was a tight fit in our queen size bed with me, the snuggle nest and my 6'2" husband. I would not recommend using it with a smaller bed unless there is only one adult.- the sound feature seems like a great idea but the volume of the sound when you first push the button is too high. My baby would startle and wake up rather than be lulled to sleep. Also, the sound only lasts for about 2 minutes before shutting off which was not really enough time for him to get into a deep sleep and if you restart it, the volume returns to the level that was too loud only waking him up again! Needless to say, we didn't use this feature very often because it caused more disturbance rather than be helpful.- my son accidentally turned on the sound many times in the middle of the night when he put his arms over his head in his sleep. It would scare me to death to be woken up by the heartbeat sound that was once again WAY too loud! I didn't appreciate being woken up when sleep is such a precious commodity for a new parent, not to mention it waking up the baby!- the light is a good idea but the click from pushing the button is rather loud and woke my son up every time. Great if your baby is already awake though.All in all, it gets the job done but don't get too excited about the extra features.
