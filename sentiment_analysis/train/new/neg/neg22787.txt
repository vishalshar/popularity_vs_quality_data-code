The new model of this chair is different than the one pictured.  I've used the old model and loved it, this one is definitely different and not an improvement.  The center strap does not come up from the front of the seat but from the middle of the seat bottom and the strap is extremely short and not adjustable.  Across the front of the chair seat is a strip of velcro where the seat liner attaches.  When the waist straps are buckled into the center strap the result is a section of plastic 4 1/2 inches long. Since the center strap doesn't come up very high, the 4 1/2 inches of connected buckles are like a plastic rod gouging into the inner thighs of my child.  My little boy is only 10 months old, this seat should easily fit him.  Instead, it is painful and only can be used without straps.  My only option is to cut the webbing and insert a longer length or return the chair.I called Regalo and their customer service rep told me that he had no idea what the specs of this chair should be (I wondered if I had a defective center strap) but that if I requested a replacement from Amazon, it would most likely be the same.  He indicated that they didn't really care if the buckles ended up far too low to be useful.  I would have to say that it was the most strange and useless phone call I have ever had with a customer service person, and I've had my fair share of frustrating customer service calls.
