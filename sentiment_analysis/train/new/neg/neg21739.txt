This is the only monitor we could find where the baby unit (the one you leave in the room with the baby) can operate on battery power. We use this monitor when traveling and when baby falls asleep some place other than the nursery. The units are lightweight and reliable. The main drawbacks include the poor sound quality and static. The parent unit inconsistently transmits random static noise when placed in various parts of our house. I haven't been able to associate the random static with proximity to any particular electronic device, so we just move it around and find a quiet spot each time. The sound quality is such that when baby starts making noise, we sometimes can't tell if it is babbling or crying. Basically, we only use this device to monitor whether baby is still sleeping or awake from a nap.
