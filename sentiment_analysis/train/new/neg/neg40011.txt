I bought this back in December but only started using it two days ago. One of the hooks ripped at the seams, rendering it useless, on its first use. I did not use these hooks in any way out of the ordinary--one hook on each side of the stroller handle and hung my diaper bag across the two hooks. One mile long walk later, the hook was on the ground. Unfortunately for me, I am out of the return window since I purchased these while pregnant and overly preparing for my baby; but save yourselves the trouble and try another brand of hooks!
