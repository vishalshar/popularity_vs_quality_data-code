Full disclosure....  This is NOT what I thought I was getting. Since, I had a specific design in mind, my review may not be totally objective.  But, I still don't like this design. The handle in the middle of the gate used to lock the gate closed doesn't do a very good job. This gate uses pressure (similar to old wooden gates) to lock the gate closed. It just doesn't close well. It's hard to work the handle and it feels as though its going to break ever time you try to lock it.  The hinges are "universal" so it can be set to swing in or out. That's a nice feature but the directions do not explain it well. After a few trial and error attempts, I figured it out.  I wouldn't buy this gate again. Most of all, neither would my fianc√©e. She hates it and wants it down.
