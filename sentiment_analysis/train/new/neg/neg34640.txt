We purchased this when our baby was 9.5lbs of weight thinking that if it gives us enough use for a month or two that will be worth the expense.However, this is very unwieldy to use and our baby being less than 12 lbs but about 22 inches tall had a tough time fitting into this as this is designed for smaller babies. We removed the small pillow type thing in the insert to try as well but it forced the baby's legs to be folded in weird ways to just fit the baby in.This was just a waste of money for us and we should have just waited for our baby to be 12 lbs before using the main Ergobaby.
