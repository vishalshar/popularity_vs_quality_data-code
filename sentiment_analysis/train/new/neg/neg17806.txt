Ok so I bought this swing before baby was born and was a little horrified when I put it all together at how huge it is and how much space it takes up.  Granted, it's cushy and cute and works great, but for our small town home, we just didn't have the space for something so enormous.  Not only that but once the baby was actually home, I realized I wanted something that could be moved around the house easily and this is NOT that!  I ended up sending this back and buying a bright start portable swing that folds up when not in use that I really loved (see my review) that could be moved from room to room, by my bed and taken on trips etc.  If you have a dedicated space for a big swing like this to go and don't intend on moving it, this is a great swing.  My sister has one and uses it regularly.  It just wasn't right for our needs and limited space and colicky baby who would only sleep in the swing sometimes.
