This is a very good idea.  I have become less comfortable with our daughter drinking daily from a plastic cup, and this is the best glass sippy cup solution I've yet found.  The glass cup is a small canning jar, and the plastic lid will screw on to any standard small canning jar (Mason, Kerr, what-have-you).  That's the clever part.The downsides are minor, in general.  The lid can be easily screwed on crooked, in which case the cup leaks.  Also, the silicone sleeve traps food and water in the dishwasher, and isn't very easy to put back onto the cup (removal is easy).  With cold beverages, you could skip the sleeve entirely, but with warmer beverages or smaller hands, you will want the sleeve.Finally, since we already had a number of suitable jars, I wish the company would sell packs of lids and sleeves for less money.  As it is, I think the lids alone were something like a dollar less than the full cup.*UPDATE* I just tried these lids on a spare 8oz canning jar I had with a kind of raised diamond pattern on the jar (don't know the brand).  The lids leaked - I could not get them to seat evenly or seal properly.  So beware these may not work on all jars as advertised.
