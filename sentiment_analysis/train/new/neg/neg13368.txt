It does it's job, as far as powering the Symphony on a drive. However, it's a pain. The plug doesn't fit well in the DC outlet of the pump. Once you get it in, it will slip out if the pump is shifted. My Symphony usually has a display that says "Symphony 2.0", but with the car adapter, it will only show the display of the pump level, so it looks like it's not getting power when it actually is. I didn't notice any loss of suction, I was able to pump my average amount while on a road trip.
