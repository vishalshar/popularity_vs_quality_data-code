This was much more flimsy than I expected it to be. It is basically cardboard. Would get soaked in the rain, which doesn't matter so much because kids won't be playing in the rain, but I wouldn't want to put outside if the road was not completely dry (not even snow, so not good for winter use) and it would blow away with the slightest breeze. In fact, even once assembled, I have a hard time keeping it flat and upright. It says to put a milk jug full of something inside of the sign to keep it from flying away. You would have to do this, otherwise it would not stay put. I would not have purchased this item if I knew it was this flimsy. I have ordered from Amazon many many times and this is the first time I have been unsatisfied. I am not even sure how or where to store it because it is such an awkward, large item to assemble and then to take apart and doesnt' fold well.
