Great item, but it came out as stuffing when I washed it. I'm not sure how you are supposed to wash it after it gets bottle contents all over it, maybe I didn't follow the directions, but I feel as thought it should be machine washable. It lasted a whole 3 weeks. It's a good thought, poor execution.
