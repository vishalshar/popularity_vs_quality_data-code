The product is fine, but they are level 1 (0-3 months) instead of level 0 (newborn). I already have several 1's, and the stores seem to always be out of 0's so I came here to get them. My son can't use 1's without gagging yet so I'm still stuck with only 2 usable nipples. If you're looking for 0, keep looking. This is not it.
