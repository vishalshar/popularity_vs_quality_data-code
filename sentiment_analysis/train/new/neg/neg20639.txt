I purchased this product thinking it was similar to the 900mhz Crisp and Clear that I had for three years, boy was I wrong.  It's full of static.  It sounds like running water with the volume only turned up slightly.  I can't believe some people would rate this product acceptable!  I guess it's what you're use to.  I'm returning this product and seeing if I can find the old version on ebay!
