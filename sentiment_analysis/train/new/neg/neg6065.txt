I put these on cabinet doors just like in the picture and my kids 1.5 and 2.5 years both easily popped them open on the first try. Kind of expensive and really feeling the loss. The snap-open on the left comes apart really easily, and even though it goes back together, it still means that the kids are getting in. I will go back to the Munchkin XTRAGUARD latches that I bought for the fridge and microwave, as those have never let me down, and just chalk this $30 purchase up to a total loss. By the way, if you are trying to remove these or the Munchkins, try using a hair dryer to heat the adhesive and it will be less damaging to cabinet finishes and paint.
