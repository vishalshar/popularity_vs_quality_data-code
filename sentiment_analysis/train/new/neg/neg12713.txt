Our son is obsessed with his two blankie/lovies from Angel Dear and has been since he was born.  We thought he would love this just as much but really has no interest in it at all.  The material is slightly different from the smaller lovies so I think that is the problem, it isn't as milky soft.  However our older children do love the blanket and have taken it as theirs so all in all it was worth it and we may buy them another one.  Just don't expect it to be the same as the blankie/lovies they make.
