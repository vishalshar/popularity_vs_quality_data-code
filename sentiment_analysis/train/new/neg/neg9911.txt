My son started teething and overnight, turned into a woodpecker. The beautiful crib my parents bought him was utterly destroyed by his teethmarks and he woke up wit brown paint chips all over his mouth (ughhhh).  These covers saved the rest of the crib railing and my son from ingesting even more toxic crap, but at the price of losing the beauty of his nursery.  They are pretty hideous on his dark mahogany crib and after a month of use. Have become a bit loose and move now that he can pull himself up. I guess i'll file this product under "necessary but uuuuuugly."
