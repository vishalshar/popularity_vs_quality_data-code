I bought this for my city select stroller. It comes in handy for anytime you have to leave your stroller behind, zoo, amusement park, restaurants, small shops. It is pretty easy to use. You set a combo, pull out the cord, and then click it back in. It would've been helpful to have a slightly longer cord. My stroller is pretty wide, so I have to get just the right angle for the cord to wrap around the back tires. The monkey is very cute, but his little bow tie fell off right away. The quality is pretty good, not perfect. I do leave it attached to my stroller frame with the Velcro strap it has, very convenient. This lock will certainly make it harder for someone to roll off with your stroller. Small cost for some peace of mind.
