First of all, these scissors DO NOT HAVE curved blades. They're straight as straight can be. So that was a bummer. Besides, the metal is a little thicker than I'd like and they don't open/close very smoothly. But other than that, they're little scissors that are sharp enough and don't have sharp ends, so they'll work.
