I've had 6 of these for about 1 year. We exclusively cloth diaper our son, and our stash primarily consists of Bum Genius diapers, but we loved his Bummis covers from when he was little, so we decided to buy some of these as they are extremely simple & easy for babysitters & grandparents.The Pros:-they are adorable with some of the cutest prints available, which is a bonus in my book.-they are easy to stuff-the interior is SO soft!-the hook & loop closures are still in good condition 1 year laterThe Cons:-they are SIGNIFICANTLY less absorbent than our other diapers (I have to use at least 2 extra inserts)-they leak all the time (my other diapers do NOT leak, so I know its not a laundering issue)-the elastic is GONE! (I have had to put 3 away until I can rip up the diaper and re-do the elastic)-There is not an easy way to access the elastic to replace it.**We've laundered these according to the directions. My other diapers from other manufacturers are washed, stored, & used in the exact same fashion without these results. Unfortunately, this brand can not withstand a full year of use as well as other brands can, which is too bad since they're not cheap diapers.**
