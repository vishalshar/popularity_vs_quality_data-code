Holy cow, what a mess! I ordered two of these gates, and they came in separate boxes (actually the Amazon shipment sticker was pasted right on top of the box these come in- that is, the box you'd pick up at a store).  BOTH gates were broken. The wooden sides of both were cracked in a very similar fashion, but one was more damaged than the other.  That one also came out of the box in bits, as the wooden side wasn't the only crack in the gate. I put in for a return/refund. No point in ordering more of these cheap gates, which can't survive shipping and certainly wouldn't survive a toddler.
