I love the Alice in wonderland print! Its adorable but i will say these aren't exactly practical in the long term sense. My daughter is now 8 months old and she grew out of the car seat months ago. The stroller doesn't have anything like a cup holder or storage area at the handle for your personal belongings such as keys, phone, or drink like so many other strollers do. The carriage under the stroller doesn't allow you to easily put things into it or remove items, such as baby bags. I would have to shove my daughters small bag in and then rip it out every time she needed something. The back to the stroller adjusts by a very cheap kind of belt which doesn't allow your baby/toddler to sit upright. The car seat always seemed a little on the cheap side to me. It didn't take long before i could feel and hear the car seat handle struggling to stay in one piece while i carried my daughter from the car into a store or into our home.  My son is 8 years old and his grandmother bought a travel system for me that was with us until he turned 3. The car seat supported him for quite a long time and the stroller came with 2 cup holders as well as a small area in between them for other things. The carriage underneath of it folded up and down even while my son was in it for easy access to baby bags or purses. The seat on his stroller adjusted by means of a set of levers on either side of it and he was able to lay down completely or sit straight up and everything in between. It was just as cute as this travel system (Classic Winnie the Pooh accented with dark blue and beige)  and at near to the same price as i recall. i recently sold this travel system via craigslist because i wanted to use whatever money i received to by a new stroller that was at least going to be worth it and last. like i said its nice, but not exactly accommodating. More or less, you're paying for an image.
