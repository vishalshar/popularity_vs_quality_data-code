The write up said that the nipple was latex. It wasn't; it was silicon.  I used the Playtex nursers with my two children and bought this one for my grandson. The old Playtex nursers were a slim design that were easy to hold, not  bulky like the ones they have now.  They also had the latex nipples that were more natural than the silicon ones.  Hospitals use latex nipples. Maybe Playtex will wise up and bring back the slim design bottles fitted with latex nipples.  Also, if you are trying to measure the correct amount of water to mix with powdered formula, forget using these. The measurements are not right. One other thing, you sit and hold a bottle for about a 30 minute feeding time, these bulky bottles wear you out.
