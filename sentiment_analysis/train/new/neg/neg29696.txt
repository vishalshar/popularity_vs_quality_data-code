I bought this Ergo carrier after trying on the original baby carrier at a local store. I loved it and thought it was great,  so I ordered the newer one that was supposedly better, lighter, etc. Here are my reasons for not liking the Performance. The Performance comes up higher in the back so it makes it VERY difficult for my son to turn his head. He doesn't have much room to do much except give up trying and bury his head into my chest. He doesn't seem comfortable in it, and it is frustrating. With the original Ergo, it doesn't come up so high which gives baby more freedom to look around.I tried putting his arms up above the straps as pictured in ways to carry baby, but the front area is squared off and narrow so the straps end up cutting into his arms, leaving marks. Overall, I don't think this carrier is worth the money. My cheap $30 Snugli carried him better than this. Granted, it wasn't as comfortable for me, but at least baby was comfortable and could move his head around.Don't make the same mistake I did. Go with the original Ergo.
