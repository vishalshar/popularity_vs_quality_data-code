Nice bag for the price, cute but not too girly for a baby boy. Not the biggest diaper bag I have seen but I don't haul a lot of stuff around.I really liked this diaper bag when I got it, but only had it a month before the mesh that is part of the bottle holder on the side tore away from the top part where it is stitched to the edge, I was using the small 4oz skinny bottles, so I didn't do anything to make that happen.
