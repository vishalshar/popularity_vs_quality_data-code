I had high expectations for this blanket after reading the great reviews.  I bought one blanket to test embroidery on for a company baby gift. When I removed the tag, it ripped a whole in the blanket (it seemed the tag being punched through the fabric was enough to cause a whole). The material is nice, not too thick, and the size is generous. I could see this being a great lightweight, everyday car seat blanket.  Unfortunately, since the blanket ripped, I cannot give it a good review. The company should consider a plastic package to prevent this issue in the future.
