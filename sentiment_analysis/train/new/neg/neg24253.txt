This only covers the immediate car seat (so it falls short when used in the stroller) and wreak of plastic.We bought this because we have the Britax B-Agile 3 stroller and saw that this was the only rain cover option. This plastic rain cover does not fit over the canopy attached to the stroller. This means that it only covers half of the top of the car seat/stroller when we want to use it with the stroller.  it works fine if we want to lug the car seat around by itself outside.My other reason for the poor review is that it is still off-gassing even a few weeks after it was unwrapped and aired out outside in a well ventilated area.  I don't think it is a good idea to surround my infant with this when I can smell it so strongly from across the car or room.
