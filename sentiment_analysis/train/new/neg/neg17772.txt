Looked like a decent bib, perhaps for arts & crafts. However, not ideal for us (we have 20 month old), especially for eating. This was too large for him and I didn't like that it doesn't have a pocket in the front to catch anything that falls, which is usually lots of food. It arrived on time, so that was a plus.
