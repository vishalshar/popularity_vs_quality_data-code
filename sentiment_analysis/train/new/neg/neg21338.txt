Very tall cup. My baby will get 1/3 of the liquid out, then, give up. she needs to hold the cup so high up in order to get the rest 2/3 out of there.the sprout is slow flow. Takes her probably 2 hours to finish everything.So, she just give up.The handle works nice though. My baby can hold it running around, without leaking on the floor.Cute design. She likes the frogs on there.I have the smaller versions too. It's a little too small. I wanted to get a bigger one, but they should make itshorter and chubbier. This way, the bottle would not be so talk
