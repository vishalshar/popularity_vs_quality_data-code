We had our vehicle and carseat inspected prior to our child being born.  This is a free service offered by the highway patrol in our area.  The officer noticed that we had this product in the carseat.  He said that unless it came with the carseat you should never add one of these to your child's seat.  He gave many reasons, the main reason is that the carseat had not be crash-tested with the item in it and could therefore compromise your child's safety in the event of a crash.  He suggested using a receiving blanket that is rolled and laid in the same postion around their head, this way in the event of a crash the blanket will easily fly out and wont hurt the kiddo.  I would seriously urge all parents (new and pro's) to have their local highway patrol inspect their seat for safety.  I know that Babies-r-us out here does free carseat checks periodically, so there is another resource.  It can't hurt, and when it comes to our precious children, this is a 30 minute chunk of time I'm willing to give.
