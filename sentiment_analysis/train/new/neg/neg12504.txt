We bought this when my son was a baby to help sooth him to sleep. It never worked but, honestly, not much did. However, he is now 20 months old and loves to play with it because it has music and does project images. I must say, though the room has to be really dark on a light wall to get much and the ceiling is out of the question. It's not strong enough for that. BUT, it does angle so you can display on the wall. Overall, ok, but for us, not the miracle we were hoping for.
