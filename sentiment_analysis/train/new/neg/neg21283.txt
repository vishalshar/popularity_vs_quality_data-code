These toys are cute my kids (2 & 4) enjoy them, but I’m a little disappointed that they aren’t more interactive – that is, I thought the wheel inside the fish would turn when water flows through, but it doesn’t. The one inside the penguin turns a little. There’s really nothing too impressive that happens when the parts are connected – my kids enjoy playing with the parts separately more.
