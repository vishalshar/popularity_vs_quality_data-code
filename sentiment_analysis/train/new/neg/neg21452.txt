I love our Sili Squeeze, but the Nipple Spouts don't last more than a few weeks for us. Our daughter chews on it and it eventually cracks open on one side between the base and the nipple opening. Otherwise the product has been really helpful for our snack needs. I usually just mix some yogurt, apples sauce/homemade baby food, sometimes add some probiotic powder if we need it. We take these as a snack to go and it's been great. I've recommended to friends with the warning that the spouts are likely to fail in after a period of time (I think our first one lasted longer, once she figured out she could bite through it became her mission).
