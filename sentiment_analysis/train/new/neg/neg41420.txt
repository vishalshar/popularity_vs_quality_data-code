I received this in a box marked "insurance provided not for resale" so was unhappy to have bought it from Amazon.  Similar to what someone else mentioned mine also leaks air through the connection of the yellow rubber port plug.  I have used it a few times and it also seems the suction is decreasing.  I contacted medela and they have been helping me with the issue and sending new parts.  I would not recommend buying this particular pump.  I have a Medela pump in style from my insurance which I love and it works great.
