Sadly all the bad reviews were not lies.  This is the only mirror I have found that fits my giant mirror with built in garage door openers but, besides that it pretty much sucks.  I would have returned it, but I need to "see" my kiddos and for some reason no one else out there has created a functional mirror that will fit my Merano.  The screw is crappy and doesn't work, the mirror is super cheap and makes your kids faces look like funny photos you take in iPhoto.  I am going to try and get a stick on mirror from the auto store just so my eyes don't hurt from the wonky image I keep trying to focus on.
