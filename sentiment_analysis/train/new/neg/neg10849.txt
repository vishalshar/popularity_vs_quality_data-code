I emailed the company asked it behind their product  my daughters had hers for few months and it started ripping.  They told me it was past the 20 day warranty period. Believe that a 20 day warranty too bad, best regards.  If they only stand behind their product for 20 days  I would not do this with them and urge you not to do it with them either!  Other than  ripping my daughter loved it.
