I bought this for my little sisters birthday, I got her tickets to one of the shows and cut a slit in his hand to slide the tickets through so it looked like he was holding them. Then I played the waiting game.It was awful. For some reason I thought it was a good idea to set him up in front of my patio doors facing the front door. Every time I came home I had a heart attack. I'd go out to get my mail, forget he was there, and scream out loud when I came back in. Going downstairs to get a glass of water at night, he looked like the shadow of an evil demon burglar. My bad for buying it so far in advance of my sisters birthday and then leaving it set up in my living room.The three stars are not because I was afraid of a cardboard man (if I was rating for my level of discomfort it would be -19,000 stars) but rather because he did not hold up for very long and begin buckling at the knees after a few months. Granted, we had taken to hiding him in closets and bathrooms, and sticking him outside looking in through the windows around the house hoping to scare the crap out of each other but still, I paid good money for this thing.
