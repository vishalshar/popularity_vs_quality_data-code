Let me just say that I LOVED this product. I was going to give it 5 stars but the zipper broke this morning and I've only used it for 3 months. From what I can see I'm not eligible for return or repair because I bought it in august 2015 in preparation for my baby arriving in the end of September, so that's pretty s***ty because this was an expensive, high quality product and now I have to look for outside help for repair. But the product was amazing until this happened.
