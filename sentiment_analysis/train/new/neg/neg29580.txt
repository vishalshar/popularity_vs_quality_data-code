I got the starter bib because my baby is only 5 months old. On its descriptions and other reviews I saw, it stated that it was for my babies age range. I bought the bib when she was 4 months which is when I began to feed her cereal. I read great reviews about using while feeding cereal. Needless to say in the month I've had it I've used it twice because of the mess it made. The cereal would slide right off and she would have so much cereal in her neck (more than the usual ;) ) The hair at the nape of her neck was caked with cereal. And I don't make her cereal really runny. I just use regular bibs now that actually catch the food plus I can wipe her mouth real quick which you can't do with this one. Also, even after wiping it and/or washing it it stayed sticky. Reason why I gave it 2 stars is bc MAYBE it will work with other foods down the road.
