We bought this booster for our soon to be three year old.  It is really, really, big.  We intended to take it on a flight, but opted for his sister's covertible instead (she's still a lap child) and checked his.  Thank goodness we did!  This seat would have not fit in the airplane seat comfortably.  He already puts his feet on the seat in front of him, but he would have been kicking the person in front of him in this chair.It's a nice fit for him with plenty of room to grow.  My biggest issue is the size.  It barely fits in my sedan.  I even had to move the seat up so it didn't squish his legs.  Other than that, it seems pretty safe and relatively comfy for him.
