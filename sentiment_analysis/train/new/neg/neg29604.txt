I ordered this awhile ago. It's too late to return it according to amazon but i would like to take advantage of your 100% money back guarantee. The "amber" in this necklace is fake, I have just tested it, as I was just informed that real Baltic amber sinks in tap water and floats in salt water. Well yours floats in tap water, meaning the beads are plastic not stone. Terribly disappointing. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
