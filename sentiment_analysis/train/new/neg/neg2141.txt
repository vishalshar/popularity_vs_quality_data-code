My son is 2.5 years old and he picked out the color of the helmet online himself and absolutely loves wearing it!  Once it's on, it is very comfortable for him, but it is a tight fit. It fits him perfectly right now and cannot be extended out any further to make it larger. I feel like he will out grow it by the end of the summer and according to the description it should fit 1-4 year olds.  I did not bother to measure his head circumference because he has always been in the 50th percentile and I figured it would be pretty big on him and he would grow into it, however it looks like he will shortly be growing out of it and has only worn it 3 times since I got it in the beginning of April.  Of course I already threw the box away and probably cannot return it.  Although it is a little small for him, it really is a great, comfortable and sturdy helmet.
