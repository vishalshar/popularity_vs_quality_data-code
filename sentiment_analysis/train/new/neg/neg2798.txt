I broke several fingernails following their tiny directions only to find out it did not apply. I went online to find more detailed directions, but no. I finally lurched my way to connect the basket to the scale bottom. Had to go get batteries although their directions said they were included. I still have two parts I don't know what are and which don't show up on any of their material. I got this to keep up with my food addict cat. The vet gave me a probable good weight for her as she looked like an Irish potato. I had been sick and let them self feed. Wrong. With cats, dieting must be done very very gradually or they get kidney disorders. This product fits weighing a now 12 lb cat, but I would not use it otherwise. I figure a company that can't take time to put detailed instructions online or answer questions don't care about me or my money.
