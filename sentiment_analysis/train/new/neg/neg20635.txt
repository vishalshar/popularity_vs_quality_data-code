It works great on my switches that don't gave a dimmer on them. It doesn't, however, work on ones that have a small sliding dimmer (next to the switch) on them. The main reason I bought these was for my 3 year old to be able to reach the bathroom switches and his bedroom switch. I can't use it in his room though because of the dimmer...back to the drawing board. (Note: it will attach to the one with a dimmer and turn the light on and off but it constantly pushed the dimmer all the way down so that even if flipped "on" it is still very dark.)
