I just received this baby gate today. As a first time parent, I researched baby gates for hours, attempting to find the perfect one for our needs.  My husband and I were going back and forth on this gate and a less expensive gate from a different company. We decided to splurge and buy the "better" of the two, but am now VERY disappointed with our purchase. In fact, I am irate enough to take time to take pictures of everything wrong with this gate.For starters, the gate had a greasy feeling to it as I pulled it out of the packaging, which I thought was odd. As soon as the packaging was off I instantly noticed the metal along the top of the gate was very flawed and looked like it was manufactured improperly. I also noticed it was very dusty and certainly did not look NEW. The main thing that really irked me, was the plastic part of the gate that actually locks was pretty beaten up, and almost looked like it had been chewed on, I'm assuming from use.  Also, the "Dreambaby" logo sticker on the plastic part of the gate is already peeling up in the corner. I then realized this gate had clearly been used. As I inspected it closer, I saw globs of either glue or some kind of greasy substance in the locking mechanism of the gate.  On top of all of that there are scratches and fingerprints all over the gate.  My guess is that this was a returned product that the company "spruced up" to resell.  $80 for a baby gate is certainly not cheap, and I don't want to receive cheap second-hand items for that amount of money.  Not impressed one bit.
