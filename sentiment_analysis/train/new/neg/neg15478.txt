Long story short: it was supposed to be a 10" high mattress. I asked the question of the seller specifically, and they replied to say it was definitely a 10" mattress. The product description and order form both said it was a 10" mattress. The price charged was for the 10" mattress. However it is only 8" tall - nowhere near 10", I know it sounds like 'not a huge difference' but it actually is a huge difference and doesn't fit properly on the bed which required a 10" or higher mattress due to the headboard. It's not what I ordered, and not what I paid for. (The 8" mattress from the same company is a lower price point.) The label on the mattress says "2 in 1" which is supposed to be 10" tall. But it's not.It took 2 weeks for the mattress to arrive but it was delivered exactly when it was promised.Other than that huge lie about the height of the mattress (or maybe it's an illegal bait and switch), I can confirm that there is no smell. It is comfortable and definitely not too firm (plush side). I will update this review if the seller contacts me, or if I notice anything else worth mentioning after my kid sleeps on it for a while.
