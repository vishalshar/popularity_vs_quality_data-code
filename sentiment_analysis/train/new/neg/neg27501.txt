I love the my brest friend nursing pillow but purchased this hoping I could use it with a rocking chair that had arms. It fit within the arms of the chair but it was too soft for me. The shape was good but the weight of the baby (now 13 lbs) was flattening the pillow. If I was confident at sewing, I'd tear it open and add more filler to make it firmer.I purchased the Kushies foam pillow and prefer that much better to the Leacho. The Leacho cover is not removable and mine is starting to fall apart where the trim meets the pillow fabric. I think a few stitches can fix it, but it's disappointing since it's not very old. It does not have a pocket or a handle to carry it. I usually carry it by the tag that sticks out of the front.I prefer my brest friend for the majority of my nursing, but the Kushies is second best, especially for a chair with arms or for taking it with you because it's a little smaller than the brest friend.
