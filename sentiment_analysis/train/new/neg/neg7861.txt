I liked Bumkins junior bibs so much that I bought 3 of them.  They are great for keeping your kids clean during meals.  But after awhile, they always smell putrid.  Unless you machine wash them every single day.  I was literally washing them promptly and drying them promptly and they'd still smell vile after about 4 months of use.  Pop them int he washing machine and they smell fresh but literally the next time you hand wash it, it smells putrid.  I don't have time to wash this thing every day.
