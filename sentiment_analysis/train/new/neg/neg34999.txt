This would have been a four-star review if this weren't the most delicate stroller ever.  For the cost, I expect more from Phil&Teds.  (Truth be told, we are happy owners of a Phil&Teds Verve double stroller.) This was our go-to stroller for travel.  For its size, it's not heavy, the compact design is great and it doesn't take up a lot of trunk space.  We found it easy to open and close and had no problems navigating.  Unfortunately, it is not strong enough to stand up to being tossed around by baggage handlers.  Within eight months of occasional travel through airports, we had major problems on our hands.  The caps on top of the front wheels had disappeared, the front wheels didn't navigate well, the brake was difficult to engage, and the screws holding the canopy had worn and popped off from being regularly opened and closed.Phil&Teds customer service was great and provided an updated replacement.  We have chosen not to use the replacement for air travel.  Even so,  the braking system on the new stroller began failing within a few months.
