I was so excited when I found this bedding!  I thought that it looked perfect, had great colors and wasn't too flashy.  I was amazed that the delivery was very fast and rushed to open the box and see how cute it was.  I opened the box and to my dismay, I was incredibly disappointed.  The bedding was nothing like the pictures online.  The colors and pattern were terrible.  The pictures displayed online are quite deceiving when compared to the actual product.  I love the pictures online, the bedding looks so sweet and was extremely disappointed when I opened the package and found ugly, non-baby like bedding.  The colors were just terrible.  The pattern looked cheap.  Baby Supermall still charges you if you received free shipping from Amazon and you have to pay for the shipping back, but to me it was well worth the shipping costs.
