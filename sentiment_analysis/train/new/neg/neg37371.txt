We needed this crib for when our grandchild visits. Because it wasn't going to get used regularly, we decided to purchase an inexpensive fold up crib which would be easier to store when not in use. We purchased this inexpensive crib with a discount through Amazon warehouse in "like new" condition, knowing that the packaging would be damaged. The crib arrived, and as soon as I opened the box, loose screws and hardware began falling out of the box. Fortunately, all of the proprietary hardware was still there, and we were only missing a few screws and washers, which I happened to have on hand. Assembly is simple, but is much easier with two pair of hands. Note that If you try to assemble this crib by yourself you run the risk of tearing out connecting points and ruining the crib.The reason I gave this crib 3 stars is because the two long rails are slightly bowed out on the bottom, which renders a plastic latch that is attached to the floor of the crib inoperable. I believe that latch is to prevent another child from pushing up the floor of the crib from underneath. There are no other children in the house, so that wasn't an issue for me. There are two side latches that prevent the crib from folding inward at the short ends, and they latch tight. If you are looking for a well made quality crib, this is not it. If you're looking for an inexpensive full size folding crib for occasional use, this might be exactly what you're looking for.
