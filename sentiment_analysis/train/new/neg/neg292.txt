I was so excited to get my Gemini….it is beautiful.But honestly for as much as it costs I expected more.The shoulder straps are not padded enough and aster just a few minutes my shoulder are killing me.  My baby is not very heavy……I am 108lbs 5"3 and the waist strap can not get any tighter yet it is too large for my waist.  because of this I can't strap him higher up which is what I need….so  I have to tighten the shoulder straps tighter to support his bottom .  aAll in all it does not work for me.  All of his weight is being put on my shoulders because the waist is too large.  Also the waistband its self needs to be wider.My husband has an ERGO .  Much more comfortable and baby is happier in it too.Now site somewhere in its boxI would not buy again :(  160 dollars wasted..I bought a limited edition ginger overall
