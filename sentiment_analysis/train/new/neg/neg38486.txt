The Peapod is well made and comes in a small carrying case.  The problem for us was that our son sits up in his sleep to change directions and his head hit the top. He is about 30 inches tall when standing.  The larger size Peapod Plus was too long for us and the smaller one was too short.  We ended up returning it. It also took several YouTube videos to see how to repack it!
