The idea of this seemed great and I bet it's wonderful to keep the pacifier nearby or in the mouth of a small baby.  We use wubbanub and other similar things to keep the pacifier easy to find in the middle of the night for our toddler.  The Velcro is weak on this and he very easily rips the pacifier off.  It also isn't as soft as it looks in the picture, but it isn't rough either.  Maybe it would be softer after being washed.
