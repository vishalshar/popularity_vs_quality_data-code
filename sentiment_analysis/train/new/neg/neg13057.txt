I don't usually write reviews but I'm super bummed about this product. I absolutely loved it for the first month and it helped my low back pain. But then the Velcro stopped working. I've only washed it twice on cold water and hung to dry...so I think mine is defective? Anyway because it's been more than 30 days since I purchased, i called amazon and They said I can't get replacement band. At this much money I would expect the product to work through my entire pregnancy.
