Gorgeous blanket. I was so excited to receive it. I bought for my newborn while still pregnant. I washed it before her arrival so she'd be able to use it right away. I was so disappointed with it when I pulled it from the dryer. It was so soft and beautiful before. Now the giraffe print side isn't soft and its shedding like crazy. I had to wash it again to get more of the fuzz off it before using it. I'm sad because I love it so much. The bottom side is in perfect shape and is still soft. The satin trim is still beautiful and soft. It's just the faux fur that is poor quality.
