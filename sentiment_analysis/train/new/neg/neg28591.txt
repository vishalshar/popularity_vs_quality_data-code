Well, we like this system. It does everything that the listing/ad says it will and it's a time saver for sure being able to talk to and see your child/children. Especially when our 22mo old awakens in the middle of the night and just needs to hear your voice and those times when you wake and just have that feeling that you just have to walk to yes other side of the house and check in on them. In that case this saves you the a lot of time and all because you can just reach over and see everything that's going on, or not.lol...The only major PITA so far has been that the power supply has just burnt out. We bought it on March 23, 2014 and yesterday morning (Only 4 Months of proper usage) I find it dead and almost dead. I'm really glad that I it lasted to the morning hours because if it hadn't this part would've been a whole different read... I can't imagine not being able to see and hear your children now that we're a bit spoiled by Samsung.lol... But, it's a damned nice unit and other than the power supply dying we really have no complaints that I can think of right off the top of my head...Hopefully I'll be able to get a new one shipped to us. I'll update this and let you all know how their Customer Service treats me and our case...Have a Great Week!
