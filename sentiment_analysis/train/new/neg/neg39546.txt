I didn't realize in ordering these that they had a delicate vinyl back (think old school diaper plastic pants). I ordered two packs, for twins, and literally within a week the backs are destroyed. To salvage, I went to the fabric store and bought cloth diaper fabric, aka the waterproof polyester that comes with the organic version. My tip, skip both products and borrow a sewing machine. You can buy quilted fabric for the top and waterproof backing at the fabric store, and for $20 probably be able to make 10 with a yard of each.
