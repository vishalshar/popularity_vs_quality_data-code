I should have read some of the more recent reviews on this product. I ordered 2 packages for my toddler and they arrived in fine shape, but when I opened them, none of the lids would fit on the plates at all (not even close).  I washed and used one of the plates anyway and warmed up some food in the microwave on the plate with the steamer lid just sitting on top (not attached).  It was in there for 45 seconds on 60% power.  The food warmed up nicely, but the bottom of the plate warped / melted.  Going to return the unopened package and throw the rest away as there's no telling what plastic-y chemicals it will leach into my toddler's food if it won't even stand up to 45 seconds in the microwave without melting!  Nuk / Gerber should discontinue this product - it's not safe in my opinion.
