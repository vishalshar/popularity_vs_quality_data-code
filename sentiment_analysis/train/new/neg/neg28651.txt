Typically, baby clothes and baby's linens are washed before use. And so I did. This sheet was so badly wrinkled after drying. The fabric felt coarser than the bedsheets I use myself. I mean I would not think the fabric is gentle enough for baby's skin. So, I ended up ironing it so it wouldn't feel as coarse; but, who would want to iron bedsheets and go through the hassle of doing so?
