It is so small he is unable to get his penis inside of the bowl part to pee pee in it, it is impossible for him to do this, even when the option of placing on the top of the real potty.  He loves the potty it just is not usable for potty purpose, instead he sits on it in the living room fully dressed like it is his personal TV chair, he calls it his choo choo chair! But I am looking for a new potty chair that he'll fit on. He is not that big either, He is 2 1/2, weighs 35 lbs. and is 36" tall, so he is bigger as in taller than most 2 year olds, but he is not fat.  I am thinking of going with the Babybjorn potty instead, I need to really investigate the sizes before wasting more money.
