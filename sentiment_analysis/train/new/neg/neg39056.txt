This is a great way to track your child's milestones however beware- if you try to use it for the month of their first birthday and second birthday, it will NOT fit. I made the mistake of writing in the months and days starting with her first birthday month and then got to the end and there wasn't an extra calendar for her 2nd birthday. So disappointed in that. Other than that, it's a good durable product that seems it will last many years to come.
