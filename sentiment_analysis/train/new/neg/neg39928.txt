These were a mixed bag purchase of me. I originally bought them for my newborn- they were too long and prevented the chest buckle on our Peg Perego carseat from being at armpit level. I gave them to my sister for her 2 year old's convertible carseat and they were a perfect fit.So, these are great for older kids, but I would definitely try them out on your carseat and check the fit before using them on smaller children and carseats.
