I love the stroller and the idea of the stroller, but the handles seem flimsy and one side of the handle has already come off (this is with occasional weekend use walking around a mall). I've written to the company that sold it, but have not received a response to the email. Regarding the handles seeming flimsy, it takes extra effort by me to turn and navigate the stroller because the handles seem loose. My cousin has a Maclaren Quest for her daughter and she loves it. I tried pushing that stroller around and the handles are not flimsy at all. She also purchased the stroller through Amazon, so I figured buying this Maclaren would be a great thing. Other than the flimsy handles that feel like they're going to break, everything else about the stroller is great.
