These are good hemp inserts. We use them as doublers for our two month old heavy wetter. However, we have other inserts that we prefer to these because these are long and a little wider than we would like. We ordered (from Amazon) HappyEndings Heavy Wetter 4 Layer Organic Hemp & Cotton Inserts for Cloth Diapers, and we reach for those first. The BabyKicks just don't fit easily into the pocket diapers we have. Our daughter is still small but I think we'll probably still have a problem stuffing these into some of her diapers even as she gets bigger. Please take a look at the attached photos. Two sizes of bumGenius microfiber inserts are on the left. BabyKicks insert is on the right of the ruler and HappyEndings is on the far right.
