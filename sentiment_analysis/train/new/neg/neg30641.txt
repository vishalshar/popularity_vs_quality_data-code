I bought the original Summer Infant model and loved it had no problems with it. I ordred this one because I was expecting another child. Used just one camera and had it plugged in and it worked great. I bought it November 2013 and now its Aug 2014 and I want to throw it against the wall. I recently hooked up both cameras and had it unplugged from charger and it just shuts itself off when it wants too. Now when its on the charger screen goes blank and says out of range and takes a few minutes to come back on. Not near anything that would interfere with it either. The static is also HORRIBLE!!! I would not recommend this to anyone.
