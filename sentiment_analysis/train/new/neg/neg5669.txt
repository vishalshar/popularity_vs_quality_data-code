Purchased this stroller because it was the lightest side-by-side stroller, but it does not go over those city sidewalks bumps and cracks too well.  You need to constantly put your foot on basket to lift it up over each uneven pavement.  I wish it had bigger wheels and better traction.  Also, the basket is not very deep but large in width and the front bar-child trays are hard to snap open.
