I had been using the lansinoh bags and after a few leaks tried the green sprouts storage bags which were great but pretty costly - the honeysuckle bags have been great! Affordable price and no leaks :)**Updated** Now that we are in full swing using these bags to defrost milk for Daycare I can give a better review. I have had 3 leaky bags out of about 100 which have been defrosted so far... there were no holes when I put the milk in but the 3 that have leaked seem to have come apart at the seems when frozen. I have about a months worth of milk frozen in them right now and I sure hope that there aren't more leaks... as a 3% failure rate isn't great. I will update again in another month as that will be another 140 bags we have defrosted.* Update 2* I freeze 8 bags a day - 6 oz of milk in each. I defrost 5 a day. Today 3 of my 5 which were left to thaw overnight were leaking. All were from different batches and all were leaking along the seams. I cannot even put into words the anxiety I have about the fate of my entire freezer full of milk stored in these bags.... To lose 18 oz today was heartbreaking.
