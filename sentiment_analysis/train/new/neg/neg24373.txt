The idea of this tub is great and it has 2 sides that can be used. One is flat for newborns and the other side dips for when your baby can sit up by themselves.We always hang it up to dry up in the bathroom but after 7 months of using it on a regular basis it has started to smell a bit. Also the colors bled a bit, mostly the red color.
