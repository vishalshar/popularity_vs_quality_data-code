Well, I had been wanting this particular wallet for over a year and finally took the plunge and purchased it.It is a little bulkier than I expected.  The Earth Leather material really does look like a faux leather.  There is no way I could ever be convinced the look is similar to real leather.There are a lot of slots for cards and things but for some reason, it holds the same amount as my old wallet yet it is about 1.5 times bulkier.  My old wallet definitely needed to be replaced and I could never find a similar one so I had high hopes this would be the perfect wallet.  Alas, it is not.
