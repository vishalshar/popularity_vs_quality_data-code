We use this every night to help put our 6 month old to sleep.  He enjoys the colors and twinkling of the stars and the music is very calming.  The 'light show' is actually very nice, so we sit in his rocker and watch it w/ the lights out for about 5 minutes before he goes to his crib.  It does have its CONS though: 1) No volume control and is VERY loud - I taped one of those cotton facial pads to both of the speakers to muffle the sound and now it is perfect.  If we want it louder, we just remove one (strange, but it works!).  2) Music is not that exciting of a selection.  We use one in particular that we both enjoy and that's it.  One of them is a Christmas song and another is the "Titanic" song, but they are all chimey, lullaby sounding at least. 3) The buttons/controls are hard to see, but it is a simple design, so once you know how to use it, you don't need to look at them anymore.Overall, I think it was worth the $11 I paid for it, most likely b/c it has worked for us.  If you're looking for something 'fancy,' this certainly isn't it; but if you're looking for something cheap and simple, it might work for you too.
