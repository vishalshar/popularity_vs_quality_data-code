After using this pad for a couple of months, I'm finally ready to give it a fair review. I think this item received alot of positive reviews because most people review it too early on. There are better and cheaper pads than this one. I ordered this for the four sides. But be beware that the plastic cover is not tightly secured like other pads are which causes it to tent up and easily rip since it tugs around when your baby shifts on top of it. The main reason is because the flimsy plastic cover is loosely stretched over the frame and only the edge is stitched underneath. The integrity of this is not sturdy and mine has a rip on it from normal use. The worst part about this pad is that the plastic does not cover the back, instead there's a thin material that's similar to a used dryer sheet and it will fray and pick up dust like a Swiffer. I'm throwing mine out because the bottom gets disgusting with all the dust and hair it attracts (Yes I do keep my house clean so that's not the issue). It's quite unsanitary especially if it comes in contact with a wet or soiled surface. Please view the pictures I uploaded of the tenting and fraying. I would recommend getting the Summer Infant Changing Pad instead. The material is easier to wipe, the plastic is secured throughout via the quilted design, and the whole pad is covered and protected with the same sturdy material.
