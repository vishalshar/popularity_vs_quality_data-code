I bought this thinking it would be perfect for my teething 6 month old.  Everything goes right in her mouth.  I took it out of the package and washed it thoroughly and gave it to her.  She seemed to like it. So I sat down and continued to work on my computer.  Until I heard a little shriek.  I quickly jumped up and went over to her and noticed a little blood on her mouth.  I took the teether from her and that's when I felt it.  Those bumps on the red part are sharp plastic bumps. It actually hurt my hand.  I can't imagine how it felt when she bit on it.  I understand they aren't supposed to bite that part of it.  But what teething kid wouldnt.  Maybe the one I got was just defective and the plastic isn't usually sharp, but just be careful.  Broke my heart to know I gave her something that hurt her like that.
