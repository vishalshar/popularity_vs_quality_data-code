I'm a mom of three and never have I seen utensils break so easily.  We've almost broken the entire pack.  Plus I bought these assuming they were a more earth friendly and baby safe option than standard plastic, but I'm not sure.  The package looks "green" but doesn't state that these are either recyclable or biodegradable.  I can't image something that breaks so quickly is helping the planet.
