Extremely soft, nice style and fantastic button to serve as both a bib and a burp cloth with a ton of coverage.  It is also nice and absorbent.  My 4 month old LO spits up a LOT and can drench himself and whomever is burping him.  This saves the day and a lot of clothing changes.  My baby also loves how soft it is and will play with it in his hands and often put it in his mouth to chew which he's found soothing.  I'm also very pleased with the look...I'm proud of my baby wearing it all the time (literally...he's in it a lot) without looking cheesy like with a lot of baby bibs out there.  I would order a million of these except this particular one's fabric pulled - all over - in the wash, even though I did it on low tumble dry.  It didn't snag on anything, but the fabric deteriorated quite a bit, something I've never encountered with my aden + anais products.  A huge bummer but I'm going to return it and send in for a new one (thank you Amazon Prime!) hoping that it was a fluke.  It didn't happen to my friend's nor to the same product in the Organic - Oasis style.
