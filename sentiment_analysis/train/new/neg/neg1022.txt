This may be awesome, but it certainly is not what I purchased! It is made by Tiny Love, but it looks nothing like the "blue" option in the pictures. I haven't opened it and used it yet but I find it to be annoying that I purchased something based off of the pictures and what I received is NOT what is pictured! For that, I'm giving it 2 stars. I'll update in a few weeks after we've used it for a while to let readers know if the fake mobile is worth it (if I don't return it before then)
