The fence itself serves the purpose, but the cap on the ground sleeves is nothing more than a cheap, thin, flexible plastic cap. So, if you hit a rock and need to pull the sleeve out to relocate it, plan on the cap being ruined after one use, and you need some sort of cap to prevent the soil from entering the sleeve so the sleeve remains hollow.  I don't know why they didn't design it with a better quality end cap.
