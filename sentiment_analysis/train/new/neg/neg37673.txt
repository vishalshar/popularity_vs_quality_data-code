Liked/DislikedBy the time our son was two weeks old my husband and I were purchasing our third car seat.We chose this seat because our son's fit was snug and secure.  Something that was a problem with the others we owned, our son's head dangled no matter what level it was adjusted, even with a head support.So, this time we took our son in the store and fit him in every car seat they had in stock.This model far exceeded the others in regards to a secure fit.It was also very easy to get our son in and out of, in reference to the actual car seat.Problems:First, if your vehicle isn't equipped with the latch system, which one of ours was not, the base is hard to keep from moving  more than the one inch recommened by law enforcement.We were able to prop the base with a towel as recommended, and then my husband with all his might would tighten the seat belt and knot, so that it would not loosen, which kept the base from moving. I personally never took the base out because I could not tighten it to keep it from moving.  The whole process was quite an ordeal.However, we found that when the seat was placed on leather interior we did not have this problem at all, only with cloth interior.Secondly, the arm when raised and lowered has a loud clicking sound which woke our baby whenever he was sleeping.The arm was also physically difficult to move up and down.Third, putting our son/carseat back in the base, required physically getting in our vehicle and pushing down and then pulling on the seat it self, because at times only one side would engage.However, the release for being able to pull the baby/carseat out together - easily, works great!Fourth, now that our son is at 22 lbs, which is the maximum weight allowance for this model, we must buy another seat.  We cannot forward face the seat and be able to use for weights up to 35-40 lbs.Overall:50/50We had no other option.
