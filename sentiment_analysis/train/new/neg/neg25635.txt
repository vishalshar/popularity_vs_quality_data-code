We upgraded to this monitor when our 2nd daughter was born. We loved our first video monitor, but to add a camera to it would have cost as much as this system did.There are several issues with this system.Our issues are as follows:1. The battery on the monitor barely lasts 3-4 hours fully charged. Our last monitor set lasted an entire night.2. The camera with the green circling light is annoying, our 3 year old still asks why is does it.3. The system drops connectivity almost nightly, our last one rarely did.4. Even when the video is working the sound will drop off - super frustrating when trying to hear our girls, especially since our oldest has night terrors.5. Numerous times the buttons on the monitor have gotten stuck resulting in the sounds waking up the girls and sometimes scaring them.I wouldn't recommend this system for anything. It isn't worth the money we invested.
