This toy hammock rocks!! I told my daughter that I bought her a hammock that would hold all her stuff animals. This would have been true if she only had two or three small teddy bears. I think I may have been sent a mesh half shirt from the 80s. I was thinking about sending this back, but maybe I'll start a hair band instead and wear this. This would be good to put onions in. Heck, this would make a great play web for my spider man doll. Freaking He-Man would put a hurting on Spider Man. In my pretend battle I would totally use this hammock and wrap up He-Man. He would be so mad and spider man would be laughing, but then the womping would happen. Any who, this hammock sucks big time for teddy bear storage but more than makes up for it in Spider Man / He-Man battles.Update: I sent the little crappy one back and was sent the actual Lionheart Jumbo Hammock. The Jumbo one is very nice and works well. If you received one of the little crappy ones, return it and Amazon will send you the real one.
