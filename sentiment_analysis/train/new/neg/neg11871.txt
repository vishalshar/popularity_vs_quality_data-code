I want to make sure no one else has the same problem I did. I purchased this rain cover because the picture shows it fitting a Baby Jogger stroller almost perfectly. I own a Britax B-Agile double and they are almost the same in size and style so I figured it should be a perfect fit. WRONG!! The cover didn't even make it to the seat. It literally hung just above their knees.As for the cover itself, it is nice and easy to attach. Seems to be good quality and would probably work best on a smaller umbrella type stroller.
