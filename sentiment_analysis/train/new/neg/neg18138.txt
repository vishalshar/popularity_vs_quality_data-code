I am a very average sized man, and my hand barely fit through the strap. These also felt like they would not hold the weight of the stroller. We live in a very hilly neighborhood, so a runaway stroller was a serious concern for me. I ended up buying some sown Black Diamond runners (used for rock climbing, so you know they are strong enough), and girth-hitched one to the stroller. I think the BD runner was less expensive than this, too.
