I ordered this for my sons crib and it was the WORST mistake I've made!! After the first wash, it started to fray along the edges. After the 2nd wash, all the squares were coming apart and you can't sew them back because it would not look right. The little strings that hold the bumpers to the crib are horrible... some ripped completly off so that section of the bumper does not stay on the crib. I have had the set for 9 months now and i will be replacing it today. It is completely horrible. Looks nice but the quality of it is minus 10. For the price I paid for it, I expected tons more out of it. I could have gone to the dollar store and probably found something that worked better, that's how cheap this set is!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED, do not buy and save your self the money!!
