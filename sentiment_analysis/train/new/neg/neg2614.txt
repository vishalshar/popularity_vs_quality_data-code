While I was happy to find there was some solution to sticking tape on my son's bottles each day with his name, it still seems like there could be something better.  These said you could write on with ink or permanent marker.  I used ink but it started fading/rubbing off after two washings.  The bad part is that it won't come completely off so you can start over again, it stays behind and now just looks really messy as his name has been re-written over it.  I should have followed the more permanent instructions and done the boiling water and dishwasher part from the beginning.  Maybe permanent marker works better.  Still a better idea than tape!
