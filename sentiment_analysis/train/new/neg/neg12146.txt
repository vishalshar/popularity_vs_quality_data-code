Works for the 'pokey' feet, but did not fit our crib well at all.  I had to rig it, but it works.UPDATED - After using for a bit... it has stretched and slides down the crib rails.  My little one is reaching out and untying the strings now, so I removed from crib.  I would recommend looking elsewhere.  I have a three sided crib with a solid wall panel.
