I really wanted to like this cup, since my granddaughters love Mickey.  However, it is unreasonable to expect a toddler to hold a cup upright all the time, and if this cup is not upright, it leaks --a lot.  I finally threw it away after lots of spills.  I replaced it with the Munchkin Miracle 360 degree cup, which never, ever leaks or spills.  I bought some Mickey stickers from Amazon, and everyone is happy.  I primarily bought this for an 18-month-old, but  her 4-year-old sister loves it too.  Luckily, they come in a package of 2.
