I live in a small apartment and I got this washer to handle baby-related laundry. I do not have separate cold and hot water taps by which to hook up the washer, so I resorted to connecting my single bathroom sink faucet to the cold water intake. I quickly discovered, (given that setup) that I could only get hot water washes if I use the Baby Care settings (Super Sanitize, Sanitize, and Baby Clothes). Unfortunately these cycles are incredibly long (100 minutes or more). With the Normal, Delicates, Quick Wash, Rinse & Spin cycles, I could only get water at the temperature coming out of my bathroom sink faucet (if you do not have a hot water tap connected, you always have to select "Cold" for the water supply type and there are no options with the Normal, Delicates, Quick Wash, Rinse & Spin cycles to select at temperature for the water to be heated to). I suspect I can manually adjust the temperature going in for the wash part of the cycle by adjusting my bathroom sink faucet taps, so all is not lost.By the way, the User Manual does not contain any information about the minimum/maximum temperatures or times of each cycle and I could not get any information out of the poorly trained Samsung representative. I only understood what was going on with the machine after reading TOPJOY7''s review (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5QQR1C2EEJHJ/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNNOIWU) - so thank you.
