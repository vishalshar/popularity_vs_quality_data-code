I bought this crib for a first time mother, per family and friends suggestions she's started purchasing baby items 3 months before her due date so that she could gradually accumulate everything. We bought the crib in late July and she is due in October. With that said, we put the crib in storage (in the house) as July would be too early to have the crib sitting there for 3 months. We recently opened the box to begin assembling it. The first thing we noticed were the amount of defects. We purchased the black color, so it isn't hard to see scratches and if paint has chipped off and wood was exposed. I would encourage anyone purchasing to examine the crib as soon as it's delivered to you to prevent being disappointed. Other than the defects/scracthes, it's a perfect sized mini crib, pretty sturdy and easy to assemble.
