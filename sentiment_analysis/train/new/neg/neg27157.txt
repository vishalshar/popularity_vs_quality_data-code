It didn't really work as well as I'd hopped on the shopping carts. I was hoping it would be more secure than it actually was, plus it was a little weird trying to push the cart around with the fabric covering the handle loosely...We kept having to adjust it while shopping with my toddler and a preschooler, we wound up removing it after a while. I really had higher hopes for this though...The colors are cute though!
