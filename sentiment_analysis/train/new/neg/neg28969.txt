I got this as an alternative to the Halo sleep sack and I really wish I hadn't. The whole point of swaddling is to keep the baby contained and feeling secure but this is just too loose. I like that it's not too tight over the legs so hip dysplasia isn't an issue but I'd prefer it was tighter over the torso because it keeps getting bunched up around her mouth and I don't feel safe putting her in the crib while wearing this.
