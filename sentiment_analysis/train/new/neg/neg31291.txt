I also bought a good quality 2 inch thick cradle mattress with this sheet, and the sheet was so tight that it caused the mattress to bow in half. I put some weight at each end and that fixed it, but I wasn't impressed that I had to stretch this product to make it fit. I can't speak for the quality of the $7 "higher quality" cotton jersey cradle sheet that American Baby Company makes, but this one is definitely "value" as far as quality is concerned. It's very thin, and doesn't look like it's going to hold up to regular washing and drying.In summary, it's okay if you don't have the money for anything else... but if you do, pay for something else. With this product, you get what you pay for.
