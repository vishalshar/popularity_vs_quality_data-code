I purchased these primarily because it seemed like a good price (for a quantity of 10).  Unfortunately I did not look at the pictures very carefully; these do not have the nice thick border that my other Gerber washcloths have had.  There is a flat, loop stitched border only.  I'm worried that they won't be a sturdy and hold up in the wash.  I may update later, but be aware that these have no sewn on borders.
