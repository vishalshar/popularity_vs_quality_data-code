While this pacifier clip is very cute, and does the job well, I am a bit disappointed with it overall. The fabric that makes up the doll's dress is not secured to the chain and comes off very easily. I suppose the idea is to improve the ease of cleaning?? But it falls off very easily, posing a possible choking hazard. And, without it, the doll looks like a big bodiless head. I also have the heart design by Haba, and I highly recommend it instead.
