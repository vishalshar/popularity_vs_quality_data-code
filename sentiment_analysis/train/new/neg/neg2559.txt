While this toy is a bit of fine craftsmanship in wood, it is not very interesting to our 10 month old grandchild. It was not interesting even a few months ago before she could crawl. The colors on it are washed out and thus not very eye catching.  She just pushed it around a few times and never came back to this item except momentarily.A child crawling, as our granddaughter is now, is not at all interested in having her movement interrupted by this push toy.  Putting it on a raised surface for her to play with while cruising did not spark her interest for long either.This toy just does not seem to have enough varied characteristics or complication to intrigue a child who should be into floor level push toys.  It's really kind of boring, but, yes, nicely crafted.  I can't recommend spending your money on it.
