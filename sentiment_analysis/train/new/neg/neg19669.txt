We just purchased this stroller for our son who is just turning a year old. We wanted something lightweight and stylish as we just stopped using our heavy double stroller. This stroller is lightweight, under 12 pounds. We also really liked the look and color scheme. However, this stroller is almost impossible to collapse. You have to push down on this button and pull on this handle simultaneously. It was so hard to get it to release that my husband even had a lot of diffficulty closing it! The worst part was the back support for the child. It has a hard support piece behind the back that is curved within the material, and it made our son sit hunched over and he couldn't really sit with his back straight. He seemed so uncomfortable that after using it a couple of times, we have decided to get rid of it. I would definitely look into a different brand/stroller.
