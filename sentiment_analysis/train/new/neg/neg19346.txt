Beware...although these are adorable and help make bath time fun, you must squeeze out any water daily or they will get mold quickly. I learned the hard way, and several were saturated with mold only after a few days!GREAT toy if you are not a busy mom with a million things on your mind and can remind yourself to remove all water, as your toddler is way overdue for bed time.
