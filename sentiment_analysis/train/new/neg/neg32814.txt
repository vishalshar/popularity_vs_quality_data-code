These pieces are brightly colored, easily stacked, and light weight. My 7 month old really likes playing with this. My only problem is that the top red piece is not shaped like the other pieces. It mainly isn't played with since it can only be placed on the top. My son doesn't care that the finished tower doesn't have a nice rounded top - that's an adult aesthetic. And the toy is his, so he should be able to play with all the pieces.
