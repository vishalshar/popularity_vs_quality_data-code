"Aden by Aden and Anais" is not Aden and Anais. It is cheaper, and thus of lesser quality. You get what you pay for though. I was refunded for this purchase but didn't need to return them, so I did wash them and notice what others have said- they definitely shrink. Also, the tag is pretty big compared to the size of the bib, and it always seems to be hanging out, which I guess I could just cut off, but thought I'd mention that. In the photo, you can see the 3 bibs on the bottom compared three other random bibs I had and see that they don't hold a shape very well after washing and seem to "do their own thing" even when I've promptly removed them from the dryer and laid them flat. I bought 4 matimati bibs with this order as well and even though they cost almost twice as much per bib, you use half as many bibs because they work so well. I bought 8 more of those. Totally worth it.
