I just purchased a brand new SUV through a lease. I'm trying to be very cautious since its a lease and I have leather seats. My last SUV had leather and I did not have a protector underneath the car seats. They were disgusting!Pros:- Strong rubber material- Looks great- Fits around Britax base perfectly- easy to clean and wipe down- I like the little flap that comes down so little feet don't get dirt on the seatsCon:- a little difficult to use latch. Have to push rubber material down to finagle the latch in place.- still leaves marks on leather (faint but still noticeable) from car seat.To clarify, it leaves marks on leather if you leave the seat in the same spot for awhile. I had left carseat in same spot for 4 months and when I went to change it I could see a faint outline on leather. I'm just going to rotate the carseat every 2/3 months and hope it doesn't leave a mark/outline at all.I would buy again only because everything else on the market for car seat protectors is basically rubbish. The protector we had in my husbands car might as well have not been in place.
