ok, my 3-year-old son did think the flimsy, scratchy pink bunny was cute, but it barely got cold even after 2 days (!) in the freezer. he had no problem opening the back, pulling out the "cold" pack and holding that in one hand while he tried to put his foot into the bunny like a slipper.  one star because doing all that distracted him from his boo boo.it's small - good for small hands - but the fabric feels very cheap and not cozy and is so thin i can easily read all the text off of the "cold" pack that's inside. also, the velcro is placed all the way down the back so it's either a lump against the skin or waiting to be ripped open in the palm of a toddler.did anyone get a different color? the product page says there are a variety of possible styles, but no one seems to have received any other than the pink bunny.i wish i'd kept the packaging so i could return it.
