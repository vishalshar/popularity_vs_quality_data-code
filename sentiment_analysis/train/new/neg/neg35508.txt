I love the pretty fabric and silky comfort of this pumping support bra.  However, the clasps are too numerous and time-consuming to use, especially compared to another pumping bra I found with a zipper in the front.  Also, the bra fit great right after the baby came, but as I lost water weight after delivery, it quickly became too large and would slip down thanks to the silky fabric and size.  I followed the sizing recommendations, but should have gone with one a size smaller, I think.  Even better - I wish this company made an adjustable one that could change with me.  In the end, I bought a different bra made for this purpose by a major brand and although it was much less attractive than this one, it was much more functional: went on and off faster, held the pumps more firmly to my breasts, never slipped down, etc.  I was pumping exclusively because my breasts were having difficulty with let-down and the baby was losing too much weight trying to get the milk directly from me.  In that high stress and time consuming situation, where I had to pump SO often, it was important to have the right tools to help me maximize the time available for pumping.  Being sleep deprived and failing at normal breastfeeding made fumbling with clasps and the bra's slipping EXTREMELY frustrating after just a few weeks.  I tried using binder clips to keep the thing tight enough and make clasping easier, but it got to be ridiculous and I ended up spending big bucks on another bra from medela.
