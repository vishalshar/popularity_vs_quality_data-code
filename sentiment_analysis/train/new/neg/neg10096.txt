We bought this walker for our 9 month old son. My intention was to buy him a walker and let him walk around and use up some energy without my having to hold his hands and walk around with him (he can do that for what seems like forever) It was just so cute we couldn't bring ourselves to buy the plain old traditional walker.  I like that the seat cover can be removed for washing although I haven't had to do that yet. The cup holder and snack holder are also great. My son likes to sit in the walker and either watch his videos (while snacking on his Cheerios-- so cute) or he can be in the same room with the rest of the family without being underfoot. He has't quite gotten the hang of actually walking around in it though...he just kind of sits there or goes backwards. I don't think that this walker is going to be very manuverable on our carpet so it is going to have to stay at my parent's house. The back wheels don't turn so that is something that I don't like about it. This jeep is SO cute, but I really don't think it's practical. I am thinking of buying a "regular" walker but I don't know if it's worth it since he will probably be walking soon.
