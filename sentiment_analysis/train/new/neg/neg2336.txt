if you are using this booster, or any "seat only" booster, be carefull.  We were using it, when my daughter fell asleep, but because it doesn't have any back/head support, her head actually went under the sholder strap. (it was over her face).  needless to say we went back to using the turbo booster WITH  back support and seatbelt guide.If your kids don't fall asleep, then I'm sure this will be a great seat.  My daughter is 5 and very often takes little cat naps when we drive for more than 30 min.
