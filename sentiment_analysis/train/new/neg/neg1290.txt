I like the idea of this kit but think it is a bit overpriced at about $17 for essentially a pack of bottle labels and a couple pieces of nicely printed cardboard.  My kit was also missing the three stickers that are in addition to the milk bottle labels.  I've decided to keep this because I really need something now to put on my office door and I don't have the patience to return and wait for another one with the missing stickers.  The door hanger and stickers are cute.
