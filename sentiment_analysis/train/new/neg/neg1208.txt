These seem like a good idea, but they don't work.  The locks don't adhere to the tape that they are shipped with.  We installed several where the plastic lock came off the tape, while the tape stayed stuck to our furniture.  The tape did generally adhere well to our furniture, and was removable, so it appeared to be good quality tape.  It just didn't stick very well to the plastic locks, which is either poor design or poor manufacturing.  Also, if you pull the drawer or cabinet door quickly where these locks were installed, you could typically defeat the lock.
