I bought this beautiful crib bedding set for my niece. When I opened the box I noticed that the colors weren't a fiberent I it showed online. I washed the comforter & bedding skirt and when I went to take them out of the washer the thin fabric in the middle of the bed skirt was torn to pieces! I was so upset because I looked for weeks for the set I wanted. My husband immediately called Amazon and the gentleman was extremely polite, we could understand what he was saying (sorry but a real problem these days). He apologized many time and gave us a full refund and we returned. Back to searching for another set.
