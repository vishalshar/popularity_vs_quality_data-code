I find this gate to be adequate to the task of blocking the top of a stairway in our house and thus preventing our toddler from taking a bad tumble.  The construction is sturdy and the latch is secure yet easy to open for adults.  I do wish it would close automatically.  My problem is with the included mounting hardware, which is insufficient for my needs.  I've had to remount this gate three times in the same doorway, each time with progressively stouter screws and stronger anchors.  The mounting hardware shipped with the gate is fine if you mount it in a low-traffic area or don't have any other young children in your household.  Neither of these conditions describe my situation, and the gate is in constant use, opening and closing seemingly hundreds of times per day.  Invest in some toggle bolt anchors if you expect this gate to get a lot of use.
