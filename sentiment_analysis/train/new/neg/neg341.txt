I am ONLY giving it 1 star because it arrived quickly. That's it! This toy box consists of cheap materials that were badly damaged when it arrived. The wood is even mis-matched colors! The lid doesn't close all the way, nor does the safety close feature work correctly. Had I seen one in a store, I would have never bought it, let alone paid more than $20 for it. Very disappointed!
