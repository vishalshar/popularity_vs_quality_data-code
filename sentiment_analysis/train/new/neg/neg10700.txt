I looked everywhere for a jumper that did not have a ton of stuff on it, so I was very excited when I found this one.  However, this jumper is not for tall babies.  Our 5 month old daughter is 26 inches long.  We had this on the highest setting and her feet were still flat on the floor.  We had to put a blanket in the seat and then put the legs up on books.  I decided I was not comfortable with all that so I ordered another jumper.  This jumper is sturdy and cute, but is for short babies.
