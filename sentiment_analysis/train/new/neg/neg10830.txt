Received Jogger as a shower gift so it sat in the box for nearly a year.  Once i started using stroller it was almost 2 weeks before the 1 year manufacture warranty expired.  Everything seemed great, full suspension, deep sun visors, and four wheels for more stability.  that is where it ends, quality for nearly a $700 stroller is lacking.  The frame looks molded like a high tech mountain bike but the break system failed 2 months into light operation, the wheels were warp easily, the material on the stroller feels like a cheap book bag and the child harness is plastic and has already broken.  it boggles the mind that this stroller is $649, but the warranty will make up for all the concerns right???NoI go to dicks with receipt in hand and the deny every selling it.  Dicks sporting goods stopped carrying this entire line due to quality concerns.  So i contact the manufacturer and that is where the fun begins they have a lifetime warranty but it is only as good as the company who backs it.  Customer service here is terrible I was told after numerous attempts to remedy the warped wheels that my 1 year warranty has expired.  I start listing the numerous problems with the stroller and the women at customer service says that none of that is covered outside the 1 year manufactures warranty.  Wow!!  now I have a barely used stroller with warped wheels, no wheel locks, and broken child harness.  Save your money buy a Bob or Schwin and retire them in yard sales this stroller is terrible.
