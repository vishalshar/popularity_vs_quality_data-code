I am adding a photo of this neck pillow in comparison to the Trunki Yondi Travel Pillow (http://amzn.com/B00KJ92R9Y).This neck pillow is VERY cute. I wanted it to work because its the cutest one we've ever seen. Very very soft, with vibrant colors and adorable details. I noticed right away that it was large. Quite a bit larger than the Yondi pillow. This seems like a good thing when the toddler's neck is slumping to the side and you want it held up, but logistically speaking, the back part of the pillow on the back of the toddler's neck is only going to push their head forward and down. I repeat, this will NOT work as you would think to put it on their neck around the back. The only way this pillow can work is if you wrap it around the FRONT of their neck so that nothing is behind their neck pushing their head forward.I am an adult female and I used this a little while in the car. It is large enough for a small adult. I personally think it is too big for a toddler. And the most obvious thing is that no toddler is going to leave this in front of their neck, wrapped around "backwards" long enough for them to fall asleep. It just doesn't work. You could slide it on the front of their neck once they fall asleep, and that might work.Overall the Trunki Yondi wins for best toddler travel pillow. Hands down. It has a magnet attachment so that it stays around the child's neck long enough for them to fall asleep without taking it off. Genius.
