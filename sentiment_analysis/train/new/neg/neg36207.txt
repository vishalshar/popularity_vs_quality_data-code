I purchased this high chair for my 7 month old thinking it would be an inexpensive alternative to the Boon design. While this chair is easy to clean, it is not easy to move or use. Having the wheels just in the front is virtually pointless, the tray has to come all the way off in order to get the child in and out and the removable tray piece is so hard to remove! If you are looking for something completely stationary that won't be used too often it's okay, otherwise it's worth the money to get a better model.
