The set that I received are not quite as fancy as the ones pictured. They are the same shapes but have far less detail (the keys are all one color). I think they are trying to make production cheaper. With that said, the quality of the plastic seems fine and is strong and durable. The whole product is made of the same hard plastic. There is no soft rubber/plastic on them. There also are not that many notches to really sooth the gums which is what I would really like. The one key has some large bumps, but they seem too large (at least my baby does not enjoy them). We had a different pair which was hard for a baby to grab, but this pair is nice for them to grab onto. It has the holes in the keys and a nice big key ring for even young babies to be able to grasp.
