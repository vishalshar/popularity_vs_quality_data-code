I wanted to save a trip to the store and the one we already had was getting dirty so I ordered this bath mat for our son's tub and was happy with the price and the overall size, it is very long so covers 90% of the tub, which is great for our toddler.  However, I was very disappointed that I didn't really consider the other reviews that mentioned the smell.  This mat has a horrible plastic smell that does not EVER go away.  We used it for several weeks, at first I figured the smell would go away and so we continued to use it, then I realized it wasn't going away and maybe we need to 'air' out the bathroom by leaving the door open to get the air to circulate and stop the smell, well, that never worked.  I just threw this away although we didn't have it very long and purchased another mat from a store which was so cute, had the multi colored dots and although it doesn't cover the entire tub, there was absolutely no smell.  I would not recommend this, unless you want to get a headache from the never ending chemical / plastic smell.
