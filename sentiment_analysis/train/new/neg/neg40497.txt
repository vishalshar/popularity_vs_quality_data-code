This is quite bulky and we have had trouble with it sticking to our tile wall.  It would hold for a little while, but eventually it always fell off.  It fell on our daughter's head a couple of times, so we put it down in the actual tub, but it didn't leave a whole lot of room for play and if the water was too high then the basket would float off.  We put it back on the wall and inevitably if would fall off and make the worst crashing sound during the night.  We are giving the thing away to the salvation army. No thanks...not worth the trouble.
