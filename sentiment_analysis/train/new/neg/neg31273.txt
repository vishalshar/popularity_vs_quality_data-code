after a long search for a maternity pillow, I chose this because reviews said that it doesn't take up much bed space  and it serves the purpose of support.  Yes, it is small...too small that it doesn't do anything at all.  I might as well just bought a tube pillow and put another small pillow on my back than spend the amount that this dream Genii is worth!  The Dreamgenii is simply that -- a tube pillow and a small pillow.  The quilted pad is just an empty space, doesn't do anything at all.When I used this, I still propped several pillows to help me get comfortable. I don't know why this product won awards?!
