Disappointed in this bag. One side of the straps on the right side ripped off on the first day of use. I was able to tie it to the stroller handle and continue using it. A couple days later, one side of the snap button along the top popped off....which I didn't realize until I saw my infant daughter pick it up off the floor and put it in her mouth. :( I thought JEEP brand would be more durable.
