I have a 2 1/2 year old who used this seat about 20 times. She is under the weight limit of the product. It was FANTASTIC until it broke while she was sitting on it. It folds at the section where you see the color change and at the seam in the back where it is joined. The crack happened just above the folding joint/hinge (where it is supposed to bend/fold) This is clearly a flaw in the design. If it had been design with the correct amount of space to allow the hinge to bend without friction, the plastic above the hinge would not have had to bend. If I had not been holding her still when this happened (it cracked without her full weight on it) she would have fallen into the toilet. As it is she is now terrified of the potty seat. The product folds into quarters and comes with a nice bag. It is very easy to keep clean, but I would not recommend this. As it is design now, the user cannot avoid the flaw that occurred to the seat we have. While this may have been a fluke (who knows, it happens) I wouldn't risk it.
