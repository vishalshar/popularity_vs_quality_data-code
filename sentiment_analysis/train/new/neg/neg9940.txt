My daughter enjoys playing with this toy.  It makes sounds, and it lights up and its entertaining.  On the first day we got the toy she fell twice.  It is not steady.  I have it against a wall.  If she tries to pull herself to stand, I have to hold it or she will pull it forward, and she will fall back.  I am never more than 3 feet away from her when she is playing with this toy, because is just not safe.  If I had known this, I would have not bought this toy. There must be toys out there that are just as cute and fun, and serve the same purpose, but are more steady.
