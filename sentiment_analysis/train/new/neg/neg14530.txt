We have stainless steel cable railings on our staircase and due to the wires coming in to the bannister at an angle this does not attach at all.  Instead we just attached the locking strip to the stainless steel with metal epoxy.  Its holding great, and is a lot less clunky than this bannister install kit would be.  When we do want to take the gate down a heat gun will remove the epoxy without damaging the stainless steel.  Epoxy is a lot less expensive as well.
