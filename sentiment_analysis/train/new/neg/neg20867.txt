This thing ended up being HUGE.  Thankfully my daughter's preschool teacher was not too picky and she cleared space on top of their nap mat shelf to accomadate this mat.  Also, when the product arrived, it had scuff marks on it, even though it was inside plastic.  I'm assuming this was actually a used product, not new.  But it does it's job.  She has only been using it at school for about 3 months now and I'm assuming it's holding up so far.  I saw a lot of other people's reviews saying these types of mats get rips easily.  I haven't seen my daughter's as it's kept at school.  But I think these things are way overpriced for the cheap plastic materials used.  I looked all over in stores and could not find them all summer long.  So I ended up having to revert to the internet to purchase.  By the time I did that, I think maybe everyone jacked up the prices since it was back-to-school shopping season.  They were also extremely unavailable on a lot of sites, so I didn't have much choice of which mat to buy and ended up paying more than most of the other parents who bought these mats for their child's nap time at school.
