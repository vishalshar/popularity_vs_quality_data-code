Piece of junk - first one arrived and I hand washed per instructions... Very gingerly I might add.  Water got into the device and it broke.  Called the seller and they sent s replacement free of charge (excellent customer service).  Hand washed the second unit per instructions and the exact same thing happened.  I never even had a chance to give it a test run.  This product is advertised as waterproof and is far from it.  Don't waste your money!
