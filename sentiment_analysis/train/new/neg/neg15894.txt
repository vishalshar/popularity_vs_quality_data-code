It's alright.  I would consider it an upgrade to the standard Britax one that can be bought at most baby stores.  It has more pockets and might be slightly taller, and so is a bit more functional.  I decided to purchase this organizer, over others, for that reason, but also because I was concerned about whether it would fit my Uppababy Cruz.  (Many of the other caddies did not specify the range of stroller handlebar widths that they would fit.)  It does fit my Cruz, it has multiple design flaws:- When installed, it's angled - not vertical.  So, if you have drinks in the caddy, they will also be angled.  At least the Uppababy caddy's single cup-holder is pitched to accommodate the angle of the strollers handlebars.  This is probably the most annoying design flaw.- Middle compartment has a velcro closure, whereas many other caddies contain a much better magnetic closure.- Drink holders may be deeper, but they are not "Extra Large".  It won't accommodate anything larger than 24oz drink, but that may not matter to most people.  Just means it might not always fit the canteen or cup you're using.  Neoprene would have helped.- The zipper on the front zips open from the side; it should zip open from the top.  This just seems like common sense.Bottom line, there are a number of other organizers out there that are similar to this one that cost less.  I don't see this one as being better designed or for that matter "deluxe" or "luxurious" as the name states.
