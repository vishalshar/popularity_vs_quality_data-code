I love Skip Hop products - we have several - and was excited to add this to our collection. However, it's not as functional as I'd hoped. We used a bottle that had a lot of parts to it and ended up only being able to fit three total bottles (with parts) on this drying rack. I love the color and the modern design, though, so if you don't use many bottles or bottles with a crazy amount of parts, this will be good for you.
