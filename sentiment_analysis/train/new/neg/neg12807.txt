I just hate this monitor. Honestly, it's just so annoying. My baby is sleeping through the night since he is two months old and he has been sleeping in his own bedroom since he is 5 months old (he is 6 months now), but when we moved him to his room and we started using the monitor during the night we actually stopped sleeping through the night, not because of my baby but because of the sound monitor. It sounds a constant static and bursts of loud noise no matter what we do or where we place it. Plus many times has happen that I listened my baby cry from my room but not through the monitor because it suddenly stopped working. Also we never used the movement pad because once we bought it we discovered that to be able to use it we needed to get a wooden pad first, which we just didn't get because as you can imagine with a newborn there is already a thousand worries and things to be done to be thinking about the extra piece you need to get for getting the baby monitor going, plus we have a pack and play and is quite a hazzle to place it in that crib. I had tried other monitors previously with my nieces and nephews and honestly I had never experienced something with so much extra noise as this one.
