To be fair, this looks like an EXCELLENT seat but I had to return it since it DOES NOT FIT at all on our elongated toilet (see picture)!  Someone said in one of the questions that it fit elongated toilets so I bought it, but it doesn't.  I'm really sad I couldn't keep it and it probably deserves a much better rating than 3 stars but it needs to more clear about what toilets it fits.I must say this company offers wonderful customer service though!
