We have had this stroller for 10 months now and it started collapsing with our child in it (who is 1, average sized) a few months ago.  Now, it does not stay open for more than a few steps without collapsing.  It's actually pretty dangerous.  I would not buy this stroller again, and I am very disappointed by that fact.  We have the Vista and thought Uppa was great.Disappointed sums it up.
