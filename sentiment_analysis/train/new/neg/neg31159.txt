For the first month this swing was lovely. It has developed more of a clicking noise when it swings and isn't completely silent anymore like it was the first 2 weeks. We've had it for 3 months now and unfortunately for the last few weeks it barely swings at all. Maybe 10 degrees total which isn't enough to make anyone happy. I'm sad that it didn't seem to last longer. My baby is also no where near the weight limit of 25 pounds, he's only 16.5 right now so I can't imagine that's the reason it's not swinging well.As a note on the batteries, they do last a long time but it's more like a month with use each day rather than the year they advertise.
