The stroller is light and easy to lift into and out of the car - perfect for quick trips to stores, etc. The complaints: I miss a cupholder for my waterbottle, and the bag underneath is sooo small! I don't use it at all, it's hard to reach and you can't store any purchases down there. But it's comfortable for naps and I love the 5-point harness. The harness is very difficult to adjust, though. And for some reason I thought it could fold smaller, guess not.....
