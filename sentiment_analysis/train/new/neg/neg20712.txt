I have bought MANY items from Amazon and this is, by far, the worst quality item I've ever received.  PLEASE take this review seriously and don't waste your time or money buying this product.It looks cheap and IS cheap material.  It's very difficult to roll the putty flat because it keeps puffing up, and FORGET applying a hand or foot print that would ever stay compressed or visible.  I couldn't even get my own handprint to stay embedded after pressing with all my force.  You couldn't even press a baby's hand hard enough for it it work.The positive reviews are obviously from people that are more easy going than me - but trust me, if you want an actual print to show up on an ornament and have it turn out with nice quality, this is NOT the ornament for you.
