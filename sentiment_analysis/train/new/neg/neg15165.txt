Mothers beware! I didn't realize it when I loaded my freshly pumped bags of milk but when I placed it in the tray and let the spring push it back, it pinched tiny holes in the sides of SEVERAL of my bags.

I recommend just laying them flat in a gift bag. Those are a dollarðŸ˜‘ I switched to that method and my problem was solved.
