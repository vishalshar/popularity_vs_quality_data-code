I bought these to use as wipes with cloth diapers on our new baby.  Instantly my husband and I could tell they are not thick enough or soft enough.  We washed them and gave them a try, and we were right.  They're not much thicker than a T-shirt, and they are less soft than a T-shirt.  I would not buy them again.  Instead of using them for butt wipes, we will probably use them as cloth napkins for our little one - wiping hands and faces.  But even then, they just aren't very absorbent so I'm not sure how functional they will be.Brands that I recommend for butt wipes, by the way, would be Grovia and Thirsties.  So far so good with those.  Both brads are soft and absorbent.
