I have never written a review on Amazon, but felt compelled to do so for the Swaddleme. My baby, who was 5 weeks at that time, could easily get either one or both arms out of the swaddle. But, what once worse, was that she was able to pull the swaddle up over her face with the velcro still secured. After that, I knew this product could no longer be used. I feel, at least for my baby, it posed a suffocation hazard. I would personally recommend the Miracle Blanket. Although, it is double the price of the Swaddleme, it is great for swaddle houdinis and does not pose any suffocation risks as far as I can tell.
