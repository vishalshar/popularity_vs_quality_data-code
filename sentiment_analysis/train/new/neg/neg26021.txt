This thing is heavy and difficult to install.  I have never been able to get the lvl right.  I have no doubts that our baby is safe, but man is it difficult to get him in and out because those arm rests don't really move much.  Graco has a much lighter seat that does't have this crazy base and is easy to install and easier to get the baby in and out of.  Save some money and get the Contender.
