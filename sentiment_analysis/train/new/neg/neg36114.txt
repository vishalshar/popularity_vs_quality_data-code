I am now waiting for my third Super Scoop...not because I love them so much that I have ordered three, but because the suction cup has broken on the last two.  On the first, it broke well within the 1-year replacement/repair timeframe but I didn't write to BRICA (now Munchkin) until it had expired - they were kind enough to send me a new unit anyway.  This Scoop's suction cup has now broken, about 1 month shy of the 1-year replacement/repair limit.  The Scoop was not even half full of toys, we have it installed way up high on our bathtub wall so my son isn't pulling on it or even touching it in any way.  I have written to the company for yet another one but nearly a week has passed and I have not received a reply.  I might have to bite the bullet and change products now - too bad, because I love the design of the Scoop itself.
