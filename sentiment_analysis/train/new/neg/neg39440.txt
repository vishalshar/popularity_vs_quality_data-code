I purchsed the sun shade hoping it would protect my daughter from the harsh summer sun.  Unfortunately it's practically impossible to affix to the stroller.  Chalk this up to another disappointing Bugaboo accessory.  So far we only like the cup holder and the wheeled board (unless you also count the foam tires which really are great.)
