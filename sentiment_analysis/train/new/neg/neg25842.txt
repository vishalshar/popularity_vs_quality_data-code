I added two types of cloth diapers to our baby registry, these and the OsoCozy brand.  After receiving a package of each I opened them up and the diapers themselves looked and felt almost identical. I put them through the wash three times (I used cold water) and after removing them from the dryer (I dried on low heat) it became very apparent that there is a huge difference in quality between the two brands.  These diapers (Swaddlebees) pilled like crazy (had annoying little fluff balls tacked all over them) and one of the diapers actually fell apart in the dryer (the hem around the edges came undone and the fabric started fraying on one side .  Again this was after three washes and the diapers had not even been used yet (our baby isn't due for a couple of months).  The Osocozy brand however stayed together nicely and didn't pill.  After that experience I immediately removed the rest of the Swaddlebees cloth diapers from our registry and added more of the Osocozy.  I can't say how the Osocozy brand holds up over time, but I would definitely recommend that brand over this one based on the fact that these diapers seem to fall apart from the beginning, which is surprising considering they're not exactly the cheapest diapers on the market.
