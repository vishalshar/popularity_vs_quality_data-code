I find these to be just okay.  The forks aren't great for picking up some foods, but they are easy to hold.  I find a metal prong to be better for use after some experimentation and several purchases.  The spoons are fairly deep and hold a good amount of yogurt or pudding.  When washed, these always seem to feel a bit greasy unless washed in really hot water with a good dish soap for dissolving grease.  They are top rack dishwasher safe, but I don't have the proper container to wash them that way, so I hand wash and they always need to be done a couple of times before they feel clean to the touch.
