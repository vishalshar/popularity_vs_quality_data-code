Our toddler broke his bright starts frog soother/sleepy time toy. The songs along with the projector of stars made him very happy before bed. So naturally we wanted to replace it, but unfortunately we chose this model to replace it with. - we failed with that decision. This thing is garbage, considering the price. The songs are like some kind of terrible poly phonic 4 bit midi tones or something? And all three songs lasts only a minute or two then it's just silent, so a baby cannot fall asleep to the sounds. The song button rarely works on our projector, most of the time you just here weird plibts and pleebt sounds chirping through the speaker. The projector and lights are alright, but not enough to redeem the justification in this purchase.Seriously wouldn't buy this thing unless it were under $10. It's a joke.
