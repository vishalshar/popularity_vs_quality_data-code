So I bought this prior to traveling abroad with my lil Munchkin and Hubbie.This was my first trip with baby and I was worried about not getting the crucial things and overpacking! Moms out there - you know exactly what I mean!!!;). This was perfect for what I needed. It was compact enough to put it inside the diaper bag and still functional.  The brush clicks together so you have a normal bottle brush and it's good quality. The only negative is that the handle section can be a bit annoying to align in the case so it closes up nicely.  Not a deal breaker but just an FYI. You can wash up and drain about 3-4 bottles at a time depending on how many pieces you have. I use mainly Dr Browns but with clever stacking I could get 4 draining in it.
