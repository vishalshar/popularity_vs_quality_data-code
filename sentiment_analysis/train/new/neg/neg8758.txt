Love the mat color (although I expected the blanket to be white and mine is tan)  and the concept... Love that the pillow comes out, love the way it rolls up also. But like some said there isn't any padding or cushion to the floor part. I'm ok with that since we will be using this on top of the nap mat from school (I wanted something to sleep on over the plastic mat his daycare provides). The pillow is thin. And the fabric is kind of rough. Hoping it'll soften with wash. I will keep Bc it serves it's purpose but expected a little more from this $40 mat.
