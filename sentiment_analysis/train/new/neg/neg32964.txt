This product is worthless! I had to try and "lightly press" my daughters foot into the plaster no less than 9 times and each time it barely made an indentation.  We tried everything, from rolling the plaster a little thicker for more cushion while pushing, pressing her foot a little harder and nothing worked.  We could have thrown our $30 for this product out the car window and gotten more satisfaction and a better memory than this piece of junk will provide.  We ended up with a very faint, almost unreconizable imprint that will most likely be replaced with an ink impression if we can find it soon enough.  Save your money and buy something else if you really want a true memory of your child's foot or hand.**UPDATE: I emailed the manufacturer Pearhead, after receiving this product.  They sent another plaster packet out and we tried it again.  We followed the directions as noted and it still did not work.  We again were left with a horrible, barely there print.  This product truley is a waste of money.  We ended up ordering the Inkless print kit from another company for much cheaper, worked great and we got the keepsake this product/company could not deliver on.
