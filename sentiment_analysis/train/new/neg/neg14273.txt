As an umbrella stroller it's ok. I wouldn't suggest this as being your everyday stroller. We purchased for airports and trips as not to ruin our expensive stroller by the airlines. This serves that purpose. It's very short , not awful but not I'm 5ft7 and it's awkward. My 18 month olds seem to slide forward no matter the positioning of the back. Very frustrating trying to constantly reposition them.Easy to open, a bit odd to close but easy enough. I do not suggest any is per bags, or handbags be hung on the bars, huge tipping problem (found that out the hard way) 5 stars for a junk stroller , two stars for an every day stroller. Good luck moms!
