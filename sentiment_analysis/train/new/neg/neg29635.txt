The instructions say "Using a standard ballpoint pen, write the name and/or desired information on the name plate area".  Well... I tried... and tried... to write a name on the name plate area and the material just refused to allow itself to be written on.  I went over and over each letter with five different ballpoint pens but the ink just would not penetrate or even remain on the surface. Put it into boiling water and.... no joy, there was no readable lettering.Useful only if you are willing to rely on color coding of the toothbrushes, which I am not. Am returning this annoying item.
