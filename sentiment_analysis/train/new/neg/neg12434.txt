These are theoretically very well designed and comfortable, but my child did not think so in practical application. They can also be a bit of a pain to put on; more power to those of you who don't think so.As you can imagine, you would have to pull the ear muffs apart then slide the elastic over your child's forehead and the back of their head. Then if the child decides to take them off less carefully, you'll be doing their hair again along with carefully sliding these back over their ears. The rest is history...My wife and I ended up going with more traditionally styled earmuffs which worked pristinely at an outdoor concert, which my child slept soundly through.
