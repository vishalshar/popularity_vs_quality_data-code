We bought this in anticipation of our Christmas baby.  It was a pretty normal Cincinnati winter, but our poor little Emma was so hot in this thing, that every time we would put her in her carseat with it in, she would scream bloody murder.  Even taking the cover off and just leaving the back on didn't help, once we drove 25 minutes to the mall and by the time we got there, not only were my husband and I nearly deaf from listening to her scream, her back so so wet from sweat that we had to change her entire outfit.  We returned the Bundle Me the next day.  I suppose if you live in like Alaska or somewhere where it is REALLY cold ALL the time, or if you only use your carseat to take the baby outside in the stroller, than this is a fine product, but living in a relatively cold winter climate and using this as it was meant to be used (leaving it in the seat and just uncovering the baby once in the car) we had virtually no luck with it.  I think that it is a wonderful concept, which is why I give it 3 stars, but, overall, my personal experience with it was only a 1 star experience, if that.
