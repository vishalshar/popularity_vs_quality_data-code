I bought this item for a friend and when it came in the packaging was open and taped back together. Also i thought i was purchasing the pick one but it came in in blue, there was no where to choose a color when i was checking out. It does it's job but i wouldn't recommend it for its aesthetics. It looks fairly cheap, just beads strung on a string. Also, the beads are very big, so it is not very discrete when the baby is wearing it; it looks more like a toy. It wasn't so terrible that i returned it, i just wouldn't recommend anyone else to buy it.
