I bought 2 of these Kidkusion mats (1 here on Amazon): One to put on our dining table for use with a booster-style chair, and the other to put in the tray of my then-7 month-old daughter's Fisher-Price space-saver high chair.  (Since Fisher-Price repeatedly refuses to state whether its high-chair trays are BPA-free and thus safe for babies).  These mats initially worked very well, when we were just introducing our baby girl to solid foods and self-feeding.  I preferred using the mats with the smooth side down, which was tacky enough to stick to our wood table or high chair tray without slipping; and the nubby side would help my daughter to get a grip on her food.  Plus, these mats are made of non-toxic TPR, which is BPA-, PVC- and phthalate-free, so I felt much better about my little-one eating food off them than off of my wood table (which I'm pretty sure is finished with NON-baby-safe varnish) and the mystery plastic of her high chair.  (NOTE: If you have a high chair that has 1 or 2 cup holders, like the Fisher-Price brand, these mats will not fit around them, so you'll have to cut the mats to fit around the cup-holders.  But this doesn't affect how well they work).But alas, my satisfaction with these mats was not to last.  As soon as my baby girl's manual dexterity developed and she perfected her pincer-grip, she quickly figured out how to pick this mat up at the edges, peel/pull it off, and throw it -- and all of the food & utensils on it -- on to the floor.  In fact, it became a very fun game for her!  (Not so fun for Mom & Dad).  It's such a shame because this item is, in all other respects, a good one.  It's just that it REALLY could have benefited from a couple of suction cups to make it more difficult for curious toddlers to pull off.Grade: B-
