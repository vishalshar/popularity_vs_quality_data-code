This duck is slightly different than the picture. However the larger issue is that it smells like the company used an organic solvent in the paint they used to make the toy. I have washed it and aired it out for a bit, but it still smells like spray paint. So the toy may be free of PVC and BPA, etc for marketing purposes, this is clearly not a company that values child safety.
