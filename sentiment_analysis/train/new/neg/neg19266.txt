Love how they look on the crib but I do wish they were a bit taller. Maybe more ties would be nice so that its not so easy for my son to pull down, now it kind of bows in from being stretched. I debated returning them but they do look nice and we wont be using them much longer. I bought when my son turned 5.5 months because he kept banging his head on the rails and screaming from pain! He also had his leg stuck a few times. So far so good with these bumpers.
