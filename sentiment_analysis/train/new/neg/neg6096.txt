I love my Snoogle pillow, but this pillow case was nearly impossible to get on! I am shocked I didn't rip the stitches on it trying to pull it onto the pillow. The manufacturer really needs to figure out an easier way for moms to put these things on, because it was nearly impossible to get on. And I do CrossFit, so it's not like I'm a little weakling! ha The product pattern is very cute and it is soft, so now that it's on I am appreciating it, however I dread the day I have to take it off to wash it and try to put it back on again.
