I, unfortunately, had to return these items. I could not get them to stay put under the mattress pad.  Every time I would get them in place, the minute I stretched the mattress pad back down to hold them in they would slip right out of place. They are also a little too large to use in twin beds which is why I think they wouldn't stay put under the mattress pad. It may have just been too small to accommodate such a large barrier and so there wasn't enough tension to stabilize them.  They were heavy duty and good quality items.  They are foam and come condensed into small packages.  Once you open the package, the barriers expand to full size.
