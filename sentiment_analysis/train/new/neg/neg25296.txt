Way too small for my 18-mo-old. It doesn't even fit a 1/4 of a quesadilla... I should have gotten the oxo tot big kids plate instead. I do like the rim, but it's really only good for small veggies, which we do a lot. Not worth returning, but not amazing either especially for the price. I should have read the measurements! More like a shallow bowl than plate.... Oh, and the "weighted" bottom does nothing to stop toddler from dumping food. ;)
