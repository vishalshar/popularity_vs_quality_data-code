I really wanted to give this a higher rating but I just can't.  It did help my nipples initially when I first got home from giving birth.  But that was before my milk came in so the gel pads stayed relatively dry when I use them.  But when you think about how the gel absorbs liquid, and your milk is leaking onto the gel, you're wearing it for hours on end, it's just a breading ground for a yeast infection.  Not to mention that it gets pretty gross.  So i would say that these gel pads are really just good for a one time use or for 1 day at the most.  I definitely wouldn't use it for 72 hours as suggested.  And considering the price, i'm certainly not dropping $7 a day when I can just get a jar of nipple cream.
