I bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday party and she loved it. Two things though.One, it was a lot bigger than I was expecting it to be. I didn't check the dimensions, so my bad, but for me that wasn't a big deal. I had a small party and I filled it only half way. Would work well for a late party.Second, and this is why I gave it only three stars, the handle broke. It is supped to be the kind of pi√±atas where you pull the string and not whack it, but instead of the strings pulling the bottom open, when the kids pulled the handle ripped from the cardboard.
