A night light is really supposed to do one job: give light at night. This one sometimes does, but other times we awake to our baby screaming in the dark. I figured out very quickly how to turn off the timer so that the light stays on ... that is not the problem. The problem is that the light we prefer (blue) sometimes works and sometimes will not turn on at all and sometimes just flickers badly, whether or not it is on the charging base. At times clicking the button on the bottom just cycles between just red and green, no other colors. After clicking about 20-30 times it will start to cycle the other colors ... except blue.Nothing I like better than trying to fool with getting the night light working for five minutes every night and nap time and hoping it is still on when baby wakes up.For what it is, it seems like a good idea. It is convenient to have a rechargeable night light that we can toss into a bag for a trip where we know the baby will need a nap. That is the only reason it got two stars.
