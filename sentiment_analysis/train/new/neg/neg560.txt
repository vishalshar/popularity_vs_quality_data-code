NOT RECOMMENDED - The monitor itself seems to be good, however one the receivers quit working after about 4 days. I returned the defective system and exchanged it for the same model and the new one had the exact same problem as the original one I returned. After experiencing the problems I have had with the replacement, I will be returning this one and go back to a Fisher Price monitor that will hopefully work better.
