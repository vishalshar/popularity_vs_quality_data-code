I bought these links because they have animals on them and I wanted to switch it up, but unfortunately, these rings suck.  Only half the package has animals at all and the other half are just plain links.  Then to top it off, they're thick and difficult to attach to the loops on my daughter's playmat.  Of course hearing about the BPA is a no-brainer as well.If you're looking for links I'd definitely pick another brand...
