these bottles may be great for others but weren't so good for us. the nipples collapsed and ended up giving my son a lot of gas. although the bottles seem to be well made and are environmentally friendly they just didn't work for us. we ended up using dr.browns which are a hassle to clean but certainly worked much better.
