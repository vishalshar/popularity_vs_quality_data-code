I purchased this thinking it would fit the best with the Medela pumping bottles. While it fits ok, its really nothing special. The water in the ice pack isn't filled all the way and so there's about 1/4 that wouldn't keep the bottles cold unless flipped the right side up. I can see how it would be helpful to have if you've purchased the Medela cooler bag, but if you're not using the Medela bag, I would look for another ice pack.
