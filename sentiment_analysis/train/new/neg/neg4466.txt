I bought this to have my baby girl's things more organized and I tried to put it in the back of the door- didnt fit. I see the picture now and instead of back of the door- I am going to see if I put it in a rod!Post review-4/21/2006I stuck 2 nails on it and forget the hooks it comes with- I hung it right on the nail and it fit- I stuffed the pockets and by sticking the 2 nails - it worked for me - so I might just go and buy another one because it sure did lessen some of that cluster I felt I had- put her socks, bibs hair accessories, Her cd's and tapes... I might just put another one for her lotions, onesies, and other things I have an abundance of....Thank YOU!!!!!! Now I give it (with the hooking it up on nails) 4 stars ****
