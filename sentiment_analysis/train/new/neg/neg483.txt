Item works as expected, but this is definitely not as useful and I hoped it would be. If you are carrying a diaper bag, you can easily slip the strap across the handle of the stroller and this item is unnecessary. Unless you are carrying a purse, shopping bag, or other type of bag that has a shorter drop length, you don't really need this. I only use this product when I walk with the baby to the store and I place the shopping bag on the hook. The shopping bag is too long, and inevitably it makes a smacking noise as it hits the stroller which I can't stand. So, I end up throwing the bag underneath the stroller. Also, you have to be careful not to place a really heavy bag on it or you might risk toppling the stroller over backwards. This is more likely if the baby isn't in the stroller to counterbalance the weight of the bag, of course.
