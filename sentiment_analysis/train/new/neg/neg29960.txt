If I could give this item 0 stars, I definitely would.  I purchased these to protect the tan seats in a new car, and when I removed the car seat and seat protector, I realized it had damaged the seats.  The rubber raised backing left black circles all over the seat of the car, as well as the back.  Leather cleaner was unable to remove the spots, and my fear is that they have been permanently damaged.  This was especially disappointing since the ad pictures the car seat protector being placed over tan leather seats.  I also purchased them for a car with dark gray linen seats, and am hoping that those seats are not damaged as well.
