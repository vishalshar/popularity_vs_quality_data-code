It works pretty good but, has fallen off a couple of times probably need to add some liquid soap to the cup like I have with the handles so they will stop falling on the floor of the shower.By adding liquid soap to the suction handles they have stopped loosing suction and falling on the floor. Liquid soap a good fix!
