NOTHING I can think of doing will peel the paper off the second side of the tape.  The really nice bumpers are worthless with one-sided tape.  I need an instructional video on how to liberate the tape.  The tape is very sticky on the side I successfully exposed  It is so thin it's hard to tell if there Is removable paper on the second side.  Two of us struggled for more than 10 minutes.  I give up.
