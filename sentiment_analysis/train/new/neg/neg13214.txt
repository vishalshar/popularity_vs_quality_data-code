Starting out, the bottles worked well and we didn't have any issues. That's why we rated it 2 stars, cause we initially really liked the bottles. Over the course of a couple months, many of the bottles began leaking from the seal between the nipple and ring. At around 3 to 4 months, many of the bottles would crack and break 1 cm above the base of the bottle.  Out of the 8 large bottles that we purchased, 5 cracked and broke. 1 bottle broke in mid-air after being transported from the bottle warmer.  1 bottle broke while we were washing it under the sink. 3 bottles broke when we took refrigerated milk and placed it in the bottle warmer. The bottles have trouble changing temperature from the refrigerator to being heated up in the warmer apparently. Initially we thought that this was a one off fluke, but the new bottles we purchased continued to break in the same place. It has been extremely frustrating, especially with my wife having limited breastmilk she is able to express. We've lost some hard earned pumped milk due to these bottles and a wailing baby waiting to be fed! We are not satisfied with our purchases and will have to look for bottles elsewhere.
