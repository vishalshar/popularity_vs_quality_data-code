BEWARE*WARNING* I would give this seat 0 stars if I could. I have had this car seat since early 2013 and have loved how narrow it is. HOWEVER a few months ago as I was buckling my son into the seat as I pulled the strap to tighten the chest harness one of the straps ripped entirely in half. It looks as though there must have been a weakness in the strap because it tore in a relatively clean line right in 2 pieces. Luckily we were in the driveway buckling because if this had happened in a wreck could have cost my child his life. It's been sitting in the garage since to go to the dump but before I take it figured I would warn others about this possible flaw! Photos attached
