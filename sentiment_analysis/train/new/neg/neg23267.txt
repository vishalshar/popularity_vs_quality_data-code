My three year old loves the print on the sheets, pillow case, and comforter!  The comforter is the perfect weight (not to light, not too heavy), but wish it had more stitching to hold the batting in place over time - I am worried it might start to move all over.  I wish the sheets and pillow cases were more cotton than polyester, although my son doesn't seem to mind.  Quality seems to be great so far!  I had a difficult time finding firetruck bedding that wasn't for a nursery, so this was the perfect blend of graphics for the preschool crowd.UPDATE - After four months the stitching came apart at the top seam of the comforter - that is just annoying.  After a few months with this set I really wish it was all cotton instead of a polyester blend.  My kiddo has had more than one sweaty night with these sheets...but he still LOVES his firetruck bedding!
