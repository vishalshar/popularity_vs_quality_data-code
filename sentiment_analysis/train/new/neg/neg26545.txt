It is not rocket science to construct a booster seat.  This one is adequate, it does raise the child to the table, however it fails to secure the child to the seat.  It has straps to secure seat to chair, it lamely attempts to secure child to seat.  In the structure of the seat everything is there for a three point harness type belt but for reasons unknown the manufacturers have chosen against this design and just wrap the belt around the child with belts for legs thrown in.  The seat straps are confusing and even when eventually understood can only be used for a child in a comatose state who offers no resistance whatsoever.  If your children willingly submit to the booster seat 100 percent of the time, this is the seat for you, for everyone else it is, at the very best, adequate.
