My 20 month old daughter LOVES this couch! It's the perfect size for her and she adores rolling all over it, running and jumping on it, etc. However,  it is very flimsy, the material slips and slides and it just isnt sturdy at all. I was hoping for something a bit more sturdy to hold up to her rough playing. As it is, Im afraid it wont last too long before it needs replacing. It gets 3 stars though, because she really loves playing on it and she doesnt have any complaints!
