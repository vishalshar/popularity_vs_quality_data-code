I loved the concept for this spoon and fork set so purchased it for my 10 month old son.  A 10 to 11 month old child chews just about everything that he can get his hands on.  My son is no exception.  He took to the spoon and fork and would chew it from every angle.  Much to my dismay, he was able to bite off a chunk of the orange material.  This set is NOT safe for the advertised age of 9 months and up.  Two stars for the concept.  I am returning this product to Amazon.com.
