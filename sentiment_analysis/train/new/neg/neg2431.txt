I'm not very happy with this basket.  It's not bad,  it's just not like I was expecting.  I wanted it for the bathroom counter to hold rolled up guest towels.It looks a little plain. And it's scratchy to touch  (due to the way it was made) with sticks poking out. I decided to keep it instead of bothering with the return process, and use it as a catch-all, storage basket to put in the kitchen.I'm sure it will serve it's new purchase well enough.  Oh, and BTW, I'm not usually picky about this stuff.  I appreciate a good, discounted item. That's why this has 3 stars instead of 1.BOTTOM LINE :Product is basically as describedI would not purchase againI would probably not recommend this to friends and family
