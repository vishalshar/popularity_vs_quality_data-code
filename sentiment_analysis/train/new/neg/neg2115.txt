very similar in appearance to a durabib (by dexbaby), but sadly is an imitation that lasted less than 4 months for me.  the plastic front peeled off with the picture, leaving the bib both ugly and not water resistant. it got stinky fast, and a machine washing just shredded it.  luckily I had tucked away my worn durabib (that had lasted over a year) and started using it again, and am still using it now 6 months later. the picture is worn but it still repels fluids/food and is holding up.
