I had such high hopes for this chair, but it arrived BROKEN at the seat area. There is a big chunk piece of the chair that just broke off easily. This is so disappointing...the defective area is right where my baby would have sat and the broken area exposes many sharp jagged edges that are dangerous. Also, the chair is too small to fit my daughter (who is only 4 months).This is a TERRIBLE product, I wouldn't recommend any mom to buy it.
