I was looking for more toys to put in the car and came across this one.. so we gave it to my daughter for Christmas (who is now 19.5 months).  It is now not even in the car.. she doesnt play with it.Wonderful concept.. but some drawbacks:-  There is a picture (a pretty big picture) of a duck on the mat.. but no duck on the steering wheel!  Why!?  My daughter absolutely loves ducks.. so that doesnt make any sense to me.-  There is a green thing that attaches to the car seat to keep the steering wheel handy.. so it can be easily accessible for your toddler.. however, my daughter got so frustrated when she couldnt get the steering wheel where she wanted it!  The little green thing is short and doesnt allow you to have that much mobility with it, so my daughter was easily upset when she couldnt get the steering wheel where she wanted it.-  It is loud.  There is no volume control, so this is not recommended for parents who dont like loud toys.I think this is a good concept, but the toy could use some work to make it more entertaining for the child.. so I gave this toy 3 stars.
