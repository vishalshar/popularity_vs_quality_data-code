Caution!  A bit of a conundrum on how many stars to rate this product.Pros: It is an attractive, colorful and beautiful work of art for our grand-daughter and she does love to watch it.  Our daughter had my husband install it over her bassinet so that she can watch it during diaper changes and sponge baths.Cons:  While installing it over  the bassinet, as soon as my husband lifted it off the bassinet to hang it from the ceiling hook, one of the quarter size flowers fell off and onto the bassinet.  Talk about a choking hazard!We decided to move the ceiling hook so it no longer hangs directly over baby and bassinet,even though baby is never left alone on the bassinet.We highly recommend AGAINST hanging this particular mobile over a crib!!!
