I've owned a number of baby monitors now and this is, by far, my least favorite.  In short, the signal is flakey, the volume is poor, the battery life is horrible, I have no idea how the channel selection works, and the price is too high for what I received.The longer review: I live in a house that is part stone, with my bedroom and the nursery on either sides of a 1-foot thick stone wall.  So I needed a monitor that had long range.  We bought this one since it comes with two receivers with the thought that one could live in our room and the other on the first floor where we spend a lot of our time.  The small size, built-in clip, long range and vibrating signal also meant we could wear it outside the house.  I've used the monitor for about 8 months and found that it is a lot more of a headache than its high price is worth.  There are some good points: the receivers are small and light weight, the noise-indicator lights are useful, and the vibrate feature can be set to vibrate at different noise levels.  However, there are a lot more cons.  When fully charged, the battery lasts about 90 minutes.  The maximum volume is pretty low which makes the monitor useless when e.g. I am cooking or the dishwasher is running.  The signal comes and goes, so that some nights I'm woken up by a lost-signal alarm, even though the unit has not moved in weeks.I just upgraded to a Summer Infant Video monitor that claims its signal is best at less than 100 feet, and it is able to provide crisp, consistent video and audio signal with the transmitter and receiver in the exact same place.  So in the long run, I'm just kicking myself for not spending a few more dollars and getting the better unit up front.  Sigh...
