Open the package and throw the suction cup right in the trash.  It's made of rigid cheap material that will not hold suction.  Not even for a minute.  The ball joint is also stuck in one position.  Absolute P.O.S.  The clip works as expected but then you have to remove it every time you flip down your visor.  The reflective surface can be distorted but that was to be expected for the price paid.  Still, I wish I hadn't bought it.  Crap, I bought two didn't I?
