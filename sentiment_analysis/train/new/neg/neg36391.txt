I initially loved this stroller. What is concerning to me is that with my son at 25 pounds and 20 months I have had to stop using it. I can barely snap the harness closed as the crotch strap is so short. If my son is wearing a onesie and the strap moves to the side it is so tight it has made a mark on his leg. I'm concerned with his circulation being cut off to his leg and lower area. After 3 months we are having to stop using this stroller, what a waste of money!I have contacted the manufacture, they stated that was the way it is made and there is no concern or fix for it at this time. The first person I spoke with at the company stated there was a strap extension, but then the second person said it was not for my model....so this is an issue with other models too!!!!***Update - I sent Mia Moda's CEO a letter on August 30 about the concerns I had regarding the harness, six week later there has been no response from the company. I have altered the strap myself by cutting out the buckle and adding a new longer piece of nylon strapping. It works but I would have at least liked a reply from the company. I resorted to doing this myself as we had a trip to Disneyland and couldn't afford another stroller at this time. Also, I'm sure I've now negated any warrantee there may have been but seeing that they've been less than helpful with this issue I don't think I'm going to worry about that.***
