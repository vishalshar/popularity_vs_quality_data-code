This would have been wonderful to have taken the time to look int cloth diapers when my kids were little. I am using this for my 2 yo for night time protection. It is very nice, but the crotch is too wide for her to be confortable and to not have the insert bunch up. It only lasts for one pee and then it need to go to the wash. It is so cute and I wish I would have used these when she was younger, but now I think she is just too big.
