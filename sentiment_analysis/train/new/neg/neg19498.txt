I tried to use the camera within our home wireless lan (Verizon FIOS router). I had no problems making the cam part of the network. But the app lost connection every few seconds for a short period of time. I was in contact with the support and tried to play around with the router settings to make it work. I am tech savvy, know what UPNP is but still couldn't get it to work. It probably works fine out of the box in some environments but not in mine. After one day of playing around it went back to Amazon.I also have some privacy concerns since you are connecting the camera to an external service even when you are only using it within your own network.I ended up buying the Philips Avent camera with monitor (Philips Avent Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision). Less features but works fine out of the box and I can take the system with me when traveling without bothering anyone about reconfiguring their router for me and my baby phone.
