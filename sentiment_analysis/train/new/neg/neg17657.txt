The weight limit for the seat in the recline position and also the swing is only 19.8lbs.I have a 4 month old that weight 17lbs and is 27 inches long and he barely fits in the seat due to the location of the bar between the legs which you are not able to adjust or remove.As others have mentioned, it is very easy for a child to get their fingers pinched when using the swing. I was sitting and talking with my little guy while he was in the swing and it happened so quickly I could not even intervene.Even though he is under the weight limit for use of the swing, when using it, there was a pretty significant movement of the entire base of the chair.There is also a pretty large gap between the seat and the tray table so my son could not play with his toys on the tray table while sitting in the seat. This may not be an issue if he was a bigger/older child but we purchased this seat for him to be able to use now - besides, I really do not think he will even fit in the seat if he got any bigger.The chair overall appears relatively well made but I did notice on the side joints where the white piece that holds the chair is attached to the gray piece of the base, there was a bit of a gap and needed to be pushed down a couple of times. Im not sure how this affects the safety of the chair if at all.I like the location of the break system - easy to access and easy to use.I didn't have any problems pushing the chair on carpet - in fact it moved very smoothly.We will be returning this chair. The fact that my little guy got his fingers pinched so easily/quickly when in the swing position was enough to make me want to return it but given that he hardly fits and is only 4 months old its hardly worth the price of the chair for what little use we would likely get out of it.
