Heaviest furniture delivery for little one's room. It arrived 2 days after placing the order using the free shipping option. Pleasant surprise there!It took hubby 2.5 hours to assemble the whole thing by himself. Mind you, hubby is very handy. Took him less than 8 minutes to put together the glider.Looks nice but as hubby was screwing the drawer rollers in, you can hear the wood cracking as it is just recycled and cheap wood. 2 of the supporting side woods are actually in need of replacement due to almost half of it being gone and disintegrated inside the packaging. Will call amazon about replacing the parts. For now, because I was so excited to just take pictures, hubby made the bottom drawer work. Also, the knobs are a little loose, hubby had to replace the screw and used a bigger one than the ones supplied, now it's fine.UPDATE: Due to this item being a product from the Amazon Warehouse, Amazon could not replace the part. They need to replace the whole thing, which was out of the question. They offered for a full refund if I returned the item but because I already have this assembled and the box thrown, that was not an option either. So Amazon gave me a 20% credit back. Good enough for a damaged drawer part. Hubby just had to reinforce it and it's working fine for now.
