Such a great idea for babies! When I saw this bean bag I knew I had to have it for my new baby. He loved it and it was perfect for taking to friends and families for him to sit on and perfect for propping him up in the kitchen while I was cooking, or taking a shower, etc. The only down fall that I had was after a few months it did get a hole in the stitching on the side and the plastic buckle broke so we weren't able to secure him anymore which kind of scared me so I had to stop using it. I was able to sew the hole up but I couldn't fix the buckle unfortunately. I most likely wouldn't buy again just because it's very expensive and poorly made, but the idea is wonderful! I'm having a girl this time and the pink one is super cute. I wish I could find something similar but they all seem the same. Either way, this was still a good thing to have for new babies.
