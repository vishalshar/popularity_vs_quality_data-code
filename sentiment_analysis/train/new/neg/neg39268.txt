We purchased the Peek-A-Boo Forrest book before this one and it was a huge hit with our son.  We wanted to expand the collection and decided to purchase this Peek-A-Boo Puppy book.  We were extremely disappointed to find it had no story...it's just a cloth book of pictures, which is less exciting and engaging for our 9 month old son.  My husband created a rhyme for the book, but still disappointing since he and I are the only ones that know the words so no one else can 'read' this one to him.
