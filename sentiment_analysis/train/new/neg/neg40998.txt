i bought these to try mainly because these are longer in length, and I was looking for something longer than the Muchkin Arm & Hammer disposable changing pad.  These are longer and slightly narrower.  The material is more "thin foam" like and feel like it would be easier to break than the Muchkin brand.  I feel like I have to be extra careful with them not to poke a hole in it.  But so far, it has work ok as I was being extra careful.  I still prefer the Muchkin brand at the end, and bought more of those instead
