Honestly I was expecting a lot more for $350+. The bag felt very cheap (it was more plastic than leather) very hard to open and close, so not convenient with a baby in your arms. And looked nothing like what's pictures as far as color and quality. We didn't even use it, and chose to return the item immediately. We found a much nicer unisex diaper bag at Pottery Barn Kids for less than have the price.
