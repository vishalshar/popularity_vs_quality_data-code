This mirror is made from some sort of "safety" material which distorts the image so badly you cannot even make out a familiar face in the back seat!I purchased this to bounce off a higher quality mirror facing a rear-facing car seat so that I could view the baby without twisting around and taking my eyes off the road. There is no chance of that working because I cannot recognize even an adult face with this mirror.There doesn't seem to be much point in sacrificing the quality of the mirror for safety reasons since this is designed to go on the rear view mirror and not to be handled by small children. And the sacrifice is complete. I would return it, but we already installed it. The only good thing about this product is that it flips up behind the rear view mirror so that it is not in the way when you do not need to use it.... of course it is always that way because it doesn't work. I am trying to figure out if I can somehow attach a functional mirror to this plastic frame to salvage my purchase to some extent.
