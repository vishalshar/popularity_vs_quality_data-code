I am not a fan of Peg Perego.  All of their stuff is expensive.  The vast majority of it is not worth it.  Their Duette twin stroller has some merits and breaks this trend - so when I was stroller shopping for a side-by-side I gave the Aria Twin a good consideration.And my verdict was...  ummm, no.This is a double stroller, not a twin stroller.  The seats are different sizes.  It looks odd and seems unfair to the kids.Only one seat takes a car seat - which explains the two seat sizes, and means if you have two babies in buckets, this won't fly.  If you have an older and a younger, well, then you don't have twins - which is why I say this is not a twin stroller.  It's either made for an older child and a younger child, or it's made so you have a little more hassle with infant twins.  And if you have infant twins, "more hassle" is really not high on the list of things you need.  It doesn't even make the top 10.For something so chintzy, it doesn't fold up as compactly as some other double strollers.  To be fair, this is due to it's having a solid bar across the back, as opposed to a little handle on either side a la Maclaren (which I think is also way overpriced).  This is actually a perk as it makes it easier to push with one hand - but this stroller has too many negatives to really strongly consider that as a reason to put up with the less than compact fold.The seats feel hard, cheap, flimsy.The only thing this stroller has going for it over some other doubles, IMO, is the snack tray.The others I tried at the store I looked at this one were the Graco Twin Ipo and the Baby Jogger mini double.  Graco Ipo has some flaws but feels much nicer than this to push, folds up smaller, and costs 1/2 as much.  Baby Jogger costs slightly more but feels so much nicer.If you buy this one you are paying for the Peg Perego name, a name which I cannot understand why so many go ga-ga for.  It's not worth the money.  You can find better at a variety of prices.
