I bought four of these sheets for my daughter's pack-and-play and for the one she uses at daycare.  Three of the four have pilled very badly, and I'm actually throwing one out today.  The others I try to salvage after each wash by snipping (by hand!) all of the little balls off.  I also try to wash them inside out and hang them to dry... way too much work for crib sheets!  I'm really disappointed because I want to like them... they are nice feeling and they are cushy, but the pilling is driving me nuts.  I don't want my daughter picking at the balls while she's trying to fall asleep or when she wakes up and then eating them.  They come off when you pull at them, but then they leave little fibers behind that will pick up laundry lint the next time they're washed!  Ugh.  Sad, sad, sad.  Wish they were higher quality.  Would not recommend them or buy them again.
