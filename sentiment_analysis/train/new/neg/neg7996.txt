I would rate this as average.  The blanket is not as big as I would have liked.  The colors are soft and not really very bold.  So again, it depends on what your goal is.  I would rather the colors have been bolder.  The sesame street characters on the fitted sheet are very cute.  Basically you get what you pay for and you really can't expect much for a $50 three piece bedding set.  It did support the Sesame Street theme in my nursery and it is really only for show b/c blankets and bumpers are dangerous to the baby.  I also purchased the mobile so the entire look was nice.
