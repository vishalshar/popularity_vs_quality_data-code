I give this 3 stars only because the item is NOT what Amazon describes it as. Amazon says the Toffee Dot co-sleeper can be used as a play yard, but this is not the convertible model that can be used as a play yard. Amazon needs to fix that typo. The seller was willing to work with me, although it took 4 co-sleepers to finally get the right one that converts to a play yard. Now that I actually have the right product, I like it (but I do not have the same one pictured here).
