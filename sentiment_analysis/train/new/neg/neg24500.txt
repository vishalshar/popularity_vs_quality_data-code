Very Disappointed in this bag. Baby Jogger's website states that there is plenty of room for this to hold an extra seat as well, which was how we gate-checked the stroller. We decided to get the bag since the individual components (the base, the two seats) were more likely to get lost or damaged if loaded on separately. Well, by the time we reached our destination (direct flight)there were two tears on the bottom of the bag. While this did not tear to the point of uselessness, this did allow for fraying of one of the seat's canopy edge. I do appreciate the compartments for the wheels so that at least that component cannot get thrashed around but I do wish they made the bag of a higher grade denier and with a reinforced bottom. I will be on the hunt for a better bag.Update: Good customer service. Received new bag. Lined it with duck tape on the inside--just the bottom a few inches past the corners and a little bit up the sides. Has held up because of that, I think. One problem: baggage handlers think this is baggage and not a gate checked stroller and even though it always had a gate check tag on it, more than once it landed up in the baggage claim instead of being brought out to me. Perhaps baggage handlers can't read the large "Baby Jogger" on the side. Maybe Baby Jogger should clearly mark it as a STROLLER GATE CHECK.
