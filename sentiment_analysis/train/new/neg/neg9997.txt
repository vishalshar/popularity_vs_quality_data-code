It is quite good at first, ie, serves its function of indicating when food is too hot.However, after using for less than 3 months, the spoon appears discoloured, ie, it seems to be permanently set in white colour even though the temperature is cool. Please refer to pictures attached.Not sure if this is inherent in its design, if so, it is not satisfactory given such a short lifetime.
