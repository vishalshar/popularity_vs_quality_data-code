I bought two Snug tub jrs. for my twins girls. They began using them at 8 mo when they could sit up on their own. Within 2 -3 weeks of use, both tubs developed a rupture of the plastic at the vertical seam at the rear of the tub. The sealing kit included with the tubs was useless and I had to throw both of them away. The poor construction is clearly the problem (Kel-gar).  Perhaps another company can get it right.
