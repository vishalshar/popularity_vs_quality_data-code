This puzzle is adorable and well-constructed from good materials, the one problem is that all the pieces are one of two shapes and can fit in any of the puzzle slots. My 18-month old is good at puzzles but he doesn't recognize colors yet so he can easily fit the pieces into any given slot and it's not much of a challenge. If I were buying this puzzle for color matching then it might be okay as the kids are supposed to match the color and number of bird with the bird underneath, but I would prefer that in addition to the color and number matching that each of the shapes be slightly different so as to give an added challenge and more versatility to the puzzle.For now I'm sticking with the Melissa and Doug puzzles, which are of similar quality and cuteness but come and different puzzle shapes.
