Ok product. Color of wood is not true to color on photo. I bought it in oak color. It's way darker and more gold/red toned. I tried to match it with a light colored moses basket from Tadpoles and it was way off. Would go for natural color next time. Rocking motion is not very smooth. Pretty wobbly. Some of the holes supposed to fit the screws were off kilter and that didn't help with that issue either. Didn't have time to return it, so solved that by putting a rug under it and it helped a lot. Probably not a big problem if you have carpet.
