The little buggies themselves are great and very engaging (the lady bug rattles and the butterfly has crinkly wings) but the 'socks' are rather obnoxious. They're more like little sleeves and our son loves to kick and he had these things kicked half off in less than a few minutes. Soooooo I cut the toes off of these (right past where the bugs are sewn on) and stitched them (be sure to use tiny stitches so your baby's tiny toes don't get stuck) to a pair of regular baby socks and we have a winner! I wish these would have come attached to a more traditional sock in the first place but it's a relatively easy fix that can be done with little skill in sewing
