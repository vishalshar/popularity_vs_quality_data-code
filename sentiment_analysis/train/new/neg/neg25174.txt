We used this mirror when we took a 700 mile (round trip) drive with our son when he was 2 weeks old and it works well in very dark areas.  If there are streetlights, however, the light is too weak to illuminate the baby's face (and I was using freshly charged NiCad rechargeable batteries).  My son is now 6 months old and the light stopped working a few months ago, not sure how long it actually lasted as we bought a minivan when he was 3 months old and I just use the dome light to check on him now.  The mirror's curvature makes it great for getting a look at more than just the baby's face - some mirrors I tried I could't even see his whole face when he was much smaller, this one I can actually see if his pacifier is in his lap or not.  Good for small cars (we still use it in the Honda Civic on the rare occasions he's in that car instead of the minivan).  It'd be a 5-star if the light was brighter and more durable, or if it was just a mirror without a light, but it raised expectations by having added features!
