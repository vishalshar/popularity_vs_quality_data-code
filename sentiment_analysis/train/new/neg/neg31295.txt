The picture and description on amazon said it was a square, large crawling mat. The one that was shipped to me was very cute but not as big as the one i ordered and It was circle shaped, not square. As a new mother, my advice to you now would be skip getting a crawling mat all together. My daughter was not very amused by the mat and when i got it she was 6 months so she just started crawling. Children grow so fast I think these purchases are kind of pointless. She did NOT want to stay on the mat at all. We have all hard wood floors so i thought this would be a smart buy. Parents, get an area rug instead. Area rugs don't really move and you'll use them forever.
