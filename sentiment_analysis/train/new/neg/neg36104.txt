This is the only monitor we've ever owned. So far, we like it. The only problems we have with it are the volume (we'd like it to be louder) and the hand held unit sometimes randomly decides it's out of range, but this is only in one room, so it may be our house that's the problem.Overall, it's a good monitor, just wish it was a bit louder.Update: We've had this for less than a year. It no longer works properly. It loses signal constantly. Even when we're standing directly outside the very thin door to our child's room. When it's not losing signal, it's refusing to charge. Wish we'd forked over the extra money for a better monitor. We're going to have to buy a different one for our next baby anyway, seeing as there's no way this will work.August 2015 update: We had this for just under a year. The parent unit died. Completely dead. Even worse, I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and noticed a strange smell like burning plastic which turned out to be coming from the parent unit which was left plugged in in hopes that it would spontaneously decide to charge (as it usually did.) I picked it up to unplug it and immediately had to drop it. The plastic was too hot to hold. There's a metal clip on the back that my finger grazed and it was even hotter than the plastic. We will never buy another Summer Infant product again.
