This was great for me for the first 2 months of my son's life, but once he got over 12 lbs and the temperature rose above 70 farenheit, it was no longer comfortable for me. For one, he didn't want to face me as he got older (by 5 months or so), so I couldn't really do ANY wraps or ergonomic carriers. But even if he'd been comfortable facing me, the amount of fabric on this made me too warm for the southern climate in which I live! I used it only occasionally when he was 2-5 months, and only in an attempt to soothe him or do a bit of gardening. I could only stand it for about 20 minutes at a time, though.That being said, I did not find the wrap overwhelmingly difficult to use. There is a lot of fabric, but I think it was fairly manageable and might be worth trying for those in cooler climates. The quality was great, and it washed up in the machine perfectly.
