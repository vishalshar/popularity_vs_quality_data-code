These brushes are a great idea, and I really wanted them to work, but they fell apart the first time I used them. I have severe vertigo, so I drink all of my beverages in sippy cups; I use Munchkin 10oz sippy cups for regular drinks and Camelbak water bottles for my regular water bottle- if it saves me from having to mop up Coke off the couch, I am going to use baby cups lol. I searched around to find brushes to clean those bottles, which have bite-to-drink mouthpieces made of silicone that tend to collect whatever you drink and get nasty if they are not cleaned well (The Camelbak gets nasty when just water is left more than a day in it, and though the mouthpiece is removable it is a total pain in the ass to clean, but that is another review lol), and was even using pipe cleaners, until I found these brushes and thought they would be perfect, especially since they were made by the company for these types of cups. The first time I used them, however, the bristles fell off the brush, rendering them useless. First I thought maybe I just got one defective brush, but each one I tried dissolved as I pushed it through the straw or valve- and it is literally marked on the handle that it is for cleaning that part ( the green one says "straw", the blue says "valve", the pink says "spout"), so it's not like they were used wrong, but they just fell apart, leaving little brush bits all over the inside of the cup and straw, and leaving the brush as a naked metal stick....Total waste of money all around ( but the idea was good). I took a picture of the brushes missing the bristles so you can see what happens when you use them, and I also took a picture of the set that I bought to replace this set- the OXO brush set; it was four times the price, but it works great, and comes with a big brush to wash the inside of the bottles themselves, and the skinny brush can be bent in all sorts of directions to clean straws, valves, etc.
