My husband and I spent a lot of time with our baby in Target last week putting him in and out of convertible carseat models. We were about to buy this Evenflo model--it is super soft, has great shoulder strap adjustments, etc.--but in the end decided against it. The deal killer was the harness buckle that goes between the legs. Even though it can be adjusted away from the baby's body, the clips are hard plastic and bow-shaped. (Look at the close-up picture of the product to see what I mean.)These dug into my little guy's legs and left deep red marks from the straps. Granted, my six-month-old is the size of a one-year-old, but we were looking at this seat specifically as one with growth potential--something he could be in for a few years. If the leg straps were cutting into his legs now, what would it be like in one year and with him in a snowsuit? Not good.We read about this seat elsewhere online and found similar complaints. So if you have a petite thin baby, this seat might be perfect for your little one...but we're getting something else for our little chunker.
