I am 6 and a half months pregnant. I got this pillow a month and a half ago after reading the favorable reviews. I quit using it pretty quickly. Maybe I toss and turn too much for this sort of wedge, but I would consistently wake up with the wedge under me in such a way that I was being stabbed by sharp edges on the velcro (which is underneath)! I am much more comfortable sleeping on my left side with 4 pillows... some skinny and some fluffy ...and a teddy bear (my hubby gets to teeter on the edge of the bed) ;-)
