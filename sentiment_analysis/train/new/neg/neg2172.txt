I bought this to try and transition my 12 month old off the bottle. He's used Nubby sippy cups since age 4 mo but was refusing milk out of a cup. He refused this cup right away. I was confused so tried the cup out myself. Even I couldn't suck anything through it! Definitely leak proof but you can't get the liquid through the nipple or straw either! I'm returning it.
