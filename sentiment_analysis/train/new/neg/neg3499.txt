This product is not for infants who are in the stage of putting everything in their mouth. The cups have cutouts of shapes on the bottom corresponding to the number cup. I.e. Cup 1 has 1 cutout and so on. These cutouts do not have rounded edges and are very rough or sharp. One of the cup's cutout actually still had some sharp plastic attached to it. My son put it in his mouth and cut his tounge! I recommend this product for older toddlers when they're passed the mouth stage.
