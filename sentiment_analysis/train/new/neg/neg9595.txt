Ive been using it for 3 months now and I can't say its magic like other reviews.. but it does help with my son's diaper rashes, and I haven't noticed problems in using it with my cloth diapers. I was suprised however to see lanolin listed on the ingredients list on the packaging.. since it claims to be all natural..and lanolin is not. For that descrepancy it only gets 4 stars.
