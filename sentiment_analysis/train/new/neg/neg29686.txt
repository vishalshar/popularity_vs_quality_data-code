I bought this based on the decent reviews, because my front door (which leads to the street) is the only one in my house that has a lever-type handle - and that's the one he has opened and gone out of the house.  The kid-proof lock was easy to install, and reasonably priced, and served the purpose - for about 3 days.  Then my not-quite-2-year-old grandson watched an adult open the lock by pushing up on the tab and turning the knob simultaneously - and he did the same, and was out the door again.  (His babysitter watched him do it, and was pretty amazed.) So, it's not exactly foolproof.  If you have a rather clever child or grandchild, this might not be the answer!
