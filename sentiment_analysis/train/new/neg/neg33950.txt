Don't waste your money buying these if you plan to use them as diapers. I bought 4 packs and can't return them because I already prepped them and threw out the packaging before my baby was born. These are extremely long; way longer than you would ever need for a child! They are not really wider than the size one prefolds, so unless you are using them trifolded inside the diaper, they likely will not fit around your child. We have been using them as burp cloths, which they work great for, but I would not have paid $19.99 for diapers to use as burp cloths had I known they weren't going to actually fit my child in their intended purpose.
