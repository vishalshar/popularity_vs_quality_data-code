I write this review after 1.5 years of usage.I removed the clothing from the seat to wash it, and I was stunned to see that the foam which is supposed to hold the child's head, is broken; both on the left and on the right side, the foam (~8"x12" piece) is broken down, providing no support for my child whatsoever.When I purchased it, I thought that buying a product which costs twice as much as the second option is the best choice for my child's safety, but now I realize that is not the case. My friends have a Greco product, which cost less than half than this one, and has no problems to date (after more than 2 years of usage).It does not serve its only purpose, to protect the child in case of an accident.And of course, warranty is only one year limited.Shame on you, Britax!!
