This was supposed to be a gift from Santa but the company never actually shipped the package under weeks after I placed the order. I finally received in January.  We've only had for a few days and a piece has already broken on the bottom inside the lining of the chair that my husband will need to fix. The chair is VERY cute but a bit smaller than I expected. It is sized for a 3 - 4 year old child.
