We've had this seat for over 2 years now and it's been through two kids. It's not bad for the price, that's for sure, but it's my least favorite convertible we've used. But a few things that annoy me about it. When they are as tight as they are supposed to be, the straps cut into my kid's neck and leave red marks. I'm sure it's not comfortable for her. Of all of the seats we have used (7 between infant seats and convertible in our cars and grandparents') the straps on this one are the most prone to twisting in unfavorable ways, especially in the buckles. The strap fabric is just thinner than our other seats. Next small complaint: this seat is mostly just hard plastic with a fabric cover -- not much padding or comfort for the kid. Also, I wish the latch system had an easy release button. Of all of these, the complaint that is probably the most annoying because it would've been easy/cheap to fix, is that the cup holders are too small to hold any of my children's cup. I could see them fitting a bottle, but none of their sippy cups or straw cups fit. For those who want a reference, we've found that a tennis ball fits in them but gets stuck. So if the cupholder size matters to you, if your cups' diameter is tennis ball size or smaller, you'll be fine.Again, none of these are huge deals and for the price, this seat is fine. But if you want a GREAT seat, this isn't it. I won't buy it again.
