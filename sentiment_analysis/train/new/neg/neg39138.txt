We've been using these plates about 2 months. I initially loved them, my twins couldn't break them. Then I noticed that my girls didn't want to eat their food off the plates ......the food was taking on a detergent and plastic taste. Yuck!  I only hand wash in organic wash and never use them in the microwave or put in dishwasher. May have to throw these away. :(
