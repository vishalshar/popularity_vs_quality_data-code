After reading all the positive reviews I went out and purchased this item and was disappointed at how difficult it was to use with one hand.  Think about it....in most cases you're going to be holding a squirming infant in one arm and trying to put this thing on a shopping cart or high chair with the other.  It does come bundled up in it's own cute little sack, but it takes two hands and about 30 seconds to actually work the thing out of it's sack.  Once out, it's not super easy to get on the cart with one hand but can be done.  No biggie there...the real trouble comes when you're done shopping and you once again have your squirming infant in one arm and are trying to remove and repackage your floppy seat.  This thing is not small and trying to get it back into it's cute little sack takes some doing. And because it's so big, it's not the kind of thing you want to keep out all the time, loose from it's baggie. Too much work I say, for something that could and should be more convenient.  I exchanged mine for a Buggy Bagg. At first I balked at the price of the Buggy Bagg but later realized it is worth the extra 20 bucks.  Super easy to open, set up, remove and store all with one hand.  Plus it's got a ton of room in the diaper bag compartment so when we go out shopping or dining we don't need a diaper bag anymore.
