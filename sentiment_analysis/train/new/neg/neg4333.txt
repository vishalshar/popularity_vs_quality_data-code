The overall design of these cups is a great idea. The work fantastic to teach your child to drink out of a real cup, and they will not spill if they are gently tipped or turned upside down. HOWEVER, if they are left upside down or on their side, they will leak. This is not something we realized, and we just assumed they were spill proof since they are marketed as a "no spill" design. We were on the road and my son had one of the cups that he dropped, obviously since I was driving I couldn't get it right away, but I didn't think much of it. Yep, juice all over my brand new seats because the cup was on it's side. Oh well, it's no one's fault but my own! Use my mistake so your don't do it!Like I said though, for teaching a child to drink out of a cup, they are fantastic. If you are with your child and can prevent any situations that the cup will be left upside down or on it's side for more than a brief moment, you will be fine. They will also cause a leak if they are dropped, so if your child drops the cup when running around be prepared you will have an area of splatter as well.
