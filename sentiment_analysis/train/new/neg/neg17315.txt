I returned this item for one reason and one reason only, the drawer bottoms.This item arrived and I was surprised at the quality of the wood for a $200 dresser.  I'm sure it's relatively cheap pine or something equivalent, but it's at least real wood that feels sturdy and heavy.  This material makes up all of the visible pieces of the dresser, as well as the sides and back of the drawers.  The dresser arrives completely disassembled and puts together easily w/ wood screws and bolts.  During construction of the drawers I became nonplussed.  Unlike the rest of the dresser, the bottoms of the drawers are thin pieces of particle board that slide into a groove on the drawer sides. By "particle board," I mean the stuff that resembles cardboard in appearance and is slightly stiffer; I believe it is wood pulp held together w/ glue. There is no support for the drawer bottom on the underside and this piece of fiberboard is essentially floating.  This is a poor design decision as the drawer bottoms will support very little weight w/o bowing or possibly breaking.  I tested the sturdiness of the drawer by loading it up w/ some clothing and then looked at the drawer bottom from underneath, it was bulging in the middle where some support was obviously needed.I was dismayed at this design decision especially since I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rest of the dresser for $200.  I ended up returning this piece for this one failing since I do not believe it's a design that's going to stand up to time at all.
