I bought one of these when my first daughter was about 6 months old and I am using it with my 2nd daughter now trying to get my money's worth out of it!The tres tria is very wide (about 10" wide) - good for if you are sleeping in a full/queen by yourself and baby.  I thought I would put it on one edge of my queen sized bed and be able to still have room to sleep comfortably in between my husband and baby, but I was wrong; there's barely enough room for us all.  I ended up making our crib into a sidecar on one side of the bed and not using the tres tria much.  I use this pillow when we travel to see family and friends and I'm in the bed alone with the baby; It's very bulky though.It is a nice concept, but it is just too wide and bulky and expensive!!  Although it has been helpful at times, I still wish I would have saved my $129.
