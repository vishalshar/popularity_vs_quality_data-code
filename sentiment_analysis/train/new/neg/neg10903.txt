This was just too short for me to use with my toddler. For the time being I am attempting to work on teaching him to stay close, hold my hand, or he rides in the cart.I felt this either became too tight around his wrist or waist too easily, or loosened too much to stay on if he was closer to me to the point I worried it would either come off or hurt him if he pulled against it too much.
