I was expecting high hopes for this faucet extender due to the great reviews. I have to agree with some of the negative reviewers - it's way too big and awkward. And it's too big and awkward, it looks big and awkward. Since this is so big and awkward, if your sink isn't huge, then the water almost comes too close to the edge of the sink if it's not adjusted just so. Did I mention it was too big and awkward? I've bought aquaduck in the past..gave this one away and will be buying aquaduck, which is half the size!
