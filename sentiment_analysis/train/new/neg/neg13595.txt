Overall, I like this car seat, mostly because it is so much cheaper than other convertible seats. I got it because of the price and that it was highly recommended on several review sites as safe, cheap, and good for small cars. I have a tiny Mazda2, so something that would fit in a compact car was important. Forward facing it fits fine. Rear-facing, anyone sitting in the passenger seat in front of the car seat is gonna have their knees in the dashboard. Definitely can't put it behind the driver'S seat. In our Chevy pickup, it fits just fine behind the driver.One big flaw:  IT'S SO HARD TO GET THIS SEAT TIGHT ENOUGH. Installation isn't all that difficult, overall, especially using the LATCH. But since the seat doesn't have its own base, things get difficult. The instructions talk about using a rolled up towel or pool noodle to get the seat inclined correctly when rear facing. I didn't have a problem getting it to recline enough, I have a problem getting it NOT to recline too much. When tightening the LATCH belt (which takes superhuman strength to get it to where it moves an inch or less), the seat has a tendency to lean backwards too far - and there's nothing to keep it from going flat on its back. There's no way to tighten it enough to keep it upright. I have to have it against the seat back in front to keep it up. This worries me. Whenever I pull the straps to tighten the buckle, it also tends to lean back, so I have to adjust the incline every time.We also have a Graco MySize, and I love that it has a base that locks into reclined positions and avoids this problem entirely. It was almost twice as much money, but not having to adjust it is a huge plus, and I have more piece of mind about it.But it doesn't fit my small car as well.Pros: cheap, fits small car, good reviewsCons: hard to tighten LATCH belt, and have to always adjust recline position
