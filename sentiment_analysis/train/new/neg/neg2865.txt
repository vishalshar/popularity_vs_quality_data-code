We made the switch from Halo fleece (with foot holes) to Woolino last month and my toddler appropriately exclaimed, "I cant walk in this." I was hoping I'd be able to put it on him before bed and take it off right away when he wakes up, but as we know with toddlers, they're always (literally) one step ahead.  Please make this amazing product with foot holes and I'll buy a second for grandma's.
