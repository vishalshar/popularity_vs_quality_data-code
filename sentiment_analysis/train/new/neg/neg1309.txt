I did not see this book when it arrived since I live in a different state - however - on a recent visit I was able to see the book and was very disappointed in the limit of what it actually does. Basically all it does is makes sounds of the animals when you hold the little bee over a specific area. One of the animals is to difficult for an adult to get a noise from it  - and impossible for a 14 month old. There are no words or story line - basiclly a book of animals that you must hold the bee over to get a sound - nothing else. I don't feel like description by the manufacturer is a fair representation of the actual book. Very dissapointed in this item.
