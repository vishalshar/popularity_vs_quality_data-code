I exchanged my Sigg bottle for a Klean Kanteen and I'm glad I did. They are just so much easier to clean due to the wide opening. I also think they look better. I had read about the sports top causing some, well, noises, but I thought it couldn't really be that bad. Well, it is. Most of the time it doesn't matter, but there are instances when you just want to drink quietly (say, when you're proctoring an exam!). So I got a regular cap as well, no big deal. The regular cap is also leakproof. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, and I love the reef blue color.
