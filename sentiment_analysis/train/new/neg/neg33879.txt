I was excited to find these spoons and forks until I opened the package when they arrived.  They are tiny and not realistic for use by a toddler.  They are tiny and flimsy and I expected a better quality utensil from Green Eats.  Their other dinnerware products, however I am very happy with and highly recommend.The company should consider redesigning this set.
