I bought this when my son was six months old, and he didn't really like it, so it went away. Now he is a year old, and when I brought it out to check for the sharp edges, he of course wanted to play wih it. Here is the drop box url, because my phone stops uploading in the middle of the upload: [...]There are no sharp edges or paint, just ribbon, rubber and plastic, and elastic holding the middle part on.
