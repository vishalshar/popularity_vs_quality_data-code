Im trying to write a review but it is being denied. i dont know why. maybe because it is about the product breaking in the first week of use and the picture ive tried to post. i just want to be treated fairly. I've received it around November 22nd and a week later one of the necklaces was broke. Apparently the knot that holds the buckle went loose and came off. It was in my 7 month old baby and luckily I saw it. Since then he is using the other one because my 2 years old will not wear it. it should not loosen the knot like this and I was extremely disappointed. I wrote to amazon right after it broke and never got an answer.
