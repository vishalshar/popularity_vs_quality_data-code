I love Colgate. Both of my sons have had a Colgate mattress (the Visco-Classica 2-in-1). This mattress was a replacement for the one he had used since birth (we purchased it just prior to him turning 4). Now 9 months down the road all the "stuffing" is coming out of the mattress. For a couple of months I have had to use packing tape to keep it all in. My son likes to jump on his bed occasionally, and this mattress just couldn't stand up to it. If you have a tame child who will use the mattress just to sleep, then you should be fine. However, if you have an active little child like mine, you'll do better with a mattress with a damask cover that won't rip and get caught in the springs of the bed when he (or she) jumps on it.
