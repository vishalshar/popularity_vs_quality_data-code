I have appreciated this product overall, but I'm currently shopping for a different one, and here's why: The cup holders are net on the bottom, so condensation (and spills) fall all over the stroller and/or baby, the cup holders are deep (a good thing) but not wide enough... so there have been times that the cup (think fast food cup with lid) sat so deeply that the lid was popped loose by the rim of the tight cup holder. It CAN hold larger drinks like the ones that are skinnier at the base, but they don't sit at the bottom of the cup holder, so you have to be mindful not to tip them over. Also, the material is not very rigid, making it necessary to use 2 hands to unzip the center compartment. When I'm in a hurry, I want to grab things quickly while continuing to push the stroller with my other hand. So I never zip it shut. And lastly, my Note 3 phone doesn't fit very well in the center, so I have to use up a cup holder for that.
