I do like this blanket, but I was looking for another blanket by jj cole. It is soft and holds up well in the laundry. It also is very large, which was nice for breastfeeding. My only complaints: My husband ripped a hole in it when he ripped the tag off so use scissors instead and the way that it is attached to the packaging makes little holes in the blanket where it is attached. The holes got a bit bigger over time.
