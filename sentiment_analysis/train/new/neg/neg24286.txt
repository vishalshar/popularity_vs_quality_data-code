We recently purchased the new model of Diaper Champ to replace our old one (which we loved, until it recently broke after several years of use.)  The new model STINKS, quite literally!  From the first diaper we put in (peed on, no poop) I could smell a foul odor any time I was near it.  I don't have a particularly strong sense of smell, and I don't believe my expectations are too high for it to contain the smell of wet diapers from a six-month-old -- but I am so disappointed I am considering trying to return it after a week of use.  (Gross, I know -- but I am hoping they would not re-sell it!)  Anyway, I can only assume either a change has been made to the new model that renders it ineffective or that we got a "lemon."  Our old Diaper Champ worked well for our daughter (now 4) from birth till potty-training, then worked well for our son for 6 months until, like several other reviewers, we accidentally broke it by pulling out some foam.  But our new one is completely worthless!  At any rate, I would NOT recommend it to a new mom at this point, and will now investigate other options.  Update: didn't return it, but did get rid of it.  We now put each diaper in a ziploc and take them out nightly with the kitchen trash.  It sounds like from the reviews that some people get "good" versions of this product, and others, like us, get a lemon from the get-go.  You decide: are you willing to spend the money if you are not sure which one you'll get (the one that works or the one that stinks)?
