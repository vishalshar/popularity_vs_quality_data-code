This mobile comes in a tiny, six-inch by 12 inch by half-inch flat cardboard package which looks like it should house a few cards or a bit of stationary. It certainly doesn't look like an expensive mobile. If you're giving this is a gift, you should be aware that the amount of money you spent on it will not be apparent from the packaging.While it is a beautiful mobile, it is made of paper. It's also not assembled when it arrives, so I had to spend over a half hour folding and fiddling with it before I could hang it. I love to do origami, but with a newborn, that is certainly not how I would've chosen to spend my time. If you give this gift to somebody who is not crafty or not good at making tiny, precise folds in paper, this gift might fall flat.Also, because it is made of thin paper, this is clearly not built to last. If a child actually grabbed it, it would be destroyed.Though it is an absolutely gorgeous, delicate little mobile once hung, I think that for the price it should have come fully assembled, and should have had a better gift presentation in the packaging. It kind of hurts to spend so much money on a few little pieces of paper.
