Cheap quality products and the nail clipper is not usable because it is to hard to move the part were you suppose to push on to clip the nails. It would totally injure the baby using this so it landed straight in the trash. Brush and combs are ok but even the suctioning bulb is horrible because it split in two pieces when pushing on it...Failure Buy!
