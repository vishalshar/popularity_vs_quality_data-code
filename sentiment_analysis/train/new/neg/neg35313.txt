We installed this on the horizontal bar between the handles of our quinny zapp stroller.  The cup holder attaches fine but when I put my Starbucks venti iced coffee (daily coffee indulgence) in it (and the cup is full) then the cup holder will swing and tip so it's not vertical anymore.  Due to the cap on the cup there are no spills but it is a bit annoying.  Even though I tighten it as much as possible it will still swing when the cup is full.  So I usually just drink a little bit right away so it's not so top heavy and then the cup holder will stay vertical.Other than that, it's the best one for the price that I found.---------EDIT: After a while the tightening threads have started to strip. That means the the drinks will tip very easily.  We ended up getting rid of the cupholder and purchasing the Bugaboo Cup Holder which is far superior and worth the higher price.
