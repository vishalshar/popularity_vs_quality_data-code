Our 1yo daughter loved this when we first got it, and enjoys climbing all over it when parked.However, the front wheels on it are terrible, and they constantly want to roll in a "pigeon toed" formation... which makes pushing this thing a chore, and if you're like me and expect the stuff you buy to, at the very least, function correctly on a BASIC level... then these front wheels (which could have been designed better with 5 seconds and 5 cents in additional material) are going to ruin your day.I was originally excited to find a nice looking product like this at such a good price... but now I'm thinking the savings weren't worth the constant irritation of actually using it.
