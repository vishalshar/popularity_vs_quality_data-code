I really liked this exersaucer until the toys started popping out very easily from their connectors.  Our baby girl is pretty rough on things, but I feel like the toys should stay in place better than they have.  Also, unless this is used on a hard floor, the walk-around wheels and concept does not work as well as expected.  Our tree leans to one side, as well.  I hope others have had more luck with this items than we have!
