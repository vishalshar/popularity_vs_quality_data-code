This booster seat is attractive, and I'm sure it's safe. However, the straps/hooks that secure it to your car are so POORLY ENGINEERED that you will scrape and bruise your fingers trying to get the seat OUT of the car when you're finished using it. The straps with hooks are so short that you cannot possibly UNCLASP the metal hooks from the securing rod that comes with all cars. I spent 15 minutes trying to get one of t 2 seats I purchased out of my car. I have spent another 25 minutes attempting to release the second seat, with no luck so far. And I'm pretty tech-savvy when it comes to things like this. Who hires engineers who produce items like this?? If the securing straps were 6 inches longer, the problem would be solved.  And since you TIGHTEN the straps to secure the booster seat into the car, what difference would it make if they were longer? I would not buy these seats again......and will tell everyone the same. In the meantime, I'll be driving with 1 seat I don't want attached.
