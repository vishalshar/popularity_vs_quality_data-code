I like the idea of this product, and I dislike the idea of highly-chemical dryer sheets. However, with these balls, our clothes are still full of static. We bought three, then another three a month later upon reading reviews that six were best for static. I am really disappointed that we spent the money on these. Our clothes are so full of static that we're spraying each other with Static Guard on our way out the door. Hah! If anyone out there is reading this and has advice for eliminating static without chemicals, please comment!Our setup: high efficiency dryer with 6 dryer balls, dry winter weather.
