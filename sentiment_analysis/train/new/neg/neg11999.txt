Like every parent, I've struggled to find a straw cup my kid likes and doesn't leak too bad (I mean, they all leak as the liquid warms, right?).Here's what I like about this cup:-Doesn't spill and very rarely does the liquid leak out as it warms...MUCH, MUCH less than other cups we've used-My kid likes it and she definitely consumes more liquid throughout the day with these than she did with sippy cups or other straw cups we've tried-Pretty easy to assemble/cleanWhat I don't like:-The bottom piece to the straw doesn't always stay attached..which really pisses my toddler off (and in turn, me); basically it isn't a snug fit into the top piece of the straw-The straw doesn't reach all the way to the bottom of the cup, so there'll be an inch of liquid left in the cup, but totally inaccessible-Plus, my kid naturally tilts cups towards her when she drinks, and the straw unfortunately doesn't reach to the close corner to reach where all of the liquid collects - it reaches to the opposite side...which is just air; again = pissed off toddlerOverall they work for us...we just now know that if the liquid is getting low, we will need to open it up and refill it.  Plus, at the end of the day we may have to dump some milk (or, uh, transfer it to the cup for tomorrow).
