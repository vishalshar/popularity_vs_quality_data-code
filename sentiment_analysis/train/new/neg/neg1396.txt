Simply because it slides easily and becomes unsecured when you try to position your kid to sit over it. My kid used it a couple of times up till now and he hates it and feels uncomfortable when in use because it shakes after he sits and as mentioned before, it slides like crazy regardless the presence of some thin pieces of stabilizing foam. I still appreciate the idea of making a portable and foldable potty seat cover for hygienic and comfy reasons , but I could be better.
