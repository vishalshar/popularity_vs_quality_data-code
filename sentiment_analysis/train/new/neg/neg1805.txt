I had this nursing pad on for about 4 hours, and when I went to nurse, a piece of stuffing/filling fell out on my baby's mouth. Thankfully i was able to grab it quickly, and when I looked, the stuffing in the pad was coming out the side. Won't buy this again, and throwing away the ones I have left. Cancelling my subscribe and save. This could have been worse, had it gotten in my baby's mouth. I'm going back to ordering the Lansinoh brand.
