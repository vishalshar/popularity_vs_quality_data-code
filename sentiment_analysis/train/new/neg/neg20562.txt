Don't buy this. This is a pretty stiff elastic clay and even though I pressed my sons hand into it with enough force to make a good imprint the imprint actually faded as it dried!  So you can't even tell there was a handprint Pete except for a couple of the deeper indents of fingers. If I used any more force I would have hurt him. I bought the one that is plaster by a different brand and it worked great. Get that one instead
