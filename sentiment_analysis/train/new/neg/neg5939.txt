I purchased this crib for my granddaughter, who lives with me. The directions are not as clear as they could be AND they are printed on the crib mattress support board. So it is awkward to stare at printed directions on a board versus having a sheet of paper you can refer to. They aren't clear, so I had to undo some parts once I realized I'd gotten it wrong. Once you put it together it seems like a good crib. Not the best made thing out there, but you get what you pay for, and for me...this will work for the first two years of life. My granddaughter is only 2 months old, so hopefully this will hold out well once she is old enough to pull to standing and bounce around in a crib. We'll see...
