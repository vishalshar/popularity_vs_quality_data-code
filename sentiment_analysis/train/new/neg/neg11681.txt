I purchased this mainly just to wear for short periods of time....when I am taking the dog outside or waiting out at the bus stop in the morning with our older daughter..It works GREAT for those occasions.  It is even nice to wear around the house sometimes to get a few chores done when baby is in a cuddly mood. I definately wouldn't recommend this for wear for long periods of time unless your baby is still small.  Our daughter has almost outgrown it (weight limit is 20 pounds for this model)She is almost 17 pounds at 4 months and after about 20 mins of carrying her in the carrier it starts to get at your back - even with the straps adjusted correctly.  I think it's just because she is getting bigger because it was always really comfortable until now.  I still would recommend this product because it is a great deal if you are just looking for a basic carrier.  :-)
