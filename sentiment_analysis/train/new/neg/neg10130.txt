This pump is okay for an electric double pump. I didn't give it 5 stars because there are two things wrong with the design. First, the shields are built in a way that make you hunch over while pumping, because if you don't then the milk MAY dribble or leak out of the shield where your nipple is attached to it. So you end up getting a sore back. Second, it is not a hands-free pump. So, you are tied to the machine until you are finished.It takes me about 10 minutes per breast for 4 oz of milk, unless I pump both at the same time (which leaves more time for sleep), then I can get 8oz in 10 min.Here are some tips for this pump:-Make sure you play with the setting for speed and suction. I like the medium suction with a speed of 4.-If you aren't getting much milk, stop the pump and massage your breasts and try again or wait 10-15 min. before trying to pump again.-This pump is not only for those who are planning to return to work. I pump so I can get 5-6 hours of consecutive sleep (while relatives or my husband watch them - twins) or so i can run a few errands without the twins.
