This worked really well for the first two months, but after using this as my stroller in the city for four months it is literally about to fall apart. I primarily wear my baby so I probably only use it twice a week. I realize it is not a top of the line stroller, but I had hoped I could have used until my son is old enough to use my city mini at 6 months.
