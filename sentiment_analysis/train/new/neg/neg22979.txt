This thing should be called "Baby's First Slot Machine." It's so loud and obnoxious, I had to tape over the speaker.  The lights and sounds can be turned off but then there is no point to it.  It's supposed to be for 0+ months, but most babies can't pull the handles until they are 4 months, and even then they can't really see the lights while on their backs because of the way it's designed.  Also, there is nothing for the baby on the inside of the legs, where they can see it. I wasn't planning to use this as a walker, as that's unsafe, so this thing is useless.  Would have returned it, but didn't feel like lugging the giant box it came in to the post office.  I got the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Kick and Crawl Gym to replace this and he LOVES it.  Plus, it can actually grow with your child, without causing safety issues.
