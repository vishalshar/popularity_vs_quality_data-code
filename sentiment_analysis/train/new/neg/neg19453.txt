Really did not like this mattress! Soon as it came in when I went to lift it I could feel the springs poking my hand. I could never imagine laying my precious baby onto something like this. Returned it and got the foam one instead. LOVE THE FOAM ONE! Save yourself the trouble and get that one instead. Unless you yourself love to sleep on something and feel springs poking you.
