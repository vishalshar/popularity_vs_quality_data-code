I bought these bottles thinking that with the excellent reviews....how could I go wrong?? These bottles are AWFUL. Besides having a ton of parts, my bottles leak...like every single one! I prepared a bottle today after pumping for a trip and half of the milk spilt out of the bottle. Nothing quite hurts like your precious milk spilling out...let alone having to clean it up out of the car. Do yourself a favor and avoid these at all costs. This is my first Amazon review ever and I hope it helps someone.
