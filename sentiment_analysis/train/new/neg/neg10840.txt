I bought this diaper bag just before I had my little boy and its a fairly decent bag. It fits alot of his things (will not fit everything needed for a prolonged stay such as 10 hours at the babysitters while I work) So I do have to carry a second bag just for clothes and toys. The bag is rather attractive for a diaper bag and is insulated with dividers. My only real complaint with this bag is that its not that durable my little boy is now 6 mos. old and the bag is pretty beat up looking Im gonna have to buy another bag. When he was only 3 mos. old I began to notice the lineing on the inside of the bottle compartments had pretty bad rips in them. Now there is much more damage and were actually really easy on this diaper bag so it shouldnt be wearing and tearing the way that it has. I wish I could write a review for the small black bag the hospital gave me its holding out great and is still in brand new condition!!
