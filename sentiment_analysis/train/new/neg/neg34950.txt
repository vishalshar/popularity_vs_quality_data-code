My fourth son was born with a cleft lip and palate. Since he couldn't breastfeed but seemed to have a high suck need, I decided to try a pacifier with him. Regular ones gagged him or fell out. But everyone suggested this one. Basically, it's a Soothie sewn to a stuffed animal, and the idea is the animal's weight helps hold it for baby or baby can hold the animal and hold the pacifier. Good idea, but it didn't work for him. The weight pulled it out of his mouth, and he did not like holding it. It's worth a try, but it's sure not the solution all the "experts" suggested it would be.
