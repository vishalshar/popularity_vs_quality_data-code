Bought this a few months ago before our second child was born, as a 2nd camera/mic to integrate with an existing Motorola monitor.  Unfortunately, the camera never worked properly.  Night vision is totally useless and daytime is so pixelated that it is virtually useless.  On the plus side, it did pair easily with our existing monitor and the audio works fine.  It is a real shame that we received a dud, because our original unit still works well.Motorola's AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE is what really earns this item the lowest rating possible.  It has been two months since we contacted them to get things fixed, we still don't have a working camera, and they've already charged us extra money to ship us a working camera -- that we haven't yet received.If you ever do buy a Motorola product and think to yourself maybe I'll be nice and listen to the flyer they insert in the box that says "STOP don't return to the store, call us instead" -- DON'T BE A SUCKER.  Ship it back to Amazon and let them fix things.  Motorola had us on hold for 40 minutes before talking with an agent, they charged us (in advance) for postage to get a working replacement device, and all this time later we have still not received it.  If Motorola won't step up to fix a lemon baby monitor, what can you trust them to do?
