Love the NUK products.  My son uses the blue elephant pattern at his daycare for breastmilk.  He's the only baby with this style bottle making it pretty obvious which is his without having to read the name on the bottle.  So now that he's getting older I wanted to send him to daycare with the same design learner cup.  Unfortunately I was sent a green geometric design instead.  Love these products, just bummed that the pattern was wrong as this is the biggest asset of this brand that sets it apart from the rest.
