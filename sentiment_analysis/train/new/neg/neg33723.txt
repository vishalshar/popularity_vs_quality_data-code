I have used Nuk toothbrushes that fit over the finger in the past but the bristles on those were always exposed. This particular tooth brush has bristles that are inside of 2 lines of rubber. I assume this is so the brush can be lined up along the gum line. However, this design poses a huge problem. For one, my son doesn't open his mouth wide enough for me to get the bristles centered just perfectly along his gum line. If it's not centered properly then the bristles don't make any contact with the gum or teeth. Also, the bristle and lines are in such direction that the finger HAS to be lined up in a straight line against the child's face, which means your finger and hand are in the child's face while trying to brush. I have like the design in the past where you can get your finger in the baby's mouth and move it around and the bristles are exposed and scrub. However, this design is terrible and I'm unable to use it.
