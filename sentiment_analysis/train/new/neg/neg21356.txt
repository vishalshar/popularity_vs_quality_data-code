I have a 2 year old and recently had triplets.  I have a Sophie left over from our 2 year old, but wanted to purchase 2 more for the triplets.  I thought this was a great, easy and economical way to order them.  However, when we received them, I noticed right away that one of them did not squeak.  The other once barely squeaked.  I was very perplexed by this since these are supposed to be very nice teethers and are pricey.  So I looked into it further.  I compared these 2 to the one I already had and noticed several differences:1) The squeaks were the most obvious difference.  The "real" sophie squeaks extremely well, you barely have to press it and it makes the squeak noise.  Even if you press on his neck, a nice squeak comes out.  With these 2, they barely squeak at all!2) There are serial numbers on the back of sophie's second leg. The "real" sophie has a very pronounced and PROTRUDING serial number.  These 2 have barely visible indented numbers.  Extrememly different than the real Sophie.3) The coloring is slightly different.  The real sophie has a brighter/darker pink color for its tongue and cheeks versus these 2 sophies.4) The "real" sophie's front leg is slightly more bent than these 2 sophies.It's hard to imagine that these are authentic sophies.  I believe they are counterfeit and will be returning them.  If they are counterfeit, I do not know where they were made and what they were made out of and I don't want my babies chewing on them!!!  I'm glad I had another sophie to compare it with, otherwise I would never have known, which is what I bet they are counting on with unsuspecting buyers.  PLEASE SEE MY VIDEO and PHOTOS WHICH CLEARLY SHOW THE DIFFERENCES.
