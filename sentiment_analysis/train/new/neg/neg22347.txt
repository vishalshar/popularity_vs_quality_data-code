I can tell by layers and layers of protective stickers on the packaging that this product had been returned several times. That should have been an indicator for me to do the same. Well, I tore it open anyway, with high hopes that this would be helpful in getting my daughter to rinse her hair. First of all, the product given to me is broken. When you clamp down on the front half, it pops 'off track'. You have to take it off after ever bath to get the remaining water out of it. It does not provide the waterfall effect I was given the impression it would. It makes the water drop one inch outward of where it normally falls. The bubble dispenser creates no different of an effect than putting the soap where the water falls. It only gives you one more thing to clean, and one more area where mold can be trapped. It does not make my daughter more receptive to rinsing her hair. Save your money!
