It was pretty easy to put together (however it did not fit through the doorway of standard room) so make sure you build it in the room you plan on keeping it in. Rookie mistake.  The overall quality is a bit shoddy not as sturdy as I would like...nothing fancy, but it's pretty cheap.  I am sure it will do.
