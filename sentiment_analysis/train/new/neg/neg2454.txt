This was by far the worst decision I've made by far. First of all, the suction on this machine at the highest point is not even what I would consider great suction. After using this breast pump for a week my suction was almost gone. I spent money for a product that didn't work for me at all. I should've invested my money in a pump like Medela but decided to go the cheap route and that's what I get for doing that. Please save your money and invest in something that's going to last for a while.
