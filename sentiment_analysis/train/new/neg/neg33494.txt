I returned this product due to an issue with the white clips for the stand in the middle not staying fastened tight enough. They would click/clip in, but with the slightest pressure on the white plastic drain screen, it would pop off and make the stand unstable. It seemed really inconvenient.Instead, I bought some stacking wire baskets from IKEA and will use those. Turns out for the graco bottles I am using, the openings wedge pretty nicely into the grid of the basket, and stand upright. It might not work for every bottle, but I think just standing them up or getting a pegboard would work better than this tipsy plastic thing I returned.
