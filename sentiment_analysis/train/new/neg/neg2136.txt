This is okay, but older children can definitely figure out very quickly how to pull it off. I bought it when my daughter was 18 months and she figured it out. I have it on her again now that she's two and a half and she wants to stop sucking her thumb and it works well at school but as soon as nap time comes around she'll take it off. So I say it's progress, but the plastic on it is so soft it has its pros and cons. The probing that she's able to move her hand easily and the con being that she's able to pull it off her thumb too!
