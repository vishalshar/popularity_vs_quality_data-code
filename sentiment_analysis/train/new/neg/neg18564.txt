its really easy to use and folds like a wonder but my daughter doesn't really find it comfortable. there is no sort of padding/cushion for the kid's back. its just a sheet of material. My daughter always wants to get out of it after 20min or so. She loves her other stroller which has more cushion and seems to prop her up much better.
