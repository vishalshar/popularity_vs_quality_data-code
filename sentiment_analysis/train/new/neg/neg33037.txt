When it was time for my baby to learn to drink from an open cup, I offered him several different types of cups. This one seemed interesting, but he never cared much for it. The handles are smaller than they ought to be for little, inexperienced fingers to grab, and the slant didn't seem to help him get the hang of drinking at all. I very much prefer the BabyBjorn cup, despite it's high price: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U6GOS8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_146
