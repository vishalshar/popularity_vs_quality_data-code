We purchased this set twice for our 2 year old son. The framework is metal, but the hinges are plastic. (whose bright idea was that?) Our son managed to break them just by leaning on them and he isn't a big kid.  Since the hinge is plastic, the hinge just snapped in two.  We've since bought  another brand (One Step Ahead) and that one broke (in the same way) within a week of delivery. We are still looking for the best rail, short of my husband building a wooden "cage" to go around the bed. I don't recommend purchasing this product unless you like to make frequent trips to BRU to return the rails and having to take apart the bed every time they break
