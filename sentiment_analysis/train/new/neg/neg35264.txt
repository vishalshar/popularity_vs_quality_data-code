I ordered this after very carefully reading reviews and searching in a ton of other places. I was impressed with the design and had to have it. Overall, its too much for too little. Three basic pieces for $100.00. But I really wanted it so I ordered it. They charged my card right away, then 3 days later cancelled my order, saying out of stock. The funds have not yet been returned.I looked further at other western themed set and found a burnt orange one with 13 pieces for the cost and went with that one. This seller is highly dissapointing. Its not like this was a small purchase, but they still charged the card without any items in stock to sell.
