I love the concept of this bag and based on other reviews I went ahead and ordered it.  I have a 17 month-old and we aren't carrying as much stuff with us anymore so I thought it would be perfect.  I gave the bag 3 stars because for its size it has a wonderful amount of storage space and it looks great!  Another reviewer mentioned something to the effect of how you didn't have to worry about smacking your toddler in the face with this diaper bag, which agreeably is a WONDERFUL feature as that is one of my peeves.  (Managing purse & diaper bag on shoulder while picking up baby.)  However, and maybe I was doing something wrong, but, everytime I bent over with this bag fully packed, the weight of it would swing it down under my right arm so it was still a problem trying to manage it and pick up my toddler.  And this was with the adjustment strap fully tightened.  I am 5'3", so maybe a taller user could get it tighter than I was able to.  Also, the bottle bag that comes with it is truly that,a BOTTLE bag.  It would not hold any of the sippy cups I have, and I have many different types from the cheap to not so cheap.  I ended up returning it, although I think this would be a nice bag for airline travel, just not an every day bag for us.  Hope this helps someone!  :o)
