I ordered this set for my infant son. I wanted several small toys I could pack in the diaper bag for on the go that didn't cost much so we wouldn't be heartbroken if they got left behind. This set fit the bill.The set I got is not exactly what is pictured. One of the ones I got that is not pictured was a little tambourine. My son was playing with it in the floor and pushed his weight (around 14 pounds at the time) on his hand on the toy on the floor and the flimsy plastic that held the metal clanky things in pushed in around the edge and his finger got stuck. I took that toy away.However all the others have held up great so far.The bank is a nice added extra.This is one of those things that you get what you pay for. This many toys for this price, it's a good deal. But you can't expect the best quality for this price.
