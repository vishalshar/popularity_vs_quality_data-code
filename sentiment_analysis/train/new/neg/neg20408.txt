So we got one of these blankets for a gift.  Turns out it's now my baby's "blankie" or whatever you want to call.  Problem is I have bought three different ones so we have back up and either I am buying the wrong one although they all have the same RA# OR the company has cut costs because the quality is no way never that of the original one we have.  Still great but she knows the difference.
