I don't care if they're GIVING them away. Don't buy this monitor. It should be recalled. The transmitter made so much feedback noise that it woke up our daughter. We tried unplugging the cordless phones in the house, turning off the other baby monitor, etc. to find out if that was causing the feedback. NOTHING worked. So I sent it back.
