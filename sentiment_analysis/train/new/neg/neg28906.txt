The refill bags are fine, but the description is misleading.  The retail package is a box containing two refills.  The "4pk" contains two retail boxes containing a total of 4 refills.  However, based on other Amazon items, the implication of a 4 pack is 4 retail boxes.  However, when compared with other sellers listings of a single retail box containing 2 refills, this 4 pack is priced accordingly.  The item description should be clarified to indicate that it is a total of 4 refills and not 4 boxes of 2 refills.
