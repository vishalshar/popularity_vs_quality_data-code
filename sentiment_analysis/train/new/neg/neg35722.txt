I bought this kind of protector because they weren't selling the Prince Lionheart seat protector (I have been using one of those). I think the mats are okay, but the issue I have is that they are not very tough on the bottom, so when you're putting a heavy carseat on top of one in a car with leather seats, this protector won't protect your leather seats from being stretched by the car seat. The Prince Lionheart seat protector is really thick and tough on the bottom, so the contours of the car seat won't dig into your actual seat. These Kiddopotamus protectors are much softer, so they don't offer a lot of protection from stretching, although I'm sure they do fine for stains and such. All in all this product is well-made, but I would recommend it for cars with cloth upholstery and not leather. If you want something for leather, try the Prince Lionheart ones.
