The image shown for ordering is not what arrives. I do understand that varying resolutions on monitors and such mean that items will not always appear exactly identical to the picture you see when you order. However, this is not one of those cases. I ordered 'Marble White', but what arrived looks a mix of white and taupe/brown marbling, and in all honesty the pattern I have in front of me is ugly. At first look, before I unrolled it, I was worried that maybe someone spilled iced tea on it, staining it- that's how ugly the pattern is. Note: The picture here is taken in natural light, no flash, no filter, no anything. I saw another reviewer had the same problem but I tend to read reviews with a grain of salt and try to look at the overall stars because sometimes yeah, people can get nit-picky. No way I am using this for what I initially purchased it for, will probably just use it as liners in bottom drawers or boxes or something.
