My pump arrived and is as described by the seller. I only give this product a bad review because the features definitely leave something to be desired.  The display screen sometimes blips out why the pump is still in operation. The settings on the pump go up to 70? But, there are only about six different options? It's somewhat misleading until you actually use the pump.It does the job. It connects to Aveda bottles without a special adapter. In any event, if you need to order extra parts such as adapters or flanges prepare for an extended delay as the accessories are only available through Spectra and their third-party agents. The spectra website was not properly updated which is altered and further delays. There is no option to select the flange size. So if you need a different size flange, it's an additional $30.
