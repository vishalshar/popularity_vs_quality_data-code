I ordered two of these to use in my little one's crib. I have alternated usage/washing of the two mattress pads as needed for the past six months. So, I've probably washed each mattress pad a half dozen times (at most). After the most recent washing, one of the two pads came out of the dryer in shreds. The plastic part that makes it waterproof was completely shredded. I had to toss it.Apart from that, the mattress pad fit well, seemed waterproof enough, and seemed sturdy until it wasn't. The other one of the two mattress pads is still intact.Where does that leave things? Well, I ordered a third one to replace the first one because I was happy enough with the product.
