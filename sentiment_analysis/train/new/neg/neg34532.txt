The bad:  Color.  This changing pad cover is advertised as and shows up in the pictures and a true, smoke gray but it's actually a light blue gray.The good: Texture and Size.  It fits a standard contoured changing pad and the polyester is very soft to the touch, like super soft stuffed animal fur (not sure what technical term for this texture is).Overall, if the color was true it would have been a good buy, but as it is I'm not sure it'll work for my nursery.
