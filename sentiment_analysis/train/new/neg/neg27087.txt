Im assumminng that the 2 pack refers to the pillow case that comes with the pillow. There was only one pillow in the bag and it wasnt a great one. The pillow loses shape as soon as you lay on it. something that you would imagine to find in a disount store and pay $10 for. I was very disappointed the quality. The only reason it wasnt returned was because it had gotten stained the first night from dye in my hair. I wouldnt suggest this pillow to a pregnant mouse..... Horrid not worth the money in shipping or the 40 bucks to buy it......
