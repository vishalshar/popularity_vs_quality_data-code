I ordered this because it seem "man-friendly" and also functional and stylish.  I was a bit disappointed when I received the item because the fabric seemed very low quality, although it did seem like it is water resistant and would clean easily.  The changing pad is not padded, and very thin, plus the inner bag for dirty or wet items seemed like it might not last more than a few months max.  I kept the bag for maybe 4 days without looking at it too closely (I am due in 10 days now,) but when I actually picked it up and looked closer at it, there was a few flaws.  The strap had a frayed/loose loop on the side, which, along with everything else, I could have gotten over because after all it is a $27 bag.  The thing I couldn't get over was that the strap was twisted and attached wrong during the manufacture of the item.  Because both sides are sewn into the bag, (no metal attachment that would spin) so there was no way I could keep it.  I would have been bothered to no end about the twisted strap, so I returned it and ordered the bag I really wanted (Skip Hop Versa) instead of a "affordable" bag.
