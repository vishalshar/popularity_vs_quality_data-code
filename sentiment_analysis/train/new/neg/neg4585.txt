This is a great invention, but without some kind of apron ties in the back, it just becomes a towel bunched up in my lap. I will have to add some kind of belt to it to keep it closer to my body while I'm bathing my baby. It's just super loose, big, and flops around. Not what I imagined but I will keep it and sew a belt on it (a velcro one or something).
