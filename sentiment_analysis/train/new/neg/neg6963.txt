I do not like this chair, I think it is unsafe in areas and I sent Fisher Price a complaint about it but they never got back to me. I wish I had taken note of the other peoples complaints about the bar but I guess its not until you use something that you really see its faults. I have a (now) 4.5 month old and a 22 month old. My infant when he had no real hand control cut he's hands on the exposed bolts that are at arms length right beside them when they are sitting there, they are hard and sore for them to hit their hands off. And my 22 month old hits her head on the metal bar at the top all the time. This only has a piece of material over it not any padding! Its a very bad design but they do have much better ones without these problems which I wish I had bought I just liked the look of this one at the time.
