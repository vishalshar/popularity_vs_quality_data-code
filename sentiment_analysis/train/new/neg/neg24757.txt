I bought these covers for my sons room.  Once we transitioned him to a toddler bed I wanted to make sure he was not able to get to the outlet, yet i wanted to be able to still plug things in.  It works great on regular sized plugs. However most baby monitors have larger plugs and this does not fit over the monitor plug.  That is what I mainly bought this item for and I can not use it for that.  I really wish they would make a larger one that would work for the baby monitor.  I had to rearrange the room so that the monitor was plugged in behind the dresser so he could not reach it.  My monitor is no longer in the prime location I would like it to be.  I have a motorola baby monitor and those are very popular, its not as if I have an uncommon one.
