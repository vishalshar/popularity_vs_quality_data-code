NOTHING soft about these!!!! These are made out of HARD plastic. The only reason that I kept them instead of returning them is because they look clean, better than the ones with the springs. Just know that if you have a hollow wooden door and someone slams it open, there is a chance that this door stop will go right through the wooden door..
