So i ordered this item as a back up for the other ones i have ( for when they are washed :) ).  I received it today and the quality is no wheres near the other 2 exact items are.  The stitching is different  the underneath is not even stitched to where my baby could suck in the satin material and choke !!!!!!  Tried to post a pic to show the difference but it is not letting me :(
