I really wanted to like this and did at first. It's absolutely adorable and super soft, but after only two washes, the elastic broke around almost the entire edge! I still gave it two stars as it's still usable (I can just drape it over the changing pad), but definitely disappointed in the quality and how quickly it broke.
