Not happy with what I got. It doesn't look like the picture at all. The one pictured looks way more comfortable then the one we got. The backing on ours is completely different along with the sides of the chair (ours do not have the pockets) and our main sitting cushion is a lot thinner. If I could upload a picture of what we got I would so you could see the difference.
