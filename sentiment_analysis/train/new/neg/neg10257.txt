This toy car does not meet it's potential.  Given the design and the name "Pop 'n Push Car," I thought it would be like the popper toy and the little balls inside would pop when the car was pushed (I know, crazy assumption, right), but the balls don't "pop" at all really, and definitely don't make an audible "pop" sound (and isn't that sort of essential to something popping?, hence the word's status as onomatopoeia).  There is a device inside the car that is supposed to make the balls pop, but it's totally useless - the balls don't move any more than they would with just the motion of the car when it's moving.  To me, it was a big letdown, but to my infant, she is probably none-the-wiser.  As a toy car goes, it's pretty good.  I like the pull-back-to-wind function - it actually gives it a decent amount of force and will sometimes bounce off the wall and keep going in another direction because it hasn't run itself out yet.  It also gives it enough force to work ok on low-pile carpets if you give it a little push to get it started, and it has enough force to roll over some obstructions, which is cool.
