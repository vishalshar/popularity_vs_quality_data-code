I just purchased this recently for our first baby to use as a reusable diaper bag, as it was recommended to me by a friend. Before washing it I thoroughly searched this page and the wash instructions on the tag to make sure I wouldn't damage it, as I remembered reading a comment about not using baking soda on it and my detergent has baking soda. There was nothing on the tag that said it would affect anything, just "Machine wash warm, tumble dry low or hang to dry. No bleach or softeners.". However, after washing it and finding the outside of the bag basically stripped, I wrote to the company asking how you're supposed to wash it. They responded with "To ensure longevity with our products, they should be washed on a Warm/Cold Temperature setting. The detergents we suggest are Tide Original, Country Save and Arm & Hammer Sensitive Skin. Using vinegar, baking soda, oxygen cleaners, harsh chemicals, and oils will shorten the life of your product and destroy the PUL. Damage caused from using brighteners/additives is not covered in our Warranty." Too bad that's not included on the Amazon page or on the product itself.
