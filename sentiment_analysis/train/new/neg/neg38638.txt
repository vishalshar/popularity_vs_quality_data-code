I like this travelbag. I really do. It looks good, it's easy to use and it's great quality. I've only used it on one International Flight from Seattle, WA to Tokyo, Japan to Manila, Philippines. My Vista made it safely. My complaint is that it was a major pain to pack. You have to take apart the stroller to actually make it fit and it was easier to watch a YouTube video on how to do it, then to follow the instructions. Once it's in there, the stroller is safe and packed. You won't have to worry about anything shifting inside. Overall, it does the job, but it would be great if UppaBaby would create a bag that could just have both pieces placed in as is. It's hard already when you have a baby in tow with you and traveling.The price point is good though in comparison to other official stroller bags that I have seen for other top of the line brands.
