I have the Safari TT Dbl jogger from In Step and  I bought this shade because the shade on the stroller is non-existent.I have seen this product work well on single strollers, but it keeps blowing up and back from my canopy with the slighest of breezes, so it is not doing such a great job of keeping the sun off my kid's faces.I've used a binder clip to keep it in place, but it still blows back more than I think it should...
