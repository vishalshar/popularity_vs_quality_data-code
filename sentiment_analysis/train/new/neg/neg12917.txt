Purchased for a 5 year old son with nocturnal enuresis issues.  We were/are at the ends of our ropes, as he soaks through even the highest capacity nighttime diaper we could purchase.  We literally have a fitted sheet, two waterproof mattress pads and three extra waterproof pee pads and he still manages to wet all but one or two of them each night.  We thought we would try this approach.  The first few nights with just the pants, he soaked completely through them.  The next week we tried to put the diaper on underneath the Super Undies.  While that minimized the problem, he still soaked through two to three of the waterproof bed layers.  The higher capacity "betwetting pants" model worked a bit better (see additional review).  Even though the Undies didn't work for our son, we still gave three stars as it is more likely we have an unusual situation rather than a product that didn't function as described or intended.
