This set does what it's supposed to do, but I wouldn't buy it again.It's SO big and heavy! The stroller took up ALL the room in my trunk, then I had to wrestle it out and set it up. Plus, it doesn't fold down flat and stay that way. When I was little, my siblings' stroller would clip shut so you could easily carry it, but this stroller pops back to a partially open position.The car seat itself is also heavy, but I guess there isn't anyway around that. It fit fine in the back of my scion xb, but when that broke down we had to put it in the ford fiesta. Omg, no. This car seat isn't made for a compact car.The car seat straps also dig into my daughter's neck, and the car seat doesn't like to click in completely- you really need to check it to make sure it's clicked in.If I could redo it, I'd just get a metal stroller frame for the carseat and a lightweight umbrella stroller later.
