I purchased this stroller organizer primarily to use as a cup holder, as my stroller has a very shallow cup holder that doesn't actually adequately hold any beverage.  It appears to be made well, and fastened easily to my stroller using the velcro straps on each side.  In terms of the cup holders, however, there is room for improvement.  Each end of the product contains a slot with room for a beverage.  The slots for the cups are very small, however, and do not fit a regular Starbucks sized coffee cup well.  I had to shove the cup into the slot, as it is a bit too small for a standard sized cup.  I also tried using it to hold a travel coffee mug I took from home, and that was a little too large for the slot as well.  The only beverage that fits well in the beverage slots are a small bottle of spring water, or a small sized energy drink like Red Bull.  I mostly wanted a cup holder to hold a Starbucks coffee cup, as I'm never able to get a coffee while I am pushing the stroller right now since there is no way to hold it without it spilling all over.  So I'm still on the hunt for a quality cup holder that is large enough for a coffee cup.The middle area of the stroller organizer works well to hold my cel phone, keys, and other small items, however.  Overall, its not a perfect product, but it is mostly adequate, and it was a very affordable price.
