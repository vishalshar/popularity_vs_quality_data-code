I ordered this seat so my daughter would have something fun to sit in while I did my hair in the bathroom - I am not fond of this chair.First of all, it has a distinctly cheap feel to it as you assemble it; it's not an expensive item so take that for what it's worth.Secondly, the seat straps are ridiculously located so it is very challenging to get them secured around your wiggling child.Lastly, although the circular tray does move, it takes a fair amount of force and it is not remotely smooth in operation.I ended up ordering the following seat by the same brand but a significantly better design that will work in multiple situations:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JVXZF2/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
