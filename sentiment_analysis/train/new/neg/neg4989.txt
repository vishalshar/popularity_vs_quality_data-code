Way to expensive for a piece of plastic with a magnet inside, WAY TO EXPENSIVE. Also the set with 8 locks comes only with one key so I had to buy a second one. Who would sell a product with only one key? People who's benefit is priority number 1. Adding a second key for a most likely $.5 production cost in China, won't hurt their pocket. Sorry Safety 1, this is a very bad call.
