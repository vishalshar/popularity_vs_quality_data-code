The only thing I love about this car seat is that it is very easy to put in and out of the car.  There is a pully in front of the seat as shown on the picture which makes it easy to release the latch but for the overall price for what you get I would not purchase this seat again.  My daughter (4 yrs old) wanted this seat because of the monkey and she loves it.
