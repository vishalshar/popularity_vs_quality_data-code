Works, but using lanolin is not the best lubrication method. Coconut oil (extra virgin) was the best I have found. Using the lanolin, I found that the pieces would have extreme condensation buildup and they fell off before the night was over. I got these to aid in my success in breast feeding. I was 25 weeks pregnant when purchased. Before purchasing, I did the "pinch test" and that was how I determined my need for something like this. However, when using it, my nipples pulled all the way into the chamber without any problem at all. My issue is flat nipples but I guess I'm elastic enough to not actually need this. I will wear when I deliver though just to make the first latch on easier for the baby. I give a three star due to the inability to stay on all through the night, condensation buildup and simply because I have a neutral opinion about it.
