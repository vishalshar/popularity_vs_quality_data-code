This seemed like a high quality carrier but it did not work for me at all. I was warned about it being for the small framed woman but I interpreted that to mean thin. No. It meant short.I'm only 5'6" so fairly average but I have a longer torso. After adjusting the straps to fit, the release buckles ended up in the back of my arm pits where it was both uncomfortable and I couldn't reach them to get the carrier off without help or taking my arms out of the straps entirely which was also a challenge.I ended up really loving the Mei Tai sash for my baby wearing needs. It was about a fifth of the price and much more comfortable. High fives for cheaper and better.If you're short, I say knock yourself out.  If you're not, look elsewhere lest you find yourself in a t-rex arm style wrestling match for your freedom.
