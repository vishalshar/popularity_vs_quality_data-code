waste of money. We used to have one, it died. Bt since we had 4 filters left, we decided to try it again. It really is only a white noise machine, as no mist/cool air comes out. The water level stayed teh same for days. We gave up & bought one of the frog shaped ones you can get ahywhere & it works great. Do not buy this as it is a waste of money.
