I had thought this little nap pad would make a nice addition to have on hand for little ones needing a nap. Sadly, the product is better in concept than in implementation.It is narrow and long, so if your toddler tosses and turns, this may not be the right choice, but it will handle a taller toddler with no problem.The Good:The blow up portion slides in and out easily making this washable.It has a nice wide fleece covering, that will go over your toddler when he/she is laying on it.Colors are nice.Once it is blown up, it makes a nice pad.The head portion seems very nice to lay your head down.The Bad:After 10 minutes of pumping on the pump, it only had the tiniest amount of air. (To those who are wondering YES I had the emptying part closed. Yes I wore shoes. Yes I pumped and pumped and pumped).I finally gave up and opened the back and blew it up myself. It only took about 4-5 large breaths. It is possible the pump was defective, but I a unable to tell since it is completely enclosed within the mattress.So yes to the product, no to the pump. Since the key factor here seems to involve being able to pump it up in 40 seconds with your foot, I probably would look around to find something that met my needs, unless you aren't adverse to blowing it up yourself.
