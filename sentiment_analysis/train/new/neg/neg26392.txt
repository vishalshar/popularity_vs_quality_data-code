My family had borrowed this mobile for the crib when our older daughter was a baby and we loved it.  The classical music selections and ocean waves soothed her and she was entranced by the spinning and rocking "friends".  She also learned to kick the button to make it play on her own, which was really impressive!  We had returned it to its owner by the time our younger child was born, so I bought one in January.  It was broken in the same way many Amazon reviewers commented.  The swaying motion did not work, and the OFF button did not work.  We returned it, but I knew this was just an issue of horrible quality control, so I ordered another one, and this one does work.  (I just wanted a mobile I knew; I didn't want to look at lots of other models.) I have very little faith it will last long enough to give away to other children after our daughter has outgrown it, because I gather these are not made well.  However, it is an alright price for one child's use.  It really is quite soothing.
