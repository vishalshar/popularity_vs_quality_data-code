Particularly since this is advertised as a baby blanket, and as a retired pediatric nurse, I had to give it only 1 star - in fact I'd have given it a negative star if possible.The white "feathery" material in the blanket sheds easily and to the extent that it could be dangerous, especially for small infants, if inhaled into the respiratory tract or even swallowed.  Please stop advertising this as a baby blanket.  If it were advertised as, say, a lap blanket, I might have given it 3-4 stars because it is attractive enough to leave on the arm of my recliner.  It is warm enough to give those old knees a little comfort and the satin is cool and comforting.  But, again, while the shedding isn't great, it is an annoyance.
