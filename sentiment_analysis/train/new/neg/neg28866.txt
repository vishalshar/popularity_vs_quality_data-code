I loved this product at first.  HOWEVER, after a week of use, my 1 year old son pulled the oven and this device broke and the oven door came right open.  Luckily, the oven was not on and I was right there to grab my son.  But, this oven lock is now in two pieces.  The swivel plastic piece broke off.  It is not fixable and obviously not a reliable product.  This item should be recalled!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is very dangerous.
