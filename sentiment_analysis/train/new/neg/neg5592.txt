I wanted a lacing project for my 2 grandchildren 18 months and 21 months old at the time and thought this looked quite nice. My grandchildren did enjoy lacing them but got frustrated because I had to help.  Actually I really had to put the lace through the hole.  The beads are very wide making it very hard for them to get the point of the lace through the hole opening and getting it to come out on the other side.  They are now 21 months and 24 months old and I still have to help them.  Sometimes even I had trouble.  I had purchased another lacing project called beads and baubles which is great.  They are very thin colorful pieces in different shapes that is much easier for young children to lace them.  My granchildren had no problem with them and they enjoy it.
