Initially I thought we would love this little device. My eleven month old loved splashing her hands in the waterfall and I could more easily rinse her hair. However, after four uses the springs inside detached from the plastic form. I've put it back together several times, but it simply won't stay put. Needless to say, we're very disappointed in the construction.
