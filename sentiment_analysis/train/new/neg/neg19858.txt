The bottom and back of the pad are the same size;  you get two squares, essentially, not the rectangular back in the listing's image.  The end result is that the bottom is covered, but the seat back is only covered on the bottom half.  The upper half remains unprotected.  They are inexpensive, though.  I've just received them, so I can't comment on anything other than fit.  I've ended up laying a towel over the seat's back to protect the part these covers don't reach.
