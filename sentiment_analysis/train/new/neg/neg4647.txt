I have several non-sleeve versions of this bib, which I really like. They are very easy to clean and go through the wash machine with no problem. The price was also attractive.  Unfortunately, the version with sleeves features very skinny sleeves. The sleeves are long - which would normally be great - but since they are skinny they are very difficult to roll up. It works ok, but I don't see this being something we can use for an extended period of time.
