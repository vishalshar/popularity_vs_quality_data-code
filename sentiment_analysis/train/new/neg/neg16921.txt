Broken Zipper upon ArrivalI was truly hoping that JJ Cole had fixed this issue as it seemed to be a major problem when the product was first released.  However, it turns out that there is no quality control regarding this product.  These defaults are major flaws, not the small flaws that could easily go unnoticed, such as in inside zipper, or inside seam.  The zipper just would not unzip all the way.  When I finally did get it to unzip, I noticed that the stitching was also coming loose and the zipper wasn’t aligned properly when sewn together.  Just poor product quality all the way around.  Plus the changing pad, as nice as it seems, is actually quite heavy compared to some other changing pads that come with other diaper bags that I’ve owned in the past.  Imagine carrying that in the diaper bag along with everything else you want to shove in it…heavy, heavy, and heavier.  The hardware doesn’t seem well made either.  I will be returning this bag.  Too bad that I didn’t heed the advice of my fellow Amazon users when they said “don’t buy this bag”.  It’s just really sad that they would even bother to ship a faulty/broken product in the first place.  Amazon should stop selling this bag until the manufacturer fixes these problems.
