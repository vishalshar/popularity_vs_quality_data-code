In the description on the product at the web, doesn't say anything about having to pay $24.99 to connect to the camera through 3G; besides the problems other people talk in the reviews, you can't see your baby playing while you're working for more than 30 minutes a day if you didn't upgrade your account.This product is totally oversold.
