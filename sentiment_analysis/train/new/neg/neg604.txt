I only needed the gate for blocking a room off for a pet.  As another review says the screws seemed to not be correct..  However for me the head of the screw coming out is hidden well with the way my all is.  Also it is loud to latch as it makes a ratchet sound when coming out and I dont like how your have to press the piece down on top of the net holder each time you want to move the net in and out. ( I understand this is a safety feature for kids, just annoying for me since this gate is not for a kid)Other wise this does exactly what it says it will do.  Its firm but not too firm.  It Hides well for when company comes over and it keeps our pet in the room.I would recommend for pets and such.  but a toddler would figure this out pretty quick.
