Serves it's purpose for things like sandwiches, however, the material makes pretzels, crackers, chips, etc go stale by lunchtime, and if you put anything with moisture in it (like washed grapes), expect to see mold growing on the zipper by the time you get home.  Same will happen if you don't dry it immediately after washing.
