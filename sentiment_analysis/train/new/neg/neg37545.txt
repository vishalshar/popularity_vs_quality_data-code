I am extremely Dissappointed with this sea turtle wubbanub... I don't know if I got a bad one or what, but mine does not have any beans inside as described. That is the whole point, for it to have some weight to it, but the one I recieved has no weight at all... No beans inside and is quite a bit smaller then I thought it would be. for 15$ I thought I would get the amazing thing everyone raves about but instead I got a small cheap Stuffed toy like the kind that come out of the crane machines. Total waste of money.
