I hesitated buying strap covers because I read that they can make it difficult to get a snug fit with the car seat, but the straps were really digging into my son's neck so I bought them. They are super soft and solve that problem (I also love that they are reversible and easy to use), but I do find it tough to get his car seat straps as snug as before. I'm still using them for now, but I think I'm going to look for some that are thinner.
