What a waste of my hard earned cash.  These are too thick to fit into my 2 year olds underpants and they don't contain the leak from a nap time accident.  And of course once you open the inner packaging you can't return them.  You would be better off just purchasing regular maxi pads which would be a whole lot cheaper.  I wish now I had paid attention to the negative views and not gotten them because they were recomended by the "potty training experts"
