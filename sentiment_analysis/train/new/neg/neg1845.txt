I love this pillow but hate the cover.I got this pillow after attending a breast feeding support group and seeing how much this helped in comfortable latching and feeding (I was previously using a boppy) but the one I used at the support group had the original model buckle and pull tight strap. I didn't realize that when I ordered the deluxe model it came with a Velcro system. It's horrible as all of my baby's receiving blankets get stuck to it while feeding and ruined as well as anything I have to wash with it. The Velcro is definately NOT an improvement.
