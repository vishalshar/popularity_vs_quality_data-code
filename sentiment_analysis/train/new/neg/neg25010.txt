Save your money and go to a store where you can buy a quality product. This product is poorly made and most pieces of the "set" are so paper thin you would never use them. We washed them first and the sheet ripped in half. The seller will not exchange because it was washed and Amazon was no help. Highly dissapointed since my daughter is a first time mom and was really looking forward to this product.
