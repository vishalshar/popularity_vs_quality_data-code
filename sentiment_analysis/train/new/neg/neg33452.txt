I ordered this product because it was one of Amazon's daily deals without doing any research on the product.I have the Britax Advocate 70 with Side Impact Protection. This shade fits well to it.  Since I installed the car seat in the right side in the backseat (front-facing), my daughter's right arm and face are always exposed to sunlight. I hoped the Rayshade would provide enough shade to cover up her entire face at least. Although it provides some shade to my daughter seated in the carseat, the top and sides are not long enough to fully cover sunlight coming from the front and side of the car. In my opinion, it provides 30% or a bit more shade than without it. I guess it is better than nothing, but bear in mind that it will not fully cover the sun shining on a child.Another problem is that when the window is open, the wind blows rights in the Rayshade. Since it has the shape of a parachute, it won't stay still if you keep your windows open and wind blows into the car. So far, the wind has "not" knocked off the shade yet, but you will have to re-adjust it after driving with windows open.Overall, it is an okay product.
