I have this set and although it's easy to use with my Medela pumps (electric and manual), I rarely use it unless all my bottles are full, because you can't see the top of the bag to know when to safely stop pumping without overfilling. Thus I can't pump as much in one session as I do with storage bottles, unless I stop and change out the bag. You end up only filling each one 2/3-3/4 full and use up more bags this way. I do love the drop-ins system and that's what I use to feed baby when I'm away from her, but I pump into bottles, not into this set.
