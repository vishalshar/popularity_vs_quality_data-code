For the price and the fact it fits the Britax B ready stroller with such ease I am somewhat happy with it. BUT, the straps are not easy to adjust, I think the Peg Perego is better but for the amount of time this will fit infant size I am willing to work with the hard to adjust straps. I will get a better product for the next full size car seat. With the infant insert and the infant snuzzler there isnt much room for baby so removed the Britax insert for more room.  Otherwise it installs easily clips in car seat and is safe and sturdy.
