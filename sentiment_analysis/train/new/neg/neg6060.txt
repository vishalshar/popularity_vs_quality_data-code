I had this delivered to our hotel in Chicago so that my husband and I didn't have to struggle with a stroller on the public transport from the airport to the hotel. Assembly was easy and did not require any tools. It works,at least for the 7 days we were using it, but was pretty difficult to steer. It kept going of to one side when we were not paying attention. Like what other reviews mentioned, this is ok for shorter people ( Im 4'11") and ok in a pinch for taller people. My 5'10" husband found it to be more awkward than I did but it was not impossible for him to push it. We did not like this stroller enough to bring it home with us and left it with the hotel for other parents.I recommend this as a "disposable stroller" but not for regular usage.
