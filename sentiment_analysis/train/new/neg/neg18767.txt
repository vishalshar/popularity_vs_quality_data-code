I bought this product despite the bad reviews I had seen about it not sticking well to some people's walls. I figured the "bad reviewers" just didn't have flat clean walls like the vendor recommends. But I was proven wrong when the tree was falling down around me almost as fast as I was putting it up. This tree (and I imagine everything else this vendor sells) is made of cheap vinyl and adhesive. You will never know anything more annoying than taking 2+ hrs to put this thing up and to walk in 2 hrs later and see all the little branches and leaves curled up in a ball on the floor.I made a second attempt at putting this tree up, which meant untangling the mess of branch pieces and leaves. But this time I had used a hair dryer and a flat piece of plastic to press it to the wall and was certain that would hold... wrong again. There was no way this tree was staying up.At this point I had contacted the vendor who was about zero help. I explained how their product did  not work at all and I would like a full refund. They wrote back that they've tested the product and it worked just fine and that I was doing it wrong and gave me some helpful hints to get it to stick. The tips included using a hair dryer (which I already had done) or use Scotch Tape!!! Why the hell would you recommend Scotch Tape for something that has it's own adhesive?! So they said would not give me a refund because "all refunds and returns must be in their original state and packaging  they were sent in". How the heck are you supposed to know if the product is defective if you don't open it and stick it to your wall first!!!After a few back and forths they finally broke a little and gave me a 75% refund. I did end up using double sided tape to finally get this thing to stick but will never make the mistake of buying anything from them again. And on a side note, this tree is not nearly as big as it looks online. It is maybe 60"x72" a total scam all around
