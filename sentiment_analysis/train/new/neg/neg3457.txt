I bought this stroller against reviews warning about the difficulty in handling this stroller. I had to buy something similar to this for my two girls, but I made the wrong choice.I should have gone with my first choice, Kolcraft Contours Tandem II Stroller. It has great reviews, and I love the flexibility on the seats.This stroller isn't the worst in the world, but it's definitely not the best. Also, the storage under the seats is hard to get to and not big enough for an average sized diaper bag. I have to use a mommy hook to hang the diaper bag off the handle, which doesn't help with awkward steering.Consider how frequently you will use this stroller, and how convienent you'd like it to be before purchasing this.
