This is a cute Minnie valance set if you are looking to add on to a Minnie's room decoration. However, the fabric is thin and there are no ruffles or layers or anything special. I guess the price is low , so the quality is to be expected. Also, after adding this valance set with the comforter set, the room looks too busy- too much Minnie for my taste. I think I may replace them with solid color valances, but for now, my toddler loves her Minnie room and we'll keep them for a while.
