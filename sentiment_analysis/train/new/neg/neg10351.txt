I purposely picked this diaper bag for the insulated side pocket to store my son's water bottle for easy access. The very first time I put the bottle in and went to zip the pocket, the zipper separated. I was able to finagle it to work once, but the next time it separated again and would never zip up after that. I got rid of my old diaper bag and am returning this one, and am now without anything. Very displeased.
