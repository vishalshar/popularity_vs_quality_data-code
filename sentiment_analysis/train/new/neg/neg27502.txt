It looks really nice. I have plastered walls in a 100 year old house that has been painted many times over. It stuck well, but was still able to be repositioned as needed. I didn't use the transfer paper. I cut out all of the pieces on the paper and taped it to the wall to get positioning correct and then just pulled them off the paper and put them on the wall. It worked fine, but I would use the transfer paper to at least get the words on straight. I have it going up my staircase.The picture boxes are meant to hold 3x5's and 5x7's, but they aren't quite the right sizes. That is why I took a star off. Mine came with a total of 9 frames. The small ones are 3.5 x 4.5; the large ones are 5.25 x 7. So, you can't really use pics you had made, since they come in standard sizes. You have to scan and/or print them in specific sizes or buy frames somewhere else. I found them for $1 at the Dollar Tree. And like someone else said, they aren't hard frames. They are decals. I suppose if you were careful, you could cut them to fit correctly.Lastly, the picture reference provided in the pack isn't identical to what is provided. The major pieces are all correct, just the leaves and birds are slightly different. It doesn't affect the product at all, I just thought I would mention it in case someone is super OCD.Overall, I think it is a great buy and a unique way to display some family pictures. Iwould buy again.UPDATE: I took a star off of this item because I realizes that the words have incredibly poor grammar. The words I received were "Like branches on a tree we all grow in different DIRECTION (not plural) yet our roots remain as one."The picture is hard to see, but it looks like that writing has the word DIRECTIONS (plural).At any rate, since I don't have a way to make an extra s, I took the words (except Family) down. I can't have that kind of poorly translated English on my wall.
