I should start by saying it is a nice design and would work well with the older style Graco Car seat. But, when I tried to use it on my brand new Graco Snug Ride 35 with Click connect it was a "NO GO" not even close. SO I called BOB directly and found out that this adapter is for the classic style Graco Car Seat. They do not have a current adapter to fit the NEW Graco Click Connect Seats any of them. They told me it could be weeks before they have a new tested design, but to call back this coming Friday May 24,2013. Check you seat before you buy. If its a Click Connect don't bother. You will have to wait...
