Very annoying to put the stroller in, takes more than a few minutes at the gate, then you are 'that dad' holding up the jet bridge while everyone waits while you are fumbling to gate check the stroller and keep it clean in a rainy/snowy environment. Also, not very durable. After just a few flights it has started to tear.
