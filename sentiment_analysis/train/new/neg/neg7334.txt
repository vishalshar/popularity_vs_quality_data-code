Basically. . .okay.  The rods are heavy/sturdy.  It's not that hard to put together (I don't understand some complaining it is difficult!).  When the opening is not all that wide, the netting sags.  I don't think it will hold back a child or dog (effectively at least), but it does make an excellent barrier.  If you are present and monitor the child/pet, then it should not be a problem.  However, do not leave the child/pet unattended behind this 'gate' since it can be compromised (unless the tension on the horizontal rods is VERY high).  The tension on the horizontal bars that holds the gate in place can be made strong, but it must be against a firm/solid item/door frame (it won't work against the flimsy wood side of a cabinet, for instance, or any structure that will deform under stress).It is not a gate that is easy to remove and replace, if you intend to pass through frequently.  The reason is that the rod tension is pretty strong.  But, if you keep the top bar tension low (which makes the gate even more easy to compromise) the top of the gate can be lowered and is fairly easy to remove, step over the bottom horizontal bar, pass through, and replace.
