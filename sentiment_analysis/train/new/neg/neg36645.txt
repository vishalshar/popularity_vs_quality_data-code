I work downtown Manhattan and was seriously searching for an umbrella that would stand up to the rain and strong winds that occur there.  I had so many broken umbrellas because (I thought) I only spent $2 on my umbrella(s) when purchased from street vendors.  I finally decided to buy a good and expensive umbrella that would finally be an umbrella I could rely on.  This umbrella broke after two uses, and it wasn't even that windy.  I hate throwing money out of the window.  Don't even think this umbrella is better than the junkie ones sold on the street corner.
