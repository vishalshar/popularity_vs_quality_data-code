i believe the people at leach have made it their mission to force pregnant women to excersize, at least as often as we change our sheets. After fighting with it for almost a half hour, my husband came in to help and we finally got it on. Unfortunately it ripped, and somehow the stuffing of the pillow itself is now all messed up and misshapen. This is so poorly designed!!!
