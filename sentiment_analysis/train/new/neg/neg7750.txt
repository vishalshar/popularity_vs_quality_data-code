These are huge! When compared to the large inserts that came with my FuzziBunz elite diapers, these diapers dwarf the elite inserts. They are also missing the FuzziBunz label, which makes me question their validity. They will not work in my FuzziBunz diapers, and so far I haven't seen a diaper big enough to hold these inserts.
