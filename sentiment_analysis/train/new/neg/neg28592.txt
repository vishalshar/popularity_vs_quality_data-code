I purchased this car seat for my 11 month old when she got way to heavy to lift the infant seat. I have a Dodge minivan, and this seat was too big to put rear facing behind the driver's seat. It's huge! I have to say though, I have not had any problems getting this seat in very tight - there is no shifting at all. I think it's very easy to install.I had to disassemble the seat a few times due to car sickness - it's not a piece of cake, but it's not rocket science either. I am kind of a pro when it comes to washing car seats as my two older children were VERY prone to car sickness. The bottom plastic part of the seat catches a lot of nasty stuff (food, dust, milk) - it's gross and almost impossible to clean out unless you disassemble the whole seat.The seat doesn't have enough cushion in the back though - my daughter constantly compains that her back hurts when we go on trips longer than 15-20 minutes; she has visable red marks/pressure points on her back. I know that car seats are for safety and not necessarily for comfort, but can't we meet in the middle somewhere.
