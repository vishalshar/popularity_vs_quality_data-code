While I adore the designs & colors of this brand of bottles, their quality is very poor. The caps/nipples are flimsy at best, and completely collapse in my child's mouth as she eats. They're not compatible with any other bottles, that I have found (I also use Gerber & Evenflo), due to MAJOR leakage. Nor are the bottles compatible with other cap/nipples, which is fine for me to keep track of, but basically gives my husband a nervous breakdown. Worse yet, I found early on that 2/6 of these nipples were double-punctured/torn (likely a manufacturing error), rendering those nipples useless. I found this out the hard way, of course, after squirting warm milk all over my child's face, my entire outfit, and the chair I was sitting in, within a matter of seconds. I recommend Evenflo bottles instead; you get what you pay for.
