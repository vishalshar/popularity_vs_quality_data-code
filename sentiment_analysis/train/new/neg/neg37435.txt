This chair is cheaply made. The back on ours broke. I removed fabric to see if I could fix the interior framing and found that the framing was two 3/4 inch plywood strips that were sure to break and they did. The cushions and arm paddings flattened out very soon after a year of medium usage. I expected a much higher quality of product for the price I paid.
