I have graco and this. The reason why i got this is because of how easily u can use the changer and put away easily as well (unlike the graco one). But the bassinet or top portion is just bad. First its not fit right. There are a lot of creases that u would think this shouldnt pass the quality control. The mattress is uneven and bent. Its overall ugly. The bassinet also is too soft--- not good for avoiding SIDS which should be firm. Next, all sides on the bassinet are not mesh, which is more of suffocation hazzard. Unlike graco, only the foot and head part are not mesh. So i made this one as my daughters bed during the day so i can monitor her more. I will not have her use this at night especially during peak SIDS of 2-4months of age.
