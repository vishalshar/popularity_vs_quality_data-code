I have to say upfront that I have and always will by Britax car seats for as long as my grandsons are required to be in one.  That said, when I purchased the Britax Parkway SG Booster Seat, I did not pay attention to all the details of this car seat when I ordered it.  Upon receipt and then installation of the seat into my car, I noticed it did not come with the "latch" system that the other Britax car seats do.  I went ahead and had my 6 year old grandson try the car seat out and was disappointed that without the latch system, it was so loose, even with the car seat belt fastened as tight as it would allow, he could move the car seat around and actually get out of it with little effort.  So, I returned the Parkway SG and purchased the Parkway SGL.  I felt, for me and for the safety of my grandsons, that the Britax Parkway "SGL" better suited my needs and peace of mind.
