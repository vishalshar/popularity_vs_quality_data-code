I really wanted to love this diaper pail liner.  I splurged and got myself a new diaper pail liner with my third baby.  My other liners were 6 years old and from my first baby.  The material is soft and very waterproof.  However, after using this liner for about one month the seam sealing tape completed came apart, peeled entirely off all the seams.  Once again, I used it for about a month and alternated it with another pail liner that is still going strong after 6 years and two kids worth cloth diapers, and the seam tape ripped entirely off.
