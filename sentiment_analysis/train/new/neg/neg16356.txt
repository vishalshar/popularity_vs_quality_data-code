I was reluctant to buy this because it seemed flimsy and overpriced, but the concept was good.  My 2 year old son loved it immediately, but within a few days, the back part of the cushion became detached from the arms and it never folded easily or correctly again.  However, we really did get good use out of it for naps etc.  He finally figured out that the cushions could be taken out and that was pretty much the end of it.
