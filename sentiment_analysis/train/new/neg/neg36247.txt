This little tool is pretty handy for on-the-go stains. I used it a couple of times for oil stains on my work clothes - silk, cotton, wool, polyester.Pros: removes the stain, not a strong scent, doesn't leave any residual trace of productCons: don't like scrub top - it would be nice if the brush head was finer (kept getting stuck on my clothes when rubbing instead of a smooth application; cap also kept falling off in my purse causing the product to dry out after a few weeks; expensive compared with similar productsOverall, I'm not sure if whatever formula Dryel uses is really that much better for clothes that need dry cleaning than a similar product (like Tide to Go). While the product removes stains, there could be improvements in its design to make it more user friendly.
