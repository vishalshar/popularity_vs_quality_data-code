Over the years I have gifted many Moses baskets. Unfortunately the quality of this basket was less than I expected. The basket itself was nice and looked durable however the hood was really lacking in workmanship. The Velcro used to attach it is a poor selection for attaching the hood and basket together. It grabs and threads the ribbon. The length on the hood was not equal to the basket leaving it very visible and exposed to catch on everything. The hood has a large weave and was coming apart, partly due to the poor packaging. I will be removing the Velcro. Restructuring the hood and attach it with a like material and ties. Hopefully this will help to reshape and support it better. Over all I am quite disappointed in this Mose Basket.
