I really loved this bottle( though it leaked), but then when my son dropped it( after a month's use) the plastic ring just cracked. It should't have happened with such an expensive bottle! I have other bottles with plastic rings and my son dropped them multiple times and they never got broken. I can't find the replacement ring for it.
