This crib fits great in our small space. It was easy to assemble and it's easy to lower when needed. I was worried from reviews about this crib scratching easily. So far it has not scratched and has been bumped quite a few times by things. The Einstein crib mobile fits good on this crib. Before that mobile I pushed a mobile down on the side that was from a pack and play. UPDATE: my son is  almost a year old and just started pulling to standing and crawling. He stands in the crib and puts his mouth on it. Paint chips are left on his face when he does this! See photo. It has happened twice now.
