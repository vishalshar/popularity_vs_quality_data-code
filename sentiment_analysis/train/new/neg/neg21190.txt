This type of gate is just what I need for my rather unusual doorway.  When I opened the box I immediately saw why this was less expensive than other similar gates.  I purchased this to replace a Safety 1st gate that broke after 4 years of use and abuse.  I am returning this product and spending the extra for a new Safety 1st gate.  This Evenflo gate  is not as sturdy as the Safety 1st product and the number one thing it lacks is legs at the bottom of the side posts, which means all the weight and stress is on the pressure fit of the top and bottom rails.  Despite being told not to, my grandchildren stand on the bottom rail, as I think most kids are likely to do.  Without the legs that go to the floor to support this weight, the gate would never stay in place if it were held only by the pressure fit of the horizontal rails.  This Evenflo gate would be fine for very young children, up to about 12 mos, but after that I feel that this design flow will cause it to become a hazard.  I highly recommend spending the extra money for a different product.
