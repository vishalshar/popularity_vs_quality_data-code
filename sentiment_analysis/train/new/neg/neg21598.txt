I was very excited to find this product.  It got mostly good reviews and looked to be the perfect thing for my son's bed.  So I bought it...big mistake.First off, it does not tell you on the information page that this rail system should be used on a bed with a mattress and box spring.  My son has a captain's bed, therefore, no box spring.  Secondly, the directions are not properly illustrated and leave out a vital piece of information until the END of the instruction page.  (This being that the 'pocket' for the square tube must face inward towards the mattress)  I had the whole thing assembled (wrong, of course) before discovering this valuable bit of information.Lastly, they provide NO instructions on how to fold the rail down.  I still have no idea how to do that, not that I can because that function doesn't work on my son's rails since he has no box spring.I am very disappointed.  Hopefully my review will serve as a warning to those thinking of purchasing this item.
