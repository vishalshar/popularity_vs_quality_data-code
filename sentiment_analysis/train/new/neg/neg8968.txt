I've washed this pad three times now, following all of the recommended instructions.  It's already pilled and fraying at the edges of the skirt.  I have a flat pad from this same line which has been laundered the same number of times.  It looks as if I've had it a year -- and used it hard for a year, at that, which I haven't.Not only that, but WalMart sells this exact same item for four dollars less.  Talk about a gyp!  If I'm going to buy something cheap and poorly wearing (which wasn't my intent), I could have at least saved myself the shipping and four dollars.
