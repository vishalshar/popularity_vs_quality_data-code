This thing is a great idea IF you have the ability/interest to spend time twirling what seems like yards of fabric around yourself AND a helper nearby to assist you with loading/unloading your infant. I had hoped this would be something I could throw into the diaper bag to quickly put on prior to going on solo shopping trips/errands outside the home. But no. I love the concept, but this is just too inconvenient for real-life use. BTW, I am a very short, petite person and the extreme length of this material made it impossible for me to put it on without having the tail ends of it dragging all over the floor...plus there was a lot of material left over that needed to be knotted up to keep from having it hanging in the way. A taller person might not have this problem with it. One last thing: I got this in the standard black color, and (in the day that I had it out of the box prior to returning it) it attracted all manner of lint and cat hair...definitely something you should be aware of if you have pets or are moderately housekeeping-challenged like myself.
