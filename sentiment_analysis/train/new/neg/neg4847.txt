expensive for the quality.  When I wash a 10 dollar bib before use, I expect the neck and edges will not shrink up.  I used cold water and air drying, too.  Probably will not buy again, esp. for that price.  Cute matza print, was a nice enough gift for the baby at the Seder, but I wish it hadn't looked "used" instantly.  Brand new it was too stiff to absorb anything baby spilled/dribbled.
