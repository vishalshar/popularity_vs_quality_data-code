I am giving these bibs 2 stars for the following 2 reasons:  (1) they are soft and absorbent.  My baby often drips milk out of his mouth while drinking from a bottle, so these prevent the milk from getting all over his neck.  (2)  the bib attaches behind the baby's head using velcro, which is faster than the bibs that use button snaps.  This is important when the baby is fussing/crying because he is hungry and doesn't want to wait a long time for you to get a bib around his neck.However, I would not purchase these again because the satin trim falls apart after a few washes.  I noticed this after I had washed just one bib, and I thought perhaps the satin trim was sticking to the velcro in the washer, which was making it fall apart.  So when I washed the other 2 bibs, I made sure to fasten the velcro before washing.  The satin trim on these other two also fell apart after a few washes.  Now it's so bad that the fibers stick to my baby's neck, and so then I have to use a washcloth or my fingers to remove the fibers from his neck.
