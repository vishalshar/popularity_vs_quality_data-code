I had read some reviews and expected my toddler to rest easily in this seat.  There were two main problems I have with it.  1st- when my toddler nods off, I can tell she is uncomfortable as her head is flopped forward.  2nd- I have to constantly readjust the seat belt, every time I put her in, because the seat belt slots do not have any type of hold on the seat belt itself.  My parents bought a different style model, the Graco Cargo booster seat.  This one even though it isn't pink or purple, provides much more comfort for my little one.
