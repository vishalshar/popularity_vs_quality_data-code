This cooler is ok, but the ice packs do not stay cold but for maybe 6 hours. This might be ok for daytime outings, but as a working mom I need something that will stay cold from the time I leave the house in the morning until I get home in the evening (about 10 hours). I ended up getting this one and using it instead Breastmilk Cooler Set, 1 Cooler Bag, 3 Ice Packs, and 4 Collection Bottles. Can fit into Medela Pump In Style and Medela Freestyle Breastpumps. Can hold up to 5 Lansinoh Breastmilk Storage Bags.
