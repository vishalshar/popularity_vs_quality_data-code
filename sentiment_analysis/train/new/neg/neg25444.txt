Just received this baby cap, after a very long wait.  It was a much larger child size, instead of the infant size ordered. What is worse, it smelled and had dirty stains of some brown muck on the inside.  It is of very poor quality!  I just want to throw it in the trash and v be done of the hassle of returning it.  I believe it came from China,  because of the writing on the mailing package. IF I WAS YOU,  STAY CLEAR IF BUYING THIS PRODUCT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.Shame on seller. Amazon should stop selling this product with immediate effect. Had to give it one star,  as it would post review otherwise. But it deserves no stsrs
