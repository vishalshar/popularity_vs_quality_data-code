This mirror serves its purpose and does affix to the head rests well and does not move while driving. However, it does give a bit of a circus mirror effect which is unfortunate. I like how it has soft surround on the mirror which is different than most mirrors we have seen. It is small enough to not cause any impairment to vision when looking into the rear view mirror, but still allows you to clearly see your baby while driving. We give this a 3 out of 5 stars due to the bit of circus mirror effect.
