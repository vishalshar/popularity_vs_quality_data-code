overall materials seem to be good however quality of assembly can be better. The frame keeps falling apart because those little pins that keep components together simply pop out. This is a second umbrella I've purchased (returned first one because it broke within a week ), This one I just keep replacing pins with something more durable (1 more left ) and everything else seems to be holding up pretty well
