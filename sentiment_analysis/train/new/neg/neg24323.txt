It's cute empty or with very few items in the pockets. I use this in the bathroom at toddler level. We store about 3 PJs in each 2 top pockets and undies and a couple of pull-ups in the bottom pockets. I don't like the way the pockets curve out with so few items in. We tried with books too but really didn't like it for the same reason.It is sturdy and will hold heavier item. It smelled a bit for the first couple of days.
