I've sent this to Safety1st Customer Service: We'll see what they say.We've purchased two Safety 1st Espresso Swing gates over the past 8 months to protect our child from the various stairs in our split level house.  Unfortunately both of these gates in a short period of time have become unreliable and unstable.The gate at the top of our largest flight of stairs (9) has to be readjusted constantly as well as the nobs that click the gate into the wall unit have fallen off and had to be replaced with longer screws to secure the nobs in the gate (not sure how that is even possible as these nobs were pre-installed in the gate upon packaging and the screws never touched (really out of reach even for my toddler son).The biggest scare came with the gate at the top of a smaller set of stairs (3) when my toddler (11 months old - 10 at the time) was on the gate and leaning on it when the wood in the gate gave way and split.  Lukily we were right here and a fall was prevented, but the horizontal wood on both the top and the bottom separated right from the wood that holds the O rings that attach to the wall.Needless to say both gates, which we originally thought to be one of the best options for stair safety, are now unreliable and we are looking to replace them.What is the warranty on these items?  I find it hard to believe that these types of units are deemed safe for stair use/protection, which such instability?
