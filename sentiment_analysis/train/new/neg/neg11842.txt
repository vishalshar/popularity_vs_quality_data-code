I had high hopes for these bottles, but they're just okay. I had some that were great and others that leaked. Then there were some that the lids just fell right off. If you can get the ones that don't leak and have good lids they are a great bottle then I'd say they are more of a 4 star, but since you never quite know if you are getting a good bottle or a dud, I'd suggest buying something different and avoiding the hassle. There are better bottles that are cheaper (Gerber) and ones that are WAY better that are more expensive (pretty much everything else)!
