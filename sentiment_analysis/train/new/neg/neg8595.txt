I thought this set was ok, especially for the price. The material feels very soft and looks nice but the stitching doesn't appear to be the best quality and I don't expect it to hold up forever. Since its bedding for a baby I can live with that but it is something to consider. The top string on the diaper stacker already fell off after putting it through the wash also, which again comes back to the poor stitching. If you buy this product be gentle with it. I recommend it for anyone who is trying to budget their money but if you can afford it and you're looking for something sturdier you might want to consider spending the extra cash.
