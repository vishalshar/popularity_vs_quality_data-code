I've never found a nursing pad (reusable or disposable) that I loved. With each of my four kids I've searched, but have yet to find something that does it's job and doesn't look like a wad of toilet paper stuffed in my bra. With my last baby I purchased these after a set of organic cotton pads failed miserably. They weren't waterproof, so they worked for a few minutes before leaking through my shirt. I decided to try these since they were from a brand I've heard of and because they were waterproof. About the only thing I can say for them is they are, in fact, waterproof. The only problem is they are so huge they peak out of the top of my bra and the shape is completely unflattering. My nursing bras are full coverage, supportive bras yet within a few minutes the pad will work it's way up and peek over the top of my bra. The unyielding circular shape makes it impossible to get the pad to lie flat, so no matter what I do I see large folds and creases through my shirt. It's completely unflattering and not very comfortable. With that said, the fabric has stopped all leaks so I think they have potential after a major size decrease and a shape change.
