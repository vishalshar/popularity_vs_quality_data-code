This does not fit at all on my bob duallie.  I have tried multiple times and am really disappointed.  It fit on my single, but doesn't help me when I want to take both kids on a walk with the dog in windy cold weather.  I use it to have extra insulation on their legs, but it does not ever serve as a shield.
