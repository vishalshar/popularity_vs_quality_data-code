I purchased this rocking chair for my 2-year old for Christmas and she seems to like it well enough.  It's pretty, light enough for her to move around, and has rubber stoppers on the front so she can get in and out of it.  It seems to be well-made and looks really cute, but functionally, it's much smaller than I envisioned -- she will outgrow it easily within a year -- and the seat angles up toward the front so that unless she's scooched all the way back, which is hard for a toddler to accomplish, it doesn't rock.The biggest drawback is the $49 price tag: once I actually saw the chair, I would've expected to pay half what Hoohobbers charges.  The materials are plastic and mesh and it's small, but it does fold up neatly (although this was not a selling point for me).  Had this not been a gift from Santa, I would've returned it and purchased the Fisher Price Infant to Toddler Rocker for $29.  Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker - Blue/Green  My 5-year old has had one since she was 1 and it's large enough and constructed in such a way your child can grow with it.  The frame is metal and the seat is cotton; it has a vibrating seat option and activity bar for when the child is small.  And it's much more comfortable than a wooden, straight-backed rocking chair.  Even though I no longer need any of the baby features, it's what I wish I had purchased this time and what I'll probably end up getting when the Hoohobbers chair is too small, as it is a much better deal.
