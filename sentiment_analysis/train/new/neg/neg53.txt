These are terrible and not what I thought they were! i have bought gerber prefolds before and received three times the better quality of a prefold as this one! This one might as well be a small flat cloth diaper because that is the thin quality of it! Very disappointing! I will never buy this again! It makes you at least chose 1 star to complete the review but I wouldn't even give it that! Picture shows these prefolds on the left and the prefolds I have purchased from gerber on the right. Not even a close to the same!
