This product is very soft, I give it 2 stars for that.However, once I washed it, the zipper was nearly impossible to move. I have to tug and pull and maneuver the zipper over the teeth inch by inch to get it closed, while holding the 2 sides of the zipper together.Also, what's the deal with the flap? It falls down over the baby's face.Several certified carseat installers have said never to put anything between baby and the carseat. This product does go under the baby, so I will be exchanging it for Eddie Bauer cover by Gold Inc. that goes over the carseat and also has an outside pocket for storage.
