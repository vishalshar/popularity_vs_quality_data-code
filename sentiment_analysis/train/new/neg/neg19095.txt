I own 2 other cups from Nuk that are stage one with the handles and spout.  My son loves them and the part on the inside that makes the cup "spill proof" is exactly the same.  But he did not like these. Even though the spill proof piece is the same, this cup was a lot harder to suck water through even for me. It is possible that because his other cup has had more use makes the seal more pliable than the new one. I give it to him now only at home with a little water in it without the spill proof piece.  Also, the first time I gave this to him in his highchair, he got frustrated with it and threw it on the floor putting a crack in the bottom corner.  None of his other cups have cracked despite being thrown on the floor countless time.  If you are still going to purchse this cup, I would suggest the insulated one to protect from cracking. Other than that, the cups are very cute and the rim is good for transitioning from zippy spout on to regular cup.
