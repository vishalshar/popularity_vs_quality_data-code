So we bought this after having purchased similar organizers from retai stores in the past.It was shipped to us and packaged great. The product it self is junk. Half of the screws would not thread into their intended holes and the threads had to be retapped. One of the holes where you insert the wheels will not hold the wheel so it keeps falling off. The center piece of the top separator was not sewn on one end. I think this would be a good product if it didn't have so many manufacturing defects. I would not recommend this to anyone, you're better off looking at other products.
