They're Medela bottles, but I ordered 5 oz bottles and instead received 8 oz bottles! I didn't want bottles this big because they won't fit in the cooler I use for my breast milk while going out. It even clearly says on the packaging, "'Medela 5 oz storage bottles". These are huge and I don't know what I'm going to use them for.
