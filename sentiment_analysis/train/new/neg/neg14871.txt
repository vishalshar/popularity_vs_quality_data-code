It is such a shame! This chair is adorable and very strong. However, it did not fit at any of the restaurants I have visited. It only fits at my dining room table(glass tabletop) and even that was a struggle to get it on. I am very disappointed because it is so cute and it appears to be made with high quality material. Bad, bad, bad design.
