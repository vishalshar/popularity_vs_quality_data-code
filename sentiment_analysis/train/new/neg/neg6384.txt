I must admit we brought based on price but I was hopeful since we have other items made by the same company. I should have returned the monitor as it doesn't work well. It's always going out of range when it shouldn't, the white noise from it keeps us awake at night, and my biggest gripe of all is that there is no volume indicator. When you turn the volume up and down it beeps and the volume of the beep is mean to indicate the volume level....it's really not helpful!! The power lead also doesn't work too well and if you knock it slightly it takes a lot of wiggling around to work again. I do like the night light feature and the temperature display.I would not buy the product again.
