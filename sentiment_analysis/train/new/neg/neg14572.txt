When I ordered this product, the product title was "Strata Flip Toilet Seat Reducer White" ... there was a separate product listing for "Strata Flip Toilet Seat Reducer Blue"It is listed in my orders as "Strata Flip Toilet Seat Reducer White" and "Sold by: SCS Collectibles, Inc" ... I instead received 2 blue toilet seats and when I click on the "Strata Flip Toilet Seat Reducer White" link, it takes me to a page that says, "Strata Flip Toilet Seat Reducer, Colors May Vary" and is instead "Sold by The Baby's Gallerie"If we're going to have these on our toilets for years of potty training, I was hoping for something subtle and would have bought a different product.  Am disappointed that the product delivered was not as ordered.  I don't understand why the product description can change AFTER you've placed an order.  There is no option for exchange - only return.  I'm very disappointed.
