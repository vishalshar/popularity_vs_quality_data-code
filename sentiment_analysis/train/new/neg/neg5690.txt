I bought this because the one that came with my mobile was a wind up and only played for about two minutes before you had to wind it up again. So I was hoping to switch the two out, but the hook on this one was too fat to work with the mobile I had so that was disappointing. Wish it would have worked because it's a great price and I love the fact that you can just turn it on and it will play till you're ready to shut it off. I also like all the different lullabies it plays even though it only plays one verse. I kept it because my daughter enjoys listening to the music- even without the mobile.
