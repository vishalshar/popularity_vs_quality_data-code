Everybody raves about how awesome this bag is so I thought I would splurge for it. Bad idea. I much more prefer my skip hop messenger and this is why:1) The bag packs out not up, so it is very wide, and looks like I'm carrying a rolled up sleeping bag on a string. I smack it into everything and it looks really silly.2) The strap always falls off my shoulder but the shoulder pad is to small and too thick to stay in place.3) The mommy pocket has no room for your wallet, so your forced to put it in the big part of the bag and search for it.4) The phone pocket is to small for a phone. I have an iPhone 5 for reference and it sorta fits in on a slant if I work it in there.5) You can't fit more than 2 diapers in the diaper pocket.6) You can't use the inside bottle pockets if you are using the outside ones.7) I wish the mommy pocket had two zippers so you could leave it slightly open to access things.8) None of the zippers can be opened with one hand which if you have a baby you know you never have two hands.9) It takes 5 minutes to get the changing pad back into its pocket.I wish I could return this bag but I bought it early in my pregnancy and took the tags off. I have only used it once.
