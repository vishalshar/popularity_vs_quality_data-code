My wife decided on Kids Line Jungle Walk products when our son was but a few months old. There is no secret their stuff is expensive. Yes, it is cute - and even as a guy, I like their products more. They just seem more "baby like" if that makes sense.While most everything we have purchased seemed to have a quality that at the least pretended to be worthy of the cost, this hamper does not. We will keep it, my wife loves it. But the construction is just CHEAP. The wooden supports are too thin, the attachments are questionable.I have NO doubt this thing will be broken during some point while we are using it. Buy it for yourself, yes. Buy it as a baby shower gift? No.
