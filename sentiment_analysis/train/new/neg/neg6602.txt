The bed is cute and serves it's basic function, but not for all children.1.  Concerning Quality of Materials:  We were a bit disappointed.  Expecting more hard wood and less particleboard.  Due to the lackluster materials, the bed came with a couple chips.  They weren't big enough for us to go through the hassle of return and replace (especially considering how long sipping took) but are large enough to annoy.2.  Concerning Functionality:  Anyone with a child who turns while they sleep (which is most children toddler age) the 'safety rail' is wholly inadequate.  Our toddler has fallen out of bed every night since putting it together and we've had to order a supplemental rail to replace the 'mini' one that comes with the bed.
