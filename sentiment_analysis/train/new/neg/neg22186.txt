At first these bottles seemed like a godsend.  Our baby had struggled with Avent and Adiri brands.  The soft nipple seemed like a really good design and feedings went really smoothly and quickly.  She seems to be slowing down a bit now despite using the #2 nipple and we have yet to try the #3s (which I think would be too advanced for a 5 week old)so I guess the jury is sill out.  They don't leak and are easy to clean.  Overall though at this point I would say these are very good quality, well designed bottles.
