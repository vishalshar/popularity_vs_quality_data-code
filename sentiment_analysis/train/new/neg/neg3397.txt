Great alternative to buying pre-loaded pouches at the store - these make eating a breeze for our toddler. The only issue is the structural integrity of the bag material itself. I have another set of Sqooshis that are able to stand up in the dishwasher.These guys, while cute with the animal prints, slouch over and mean I need to hand wash each one. That's a huge consideration - I'd probably buy again but not expect the same level of efficiency in cleaning them.
