The first one of these I had came apart at every seam the first time I washed it.  I returned it and got another I was pleased with until about the 6th washing, and now IT is starting to fall apart.  They just don't seem to be well-made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure.
