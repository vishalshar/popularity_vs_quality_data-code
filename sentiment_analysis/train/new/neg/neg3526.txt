I read several of the reviews on this site to choose a new mattress for my babies room.  I have a great crib from USA baby and I noticed how the first review stated that she didn't buy the super expensive mattress from USA Baby (160.00) which I did for my first baby and it was great.  It was a super snug fit in the crib and now in her toddler bed it still is a perfect fit.  I decided that for this baby I didn't want to spend as much for a mattress because it did seem silly. HOWEVER, this mattress didn't fit snug in my crib nor did it have the firm feel.  This is a medium quality mattress for a medium price.  I bought it yesterday and took it back today.  I am going to go with the expensive mattress that I know fits and is perfect for long term use.
