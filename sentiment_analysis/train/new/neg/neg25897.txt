I bought this for my Summer Infant 3Dlite Convenience Stroller--because without it, that stroller basically has no shade cover. This rayshade is pretty good for what it's supposed to do. So far I've used it a few times, and it has worked out well.For some reason, I could not find a demo/example of how to attach this thing. Maybe I'm just a bit dense or something, but just by looking at the photo/description, I couldn't really figure out. Anyway, it's just a stretchy fabric with a curved wire on one side (the part that provides the shade). There are four velcro ties that let you attach the shade to your stroller frame. To pack it up, you're supposed to twist and fold it (kind of like how you would pack up a car sunshade that folds into a circle). I've had some luck doing it a few times, but not all the time.*While the wire on  the one edge provides the stiffness for the shade coverage, this shade still needs to sit on top of something (another canopy/frame) because the rest of it is fabric.(Note: These comments only apply to using the shade on the 3Dlite stroller)Pros: Can extend the shade pretty far forward over your baby depending on how it's positioned (though...it won't provide shade for evening/morning walks when the sun is super angled); the stretchy fabric and velcro seem to make it pretty versatile for other strollers as well--though I haven't tried it on another stroller yet.Cons: The material does not seem durable at all nor water-repellent (though I haven't tried it in the rain, so maybe I'm wrong). It takes some fiddling to attach it securely to your stroller (you have to stretch it out pretty tightly, and it's a bit awkward to do with the stiff wire at the front). It's definitely not one of those shades that you slap on in 10 seconds.Overall, I am satisfied with this shade, well, because it does what it's supposed to do (provide shade). But I wish it felt a bit more durable and wasn't so fiddly to attach.
