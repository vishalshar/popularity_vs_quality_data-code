I wanted to get some extra organization/storage for my lightweight stroller - peg perego aria (10lbs and functions like a full size) and thought this might be a good fit.It's not - our handles are a full cross bar (not like the stroller handle in the product picture). The straps were tight but it wasn't stable, and I could see our drinks wobbling/sloshing about. I did a test with a sippy cup and the organizer leaned or the stroller bar got in the way. The hooks would be useful if they were hanging off the handle - if we were to hook bags on our stroller, it would drag on the floor - or bang against our legs as we're walking.This would be ideal on a stroller that doesn't have a reclined seat - like a maclaren/umbrella. It would be better if there were anchor straps/hooks to secure the bottom to the stroller. Or a stroller that had handles like the product picture and was a taller/higher stroller to utilize the hooks. The hooks are relatively small and won't hold much weight. If your stroller doesn't meet these requirements, then keep looking.I found another organizer that fit better for my stroller's handless by Sunshine Kids - buggy buddy
