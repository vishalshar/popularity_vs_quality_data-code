I mostly like this cup.  I avoid most plastic food containers for my child, but I thought I'd give this one a chance for practicality sake.  I like that it doesn't leak when it's closed.  The problem I found with it is that there is no easy way to remove the top dome to clean under it and there is no indication anywhere that you are even supposed to clean under it.  After a few months of use my curiosity got the best of me and I wedged a screw driver in the tiny seam between the cup lid and the dome and popped it off.  It was disgusting!  I started washing it, then realized I should take a picture so this is after I cleaned it some.  There really should be a better way of removing this thing to clean it especially considering that when you turn the cap to hide the straw the straw slides up under the moldy cap.  YUCK!
