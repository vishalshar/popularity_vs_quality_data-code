I fell in love with this the moment I saw it on Amazon. It was given to me as a gift at my shower. I couldn't wait for baby to be big enough to wear it. the colors are bright, it's just as cute in person as it looks like it will be. Unfortunately the snaps will NOT stay snapped. I put it on and in less than 5 minutes it's undone. And not just once or twice. Any time the child moves (and he's only 3 months, he doesn't move that much yet)three more snaps are undone. It's a constant battle. He's only worn it twice because it's such an annoying trait. I'm actually quite disappointed. I was so looking forward to this.
