We bought these and some Bumgenius Freetime diapers to try after using Kissaluvs with Thirsties covers for 3 1/2 months (never a leak or blowout, but left her skin super wet even with regular diaper changes).  When we tried the Buttons and Freetimes, baby was about 15 pounds and a little over 3 1/2 months old.Maybe I was using the Buttons cover wrong, but we had poop leak out the leg hole several times.  I then tried to make the leg holes even smaller, at which point the baby had painful looking red marks on her legs.  Other than the leaky poop (and red marks when they are on too tight), we kind of liked these.  They were affordable, super cute, the liners kept her skin mostly dry, and they weren't as bulky as the Freetimes.However, the Freetimes kept her skin drier than the Buttons and we didn't have any leaks from the Freetimes.  We decided to spend the extra money and invest in Freetimes, and use the Buttons diapers we bought as backup.  Maybe when she learns to crawl or walk we might start to like the Buttons better (because they are less bulky), but at this stage I will say that they are not my favorite.
