We loved this thermometer at first. We've only used it for two months, bathing our twin boys twice a week. I thought I was doing a good job of squeezing all of the water out of the rubber bottom, but apparently some seal is broken on it.Getting water out is a pain and when I do now its discolored and disgusting. I have to order something totally different so this doesn't happen again. The only reason this is getting 2 stars is because it did well to check the temperature... just not so well with water contamination.
