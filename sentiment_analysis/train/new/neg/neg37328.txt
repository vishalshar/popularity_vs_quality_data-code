This is really really cute. I got it for my daughter's room along with the curtains that match. I did not realize the print was as large as it was, but that's not a big deal. I would have liked it better if it was sold as a set of 2 instead of just one. But all together. I find it to be really cute.EDIT:So I had to order 3 more of these and ummm... They weren't the same as the original one that I bought. Oh no. the other ones that I got were made of a different fabric, came in a different shade of white, the image was cut at a different spot, but ironically the quality was BETTER. It ended up coming from someone on Etsy. Might be worth looking into it since I paid the same amount for the Sweet Jojo ones and ended up with different ones that were better quality. My problem here is that I paid for the ones by Sweet Jojo Designs, and despite the design being similar, it was different than the original one. Be warned, if might say from Beyond Bedding up until you pay for it at which point it might change to a different company and if you are looking to buy this, make sure you are not getting it from 2 different companies.
