We just purchased this monitor and thought it would be great since it has a long range to it - especially since we have a large home. It's horrible! We have the receiver in our room and the monitor portion in the baby's room and we hear constant static on the receiver. When the baby does make noise, yes the monitor picks it up but the static is unbearable to listen too. Our bedroom and the baby room are not very far apart and no matter what channle (A or B) and what volumn level the receiver is at, we still here a contact static noise. I used to have a cheap 15.00 monitor that worked perfect.. I think I'll try to buy a cheaper model and see if we have better luck.
