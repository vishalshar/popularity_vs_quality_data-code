bought 2 of these cups in blue and pink.  Both blue cups plastic bubbled and warped after using for a few months, pink cups did not.  All cups are always washed on top shelf of dishwasher and on air dry and I never had any other cups turn bad.  These are very expensive to have to throw away after using for a few months.
