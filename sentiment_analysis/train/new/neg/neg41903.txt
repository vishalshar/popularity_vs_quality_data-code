Within 6 hours of use our 10 month old baby had pulled off one blade. We wondered what he was chewing on and it was a blade...Given the temperature we persevered with two blades and within minutes the baby had pulled them off.As you can see from the photo the blades tear like paper.Unfortunately if you attach this to a stroller at some point your child will get it... And it will last minutes...
