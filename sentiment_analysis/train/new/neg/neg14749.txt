My BOB revolution jog stroller was stolen and I was looking for a cheaper replacement. For 1/2 the price, this is  great stroller. The problem lies in the height. I watched the babygizmo.com review describing the back resting length for the child as 30 inches, which it is. My son just turned 2 and is in the 5th percentile for height- 5th percentile for weight, so I wasn't worried at all about the reviews that discussed the stroller being too short for many children. I have had the stroller for about 3 months and it is great. folds great, runs smoothly, great accessories that come with it. But I am figuring I have maybe another 3-6 months in this stroller and then we will be done with it. The back length is 30 inches, but the canopy (which has terrific coverage) comes out at such a sloping angle, that is takes a large chunk away from the length of the back rest. My sons head is about to hit the canopy. Hi entire height is 31 inches, so I was not worried at all about the length- but the canopy angle is so steep, it is cutting a good 8-10 inches off the back length. I thought this stroller would get me to his 4th or 5th birthday and there is no way, unless I dispose of the canopy completely.  I live in southern california and we spend a lot of time in the sun, so the canopy is pretty important to me.I am torn about the review for this item, because other than the length, it is a great stroller. i wish there was some way to adjust the canopy to come out at a higher angle, to buy me some more time with it.....
