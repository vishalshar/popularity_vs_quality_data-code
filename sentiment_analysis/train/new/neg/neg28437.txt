These cases are really durable and super cute.  Everyone is impressed with the lights that glow when the wheel spin.However, after using these I wouldn't buy again.The little case / backpack is nearly useless.  It wears like a back pack but doesn't open like one.  Therr are no pockets on the side for bottle and storage doesnt make sense.  Reallyw only works for a 1 night overnight stay.The big case is fine enough but having the case open in the middle rather than towards to too means that you have to pack both sides.  So while away, you need to leave open for both sides to be accessible and it takes up twice the room.Overall, the functionality is really awkward.  The do roll well and do a good job of protecting items inside.
