While the product was shipped quickly, unfortunately it arrived damaged and unrepairable.  The plastic within the fabric piece that the monkeys hang from was broken in half thus not even circular or even hangable.  I am completely amazed at the packing as the circular piece was bent in half and crammed into the box!  Well of course it would snap in half!!  I called the company and was told I would receive a "spare part" and email confirmation which I never did.  So I tried contacting the company again through Amazon (through email) and was told (yet again) that I would receive a "spare part" with a tracking number for shipping.  This time I tried to ensure that I would be getting the correct part.  I then did receive a tracking number and confirmation the "spart part" had been mailed.  Unfortunately like I knew would happen, we received the white plastic piece (that my broken piece would hang from!) in the mail today.  Upon sending yet another email, now ironically they are out of stock and I have to send a photo of the broken part to process a refund?!?!  This is been one huge headache and a complete waste of my time.  Completely unhappy and disappointed in the service.
