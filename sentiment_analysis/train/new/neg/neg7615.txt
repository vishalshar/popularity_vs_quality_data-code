I made a mobile for my baby and needed a way of attaching it to the crib since I didn't want to hang it from the ceiling. This is awful, definitely not what I was expecting. The description really needs to say a little more. First of all, I will say that it's sturdy! That's about the only positive thing I found in it. I like the concept of it and it would be great if it was actually useful.Here are the things I found wrong with it (and I just got it today).1) It's crazy short, if you're actually able to clamp it to your crib you'll find that the mobile hangs down within babies reach - in my case it'd probably be laying on the baby/mattress. And not to mention, it barely extends out from the clamp part (to the side), so if you're using a circled object (embroidery hoop) to hang animals/objects from for the mobile - it's not going to work at all.2) The clamp only opens 1 inch - if you've got an awesome, thick crib made of real wood - you'll never get it to attach.3) The clamp is ridiculously hard to open. I had to use two hand just to open it, call me weak but is that really necessary? I mean - there's a locking button for after you clamp it on so it's pointless.Save your time and money, this product is basically useless. The only way I found to ACTUALLY make it work is to clamp it, sideways, on a shelf that's hanging about a foot above the actual crib. DON'T DO IT!
