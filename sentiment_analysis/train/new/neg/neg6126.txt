This product seems like a good idea and maybe they had good intent...but it's made very very cheaply. Mine tore at the handle before I even used it. The hardware on it is less than second rate. I get the feeling the people who designed it have no experience with building traditional luggage that needs to withstand a certain level of wear and tear. I'd classify this more as a bag to store a car seat in a garage than to travel on the plane with. Since this is the "Elite" travel bag I'm assuming the models that cost less could only be worse. I also bought the red stroller bag that J.L.Childress makes (for checking in at the gate) and it tore at the seams after one short Delta flight. They have a good idea but they just don't know how to make a quality product. I'm looking for a replacement, or possibly have one made.
