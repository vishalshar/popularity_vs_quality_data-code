As another reviewer pointed out, and as Brica confirmed, the sides of this bassinet are not breathable where it's not a see-through mesh. That means the bassinet is not safe to use once your infant is mobile at all, because if they can squirm up against a non-mesh area of the side and put their face against it, they could suffocate.Brica also says (in personal correspondence) that there are important limitations: don't use the bassinet once your infant reaches 3 months old or 15 pounds. This wasn't disclosed anywhere on the product packaging or instructions. Since the package clearly shows an infant over 3 months old being put into the bassinet, you could easily be misled into using it for an older infant. This really is for an immobile newborn.For an immobile newborn, this travel bassinet is easy to use, lightweight, and very portable. But to keep babies safe, the age and weight limitations should be clearly explained, and the side fabric should be a breathable fabric.
