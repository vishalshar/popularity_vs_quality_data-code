I was a bit disappointed with this toy because it had great potential but was lucking in certain areas.  The good side is that it is cute and everything can be easily stored in the box.  It can also be used in the bath (if you take out the firefly bug that lights up).  My daughter (15 mo old) generally likes it.  But there are a couple of issues with it:  the handle is not long enough to be of any use; it didn't have the blue shovel shown in the picture; the firefly bug works only sometimes, when it hits the bottom really hard.  ALso, I was expecting the top slots to discriminate bugs by size or shape, but that is not the case.  Any bug can fit in any hole, so it misses a good oportunity for extra fun.  Overall, I kept this toy because my daughter liked it a bit and she can use it in her bath, but I don't think it will keep her attention for very long.
