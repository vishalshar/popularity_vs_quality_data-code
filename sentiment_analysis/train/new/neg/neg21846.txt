Upon first inspection, the Levana Baby Monitor looks like it has everything you could want to monitor a newborn. It comes with three main pieces:Wireless Movement Monitor - this is a small monitor with a clip on that sounds an alarm when it detects no movement from the baby's stomach for 15 seconds. This worked very well when I tried it out (sans baby), and the alarm is very loud. You can easily hear it a couple rooms over. This is a pretty unique feature that I haven't seen in other products and I like that it was included with the video monitor.Video Camera - It's wireless, but you can't connect to it through a regular wireless connection, and it can only be connected through the monitor. The camera is also a bit large and bulky from the types of cameras I'm used to seeing now. Additionally, the picture quality isn't that great (especially the night vision). Although it is definitely clear enough during the day to check on your baby and see movement, it can be difficult to see at night.Video Receiver - Very portable and looks nice, but as mentioned above, the picture quality you receive from it does not look as clear as it does in the product images. If you're using the night vision, you'll need to have at least some light on in the room to get a clear picture.
