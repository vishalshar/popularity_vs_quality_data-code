This "portable" play yard won't fit through a door.  Why put wheels on an item that you can't transport once it's up?  Can't find sheet for it anywhere.  My mom had to make some for me.  Not going to put my baby to sleep on plastic for the whole night while visiting family.  Don't want to just put a receiving blanket down because that can bunch up and cause breathing problems.  A tightly fitted sheet is the only safe thing but they don't make them to fit this odd shape.  Spent a lot of money thinking Boppy would make a product better than Graco - just the same problem of can't go through doors with the added problem of can't buy sheets.  Oh well.  It's cute (who cares - you're asleep) and the vibrating thing works well.  She'll grow out of it eventually.
