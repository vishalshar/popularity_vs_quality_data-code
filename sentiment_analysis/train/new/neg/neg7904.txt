We used the Diaper Genie for 1 week and were completely disapponted.  It requires way too much effort...  Open the top, push down, close, twist.  Why bother!We just keep those little disposable, scented plastic bags in the nursery and take the trash out every day.  No big deal.I absolutely would not spend the $25 plus the $15 for the refills.
