These are just ok. They get the job done, but I have issues with them bunching up inside my pocket diapers. I bought the large size for my 13 month old. They are a little short for my one size pocket diapers. Because of that, they seem to bunch up and slide towards the middle/back of the pocket diaper (which isn't good when you have a boy).On a positive note, they are great colors, they are quality made, and they absorb very well. If only I could get them to stay in place, these would be wonderful!Maybe I'm not doing something right? I don't think so, because I don't have any problems with my other doublers and inserts. I don't believe I'll be buying anymore.
