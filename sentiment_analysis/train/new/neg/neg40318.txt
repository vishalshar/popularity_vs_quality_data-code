I got the whole set; a bed the tall and short dresser. The bed's fine and so is the short dresser with the changing table, however the tall dresser was defective and so was the replacement Amazon sent. Quality is good (not great), but the problem is that it's a high dresser with absolutely NO center field support. Even IKEA ones have a rod in the middle to reinforce the tall side panels and prevent bowing when the drawers are full. I filled the drawers with baby clothes and socks and the 3 center drawers fell on one another. They just would not stay on the rails. Disappointed.
