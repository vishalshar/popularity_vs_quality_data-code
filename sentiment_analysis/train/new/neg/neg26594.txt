I've been very happy with the Happy Endings charcoal bamboo inserts and the Happy Endings AI2 and Night Night diapers.  I was looking to expand my stash options for overnight by adding hemp inserts.  Unfortunately, the Happy Endings hemp inserts did maintain the high quality I've come to expect from this company.  Paying attention to the previous reviews and the notes in the description regarding high heat causing fabric warping, I washed and dried on moderate temperatures.  Even with care, the edges became uneven and the insert warped to the point that it will not lay flat at all.  The absorbency of these inserts is very good, but the issues with shrinking and inability to lay flat lead to the 2 star review.
