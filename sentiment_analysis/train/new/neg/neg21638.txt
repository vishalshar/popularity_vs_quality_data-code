The exersaucer is well built and has several toys for the baby to play with, while it might be better for their hips, the mechanism is stiff and the part they stand on is too slick.  Our friends have the Fisher Price Jumperoo and my baby loves that one  way more than our exersaucer.  Also, the different levels for the height do not seem to match our daughter's.  It's either too short and putting too much pressure on her legs or too tall and she can't reach.
