I was reluctant to get a bumper since they are not recommended, and have actually been banned from being sold in Chicago and Mass. But, after multiple nights of my 6 month old waking up because he had turned in his crib and his head was pressed up against the rails, and twice I walked in to see his arm sticking through the rails as he napped I gave in. Knowing the bumper is temporary I didn't want to spend the $150 to get the one that matched his bedding, so I thought this would be a good option. While the minky dot fabric is super soft, I just really don't like the tabs. They aren't really sewn at the proper points to be able to tie them on the slats of our crib. And they are just small white ties. I know this is the sacrifice by getting a much less expensive style, so it's more a personal preference than anything actually being "wrong" with this bumper. It is perfectly fine for what it is, and at this price it is what I expected. It certainly has saved us from middle-of-the-night awakenings because the baby is smashing his head into the crib rails. So we are keeping it.
