I would definitely recommend this swaddler (size large) to a parent of a 3mo' old or LESS. My son is 4mo's, 14lbs and a little over 21" and the size large we purchased is very tight when properly velcro'd. It straightens his legs for him and they are long enough to tug on the length of the swaddle at his toes and shoulders. When he was first-born, this type of tight-fitting swaddle would have been utterly PERFECT for him, so I would definitely say buy this if your baby isn't over 14lbs. Now he is figuring out how to suck his thumb and likes to touch at things so when we swaddle him I like to give him enough room to at least turn his hand and feel the wrapping fabric around him, this swaddler does not allow that, haha.**If I was rating this based SOLELY on how it arrived to my home, it would have received less than zero stars. (I will post pictures after the review) The swaddler arrived in a well-packaged box with other items from my order, in a plastic snap-bag, and then folded over a bit of cardboard with the brand name and instructions, etc. Similar to how most fleece blankets are sold.. except this was so covered in fluffy purple/blue/black mold I almost hurled when I opened it. The mold was not on any of the other ordered items and was only inside of the plastic bag the swaddler was mailed in, so I know this happened at manufacturing. Two washes still haven't washed out the visible damage the mold caused and I was forced to add bleach to the 3rd wash in order to make sure the mold was killed and the product able to use on my infant.Summary: purchase if you know how to kill mold, AND have a small baby. LOL.
