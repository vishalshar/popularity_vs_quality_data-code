I purchased this set for my son's room and when I opened it I immediately noticed it was manufactured poorly. There were hundreds of uncut strings coming off of each piece giving it a frayed and used look. My husband actually asked me if I had bought it used which I had not. After sitting down with a pair of scissors and cutting little strings off of all the pieces for about 3 hours, the set looks great. It's an adorable set with lots of pieces for a good price, just be ready to harness your inner seamstress and put some additional work into this product.
