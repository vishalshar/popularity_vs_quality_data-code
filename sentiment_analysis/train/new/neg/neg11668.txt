I bought this for my new baby who was having issues with dry skin. I didn't even try it because I could not get past the smell. It has a VERY strong "grandma perfume" smell to it. Wish I hadn't opened it so I could have returned it. If you or your child is sensitive or picky about smells, I would pass on this one.
