Before a trip we had taken, my husband and I had stopped at Babies R Us to purchase a diaper back pack to carry. We have an umbrella stroller and the storage underneath was not enough to lug around our baby equipment. So after checking out every single back pack on display, we opted for the Eddie Bauer one, simply because it had lots of pockets and compartments to store things and it seemed well-designed and convenient.  It fit everything we needed for our baby; there was a handy changing pad and baby wipe/diaper storage pad that was convenient for us, hidden pockets, a place to store our keys, wallet, tickets, cellphones, etc. We loved it throughout the day and my husband kept commenting on how much he liked it.  But as the day came to an end, just like the previous reviewer, we noticed that the lining had come apart inside and had shredded. It was hard to close the back pack without having to zip into all that thread. It was horrible and frustrating! Luckily, by the time all this had happened, our day at the amusement park was over so we no longer needed the diaper bag. But it was such a waste of $37 for a diaper bag that we had only used ONCE! Who would have ever thought that it would fall apart on us on the same day we bought it! Wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. It would have otherwise been a pretty good diaper bag!
