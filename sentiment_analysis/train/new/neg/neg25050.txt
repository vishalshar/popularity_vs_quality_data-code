It keeps the stench out very well.  Easy to install new bags.  You can even use your own bags.  This would be a great product if the bag was easier to pull out when its full of diapers.  There is a plastic lip around the inside edge of the trash can that has plastic clips.  These plastic clips snag the bag when you pull it out.  The bag tears open and diapers fall out.  You have to be careful when pulling the bag out.  I've put some duct tape over the plastic edges on the inside of the can.  It seems to be a nice temporary solution but Ubbi should have thought about this when designing the product.
