The fitvis very tight and I am a female with small fingers. Hard to get it off. But i did not buy for a human baby, I bought it to use for my yorkies teeth. I like that is comes with a case. My yorkie usually has a panic attack when it comes to teeth cleaning. She actually let me use it. So awesome. It is worth being hard to get off if she will continue to allow me to use it on her teeth
