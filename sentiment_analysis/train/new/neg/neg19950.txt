So disappointed! I read the reviews on these sheets and they were mostly excellent.  I normally have purchased Carters sheets in the past but I thought I'd give these a try. So I bought them and besides having a plastic smell from the packaging, I thought they felt very soft. I washed them, twice, to get the plastic smell out and dried them on delicate just like the package states. Then when I put them on the standard size crib mattress, they didn't fit.  The corners fit great, but for some reason, the middle section isn't as wide and the seam is completely visible. It looks horrible and cheap since they don't fit correctly!  I'm also worried my daughter will wake up every day with a seam imprint on her face. I feel like I got cheated out of money. I guess I'll be buying the Carters brand again.
