This has to be THE cheapest product I've ever seen. The suction cup sticks to NOTHING. And the only view you are going to get is anything on the floor because the way it tilts is so loose....that's the only direction it faces. It also comes with a "clip"... except it too is cheaply made so the second you work the handle to open it, it promptly broke with one piece flying off into oblivion. Save your money and do NOT buy this item. I ended up throwing it out.
