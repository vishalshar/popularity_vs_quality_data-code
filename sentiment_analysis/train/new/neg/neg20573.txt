I love the city mini.  We used our first double city mini for 7 years, and recently needed to purchase the upgraded GT double.  I have to say I love lots about it.  My 6 year old can still jump in and out if she gets tired, although mostly used for our 3 year old and 5 month old.  My one complaint is almost every time I heft it out of the back of my van one of the front wheels pops off.  At first I thought we got a bum stroller, so I returned it and purchased another one.  However, this STILL happens.  Almost every time I take it out of the trunk.  It's so annoying with kids in the car, to have to get down on the ground and click the tire back on.  If it only happened once in a while, I would be less annoyed, but it happens so often.  I've looked over review and haven't seen that complaint, but it is seriously SO annoying.
