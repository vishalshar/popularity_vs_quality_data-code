Better than nothing.  This looks super messy from upstairs, not nearly as bad as from downstairs.  It simply ties around the rails.  I have a feeling all these strings will become baby magnets.  There's nothing to prevent a baby from sliding the net up from the bottom if you only tie it to the rails.  There are eye hooks included, but I didn't want to screw then into the wood moulding around the base of the rail.  I guess that would prevent easy lifting of the net.  The eye hooks arroyo short to go through drywall and into a stud, so I jerry rigged a hookup to those types of screws that go into an expanding plastic base in the drywall. I'm surprised there doesn't seem to be any other good alternative products.  This one is so bare bones, with little thought put into it . . .
