If you purchase this, please consider cutting off the yellow plastic rings that are used to suspend the animal toys/rattles. On ours, one ring was much tighter than the other and difficult to slide on the strap. We didn't realize that was cause for alarm, but it actually wore through the strap after only five uses. (See picture.)  The Z-shaped tear perfectly matches the grips on the back of the ring.  Little One was happily bouncing in his new contraption when we noticed the strap was about to give way.  Very scary.
