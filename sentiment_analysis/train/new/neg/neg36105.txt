This pillow is made out of the most scratchy material possible. I searched  the internet for pillow covers to purchase, but to no avail. It doesn't seem that additional covers are available for the XL pillow--even from the manufacturer. Additionally, the pillow is very firm. If you like a large, firm pillow for resting your head, you may love this item. If you prefer a softer head pillow, this item is not for you. Too bad--I was really hoping to love this pillow.
