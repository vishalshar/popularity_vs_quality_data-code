I really wanted to like this stroller, we got it after we lost our MacLauren twin turbo stroller shades (same type of double wide umbrella stroller), but the replacement shades were going to cost the same price as this stroller. Since our MacLauren was older, we thought we would "upgrade" to this one. After 12 hours at Disneyland the left back wheel somehow bent and the brake was hitting the wheel during every revolution making a loud clicking noise. Also, the string that allows you to recline the seat became tattered to the point where we could no longer recline it (cheap string). Getting through doors is possible, but the wheels have to be PERFECTLY straight, seriously like an eighth of an inch leeway, never even thought about this my last stroller. It is obviously a cheaply made stroller, you pay for what you get. Seats recline enough for naps, but not very far. When pushing holding the outside handles it felt like I was bending the stroller, I'm thinking the wheel mishap might have had something to do with it. The shades are attached together, so you have to move them together. If I could do it again, I would have forked over the $90 for new stroller shades for my MacLauren, had that thing over a year with heavy use, and no problems. Pros: The seats are bigger and seem pretty comfortable!
