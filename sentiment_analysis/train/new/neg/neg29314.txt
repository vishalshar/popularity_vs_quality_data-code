I bought this item specifically because the box reads "No boxspring necc. Fits Platform beds".. My daughters bed is a platform, but the mattress falls into the platform about 3 inches. I couldn't use this rail correctly, as there is NO way to fit the metal pieces into the platform with the bed!  However, Removing the metal pieces, I am able to place it between the mattress and the wooden wall of the platform, and it's pretty darn secure! It's a really nice item, and if your bed has a box spring, go for it. i just wish that they'd advertise their item correctly!
