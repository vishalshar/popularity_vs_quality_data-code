So, these are much harder to use than I expected. You see the bags and the holder...think you can just pull the bag out and it tears off to use....mine don't work like that. They are super hard to pull. I rip the bag 9 out of 10 times because I can't get the stupid roll to turn inside of the holder. I finally just threw the roll of bags into the car and leave the holder at home. I really wanted to clip it onto the stroller and diaper bag. Disappointed.
