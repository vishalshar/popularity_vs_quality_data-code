I received this stroller, assembled it with ease, put baby in it and sent it decided to return it.  The seat is so shallow. She is 9 months and without the footrest propped up it was like she was laying on a flat board. So strange and I expect more from britax. Everything else about this stroller was perfect. Very lightweight, easy to fold, and sleek looking. It also strolled like a breeze. I just could not get past the seat issue. I googled this issue immediately and found this stroller has a voluntary RECALL!  The break system will not engage on some strollers. Very unsafe. We opted for the mutsy easyrider for $9 more. I will review that stroller when it arrives.
