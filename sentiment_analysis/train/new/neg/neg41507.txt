Within a few months of use the plastic coating on this mattress began to tear. My son obviously always slept with a sheet, never had toys or even bottles in his crib, and I always wiped clean after accidents.I turned the mattress over once the tear got long. Then in a few months...tear on that side. I bought a mattress protector but the tears keep on getting bigger. I've used duct tape.This morning I noticed there is a supposed ten year warranty; as, even though my son is about to switch to a bed, I am afraid of health issues because of the tears and thought of buying a new crib mattress for the several moths he'll still be in his crib.. But when I go on the company's website to learn how to go about it, none of the links work...I can't even get a phone number.My guess is that the warranty won't wind up being anything useful anyway.In conclusion, I would look elsewhere for a crib mattress...and unfortunately perhaps buy a protector, even though mattresses like this one are supposedly watrproof.
