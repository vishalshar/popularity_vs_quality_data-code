I just received these sheets in the mail, and I can tell you there is NO WAY my baby's skin is getting anywhere near them. They feel like fiberglass. I read another review that said they were 100 % cotton, but they must have changed them or something, because the ones they sent me are the roughest, scratchiest example of polyester/cotton blend garbage the world has ever seen. I am truly appalled that these things are being marketed for babies. If I put my child on them for half an hour he would get an abrasion rash!These are going back. If I can't find anything better to fit the little snuggle nest mattress I will put it in a pillowcase. I highly recommend you do the same.
