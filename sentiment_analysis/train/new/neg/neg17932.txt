I chose these pouches based on the large capacity, spout on end (vs. side), large opening, and price.  They worked well for a while with regular use for apple sauce and yogurt.  I like the large opening, but it took a while to find the sweet spot of filling--fill it too much and closing the zipper edge will cause it to squeeze out and make a huge mess.  And "too much" is very deceiving--they are not actually capable of holding as much as you would expect.  I always hand washed these and let them air dry, and I never had any problems with residual food or mold.  However after 6 months or so of use (not heavy, maybe used 3-5 times/per week, and I have 3 pouches) all of the pouches have started to leak at the zipper closure corners.  I've tried closing extra tight, but they all leak and have created several big messes in my car and bag.  While I understand these things don't last forever, I'm a little disappointed.  It seems like a product flaw when they start leak at the zipper, as opposed to wear and tear (they do not look worn or have any holes or scratches).  I'm tossing these and trying another brand.  This time I'm going with ReSqueeze, also available on Amazon.
