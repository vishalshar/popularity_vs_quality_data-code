These are super cute and make a nice gift set, but I was unimpressed....the terry cloth that Skip Hop has chosen to use is extremely rough despite numerous washes, and the price is a bit high compared to other sets that are just as nice or nicer.  Honestly, the super cheap bath towels from Target and Babies R Us see more us in my house than this guy....maybe when my baby gets bigger and I worry less about sanding off a layer of her skin.
