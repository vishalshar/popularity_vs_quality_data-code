My 2 year old daughter loves this thermos so much. The problem is-it leaks really bad from the base of the straw and when you turn it upside down. I exchanged it for another one thinking that the leak would be fixed with the second one but I noticed the little instuctions that were inside the thermos that said it could leak. The Munchkin Dora straw sippy cups are much better because they don't leak at all. I kept this thermos only to put water in it for my daughter to drink. It does keep drinks cool a long time. I think when my daughter is 3 she will handle this thermos better.
