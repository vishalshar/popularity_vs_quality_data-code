I purchased this set when I had my second daughter. I have to say I loved it when I first saw it at the store since we just painted the nursery lilac. The colors matched perfectly and the bedding has a nice subtlety to it. Problem arises so soon as I washed them. I was shocked to see how much those bumper covers shrunk. I washed them in cold water on delicate slow setting and dried them on low heat for 40 minutes and they came out shrunk so much that I can barely screeze in the paddings. There's nothing on the care label states that the bedding needs to be cleaned other ways. It's very disappionting that this set only has a highend look but not the quality to go with the look, consider this is a $300 sheet set. So, if you like the look of this set and will try not to wash them ever, then this is for you. But if you have a normal baby who will make a mess from time to time then get something easier to clean perhaps cheaper too
