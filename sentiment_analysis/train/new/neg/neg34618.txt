So, we are new to cloth diapering and our son is two now. I wanted to cloth diaper from the beginning, but many people talked me out of it and it seemed overwhelming. Plus there was the issue with the poop--everyone says this is the most disgusting part. So, when I saw these diaper liners, I thought they would be a great solution. Plus, I love, love, love the OsoCozy pre-folds that we purchased, so I knew that it was a reputable brand. Anyway, they are on a roll like paper towels, this is a bit of a problem for us, because my son is very rascally and wants to grab them and unroll all of them. (That's more of a training and discipline issue on my part, but it still is a hassle.)I've used them a few times now, but honestly, now that I have been using cloth diapers for a few weeks now, the poop really isn't a problem, especially since toddler poop is more solid. We just flush it and it rarely sticks to the diapers. So I've stopped using the liners. It's almost easier without them for a toddler. It is a great idea, but I wonder if they would be better for a younger baby with more messy stools. They did seem a little wide for our shells, too.
