This cooler worked well when my baby was using Dr Browns 4oz bottles.  I would pack 2 4oz bottles and 2 small Medela pumping bottles.  However when I switched over to Dr Browns 8oz bottles the cooler is not large enough.  I don't see how 4 8oz bottles would fit in here; I can hardly get 2 of them in with my 2 small Medela pumping bottles.  I now need to look for a new cooler.
