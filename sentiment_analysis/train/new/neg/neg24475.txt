Pros: The material is very soft. The clasp isn't behind the head where it's difficult to reach so hair doesn't get caught. The animals are really cute and my daughter likes them.Cons: The first issue is a big one... Since the material is so soft, it does not stay stiff and the food-catching pocket does not actually catch any food. - the bib may as well not have the pocket at all. Plus, the top of the bib (near the animals' ears) is too narrow, so if the baby's head is at all turned when food falls, it lands on clothes, not the bib. This may not be an issue for smaller babies, but it is with a toddler. The clasp is also a bit hard to close.I had high hopes but was very disappointed. We still use them but I wouldn't buy them again nor would I recommend them to others.
