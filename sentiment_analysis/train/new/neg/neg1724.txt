Ok, I know I should have just listened to all the reviews saying this thing is a P.O.S. but I didn't...why? Because I had bought one for my first son in 2009 and it works just fine. I also liked that it will stay on all night in all modes but the flashing red light mode & the Kinderglow needed to have the button held down for 3 seconds to stay on all night (meaning if my kid pushes the button, it will return to 30 min. mode). Anyway, after buying one this week and having it turn out to be defective, I said ONE MORE SHOT and returned it for another one....this second one, SAME FLIPPING DEFECT!!!! They won't charge, straight from the box. The base glowed green right as I put the little man on, and I know from my one that WORKS that it should be red until it's charged. Left it on the base for 12 hrs anyway to make sure it was broken and sure enough, can't turn it on at all. Same thing on both of them this week.  I am soooooo through w/Mobi products it's not even funny.  I had a video monitor by them too which was also a piece of s***!!!  Kinderglow is in the mail and I'm hoping it doesn't disappoint like Mobi has. My little boy is patiently waiting for a working night light!!!
