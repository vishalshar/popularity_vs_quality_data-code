We purchased this diaper pail, like others, due to the price and the fact I could use regular bags.  It worked great for us until around the solid food/step 3 foods time.  Then, it went from being moderately stinky to toddler-poopy-diaper-significantly stinky.  I expected some smells to emit from this item, but I can smell my son's diapers from the stairs, and his room smells atrocious if I don't change the bag *every* day.  So much for saving money on garbage bags vs. refills.  Also, purchasing refills for the "odor neutralizing disk" is difficult, as they are hard to find.  I tried bleach, Febreez, a stick up, dryer sheet, Lysol spray, and even sprinkled carpet deodorizer in the bottom to no avail.  Additionally, the mechanism that "pinches" the bag shut falls apart often (springs come off), and will get stuck open once you have about 6 diapers in there due to the weight of the bag, and my toddler has figured out how to open it. (and you know the rest...)Conclusion:  an inexpensive alternative diaper pail, but is *NOT* odor free.  Spend the money on the diaper dekor plus, as you will want to once your little one becomes a toddler.
