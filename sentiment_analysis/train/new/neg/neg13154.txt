This was a gift to my one year old who likes banging on things. It is great, like all other Baby Einstein toys we have bought. Solidly crafted, colorful and engaging. It has three different modes and three different languages (English, Spanish and French)My real criticism of the toy is that the volume of the "drum" being pressed is drown out by the sound of pressing down on the plastic. It sounds like you're banging on plastic. The fake drum sounds are very very quiet. Maybe we got a defective one, but even after a couple of weeks of playing with it and trying new batteries the drum sounds are still very faint.
