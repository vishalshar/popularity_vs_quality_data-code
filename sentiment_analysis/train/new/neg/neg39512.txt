We bought this anticipating my husbands on-call performances at night time with our second child (my first was up every 2 - 3 hours for a few months and Daddy got the midnight slot).  However, as I am breastfeeding and occassionally pumping milk I thought we would use it for sure, once in a blue moon it turns out whenever I am leaving baby with Daddy and an expressed bottle of milk (which he can easily leave out for an hour before as its breastmilk/room temperature!) Our wee one only gets up once a night at 3am so I may as well do it and sleep later into the morning, we're all up at 6am anyway!So, to conclude, not a necessary item for US and hardly used, perhaps formula feeding and more demanding babies would use it - as a shower gift it would be fine but don't bother spending extra yourself.
