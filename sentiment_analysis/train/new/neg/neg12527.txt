I bought this bag because of its looks, but its functionality is AWFUL! It has very little room in the middle of the bag, and the outside pockets are not practical. You can barely fit anything in the zippered pockets either. My keys wouldn't fit, but I was able to throw in some chap stick... On top of the space issues I was having, it is also poorly made. The little strap that holds the excess shoulder strap length after you buckle it came out before I was even able to use the bag (before baby was even born). Without that piece, the strap will not stay buckled well. Thankfully Amazon too the defective bag back without much fuss. I would not recommend this bag at all, especially if you plan to be out for more than two hours at a time with baby. I ended up getting the timi & leslie Abby bag. It has a ton more room and also looks like a purse. Also it is made with much better quality. Only thing is, you DO get what you pay for. my abby bag was $125 from zappos.com
