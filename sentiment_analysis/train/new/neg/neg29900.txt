I will give it only 3 stars because of the gasket model lid and not enough room for using even a baby spoon to scoop out. The base is narrower than the mouth making the container to not stay, particularly when a spoon is put in. The boxes are also just little over 2 oz. Though my baby is not a big eater, I still feel like sometimes little more than 2 oz is required to be fed. As the food expands in the freezer, the lids pop open even for a just bit over than 2 oz. I prefer Sage spoonfuls plastic containers because of the size, screw little and the wide mouth & base. That allows me to mix in a spoon of oats cereal with the 2 oz of apple pur√©e and feed comfortably.
