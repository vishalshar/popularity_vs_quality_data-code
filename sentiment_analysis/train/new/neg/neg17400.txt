I kind of expected this growth chart to be painted on the wood, not necessarily by hand, but still painted.  Instead, it appears to essentially be a printed decal that is overlaid on the wood and finished with a clear coat.  The effect is that the surface is totally smooth - no texture of paint or anything - and there is some visible pixelation to the design.  It is still beautiful, and when it's hanging on the wall, you don't notice the pixelation unless you get up close to do a measurement.  But for the price, I expected something a little more "crafted".
