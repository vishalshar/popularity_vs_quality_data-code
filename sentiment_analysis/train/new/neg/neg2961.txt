The amount of lint created during the first wash was absolutely insane. Everything else in the load was covered in white fuzz, and my dryer's lint drawer literally overflowed with lint. Even after that, the towel would leave little bits of white lint on my baby's skin. After the second wash, they are done creating lint but they have become incredibly thin and are no longer soft. Considering how much lint came out, I'm shocked there's any fabric left at all to be honest.
