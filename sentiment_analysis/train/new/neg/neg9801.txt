This bag holds a lot, and I like the outside pockets, side access, and the secret inside pocket, but it just is not practical to attach to the Ergo when you have a large child and a full bag. I bought this bag to use while traveling with my 18 month old daughter from Japan to Florida, and it was just too hard to get her and the bag on by myself. Once on, it was okay (heavy, though), but it was such a hassle to get on, and you'd think Ergo would have made a better way to attach it. That said, I do like it as a backpack, and it hangs nicely over the stroller handles as well. My only other complaint is that one of the zippers came off the track, when I never pulled hard or seriously mishandled it. I will try and see if Ergo will fix or replace it when I go back Stateside again.
