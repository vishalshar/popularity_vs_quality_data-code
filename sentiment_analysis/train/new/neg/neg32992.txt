It looks very simple and good, as on the picture. The sting is long but  you can make it shorter. My son liked it. However, he was able to chew pieces out of the wood after 1 hour of chewing/biting. He was able to spits them out, but for a smaller child this will be a choking hazard. This is ridiculous!
