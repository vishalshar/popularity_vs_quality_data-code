This one is definitely not as good as the one we bought two years ago. First of all the thing leaks like crazy! As soon as you put the water in, it leaks out. We have to literally refill it twice a day and keep paper towels underneath. Also the lid came apart after two uses. I would've returned it but didn't want to deal with the hassle because we needed something right away since our old one went out. Overall it warms the bottles. Very disappointed.
