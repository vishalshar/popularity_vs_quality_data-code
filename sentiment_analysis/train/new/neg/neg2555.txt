This is a great mirror with excellent visibility for your infant's rear-facing car seat  As other reviewers have said, it also has a very simple and effective attachment system, particularly if your seat has a headrest.However, you should note the obvious before buying it: the giant animal head will significantly reduce your visibility through your car's read window if you attach it in the center seat.  I drive a Prius which has fairly limited visibility through the rear window to start; with this monster installed on the center headrest, I can't see out the back very well at all.I'm strongly considering decapitating my dog-themed model, but I should probably think about the potential psychological impact that this might have on my infant first...
