I reviewed TONS of baby pillows prior to purchasing this one.  Boy did I make a bad decision!  Primarily I wanted to buy a pillow for nursing, and I thought this one had added benefits of multiple uses (with the removable wedge and roll) and the price.  I brought this to the hospital for my first breastfeeding session with my newborn, and it was absolutely terrible!  The pillow is too overstuffed and awkward to position.  If you want this pillow for nursing, look elsewhere (since then I have bought both the Brestfriend and Boppy -- LOVED the breastfriend for nursing, and the Boppy is good for tummy time & sitting up, good for BFing but not as good as Brestfriend).However this pillow is good to use with the wedge and support your little one sitting up.  However I'd rather have the Boppy for that -- more uses and better looking, although pricier.I guess for these products, you really do get what you pay for.
