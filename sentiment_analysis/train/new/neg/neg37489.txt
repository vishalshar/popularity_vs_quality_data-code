Before purchasing this product, I had 2 other changing table covers in light green.  They hide lint and what not much better.  The dark navy always looks linty and therefore dirty.  But otherwise it's soft and pretty and matches the look I'm going for.  I would probably just have chosen beige instead of navy blue for this particular item.
