Don't waste time or money purchasing this product.  You do get what you paY for!!! I'm in the process of returning because the quality is terrible, poor design, and cheap!My husband and I finally had a chance to used this product now that our son can sit on his own....oh boy, what a disappointment!! We spent a lot of time reading the instructions and just got frustrated because it was not help.  This product is extremely unsafe to use PERIOD!! Our son hated being in it because it doesn't secure him nor is it comfortable..the material feel like rough sand paper.Now, we're waiting to see if we can return it since the "return period" is over....DON'T WASTE TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!
