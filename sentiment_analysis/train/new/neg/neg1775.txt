When I opened the box for this item I almost thought they had shipped me the wrong bag. First of all the color is much much darker than the cute pastel blue/pink shown in the product image. Second, the stitching in the front between the two colors was so awfully executed I wanted to rip it out. It's also much smaller than most standard diaper bags. I bought it after checking out my local stores and not finding one that I liked and having had good experiences buying online based on customer reviews, I thought I was gonna get a better deal and product online, plus it's from Gerber. For the same price you can get a much better product elsewhere. I buy products on amazon on a regular basis and this is the first time I felt compelled to write something, so think twice before buying this bag.
