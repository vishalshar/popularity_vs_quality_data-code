I ordered these in hopes of finding a decent waterproof bib, since my baby is drooling profusely from teething. That part was very questionable. The horror comes today when I notice that the sharp edge on the Velcro's hook side had cut, yes cut, my baby's nape. He had a bad scratch with blood coming out. You may only imagine how upset this made me. I contacted Amazon to return the item, and they were very responsive and addressed my issue immediately. Thank you Amazon... Green Sprouts - not so much.P.S. I have added a photo of the cut to the image gallery
