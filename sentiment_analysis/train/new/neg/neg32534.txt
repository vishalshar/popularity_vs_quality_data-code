The painted stitches were not all there, like 3 feet had it and one didn't? Also there was a paint smudge? on the back of the elephant. It is for my 3 month old niece for Christmas, so I didn't have time to return it for a replacement, but it wasn't that bad. Otherwise it arrived on time, in great condition, and it was truly really cute. My sister loved it when she opened it.
