We bought two of these gates because of the foot-operated (no-handed) release and  the attractive design.  The gate comes with an assortment of extenders to enable it to work in a wide range of openings.  That's the good.  The bad is that the instructions are not very clear and over-complicate assembly by failing to illustrate and identify parts called out by arbitrary name.  The actual installation is easy.The main problem with these gates is the construction of the footlatch. Out of the box it feels a bit stiff but works ok, You have to push down with your foot, remove your foot, then swing open the door. But after a few days, instead of breaking in, it gets more & more difficult to press until finally the latch stops working entirely.  Seems like there's a lot of plastic in there that just isn't up to the task.  Like I said, we bought two of these, and returned both after a few days.  Hats off to Amazon for a smooth return process.  Our search for a reliable gate continues...
