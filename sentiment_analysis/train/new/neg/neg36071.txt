We purchased the Inglesina Swift instead of a larger stroller, because of storage space constraints. I've been very happy with the purchase. The stroller has served us well even when our baby was only a few weeks old. It is more solid and adaptable than a regular umbrella stroller; the reclining back is useful for tiny babies with no head control. For babies that young, I recommend using the stroller in combination with the Boppy Noggin Nest Boppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels. It rolls smoothly, even over rough ground, and turns as well as much more expensive strollers. You can steer with one hand. My 6 foot husband likes that the handles are higher than other strollers. I don't find them too high for me, even though I am just slightly over 5 feet tall.I gave this item 3 stars instead of 5 because the opening and closing of the stroller, as well as the reclining, feel clumsy and can't be operated with one hand. For the price, I think that this is a worthwhile trade off for the otherwise overall quality of the stroller.
