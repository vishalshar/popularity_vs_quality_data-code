I just got this machine today. The whisk has a different shape than the one in the commercial video. The pitcher sits on the machine unevenly until I added water into it. I tried 8 oz of water first + 4 scoops of Comforts stage 2 formula for toddler. I was even more careful & measured the water before adding it to the machine & compared with the machine water level. The machine reheated milk & the pitcher spins but water & formula inside didn't mix like what you can see in the advertising video. while boiling the water, some milk spilled out a little bit. I wonder how it can hold 16 oz as advertised.After the machine beeped & stopped, formula was mixed only half! The milk is VERY HOT as the water is boiled.I poured the half mixed milk out & washed the pitcher & cleaned the whisk, dried them & tried the 2nd time. This time I tried 4oz of water. But the machine just beeped & didn't work. I pressed the ON/OFF button again but it didn't work. I think it's because the pitcher is still a little warm! But that doesn't make sense if I want to make a lot of milk & save in refrigerator for night time.Any way, I give this machine 3 stars because I am not sure if I got a lemon or not as it worked for some people. But I will return it & won't think about it any more.Good luck if you buy this machine!
