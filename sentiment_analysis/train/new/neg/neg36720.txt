These storage boxes are great. Not only do they keep all of our toys off the floor, but they look good doing it. They are sturdy, even after being stacked together and are good quality. Very easy to put together. We got two reds and two blues and swapped the colorful stickers (that go over the screws) to make them more exciting. The kids love them and both can reach in to get the toys no problem (3 and 5 years old).Edit: We originally gave these 5 stars, because they are functional and cute. But the paint seems to react with the material in a lot of our toys. Balls, stuffed animals, random other things, they all stick to paint, which comes off on the toys, leaving them sticky and gross. This doesn't happen with other surfaces in the house that the toys are in contact with, so it's clearly a defect with the paint used in these...
