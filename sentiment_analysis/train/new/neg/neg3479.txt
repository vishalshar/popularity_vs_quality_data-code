I bought and tried this one out as well as the squeasy snacker. I definitely prefer the squeasy snacker!The lid on this one isn't great and is only attached by a string. It's hard to squeeze the food out and a lot gets left behind. It also has free flow so it can make a mess with smaller kids (tho my 3yo so far hasn't made a mess) it also seems harder to clean.Overall I would recommend checking out the squeasy snacker as it has a better lid, no drip piece, is easier to clean out, and it's easier to squeeze out all the food
