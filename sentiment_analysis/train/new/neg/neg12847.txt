I bought this specifically because I thought that it had ties. We all know that a toddler that is protesting meal time can rip off velcro bibs. Another flaw is that the pocket at the bottom is tacked shut in the middle. Since stuff drops from the mouth, you know, in the center of the kid's body, it just ends up in the lap. Thank goodness this thing is so long it ends up catching most stuff anyway, just not in the pocket like it's supposed to. You have to be creative with the clean up to prevent it all from falling on the kid's pants, in the chair and on the floor. At the end of the day, it pretty much does the job, it's a cute print and its super easy to clean. Not my favorite bib.
