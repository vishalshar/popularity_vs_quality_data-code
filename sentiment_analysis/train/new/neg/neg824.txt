These things look great at first, but they are so horrible.We needed something that would stretch over 85", and 2 of these connected together do work. but since it will only compress about 2 feet, you will have a hard time swinging it open. If your baby tries grabbing the fence and you open it, you will pinch their fingers. One handed opening is possible, but since the fence does not support its own weight it will fall making closing it again a pain. The nice stain gets scratched by opening and closing it. Within a month it looked several years old.It should be easy to remove it, but the mechanism makes it very time consuming to get the top and bottom lined up to slide in. We normally need to slide in the top, connect the other side, go back and carefully disconnect the top and try connecting both top and bottom at the same time. 2 people help get this done much faster.I suppose if you never open and close it this would work great, and stay looking good. But using it every day is not a good idea.
