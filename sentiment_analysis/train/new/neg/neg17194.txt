Simple idea fraught with clearance issues. The bars are too wide and the screws too thick to fit my fireplace door despite having the correct lateral measurements and requisite handle gap. I could not make this fit, even with smaller screws from my personal stash.I plan on keeping this and modifying it.I would recommend a design change - moveable 1/16" thick tabs on the top bar, tapped to accept screws thru the bottom bar from the front. Tabs go thru the handles.Not sure what I'm going to do with these. Maybe buy new door handles, because this won't work out of the box.
