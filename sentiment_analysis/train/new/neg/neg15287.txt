I bought this bag to replace another and I am glad I did. It is a good size bag without being too large, yet it fits a lot. All the small compartments makes it easy to keep everything organized and easy to find. It was a great buy!I've edited this because after 4-5 months of use the strap tore off and the inside lining unraveled. I expected to last at least a year before having to replace it.
