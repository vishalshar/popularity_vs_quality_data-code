I ordered this squeeze spoon to the my daughter started outside food at 5 months.pros:good for in house usethe liquid comes out easily and do not require much squeezingcomes with a lid so that the spoon do not  get dirtylight in weightcons:I mainly used fir soups and graves. when the soup was little thick, i had to squeeze more and that ended up spilling on my daughters face or the wall.The outlet near the spoon  head is very small .The bottle leaks when it turn upside down .the cap of the spoon bottle keeps revolving many times and docent lock wellit was difficult to clean the spoon head as the food particles used to stuck in it.i would recommend this only if u feeding pure gravy/soup/juice without any food particles in it and not very thick. remember to keep it upright else it will start leaking.
