Our daughter loves to play with these until we noticed that her chewing had resulted in moisture inside the ball and it was growing black mold. I'm not sure why it is necessary for these to have a hole because they become a breeding ground for bacteria and as we all know it's impossible to keep babies from chewing on things. Waste of money because now they are going straight in the trash!
