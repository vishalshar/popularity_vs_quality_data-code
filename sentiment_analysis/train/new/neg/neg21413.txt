Just got it today.  It didn't have any instructions and I had to go to the Storkcraft website to download them.  Assembly was easy and very quick.  However you get what you pay for....it's very inexpensive and that's exactly what you realize when you feel how thin ths shelves are.  To be fair, is this a decent changing table?  I have to say yes.  However, I wish I had just spent another $20 - $30 and got a bit better quality.  But,  this will get the job done.  Also, it looks off-white in the picture, but it's actually just a bright white.
