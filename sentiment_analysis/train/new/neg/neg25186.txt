Great pram let down by poor quality tyres. Verve was purchased in January and used with only one child in it, by March the left rear tyre was worn through and required replacement (along with a repair to the inner tube). The other tyre fared better and made it to April before wearing through and puncturing the inner tube. Either way that's two new tyres in four months.To the previous reviewer claiming people don't know how to look after wheels - I ride both bicycles and motorbikes, and check the tyre px on the Verve probably more regularly than the average punter should. Trust me, it's not a problem with how I look after the wheels. The reality is that the tyre tread is crappy quality, and to top it off the sidewalls of the tyres are very tough which renders replacing tyres a far tougher job than it should be.I love this pram and it's been great to use, but spending $60 on new tyres every 3-4 months is going to lose its novelty factor very quickly. P&T are generally ok at responding to user feedback - I hope they get this problem sorted out very quickly or there's going to be a mutiny with most Verve users...
