6 month old baby girl not as interested as expected.  The light up ball we received was not purple as pictured, but more navy blue - which is fine.  Others complained it is hard to get the lights going, I have not had that problem.  Simply shaking the toy will illuminate the lights, not just spinning.  The other spinner is pretty much a waste.  The piece inside rarely rotates as it is spinning.  Although this is not my baby's least favorite toy, it isn't one she readily reaches for as I had hoped.  I bought it as a tool to help her reach up and side to side and it really has not been very effective.
