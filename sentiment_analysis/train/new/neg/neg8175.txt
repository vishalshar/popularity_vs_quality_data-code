This review is written by a very capable person. I installed this thing to the letter. I turned it on and must agree with the other reviewers, the water pressure just isn't impressive. No way poops are coming off with this thing. I noticed immediately as I was testing it, the thing leaks profusely out of the sprayer hose. Everywhere on the hose it leaks. Now I have to uninstall and pack it up to send it back. What a hassle. NOT RECOMMENDED.
