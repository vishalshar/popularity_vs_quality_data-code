So, the product description does say it's 31in, but the image just looks deceiving.  This mat is pretty darn small, I mean only a newborn is going to find this mat roomy and they don't stay that small for very long.Pros:- Cute- Soft- Seems well madeCons:- Too small for what I was hoping to get- Too pricy- Not very paddedBasically, the section (pasted below) of the description is just not accurate."These large mats make an ideal floor cushion for baby and is a cute and convenient way to protect baby from the floor.  The 31 inch mat provides plenty of cushy comfort while baby naps or plays." Overall, I do use it, but it probably won't work much longer.  I'm glad I bought it discounted.
