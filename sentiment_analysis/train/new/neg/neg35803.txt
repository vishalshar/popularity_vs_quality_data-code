I thought I had an average sized spout.. this duck proved me wrong. I actually measured it before purchasing and figured my spout might have been a little small. Figured if the product was bigger it really wouldn't be much of a problem. As soon as I got the product I tried it on. Ended up being a very TIGHT fit. I had to literally hit the duck so it would go in all the way and even then not all the way. My problem would be that I have to take off the product in order to pull the little lever on top so the water can come out from the shower head and not the spout. Considering what I have to do to get it in that's more of a hassle than anything. Only time I use the spout is for my daughter which means product has to be put in right before she takes a bath. I was hoping to just leave it on. The pros would be safety and look. It has good strong colors.
