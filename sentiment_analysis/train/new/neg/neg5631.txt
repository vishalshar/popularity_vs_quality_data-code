I used these labels 2 years ago to label my infant son's bottles for his caregiver. They were amazing. Each pack had a few sheets of every color, they were easy to peel off the paper and apply, and they stuck on strongly through refrigeration or freezing. When I was done, they peeled off the bottle or food container cleanly.I recently bought more labels to use on my new daughter's bottles. The labels themselves haven't changed but everything else has. The labels are now cut in a way that makes it darn near impossible to remove them from the paper backing. Each pack only contains one color. All I have are blue labels, which means I am no longer able to use different colors to identify which bottles are breastmilk and which are formula.I would rather pay $1 more and have the same labels I was able to buy 2 years ago than pay the same amount for such a headache of a product. I will be looking for a new product when I run out of my current set.
