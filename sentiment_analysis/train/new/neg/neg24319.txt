It's OK. The top was all warped when I received it, and the inserts inside don't go all the way to the top. Not sure if it's because of the warping or what. We have used it a little, and the sections inside are good sized. I do think that these are overpriced for a basic tupperware with a screened print on it. I wouldn't buy it again, but mainly due to the fit of the lid to the inside.
