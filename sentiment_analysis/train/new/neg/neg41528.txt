Although I can say nothing bad about my Bugaboo stroller or my Maxi Cosi car seat as separate products, these adapters are very difficult to use. You have to really align both sides of the carseat with the adapters perfectly or it won't engage. One side will click, but the other won't and then the whole carseat is insecure and crooked. Don't get me wrong, once its clicked in its great, it is just a good 45 seconds of angling and docking the thing before you get it. I thought I would figure out the trick to it after a little while, but it continues to be difficult after 5 months.  The wife feels the same. Also, NOTE: the Bugaboo stroller cannot fold when these adapters are attached. You can lower the handle of the stroller, but not collapse the chassis part unless you take the adapters off. Would have been nice to know this beforehand.
