I just wanted a reliable, sturdy, nice-looking gate. To make it blend with our furniture/decor the unsightly sticker at the bottom had to go. This gets 3 stars because it's the worst sticker I've every tried removing in my life. It's more industrial strength glue/residue than it is sticker. After a couple ounces of Goo Gone, ,a spackling knife, and a couple hours or my life wasted I ended up with a scratched up piece of garbage that looks worse than the sticker itself. Not what I was expecting for $100. At least give us a warning on this stuff. Next time I'll skip removing the sticker and just punch myself in the face.
