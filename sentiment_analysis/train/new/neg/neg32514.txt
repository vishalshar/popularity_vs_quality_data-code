This is ok for what I needed, the fit was fine, however after a few minutes of installing, my little 13 month old decided to take it off. She did. I made sure the Velcro was on correctly but that doesn't stop my little one. So I just put some duck tape over it to stay secure. She can't pull it off now, but the downside is now I don't have access to the buttons, guess I'll just use the remote.
