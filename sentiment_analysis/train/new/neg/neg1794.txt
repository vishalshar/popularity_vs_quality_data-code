I purchased the Beco Baby Gemini carrier in anticipation of carting around my daughter while enjoying the miracle of free hands. Since she has just reached the 17 month mark, it's worth noting that, when it was needed, it worked well. Here is a list of the pros and cons I've encountered with the product over the last year and a half:PROS:1. Versatility of the carrying style - front facing, inward facing, and backpack - made this a carrier whose usefulness extended well beyond one stage.2. When my daughter was smaller, it was comfortable enough for her that she would routinely fall asleep in it while being carried.3. FREE HANDS to do things around the house plus a happy baby - need I say more?CONS:1. There was a substantial learning curve in figuring out how all the buckles and fasteners worked every time we switched the way my daughter was being carried or when she grew (which was constantly).  Once the straps are adjusted and you've had some practice, you can set up baby by yourself, but you'll need help the first several times.2. It leaves imprints on the back of baby's legs despite how we adjusted and readjusted the straps. This just meant I was extra cautious in how long she was allowed to remain in the carrier.3. As baby gets older and more mobile, their tolerance of being stuck in the carrier (and probably any restraint) is severely limited (although this likely will vary largely according to baby's personality).  My daughter stopped tolerating it around eight months.  With the substantial investment this carrier required, I was a bit disappointed we weren't able to use it for a longer period of time.4. Wearing and being worn in the carrier is HOT work for all involved. Granted, this may well be the issue with carriers in general. It's just worth taking into account that you may both need a wardrobe adjustment before sticking this on - even in the middle of winter.
