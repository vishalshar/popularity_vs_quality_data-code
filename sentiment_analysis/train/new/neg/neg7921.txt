Although this chair looks as pictured, the material is thin and cheaply sewn together. Upon tearing the plastic away from the ottoman, the stitching was already pulling away from the seams and creating stretched out holes in the material. It appeared they used too large of a needle on this thin fabric. Almost every seam had large holes and stretching. I don't believe this will handle the regular use that it would get.  I had a previous Stork Craft brand that was almost half this price and the material even handled washing. I would have it still after 3 children but it was damaged in a move.
