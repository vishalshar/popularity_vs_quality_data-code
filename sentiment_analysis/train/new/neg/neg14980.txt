I ordered this crib because it was reasonable priced and got good reviews, and I liked the simple elegant style. I've heard of Graco and thought it was a good brand. It's not. The crib is actually manufactured in China by LaJobi Industries, and there is no quality assurance. All the reviews saying the crib arrived with damaged pieces? Not a fluke, but more like the default. Our crib arrived with two panels severely damaged (and there was a big gash in the shipping box, thanks Amazon). I've been repeatedly calling the customer service number provided and emailing for 3 days, but have yet to reach anyone at the manufacturer to send me replacements. After reading the other reviews I wonder if the replacements will arrive damaged too. I want to return the whole thing and get something by a different manufacturer, but we already assembled the matching changing table (which is fine, a little cheap looking). Guess I'll have to escalate it to Amazon to get anything done. Very unhappy.
