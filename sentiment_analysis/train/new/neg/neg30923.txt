The bank looks and feels high quality.  Except as soon as I took it out of the box the bow fell off.  It ties through a tiny wire loop, the the strings are not that long to attach.  I don't know, short of using tweezers, how to tie it back on.  So my daughter has a piggy bank with a wire hoop on its head instead of a bow.
