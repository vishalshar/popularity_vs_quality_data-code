I bought this for my daugther when she was around 10 months old.  She had begun playing in her crib when she woke up and any toy that would extend that playtime so I could enjoy a few more z's was good in my book.  Although the toy seems like it would be a lot of fun, it is held on the crib by velcro.  Does anyone see anything wrong with this?  When an active baby/toddler pulls on the toy to get it to make noise, it instantly comes off the crib rail and falls into the crib.  I was VERY disappointed as I instantly stopped putting it in her crib and now it just sits in her toybox.  A good idea for a toy but a waste of money with the current design.  I guess younger babies would not pull as hard on it, but what is the point if you can't get your use out of it?
