I requested the Baby Carrier Active as a gift because the lumbar support sounded so nice, and having used the Baby Carrier Original, I thought this would surely be at least as good and probably better.  The straps on the Active carrier do take some getting used to and are not as easy to adjust as those on the Original carrier.  My main problem with it is that due to the design of the shoulder straps, they can only be tightened so far.  I am 5'4" but fairly small-chested, and I cannot tighten the straps enough to get a really snug fit.  The result is that my 17-lb baby still falls forward a little bit, and my shoulders start hurting fairly quickly.  I enjoyed the very-adjustable and snug-fitting Original carrier more than this one, and am disappointed the Active carrier, especially knowing how much money was spent to buy it for me.  If you are a larger person, this might work well for you.  But if you are smaller, buy this somewhere that will let you try it on or take it back, or just go with the Original carrier.
