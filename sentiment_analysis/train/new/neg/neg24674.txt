My daughter was given the cow as a gift. We raise cows, so it was the perfect gift for her! We hung it off of her carseat so she could play with it on long trips, and she loved it! However, when she was 7 months old and was just starting to get old enough to enjoy the pull string on this toy, it BROKE. The first time she started playing with that feature!We took it apart to see if we could fix the problem. We got inside the mechanism that makes it vibrate when pulled. The string was only held onto it by a flimsy little piece of plastic, and that plastic broke! There's no way to fix it without replacing the part, but as I don't even know what the part would be called, that's out of the question.Very disappointing. It's an adorable product, but expect it to break early on . . . .
