I believe I chose the wrong size cup or menstrual cups are not for me. I leaked every 30 minutes,  luckily I wore a pad as well as it was my first cup and first use.Plus it was embarrassing to be gokng to the rest room so often. I thought I was doing something wrong or the cup didn't open well but each time I checked the cup was full.I really wanted it to work.
