We purchased this Graco seat for our second child after being very happy with another Graco infant seat for our first child over 6 years ago.  It is considerably larger - length, width, and weight than the previous SafeSeat styles.  Our baby fit in it well, but my husband and I both struggled with the weight of the combined baby and carseat by the time our son was 8 months old.  Because of this, we switched over to a convertible seat at 9 months, making the extra $$ we paid for the large size worthless.  Keep this in mind if you foresee carrying/transporting your baby around a lot.  This is a very heavy car seat.
