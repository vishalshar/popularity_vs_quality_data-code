The decal itself is cute and looks just like the listing.  It is an easy peel and stick that can be re-positioned, which is a big plus!  I was disappointed to find that it has a solid white background instead of clear, which would have blended into the wall much nicer.  That was my own mistake though for not reading the listing more closely.  Just be aware that it will stand out more on any wall that is not painted a very bright white.  Mine are an odd off white, so it just didn't quite work for me.  If a clear background variation were to be made, I would purchase it.
