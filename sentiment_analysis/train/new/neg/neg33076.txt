I really like the flexibility of these. They are lightweight, catch food and my daughter doesn't pull them off as she does with the baby bjorn ones.We had these in pink/purple but after my husband put them through the dishwasher they got tacky and weird bubbles so I decided to replace them. The green/turquoise ones stain really badly. Unfortunately we had pasta with tomato sauce for the first meal so one of them was ruined from day one. We've tried washing them several times with dish soap but they are very discolored.So advice - don't put them in the dishwasher and be prepared for them to look ugly after use.
