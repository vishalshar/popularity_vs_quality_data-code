The good:While I previously did not like the design of the Ameda flanges, I have come to love it. It works really well, and I am able to use it with relative ease with the pumping bra that I purchased. Simple Wishes Hands Free Tie Back Breastpump Bra - (XS - L). In my opinion, this pumping bra is what is needed for this product, as the last pumping bra that I had did not allow for this type of flange to be easily inserted.The larger-sized flange works especially well, without the inner inserted.The not good:I am not a fan of inserting the smaller flange size. I don't think it works as well, and it moves around too much. It just seems to not work as well as one piece does.These flanges are a little difficult to clean, and the valves and membranes wear out a lot more quickly than I'd like.
