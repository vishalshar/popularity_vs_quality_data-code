We have an early teether -- molar breaking skin at 3 months, so we're trying a lot of teethers right now. This one is perfectly ok, but not making the top of our list.The Good:1. This product is BPA free2. Soft material with texture3. Good size for easy baby grip4. Not bad about picking up blanket fuzz, etc.5. PriceThe not so good:1. You cannot boil or microwave to sanitize2. Not shaped well for easy molar chewing3. 3 month old son shows little interest in itBest teethers we've found so far: Como Tomo and Manhattan Toy Winkel (all three teethers pictured)In my experience, this teether rates about the same as the new Sophie the Giraffe teether (the safer one with the base and loops).
