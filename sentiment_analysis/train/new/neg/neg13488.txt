Good idea, but won't fold up & is more of a pain & source of frustration than it is helpful. I have car sun shades that fold this same way so I figured I would have no problem folding this up. But neither my husband nor I can fold it up. It seems that the frame is bent in several places, so that could be the problem. I thought the sides would stick out farther than they do. My 17 month old's arms have no problem dropping things over the side, which was one reason I bought this - in hopes of keeping more food on his tray. I will be returning this. Does not work the way I had hoped it would.
