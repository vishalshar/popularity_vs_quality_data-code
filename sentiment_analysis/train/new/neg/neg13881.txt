I originally ordered these to protect my child from dangerous chemicals, but was inside of an apartment where I couldn't add screws into the cabinets without a fine.Pros.They are not supposed to require screws.Cons:- The adhesive did not stick well.- My 13 month old girl was easily able to pull the cabinet open in spite of the "lock"- Once the adhesive has been torn, it is useless.- Wasted money, and doesn't include the keys in this set.
