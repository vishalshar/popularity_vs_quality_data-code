This was one of my baby's favorite toys until I found the outside ring cracked all the way through yesterday. I love that Haba makes toys that are wood AND colorful for the baby to look at but if it cracks after less than a month, this particular toy wasn't worth it. We have the triangles as well and we've had no problems with them. I considered purchasing again bc my baby loved it but I worry that it will crack while he's chewing on it and pinch him. My experience seems to be uncommon though, I still love Haba, I'd just recommend inspecting the toy each time you give it to your baby.
