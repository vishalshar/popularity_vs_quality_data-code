The pink is more of a peach color than pink. The quality isnt great for a gift, but it will pass for commemorating a baby's baptism. The box isnt quality either, cheap plastic. I would want to pay more than $10 for it, and even that seems too much for the quality. The seller I purchased from had the price fluctuating between $10-$30 which I thought was ridiculous.
