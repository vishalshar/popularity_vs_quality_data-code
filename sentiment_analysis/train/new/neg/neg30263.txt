We bought this for a Disney trip so we wouldn't have to carry around cups for my daughter. We only found one bottle that it actually fit and we had brought that with us. I was very disappointed.  It also doesn't have any value so once it's on the bottle must stay upright or it spills everywhere. Fun idea, but it didn't actually help us.
