I thought this was going to be the greatest invention ever. I just finished potty training my daughter, and have been repulsed by the dirty condition of public restrooms, so I purchased these. While the idea is fantastic, they don't always make the situation easier. First, the sticky tape on the bottom is really 2 tiny strips that have individual paper backings to pull off. By the time I get into my bag (which is usually placed on the floor by this time, or on my legs while I'm squatting down), pull out this item, open it up and find and tear off both of the sticky backings, my daughter has touched the toilet seat (or worse... the inside of the toilet) with her bare hands. But I still press on. The second main problem is that a lot of public restrooms have toilet seats that have a gap in the middle front. This makes it hard for the sticky part to stick, and the sticky area is fairly close to the front. If it's not centered just perfect, the sticky part does not make contact with the seat. Lastly, by the time all that effort has been put in and the paper seat is in place, when I place my daughter on the seat, sometimes it slides or the paper sticks in towards the toilet, and is really close to her crotch. This has resulted in her peeing on the paper area. Little kids' legs don't spread apart really when they're sitting on the pot, so if the paper is close, yep, the pee hits it.Now, even with all those negatives, there are times when the restroom is just so nasty that this time and effort is all worth it. But in general, I have found that it's not. It still gets 3 stars because of the pure fact that sometimes this is better than nothing. However, even though I carry these around with me in the diaper bag, I hardly ever use them anymore because something that should be a convenience is not really worth the time and effort.
