I bought this pump back in 2009 after I went back to work from my maternity leave.  I pumped every day for about 2-3 months before my milk finally dried up (my daughter was refusing to breastfeed).  Aside from a few minor issues with the pump, I liked it a lot.  The pump went into storage after that and I took it out 6 months ago after I had my second child.  I was at home for most of the past 6 months and used the pump rarely-usually no more than once a day, sometimes once every few days.  I went back to work a month ago and that's when the problems started.  First, I noticed a different sound when pumping, and then after 2 weeks of using the pump twice a day every day the pump broke.  After my husband took it apart, he discovered that a rubber band inside broke.  He replaced it with a hair band, which worked well for about a week and then that broke too.  We tried asking the company (warranty is only for a year) to at least sell us the tiny rubber band part so that I could keep using the pump but instead they replied we have to buy a new pump.  Needless to say, I am very upset.  I'm not sure what to do-should I buy this crappy pump again (it's been redesigned anyway) or should I stick it out with a manual. I really don't want to over spend for only a few more months of pumping.  I wanted to write this review to warn people-do not buy from this company or Ameda Purely Yours (esentially the same as old lansinoh version) if you're in the same situation as me and you'll need this pump to work for more than a few months-not worth it-go with a more expensive medela. If I could go back in time that's what I would have done.
