Piece of junk.  And that is being generous.  We originally bought one that lasted about two years, and then the charging port broke.  We were pretty rough on it so we figured it was our fault.  Bought another one because we needed a second camera.  Same problem as before however this time it only took 6 months to break.  Then dealing with Samsung to fix anything under warranty is next to impossible.  There is all sorts of issues with this thing, like the constant beeping or vibrating.  Not worth it.  We bought a $20 sound monitor and its 10 times better than this thing.
