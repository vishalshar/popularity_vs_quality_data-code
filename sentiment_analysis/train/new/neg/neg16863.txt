We bought this mobile for two reasons:  One, my wife likes the Peanuts.  And two, it was the PERFECT look for our nursery.  Unfortunately, it's a little too cheaply made for our tastes and we didn't realize the music requires winding it.  The winding process is long and annoying and the music is a bit tinny.  We've decided to return it and replace it with a much uglier, but more functional one.
