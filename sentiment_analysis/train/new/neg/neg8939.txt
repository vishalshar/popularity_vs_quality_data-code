I read previous reviews and I'd have to agree with them.  You can't put alot of water in the bathtub or this thing will float right up.  The suction cups won't stick to the bathtub in the house we're living in now so here's to hoping it'll work in our new home come Spring.  If you want something that stays put I'd keep looking but otherwise if you only use about an inch or two of water like we do then you'll be ok with this one.
