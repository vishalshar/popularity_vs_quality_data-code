I spent weeks researching seats and the worst reviews I found about this model were complaints that it doesn't fit on a shopping cart. I figured, for the savings, I could live without that feature. But only after I got my seat and put it in my car did I realize that the front doesn't lock into place - HOW IS THAT SAFE??? Also, in our cars without the latch system it is nearly impossible to get the base in securely. With the Latch it isn't so bad. But that means my husbands and mothers cars are basically accidents waiting to happen. Now I get to start over and go through the lovely process of returning it. NOT HAPPY!
