we are really disappointed in this stroller. After reading all the rave reviews we were looking forward to using it. It is very difficult to steer and push - even on flat even surfaces like the sidewalk, mall, or airport. Making turns is very difficult, and pushing it with one hand is impossible.  You can not talk on the phone, grab your wallet, hold your child in one hand or do anything with your hands while pushing the stroller. Not even in a straight line for two feet for example at the cash register while pulling out your wallet. I took it on a trip by plane and this stroller made the trip extremely difficult, I ended up using a baby carrier instead most of the time. also, you cannot hang a purse or bag on the handles- once the child gets out of the stroller it tips over. My tall 2 year old has now where to rest his feet and doesn't seem comfortable in the stroller, and the safety straps are a huge pain to put on. We now have the baby jogger city mini and we all love it. steering, folding, storing items in the basket, everything is a breeze.
