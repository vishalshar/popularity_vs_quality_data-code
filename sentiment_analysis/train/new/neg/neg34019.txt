I don't love this bib - but not because it doesn't work.  It certainly catches food/liquids without difficulty and I haven't had problems keeping it clean.  I use a stiff dish brush with soap to scrub the front and back after meals and hang or lay it out to dry.  We've had it for several months and it is in great condition.  What I don't like is the snap configuration for the pocket.  Because I take it apart to lay flat for cleaning and drying, I always have to re-snap it for meal time.  It isn't rocket science, but neither is it a simple snap and go.  In fact, my husband will use just about any other bib before grabbing this one just because of the snaps.  I don't think it's quite that bad, but I do like it to dry completely to prevent mold that others have talked about.So - it works!  It's long enough for my messy toddler and does what it is supposed to do.  It's just a pain in the neck to put together each and every time we eat.
