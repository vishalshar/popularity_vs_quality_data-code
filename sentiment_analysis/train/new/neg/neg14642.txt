This warmer works wonderfully with AVENT bottles.  It fits exactly in the warmer.  The warmer is easy to use.  Once about 2 months of constant usage you will need to descale the warmer in which the warmer will blink all the lights.  If someone didn't read the instructions it would be pretty easy to get frustrated and think that is is broken.  If you have another set of bottles like us with the Lifefactory glass bottles; they don't exactly fit.  You can't cover the lid with these bottles.We also have a Dr. Brown warmer and my wife prefers the Dr. Browner warmer.  But the Dr. Brown's warmer has water reservoir which is convenient when you unlike the Philips which you have to refill each time!  I have a forgetful wife and sometimes she warms the bottle without any water.Also with Philips warmer you set the amount of liquid to go and the origins of the liquid (room temperature, the refrigerator, the freezer).  The Dr. Brown you only  set the time.  For my wife the simpler the better.
