I got this chair for free. Thank goodness I didn't pay anything for it because it is not worth the cost. I only have the chair part and not the mobile which I wouldn't have used anyways. The chair itself looks as though it would be comfy but there is no other movement like rocking or bouncing. It has vibrate and melody settings that are totally useless for my infant son. He could care less. The only thing this chair is good for is literally for sitting him in it when he is in a good mood. So, for now, it's useful but I would not recommend buying this chair if you need something that will actually aid you in entertaining and soothing your infant. FP has much better products out there.
