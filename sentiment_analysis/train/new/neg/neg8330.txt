I really can't blame anyone, but myself. I bought a $15 high chair. I purchased it for Grandma to use who watches our daughter one day a week. She called me that day and asked, "Have you used this yet?" I told her, "No" and she said it didn't seem very safe. Funny, the brand is "Safety 1st." We'll be returning this item as a friend gave us their old high chair for Grandma to use.Again, just know you aren't paying very much for this, so don't expect a lot!
