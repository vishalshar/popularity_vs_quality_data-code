Looks sharp so it gets 2 stars, but wood was cheap and already splintering a bit when it was delivered. Additionally, one of the screw fittings in the frame was damaged and wouldn't thread. Feels like something from Ikea. Called the company and they were very defensive and recommended taking pictures and they would determine if it was there fault or not. 400 dollars for a bassinet, one would expect a little better quality and customer service.
