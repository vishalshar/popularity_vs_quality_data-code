My son just never cared for this. He found the vibration frightening and the size of this thing off-putting. As a test, I gnawed on it for a few moments after he kept refusing it and crying, and I found it an unwieldy size for my own mouth. I don't wan to give it a negative review as I'm sure some children would really find this stimulating and relaxing, but it did not work for him. It does seem like it's solidly constructed however.
