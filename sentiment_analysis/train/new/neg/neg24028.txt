We use our monitor primarily at night. During naptime we are on the same floor as the children so we do not use the monitor. My experience with this product is limited to the nighttime use. That said, I ended up discontinuing use of this product after a few days. One night our daughter woke up and cried for an unknown number of minutes before we were able to notice. Another night I actually shut the unit off and slept on the couch outside her room.This monitor has a great deal of "white noise". It produces so much white noise that there is very little difference between the sound you hear when it is properly tuned in and the "static noise" you hear when the base is off. We actually like a little white noise at night so normally this wouldn't matter. Howeever, the white noise masks the audio coming from the room as well, which means that you have to keep the volume up very high to overcompensate for the noise.The audible range seems to be very sensitive to ambient noise, but strangely the sounds you want to hear (baby crying, perhaps) are somewhat muted. We were able to hear heat rushing through the heating duct with this monitor, despite the microphone being on the other side of the room from the vent. However, the sound of the kid stirring in bed or crying was quiet in comparison to the ambient and white noise. So, again, you have to keep the volume up very high to hear what's really going on.By far my biggest gripe with this product is the static it picks up. Most devices pick up noise, but this is by far the most sensitive device I have ever owned. Very short bits of static would interrupt our whole night. This problem is exasperated by the fact that, due to other flaws in the product, we ended up keeping the volume up very high.This product cannot be recommended. I have had much better success with cheaper models. I'd rather drill a hole through the house directly to baby's room than use this product.
