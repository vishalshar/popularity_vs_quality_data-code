I bought it for my second baby and choose it because my older son, who is 4 yo, wanted to help in the bath time of his little brother so I thought the indicator light on this thermometer would be awesome. It was wonderful, but JUST WORKED FOR 7 WEEKS! My husband changed the batteries but nothing. I opened it thinking maybe the water run into it, but NO, just stop working. I definitely no recommend it, it's a shame because was awesome while it last. Now I have to look for another one, different.
