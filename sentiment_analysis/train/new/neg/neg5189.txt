I had a couple of the Munchkin brand formula/snack containers, which worked okay.  I had a hard time fitting in a full 8 oz. worth (4 scoops) of formula in each of the dividers - I usually have to tap it on the counter to get it to settle, so I could add the additional scoops.  Also, the dividers are fixed in the container.With these, problem solved!  The divided sections hold 9 oz. worth of formula (standard for the UK), so I can easily fit 8 oz. worth of formula in each section.  Also, the divided section comes out so you can use the container for a single type of snack, or keep the divider in to have different snacks.  They are a slight bit larger than the Munchkin brand, but I prefer these because they hold more and are more versatile.Review edited 4/16/11 - while I like that the dividers could be removed to hold a single variety snack, I found that the divider is sometimes difficult to remove.  It seems to get lodged in the container, even when inserted properly.  If you are using the container with the divider for formula, the lid does not easily rotate to a new, full chamber.  You almost need to remove the lid and replace the opening over the full chamber; not very convenient.  The opening is oddly shaped, and you have to really wiggle, shake, and tap the container to get all the formula out.  I think I'm going to go back to the Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary.  The only real issue I had with them is that the chambers were designed for 8 oz. formula servings, so you have to tap it on the counter to get the last scoop in each chamber.  But the lid rotates easily and locks into place over each chamber and the opening is large enough that formula and snacks come out easily.  Sure, the divider doesn't remove, but in the end, I really didn't find that feature useful enough in the Avent product to outweigh the other issues I had with it.
