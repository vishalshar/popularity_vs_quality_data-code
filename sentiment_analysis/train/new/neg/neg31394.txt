Smell is really strong and had to wash and boil a couple of times before it was somewhat gone. Only used for a little while til my baby finally latched on completely to get full. Fitted perfectly on enfamil 2oz ready to feed bottles and also fitted perfectly on all medela bottles. I used medeal for pumping and storage. Great product with exception of the smell when you first open it.
