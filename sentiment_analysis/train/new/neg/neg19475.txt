Considering the price maybe I was expecting too much about the product, but although it do change the voice, the quality of materials and the quality of sound are not quite good.To use the voice changer you must keep pressed the trigger (a difficult thing for younger kids) and besides you have to put your mouth almost in contact to the microphone because if you speak a little away from the microphone, it doesn't work.
