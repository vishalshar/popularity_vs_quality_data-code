I purchased this set for my girls room. They are 3 and 4 and I just re did their room with the tinkerbell/disney fairies theme. My oldest has a twin, and I was able to find something really cute and warm for her bed at Walmart, but my younger has a toddler bed and this was the only thing I could ship to Canada that was tinkerbell theme and wasn't tacky like some I've seen.  I thought it was worth it for the price I paid, even though I had to pay $30 just to ship it here, just to complete there room. But it was definitely for a steep price, and when I received it I was quite disappointed almost imediately upon seeing how small the packaging was. It's very pretty and the colours are true to the picture, but it is so thin and not very soft material. I had to use a blanket or two underneath to keep her warm enough. I don't care much for the flat sheet either. My girls still love it and it does complete there room. I couldn't have gotten anything better, being here in Canada, we don't have the same selection as in the U.S. and only some U.S. retailers will ship to Canada. I only found one option in Canada for a toddler bed with that theme. Overall, I felt I paid too much for this item, especially given the shipping I had to pay and the quality of the product, but I'm still happy with the purchase becuase of the overall look I was able to acheive with this bedding.
