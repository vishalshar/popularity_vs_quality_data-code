I bought this so that we could watch two cameras at the same time.  Unforunately, after using an Infant Optics unit for the past 18 months, the video quality on this unit is just absolutely unacceptable.  My other monitor isn't HD or anything, but this monitor is really pixelated, especially at night.Also, forget about using the temperature sensor- we bought two cameras and placed them in the same room to test them out.  I have one of those little wireless weather stations so I compared the results- per the wireless weather station, the room was 75 degrees.  According to camera #1, the temperature was 68 degrees, and according to camera #2 it was 82 degrees (and they were sitting side by side!).  Just useless.
