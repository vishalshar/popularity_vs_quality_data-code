If you are a Montessori teacher you will not be able to do the magical presentation were you place inset onto the traces shape and fully hide the first tracing because there is way to much space between the inset and the outer form,  badly engineered. Also. the measurements of the shapes do not allow for some of the classic extensions and variations.I am very disappointed and am going to buy a used metal set instead.  Very poor craftsmen
