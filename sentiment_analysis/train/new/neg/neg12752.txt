Caused more stress than it alleviated constant false alarms. Tried and tried to fit this, but my daughter was too wiggly from birth for it. She would roll onto her side within days of coming home from hospital, causing the alarm to go off. We lost a lot off sleep using this. Best wishes to all parents, especially preemie parents.
