The bad: The bedding set arrived without the set of crib bumpers.  The complete sheet was substitued instead.  The set that arrived included the quilt, skirt and 2 sheets (solid and complete sheet).  That ended up being OK for me - because I had wanted the complete sheet as well and had ordered it separately.  But - the pricing on these items separately is about $40 different.  And when I went on line to confirm that the bumper was supposed to be included in this set that I ordered, I noticed that the cost of the set was now $40 lower than what I had paid, even though it still said that the bumper was included.  The good:  I immediately called Amazon and they credited my credit card account with $40.  I will also be returning the separate complete sheet that I ordered - no issues with that.  And - the set is very cute.  My granddaughter loves the soft quilt.  The bumpers would have been nice, but we don't really need them, especially with that complete sheet.
