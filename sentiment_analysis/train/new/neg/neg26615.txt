We bought this for travel only. It is great for travel, but I wouldn't use it at home.PROSIt folds up flat. Good for car travel, stores small in the hotel. It's just big enough that I'd think twice before bringing it with me on the airplane, especially since they charge per bag now. It would take up too much space and would be too heavy.Once folded, you can invert it in the bathtub and let the insides drip. A latch holds it shut and it can stand upside down or right side up.CONSSmall and narrow. Older babies would run out of space quickly.Edges are angular and hard.Latch hangs loose while baby is bathing. It is again hard and sharp, and also tempting for babies to try to twist and break off.Plug is impossible to use. Once I manage to pull it up, I can't put it back in. Water also does not drain while baby is sitting in the tub. Instead of using the plug, I ended up bailing out the water with a cup and flipping the thing over when we were done.All in all, this is a tub with a very specific purpose. If you are looking for a flat, foldable bathtub to bring with you on long car trips so you don't have the use the yucky hotel tub, this is a good tub. It should be used with babies who can sit up with confidence as there is nothing to lean against and the edges are hard.But if you are looking for a home tub, I don't think this is a good choice. We ended up with a $7 tub from a Scandinavian furniture store that shall not be named. It doesn't have a plug so I just bail water out with a cup, but it was cheap, just the right size, has smooth edges, and when we are done with this stage in bathing, I won't feel bad at all throwing it out or repurposing it.
