do not waste your money!!! i have wanted to write a review for many months now but amazon reviews have not been my top priority lately with my little guy running around, anyway this bag was such a waste of money!! i was sooo excited about it! its cute and the color is great i loved it when i got it. it came with a bag for diapers and a container for a bottle and the mini matching purse was cute even though half my cards and things didnt fit in it. after about a month one zipper broke. after that 2 more soon broke and the lining started coming off so every time i reached in to get something the fallen off sticky liner came with it. i would understand if i used this bag every day but i didnt! i actually dont use it that often! i ended up having a babysitter come to the house so didn't need to take a diaper bag out everyday. sooo disappointed!! and it wasnt cheap either!!!!! i would NOT recommend this bag to anyone!!! the only reason i am writing the review now is i thought i would give it another chance, figured maybe i overreacted when i threw it in the closet months ago but nope!! SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!!
