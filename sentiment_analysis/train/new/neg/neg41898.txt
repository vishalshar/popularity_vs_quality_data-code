I was looking for more bottle caps, but couldn't find any for sale that weren't expensive add-ons to breast pump accessories. These did an OK job. I had to screw the nipple in (inverted) to get a good seal. I didn't like using these to shake formula, but it made a decent set for packing bottles-on-the-go, but then you had to keep track of the little disk floating around. After a while, I stopped using the disks and just used rings, which worked just fine.In fact, they're even more durable than the rings that came with the glass bottles, so they got a star for that.
