Waste of money. The bib is so hard that it feels like a carpet. When mine arrived I threw it straight into the trash can. Making my baby wear this terrible item would've caused a neck rash  - like rubbing a mat again his throat. Don't waste your money on this item. This bib is so hard that I fail to understand how it could've been approved as a baby item!
