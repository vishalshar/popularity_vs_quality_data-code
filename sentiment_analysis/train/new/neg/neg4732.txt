I liked the cute design and the fact that the size seemed perfect for my baby's daycare but it is overpriced as it is very poorly made.First , this is not a cooler. If you put ice on it ,it will melt in hours, and leek through the bag as the bag is not impermeable. Second, after only 2 months of using it I found a rip in the handle , which could not be repaired. This is a big disadvantage as there are so many other options there. Now I need to purchase new one.  Finally the gold plate changes color  regardless of protecting it from sun and water.Although I liked the design, it is not worth the price and I would not recommend it.
