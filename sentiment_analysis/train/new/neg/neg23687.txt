I should have read the reviews before purchasing. The color is a super bright yellow and not the pale yellow shown. I can fix that in Photoshop so it's not a huge deal, but I tried using it on a 7.5 pound newborn and it was WAY too big. That seems like an average size newborn to me so I expected it to fit. And the only time you can really use an outfit like this, with this cute pose is when the baby is a newborn. When they are older, good luck trying to get them to sleep for this cute pose.
