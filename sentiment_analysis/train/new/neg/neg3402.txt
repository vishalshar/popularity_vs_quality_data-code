The whole idea of a baby tub with a shower is an excellent idea...but I think they need to redesign the shower handle.  It is almost impossible to hold the sprayer comfortably without blocking the water spray.  Not to mention the button to get the water to spray is extremely hard to press down.  The tub itself is a nice size and comes with the sling which helps a lot.  I recommend buying a regular tub with a sling rather than spending the few extra bucks for the sprayer that doesn't work that well.  A cup or washcloth will do the trick.
