I needed a car seat for my 11 month old grandson in case I need to pick him up from daycare.  There was no need for an expensive seat and this one had good reviews.  When it came I was very surprised and the bottom of the seat...it's just narrow plastic edging; no real "bottom" on it at all.  If you don't want to ruin your car seats be sure to buy a seat pad for underneath.  Just FYI, the car seat does move around a bit on the reverse position no matter how hard my son-in-law worked at it; the seat will not go level.  We think it will be OK for very short trips for emergency pickups but i don't think I would want it to be my regular car seat.  We think it will be better when it's in the forward facing position.
