I've been using this changing table for 18 months with no problems until this morning my wiggly 25lb. daughter fell through!  She could have been really hurt.  The rail that the changing platform slides into gave out. On the purchase page on this web site it states for children 3 years old and under but when you get the box it states for 20 pounds and under!  I'm guessing the average three year old has long since broken 20 pounds, my daughter was 20 pounds around 11 months and has always been in the 50th percentile. My advice is to spend a little more money on something more substantial so you don't have to spend a lot more money later replacing it or worse possibly on a doctors appointment for an injured child.  Please take some time to read all of the reviews.  There are so many complaints of cheap material, cracked wood, the pitiful 20# weight limit, bad instructions, screws that keep coming loose, missing parts, and warped panels.  Many reviewers agree you get a cheap, poor quality table for a cheap price.
