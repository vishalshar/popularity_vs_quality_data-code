This thing is always falling apart as my little boys try to take toys out of it.  It's also pretty big and takes up a lot of room in our tub when I'm trying to bath my three boys.  Since our tile is not completely smooth I can't use suction cups to hold up other toy holders, so this was really our only other option.  At this point, all the toys just sit in the bottom of the tub, because the net insert always comes out.
