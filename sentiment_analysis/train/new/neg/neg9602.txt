I wish I'd gotten a different one.  It doesn't have a lot of space to write in which is fine at first but as they grow and starting doing a lot of new things in a month (hell in a week!) and change constantly, there just isn't enough room.  I also dislike that if you hang the calendar the top part is just a boring design.  If they'd thought about it they could have used that space to write in and make notes instead...Cute cover but I regret not returning it.
