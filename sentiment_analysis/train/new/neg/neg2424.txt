Important to note, this is the COVER and NOT the chair.  When searching for a chair, this product is in the MIDDLE of the search results page with a bunch of chairs, naturally when shopping from a tiny phone screen while working in my daycare after a child just broke my actual chair, I thought - hey, great price, I can't read the small print but it is the same price as the chair at Target and saves me a trip.  Joke was on me when I got my COVER today.  UGGHHHH.  If I wanted a cover, that is what would have been in the search bar!!
