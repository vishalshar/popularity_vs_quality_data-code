Our son does not care for this cradle and neither do we. The two times he did actually fall asleep in it he rolled to the side, while it was in the locked position with his face pressed against the slats. It feels very cheap, not solid at all. You can tell from the picture that there are two screws that go in vertically at the bottom, these tend to loosen up every time we moved the cradle. We're going to try to repurpose it for something else, I would not recommend this to anyone. We also purchased a Da Vinci crib which we have yet to use, however the crib feels solid and sturdy.
