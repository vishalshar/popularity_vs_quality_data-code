I bought these mats to form a play area for my baby.  They are of good quality, but noticeably thinner than other manufacturers.  This thinness probably contributed to them not locking together very well when laid out on our carpet.  They may perform better on a tile or wood floor, but they would easily pull apart from the constant shifting they do when you step on it.  The interlocking pieces could probably be designed a little better as well.  The interlocks were shaped more like squares than triangles, making it easy to pull apart.I did like the large variety of colors, very pleasing to the eye.  Not super vibrant, but not really a pastel either.I also liked that it had edgers to give it a more finished look when assembled.  I didn't use them because they were very flimsy on carpet and would have just gotten in the way.I ended up returning this set and buying these mats:  Non-Toxic 24" X 24" X~9/16" Extra Thick Non-Recycled Quality Rainbow Waterproof Playmats.I would only recommend this set if you are on flat floors, not carpet.  Keep in mind, the thinner mats don't provide as much cushion which isn't ideal for babies bonking their heads, but would work fine as an anti-fatigue mat.
