I think, it's a good stroller for the price. Like the bassinet feature and the ease of adjusting to different position. I could put it together very quickly without looking at the manual. However, I don't think it's going to work for me. Here are some CONS:- it just doesn't feel solid. I guess that's a trade off for the ease of spinning the seat: it wobbles on its axis.- The seat/bassinet is quite narrow.- The seat/bassinet floor isn't firm: feels as if it's just pieces of cardboard beneath the fabric.- Canopy fold is very snappy and cheap â€“ I'm afraid it's gonna break very quickly.Overall just feels cheap. Ended up returning it and paying a little extra for a different brand.
