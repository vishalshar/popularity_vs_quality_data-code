Problems weren't with product itself, but with seller.  Amazon and it's sub-sellers are so interwoven, I have no idea who I actually bought it from.  Judging from the tape job on the box, product was more than likely another client's return, and nobody had taken time to ensure that all parts were included... which they were not.  I'm way too busy to deal with the hassle of a return, and, forturnately, the missing parts were decorative (the dangling stuffed fish for the mobile), so we just made do by adding in some after-market ornamentation.
