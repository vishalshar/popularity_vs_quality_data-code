These are very poor quality and I won't be able to use them.  When I went to install the 1st shade, I pulled it down and it was too long for my car window, but it would not retract, so I tried rolling it up by hand, and that didn't work, and then the whole shade came off of the metal rolling part and I couldn't reattach it. So then I tried installing the second shade instead, and it was bent and wouldn't unroll at all.  I was excited about these because we live in a really hot climate and my daughter loves looking at the picture. Waste of money!
