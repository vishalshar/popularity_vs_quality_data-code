I have been looking for a sleek but large passport folder to hold 4 passports and documents.  I was very excited to find this one, it is not ugly, large enough to keep everything together, and reasonably priced.It does hold everything, but there is one big flaw; card holder pockets are too wide and loose.  Slippery fabric which makes getting things in and out easy, makes cards slip right out of the pockets with a few shake.  If the opening of card pockets was facing toward the center it might have blocked cards to fall off, but it faces towards the edge so if they come loose, they will come out of the holder.  I'll have to stuff each pockets to make them tight enough to keep cards in place.  I may sew over the edge to make the pockets tighter.It is still useable and useful for what I needed for, and because it was not ugly and not pricey, I'll be keeping it.
