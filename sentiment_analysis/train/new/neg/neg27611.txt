I bought this cup because I had purchased it in green and it was amazing. The absolute best leak free sippy I have found. However the Orange one I received from my purchase here was the older style and leaks terribly.  This would explain why some people rated it one star and others 5 stars. It all depends on if you got the newer one with the leak proof valve and straw or the older with just a straw. You cannot see a difference from looking at the package; it needs to be opened up.I will be returning what I was sent because it leaks worse than the take n toss sippys.If I can find the new style I will by more.
