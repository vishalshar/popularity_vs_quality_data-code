Nothing fancy but it gets the job done. Only thing I wish it had was a top that you pull the wipes through. It's hard to pull a wipe out of this with one hand (because the other hand is holding a wiggling baby) without all the wipes coming out. I solved that by pulling a wipe out first before working on baby but sometimes one wipe doesn't do the job.Other than that -for the price it's not bad.
