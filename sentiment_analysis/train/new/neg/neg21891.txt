We got this when our son was about 21 mo old. He loves puzzles, but the cut for each piece is exactly the same, so it's too easy for him to accidentally put the puzzles together wrong. He's happy when the pieces fit, but then gets frustrated because the picture doesn't make sense. For example, in the case of the alligator puzzle, he sticks the tail into the neck and then has a body piece left over and that frustrates him.If the cuts were different like with a normal puzzle, this wouldn't keep coming up.Otherwise, it's sturdy cardboard, not as nice as his wooden puzzles, but it should still last a while. I bought a container with a snap-tight lid so he wouldn't loose the pieces--the original box is sturdy but a bit too complicated for him to use it as storage right now.
