Very cute but don't stick well. They keep curling off the wall. Once I notice they weren't sticking I stopped and put heavy stuff on the remaining sheets to flatten them out before putting them on the wall. It has been a week and they are still too curled up to use. Not enough stick combined with bad packaging.  Also, the description says it comes with 4 sheets of decals....this is true but I thought it meant I would get 4 of everything in the picture. But you only get 1 monkey, its just what they show you but broken up into 4 sheets.
