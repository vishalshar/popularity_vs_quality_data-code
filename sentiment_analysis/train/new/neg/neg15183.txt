I had high hopes for this item from what others are saying about it.  We have an 2002 4 door Explorer, our daughter is 3 years old, I am 5 ft 6 in., just to give you some info you may need.  I put the organizer on the back of the driver's seat and moved my 3yo in front of it.  She could not put her feet in front of her, nor could she get in and out of her car seat by herself.  It stuck out way too far, almost touching the front of the car seat.  She had to straddle it when sitting in her car seat.  I moved her back to the middle and moved the organizer to the back of the passenger seat, she can't reach it but I can while driving and hand her what she is asking for.  I think that once she is in a booster seat instead of a car seat it will work well.
