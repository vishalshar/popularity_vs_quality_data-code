I was very excited when we first got this toilet seat. our little guy is 2.5 and we are just really getting into potty training using a big toilet. I thought this was a great option rather than having to constantly lift and remove a set-in kids seat so adults could use the toilet, as we only have the one bathroom. The design is really very sleek and neat looking, and installing it was quite simple. However:-The adult seat is very uncomfortable, and seems smaller than most toilet seats. My husband is a larger man (6'2 280lbs or so) and he pretty much can't use this seat without breaking it. The seat itself seems sturdy but where it attaches to the toilet it is very flimsy.-The child seat is larger than it appears and not really suitable for toddlers. I think it would work for kids in the 4+ range but at 2.5 years old our guy can barely balance on it without falling in and when he pees, he manages to somehow pee inbetween the two seats and onto the floor.all in all, this did not work for us. I gave it 2 stars for the sleek design and convenience of not having to constantly remove a child ring from the toilet every time an adult needs to go, but we are sadly going back to the removable rings.
