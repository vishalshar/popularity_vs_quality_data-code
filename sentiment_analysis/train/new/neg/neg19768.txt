It didn't occur to me that this unit only comes with a wall plug in option until I received the package.  I think it would have been nice to also run off of batteries, or rechargable batteries.According to the instructions, my room is always a little too warm for the baby, but according to the thermostat it is much cooler and we have the A/C running constantly during the spring/summer/fall months.  I have even tested it in different areas of the room and never get a temperature that is "optimal" for the baby.It is a neat concept and I thought it would be a nice night light for the room, but since I have to have it near a plug it is inconvenient for me and also not quite bright enough as a night light.
