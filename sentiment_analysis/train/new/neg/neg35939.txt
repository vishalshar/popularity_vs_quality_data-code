I could not get this to work properly. I made my daughter a peanut butter and jelly. I tried with regular bread and then flattened bread thinking it would help. When I pressed the cutout down on the bread it didn't cut through it. Instead pb&j squished out everywhere. I tried several times but no success. Maybe the cutouts are too small. Really wished it would have worked.
