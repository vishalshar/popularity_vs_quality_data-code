- great combo of bassinet, crib, and changing table. This is a great solution for those living in small spaces.- love the newborn napper. Although it is impossible to assemble and remove. If you attach it once (with difficulty), and plan on using it for long term use as I did, you will only have to take it off one more time. Then this is great for you. If you plan on attaching and detaching the newborn napper multiple times, look at a different product.- Awesome changing table. I still use it for my eight month old.- love the design. It's gender neutral, and simple. Can use sheets and blankets to play up for baby girl or boy.- love that you can move it around on wheels.- the side compartment is USELESS. It is completely flimsy. Do not plan on storing anything in it, other than maybe a few diapers. I removed mine after the first couple days and have never reattached it.- Graco makes several other products that cost much less, but do not include the side compartment. I decided on this one because of the side compartment. Thus, if I could go back in time, I would buy a different, cheaper product, since the side compartment was completely useless.
