Set looks nice, however it gets only 2 stars from me since it is 100 polyester. Web site description specify 55% cotton and 45% polyester.If you don't care, I would say go for it as set looks nice. But for my Elmo fan this would be too warm and he will not be able to sleep in without sweating.. so this goes back.Amazon gets a thumb down on this one.. very disappointed. Btw, it is the second time this happened.. Had the same problem when purchased "Sesame Street Construction Zone 4 Piece Toddler Set" and again received a 100% polyester product, despite the description.
