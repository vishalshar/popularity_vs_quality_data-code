I bought this one about 3 months ago. My son (2 years old) likes this colorful bottle, but when he drinks water (about 2 times daily in his day care), he also bites on the straw. After he used it for 3-4 days, I started to see a crack on the straw. The crack gets so big after about 1 month. I had to cut the top part of straw, starting from crack spot. I have already cut the straw 2 times. The straw is now quite short for him to suck the water out. I am looking for the replacement straw. If I cannot find it, I have to throw this bottle away.The bottle might work for a little older kids who do not bite on the straw, but it does not work for my toddler son.
