I purchased this item for my daughter's birthday, as she loves playing with drums and other music toys in play group. I was very disappointed in the quality of the instruments and the condition in which they arrived. The maracas seemed to have hairline cracks in them and the drum was very flimsy. She never seemed to really like the toys and played mostly with the clackers.Unfortunately, after a few months of very light use, the maracas broke open and spewed their contents all over the carpet. My daughter immediately tried to eat what was inside -- something that looked like rice puffs and little silver BBs. Even though we vacuum extensively, we continued to find the BBs buried in the carpet for several days, and at one point, I found one in her mouth. The way the toy broke also resulted in a very sharp, dangerous wood fragments. Between the resulting sharp pointy things, the choking hazard, and the vacuum killing BBs, I'd say this is NOT a good product for a child!
