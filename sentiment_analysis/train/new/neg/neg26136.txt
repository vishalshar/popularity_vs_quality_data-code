These are very convenient, however it's says that they can hold up to 8 scoops which is wrong. I use enfamil prosobee and I can barely pack down 3 scoops into them.They haven't fell open in my diaper bag or popped open unexpectedly. Yet they are easy to open with one hand.They do not fit in MAM bottles.
