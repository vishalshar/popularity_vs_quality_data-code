I am cloth diapering my second baby.  I've tried many different diapers, I used Kissaluvs fitted for my first newborn, bumgenius AIO with the second, and bumgenius one size for the first baby with blueberry and fuzzibunz mixed in.  I loved my blueberry one size and the concept of the AIOs and thought this was worth a try. The quality is amazing and I think this would have been great for my daughter, but my son who is 1 mos can't go for more than 2 hours without leaking.  This has 3 layers of microfiber compared to 4 with fuzzibunz and bumgenius.  I really wanted to love these but won't be buying more than the one I tried initially.  I'll be sticking w the bumgenius for the volume they hold
