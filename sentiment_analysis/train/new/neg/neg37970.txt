I wonder if the company has the wrong description under this product. They were described as 5 x 4.8 x 3.5 inches but these bowls were 4 inches across top diameter, and 2 inches tall. Ok for baby food/snacks .... not as great for nuts, carrots or small serving popcorn bowls for elementary school ages, which is what I had wanted.For the record, I love Green Toys, the toy division of this company, and their mission of recycling and the fact that they are USA made. I have purchased their products as gifts and household toys for years. For reference these bowls here are what they offer in their toy cooking sets ...The only thing wrong with these Green Eats bowls is the size, because they won't work very well for me. Glad I purchased one set instead of the two I originally had in my cart.
