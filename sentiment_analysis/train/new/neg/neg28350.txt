The mouth piece on these spoons are huge, even larger & wider than some of the spoons I use as a full grown adult. Plus, they are said to balance so that the mouth piece doesn't rest on surfaces, preventing contact with bacteria that may rest on kitchen and other surfaces. Untrue. With or without food on the spoon the balance is off and the design does not allow for it to do its intended purpose or function as advertised. I think my little one will be using these as toys rather than eating utensils. They'll be good for banging on pot sand pans.
