I like how the tip is soft unlike Nose Frida that I'm replacing. I was going to purchase another Nose Frida because I liked it except the fact that it constantly fell apart during use & I constantly had to missing parts. When I first purchased Nose Frida with my first child, other such products didn't exist. As I went to get a replacement, I came across this & decided to give it a try since it was cheaper & the tip was silicone.  Plus I like the convenient case & the parts don't go missing.5/8/2015:  I decided to edit my review now & go from 5 stars to only 2 after I just ended up with a mouthful of snot. A few seconds ago, I had to wash snot out of my mouth!  My 1 month old son had runny nose with one nostril being very stuffy. I tried sucking the stuffy nostril out but the silicone tip just concaved in & his nose is still stuffed up. Believe it or not, I just ended up with nasty snot in my mouth and lungs & it happened fast (it traveled through the tube in seconds)! Gross!!! Plus every time I suck with this sucker I gag because I have to use so much sucking power.Btw, I probably wouldn't even have left the original review if it wasn't for the free extra nose tips.
