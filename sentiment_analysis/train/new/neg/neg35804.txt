This bed bolster has worked pretty well, my 19 month old daughter isn't falling out of her convertible bed now that we have the bolster in.  It's not as solid as a foam bolster, but that's not really a shock considering it's not solid foam.The only big complaint / concern I have is with the straps.  There are two long elastic straps that could be a strangulation hazard, and one of the straps has a large heavy buckle on it.Probably would go with something else if we were buying again, but wouldn't return it.
