When I fist received this changing table we unpacked the whole thing to find the last two pieces were completely destroyed in shipping. We contacted the manufacturer and had replacement parts sent to us, and a week later we had our new parts and assembled the table. Assembly wasn't too hard, (the instructions are a little vague, but doable) some of the pieces did not fit due to shoty workmanship and we had to use sand paper to smooth out some of the jagged slots so that they would fit, but it didn't seem like a catastrophe.  After we had the whole thing put together and in place, we installed the drawers.Well, the drawers don't fit. The rails that hold the drawers up are about a half inch too low, and so the drawers don't close, but just hang off of the front. It makes in nearly impossible to use them because they don't seem to be of very good quality to begin with and having to push them up and over the lip derails them every time you open or shut them.To me this now seems like a big fat waste of money and time, and honestly I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with this big useless thing.It would be insane to try and dismantle this thing and send it back, (the original box was destroyed in shipping) and I'm not even sure which replacement parts would fix this problem. I wish I could just get a refund for this awful product. So incredibly disappointed.
