I really wanted to like and get use from these bracelets. I have and love a Chewbeads necklace, and I thought the bracelets would be a nice addition to my Mommy fashion. Sadly, these bangles have too wide a diameter for me. When I lower my hand, they slip right off. My hands are on the small side, so this may not be a problem for others. For me, they have to go back. I'd love to see them in a smaller diameter.
