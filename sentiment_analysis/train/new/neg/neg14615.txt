The bottle arrived and there is no OZ marked on it. Only ML. In the picture it CLEARLY shows OZ on the bottles, but mine only had ML on it. So now every time i want to use it, I convert ML to OZ which is a pain in the middle of the night half asleep. I want to be able to just look at the 4oz mark, throw 2 scoops of formula in it and be done. Frustrating why they would sell the bottle in the US without US measurement on it!
