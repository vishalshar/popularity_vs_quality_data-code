We ordered the jungle monkey wall decals for our 4months old boys nursery. I was thrilled to have gotten them for such a decent price. We put them up and before you know it they were already falling off the wall. I have to go into my son's nursery a million times a day now to put them back on the wall. Im keeping them because they are adorable and match his room but im looking into getting some wall glue to make them stick.
