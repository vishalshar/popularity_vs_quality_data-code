The title says it all. I bought these pail liners because I was looking for an inexpensive, BPA/phthalate/vinyl free  diaper pail liner to suit my cloth diapering needs. (Plus, this item has free shipping...I am a sucker for free shipping!)The pail liner fits into my diaper pail very nicely, and it dries quickly on the drying rack, but those are the only positive things about it. After the first use, I noticed that the bag was wet. I thought it might be condensation, but it was not. After I removed the bag, my diaper pail was wet and smelled like urine. The draw string does not close the bag all of the way, so it is not very useful as a duffle bag either. Actually, the name "Thirsty" really describes this bag. It's almost as if every pore of this bag is thirsty and they suck in all of the wetness from the diapers instead of repelling it!After doing some more research, I found another eco-friendly diaper pail liner called "pl*net w*se". I found them on an auction website for $16.50 with free shipping (and in a variety of colors)...not sure if I can say the name of the site....but it is the most popular auction/bid website out there! (if you get my hint) These bags are definitely waterproof! I loved them so much, I bought another one after giving the first one a trial run. You KNOW a bag is waterproof when you take it out of the wash and there is water trapped inside. Ever since I made the switch, my diaper pail has been dry and odorless!Thirsties Diaper Pail LinerPROS:1-Dries quickly when hung2-Fits nicely into diaper pail3-low cost & free shippingCONS:1-Not waterproof2-Draw string is of poor constructionWould I recommend this item?
