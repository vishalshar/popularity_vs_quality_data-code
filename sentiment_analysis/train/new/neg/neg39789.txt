I love the pattern and style of this carrier being that both myself and boyfriend can wear it. I feel like our baby's neck is so uncomfortable in this carrier. The pictures show a child happily in the back and the neck doesn't look crowded at all(which was the biggest factor in my decision to buy this one). My baby is 20lbs and 29" long in the 90th percentile, so she isn't a little pipsqueak,and it seems that it is tight around her neck. She sits comforatably in it, but i would much rather give her the option of being able to easily turn her head. We will be keeping this carrier but not be using this very often, just for when we go to fairs or on vacation where there would be too many people to push a stroller around.
