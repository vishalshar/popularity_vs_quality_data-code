I read lots of reviews and thought it might be the best. However, it disappointed me...it hurts my back whenever I carry my 19 lbs baby at the front or at the back. The belt is not very supportive, I think the reason is the end parts of the buckles are just thin nylon straps which don't make the balance. I think it's better to make the whole hip belt wrap around the hip. I have to return it :(
