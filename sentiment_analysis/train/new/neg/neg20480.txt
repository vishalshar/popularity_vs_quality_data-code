While these bibs are certainly an improvement over cloth for feeding baby solids, they are not my favorites.On the plus side, they are very good for a diaper bag as they fold up small and rinse off easily.  They are generously sized.  They wash well and dry very quickly.  The packaging is cute for gift-giving, and the washcloth is nice, although somewhat small.Unfortunately they never worked very well to keep my baby clean!  The flat pocket in the front caught very little food and feedings were still quite messy.  The bib tended to get wet through, especially along the seams of the pouch and at the neck.  Worst of all my son absolutely hated wearing this bib, and he pulled at it nonstop trying to remove it.  He is reasonably tolerant of other bibs, so I think this was truly uncomfortable on him.These bibs are ok, but I have found other ones I like better for daily use, and rarely use them any more.
