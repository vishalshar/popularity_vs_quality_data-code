This is a great idea, but WAY too bright at night. My son is used to sleeping in a dark room. This was like a beacon in his bedroom - it woke him up in the middle of the night. I did everything from place a stuffed animal in front of it, to trying to cover it, but even the remaining light was way too bright for him. If your child is used to sleeping with a pretty bright nightlight, I think you will be ok. But this caused more sleep issues than it resolved :( If your child requires a dark room for sleeping this is what we did:1. Purchased a cute little light-up animal at Ikea for about $72. Purchased a timer for our electrical outlet from Ikea for about $2Set the timer to the desired wake-up time, plug into outlet, turn on the light-up animal and plug into timer. Now every morning the little cat glows at 6:30am and my son exclaims, "The cat is awake!" and he knows it's time to get out of bed. And it cost us less than $10.I really wish some of these sleep/awake tools allowed for the light(s) to be off completely at night, but we created our own for pretty cheaply. Good luck!!!
