We made a huge mistake purchasing this product. We figured for the money we were paying that we would get a product that actually worked for a long time. In under a year the buttons and battery went out. I contacted the company and told them the issue.  The woman who responded told me a few things to try so I did, they didn't work so she said they would sent me another battery.  They did and that part of it was fixed but the buttons weren't. In her emails she never gave notice or mentioned that the battery would help the buttons work.So when the battery started failing again, and then there was a constant buzz, as well as it not staying on even when plugged into the charger i emailed them. Which in turn they brought to my attention that it was my problem because I didn't email they back right away to tell them that the buttons did not work after the new battery.I won't ever buy anything from this company again and don't recommend it to anyone! They are extremely condescending in their tone and seem to point the blame at the customer when it's their product that isn't working.
