Rated a 2 star because I received a different color than indicated;disappointing to my son and I. They are a mess to clean up if your child has a BM. The liner actually acted as a slide sending the BM up and out of the sides of the training pants. My 2 year old hates these inserts, he fights me because of how awkward they fit. The two stars come from it being shipped quickly and made in the US.Note: He will put on the "Best Bottom Training Pants" over his "Gerber Potty Training Pants" for added leak protection when we are out and about, but the inserts are just taking up room in his dresser.  I will be rating the "Best Bottom Training Pants" without the liners a 5 star for leak protection.
