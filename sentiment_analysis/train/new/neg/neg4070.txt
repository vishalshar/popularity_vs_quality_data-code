It is ok. I had previously another one (from other brand) that sterilizes and dry also. I like more the one which makes the dry function. but I bought this one knowing that it does not have a dry function. Another issue for this one is that it is required to put exactly 100 ml of water. Even though I put exactly what is required, when the process is finished it still have a great quantity of water in it. Now I am using less water than required (around 80 mL) but it is still keeps the same. And since the first time I use it, I can see some 'white' spots on the metal part (where the water is added) - but I have read about this in the reviews and the equipment manual comes with information on how to handle it - which is quite simple. So for the price paid, it is ok.
