I love these diapers-but don't expect the color you want from the 3-pack!  I was expecting the fun bright girl colors, but I got bland purple and green (the red is a nice color).  This package doesn't save you any money, so order your Tots Bots Easy Fit (best diaper ever!) individually  to get the prints you want.
