I searched all over for the best lightweight stroller available. After reading others' reviews, I ended up with this one.  It seemed great at first, but I am totally regretting it now.  The "adjustable" handle just flips away for storage, it doesn't really adjust in height.  Also, it's very wobbly. It is not one-hand folding.  It always takes both of my hands and several attempts before it folds correctly.  And once it is folded, all that holds it together is a flimsy plastic clip.  I HATE the basket on this stroller. Even with the "let-down" feature, it's still hard to get stuff in and out of it.  I wanted to trade in my Graco travel system stroller for a lighter one.  This is not any lighter than a regular size stroller, and it is just as bulky to store.  I just bought a cheap umbrella stroller and got rid of this one.
