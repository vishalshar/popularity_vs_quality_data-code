Looks like it was made in 2009 and when I opened it it had a horrible smell like gasoline or some manufacturer scent. I bought one at babies r us and it didn't have that problem. Not sure what's up with that odor but it completely made my room smell and I had to throw it away. Won't be putting that up my son's nose...I was disappointed because I really liked the store one which they don't sell anymore. Guess it's time to find another one with the same clear tip concept that you can pull apart and clean. Thanks Amazon for the refund!
