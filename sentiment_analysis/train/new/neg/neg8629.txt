I am glad I ordered the Maxboost Glass Screen Protector. The installation was super easy if you use the guide stickers and clean the screen properly with the wet and dry cloth. The size of the glass protector is a tad smaller from the edges and I thought may be it could've been 1/2mm more from all sides. But still I think it is good enough when you also add a Maxboost Clear Cushion case like mine.I recently upgraded from my iPhone 4S to iPhone 6 and the first thing I wanted was a case & screen protector to safeguard my phone. There are several fancy as well as robust covers available. I wanted balanced one that does not hide or destroy the actual look of iPhone yet provides adequate fall protection.Well the Maxboost Clear Cushion super clear case is the answer. You will still be able to enjoy the actual look of iPhone. Maxboost Clear Cushion case is really crystal clear and it also has a decent cushion from all sides and also protects the camera too.I was concerned with the buttons because I had a clear case with my iPhone 4S where the control buttons were covered by the case and it was hard to control volume and press the power button. Well, this cover has soft plastic on the buttons so you can control volume and power easily.I had considered so many options but finally came to the conclusion that I bought the iPhone because of its looks and I did not wanna hide it behind a fancy cover. I am loving it.[UPDATE 10/3/2016] I am updating this review and giving it 3 stars because the casing turned yellowish after a few month's use. Although the manufacturer had claimed that it doesn't turn yellow. It did.
