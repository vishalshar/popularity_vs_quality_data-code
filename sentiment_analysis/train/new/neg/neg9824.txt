This is the only rail that is short enough to use with a toddler bed and still leave a small opening for my daughter to climb out on her own.  It was against the directions, but I felt it to be safe, and never had any saftey problems AT ALL.  Although the rail DOES make the bed narrower, it is certainly tall enough to prevent my daughter from falling out of the bed.  I don't even see the purpose to have one any taller....may as well use a crib if you want this rail to prevent your child from climbing out. It is very secure and very safe.  I don't know what the other people were talking about when they said that it "unlocked"  This has never happened to me and I had it9 months.  My daughter is now in a twin size bed and I'm still using this rail since it is small and white, not blue and ugly like the other ones on the market.  My main complaint is that it does not fold down, so you have to remove it to make the bed.
