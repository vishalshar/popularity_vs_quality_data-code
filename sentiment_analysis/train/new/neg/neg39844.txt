Pros:  Was easy to put together, works well in stroller mode, but pulls to the right.  My almost 2 year old loves riding around in it.Cons:  It stinks.  Rubber tires are incredibly strong smelling.  Took about a month for the smell to go away.I wish that I could comment on how well it works with a bicycle, but unfortunately the bike I have doesn't fit the hitch.  (I'm blaming this on the bike and not the trailer hitch.)
