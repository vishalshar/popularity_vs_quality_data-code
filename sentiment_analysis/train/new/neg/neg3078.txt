I bought this several years ago but just actually started putting it to use.  Well...I tried to put it to use.  I just got a 4 1/2 lb Pomeranian and she got out two out of two times.  First time, she knocked it over...I'm just glad it didn't fall on her.  The second time we tried to be sneaky and turned it the other direction and she still found a way to move the wings enough to get out.  Seriously, this was a waste of money.  I don't know what kind of dogs the people who think this is a good gate have, but if you have a smarter breed, don't get this gate.
