I would give 4 stars but the first one I ordered was broken and had to be returned which is so frustrating. The box isn't packaged well and I was hesitant to reorder but the second one came mostly unscathed. There is a little chip with that one too but not enough to warrant another return. The item works as expected and is great for my little one. I did have to put a stop sign on it to keep her from trying to climb in when I wasn't there which is scary. Also my little one is able to rock it back and forth a bit if she gets too rowdy so I take her out when that starts. Otherwise a solid purchase.
