I bought this toy because of it's five star reviews and the age recommendation of six months plus.  My six month old son is nothing but frustrated when he sees these cute, bright toys, but is unable to grasp onto them well.  They were not made for little tiny hands.  My five year old daughter has enjoyed stacking them several times...but grew bored after a week or so of this activity.
