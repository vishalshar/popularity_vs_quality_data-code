My 3 month old daughter was a bit frustrated by this playyard when I first put her in it.  I think it's because she's not very mobile yet, and couldn't reach the toys well.  She does like it when I place the toys on her carseat, so I think when she's older and is able to crawl and sit up, she'll enjoy the play yard much more.There are a couple things that I think could have made this product better, though.  Firstly, the toys are not very textured. I thought they would be made of varying textures (felt, plastic, etc), to make them more stimulating. Most of the toys (the bear, dragon, and penguin) are simply made of hard plastic - not very interesting to touch, in my opinion. This play gym also includes two rubber toys (a crab and something else) that are pretty boring.  I replaced them with something else.I also wish that there was something my daughter could kick while lying on her back, playing with the main toys.  She loves to kick her legs - however, there's nothing but air within leg's reach.  I improvised by adding a rattle to one of the bars - she loved the sound that the kicking made. I wish Fisher Price had done the same.I haven't tried the musical bear yet, have to get batteries for it.
