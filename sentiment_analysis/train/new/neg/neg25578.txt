I was suprised when I opened the box and discovered that the plush seat cover shown in the picture was actually hard vinyl that didn't seem to fit well on the seat. The product came out of the box filthy and needed to be cleaned before being put together.Size wize it is perfect, fits ideally on my dining room chair and I feel very confident that it won't move. It was easy to put together and the tray removal and recline features are really easy. It is also conveniently small enough to take with you on a road trip, so if you are going to grandma's house it will very easily travel with you.
