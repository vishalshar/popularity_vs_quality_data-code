I registered for this on my baby registry... Got it as a gift...Hubby put it together... and I looked at it in disapointment.  First off the colors are really different.  The main color is yellow in a canary type color but buttery looking. And the bear is just a pad. it doesnt stay on very well either I wish they had velcro on the back to keep it in place. Also, for nearly $38 you would think that  the bouncer would have music or something.  NOTHING!  BIG hype in pics, looks really cool and in person its very cheapy.  I just ordered the Snugabunny seat so my son can have a seat with music and more entertainment... it's nice. A pain to put together, but I got it for less than $10 more than this, and what a difference.The only thing I DO like about this bouncer is the fact that my newborn is comfy laying a bit more flat in it, than the snugabunny.  so for that, I would say its good for newborns less than a month old, because once they get to a month they want something to look at, and the hanging toy bar on this one I have NEVER used while my baby is sitting in the seat, because the toys will hit baby in the head...  REALLY genius... NOT!  Spend the extra money to get a better bouncer with music or REAL form of entertainment and not just bounce.  I cannot get over the price for this when you get so little. Mine will be going on Craigs List soon...
