I have had this bag for 9 months now.  I bought it because I saw it in person at a local shop and needed something a bit larger to accommodate Twins and a 2 year old diapers and such.  Well just after 5 months of daily usage the lining surrounding the button has torn away.  I haven't tried to see if they will replace it, to me that is a huge defect for the price.  I only use this outside pocket for the changing pad and coupons that I might have, so I am not sure why the lining pulled away.I really like how all the material is wipe-able.  The looks are also great -- the colors and print are wonderful.  I also use all the hooks to hang toys and keys on when on the run, it makes finding the keys fast. The find the extra purse useless.  You can fit a thin wallet (check book style), one lipstick & one key & a really thin phone.... that's about all.  I use it for coupons to leave in the car and it will probably get put in the toy bin.I agree with another reviewer that it could be a bit deeper.  I don't think I have all that much in my bag considering I am traveling with 3 in diapers.  I would go with Skip Hop again, but just go for more of a diaper bag and just buy myself a nice purse instead.I really wanted to give higher remarks because I do like most everything about it, but for the price & construction it missed getting 5 stars.
