First, I must say it does the job and at a very good price.  Now for the bad news.  It arrived the first time in a box without any plastic wrapping from the factory.  The product had micro-scratches all over it and appeared to not be new.  I asked for an exchange and Amazon was kind enough to oblige and did so in an expedited manner.  The next product arrived quickly and unfortunately looked identical, maybe even worse than the one returned.  The seat bowl was filled with grime and dust like it had sat in a warehouse for months to years.  Scratches and abrasions were obvious and apparent. I decided to keep it due to the low cost and the fact that it was a back-up to our Baby-Bjorn seat (which arrived beautifully packaged and without a scratch....however at 3 times the cost).  Both seats do what we needed them for, one is obviously crafted more carefully (the Baby-Bjorn) and wrapped for protection when warehoused and shipped.  The other, this item, is bare bones in cosmetics, materials, and thank goodness in price.
