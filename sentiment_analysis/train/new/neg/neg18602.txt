This is our second Chico.  Works great for what we need but is large and heavy.  We've had some issues with the sun covers.  They don't stay on that well and have gotten a little bent up.  We also had the back seat break and would not stay up.  If you already have a Single Chico car seat and base, it makes sense to go with this one.
