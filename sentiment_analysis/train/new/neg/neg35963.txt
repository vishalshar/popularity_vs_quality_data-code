Positives:1.  Stylish (at least for us, matches the colors of our decor)2.  Easy to wipe down/clean3.  Easy to adjust/operate4.  Has wheels, so its easy to move5.  Feels solid (high quality materials)Negatives:1.  Straps, although easy to clean, are very bulky and cumbersome. The shoulder straps and waist straps are of the same piece, with no way to remove the shoulder straps as your baby gets older. Our son seemed to find them uncomfortable.2.  Crotch bar (the blue piece that helps keep kids from slipping under the tray) is wasy to big/bulky.  Our son is 21 months old, and 30 lbs. and won't be able to use this chair much longer due to limited space.  **This piece is not removable or adjustable.3.  Unstable when folded, Even with the caster wheels locked, when folded near flat for storage the chair wants to tip over.  It must be leaned against a wall, or tucked into a corner/closet if you want to fold it up.  We just keep ours setup because we have the space.It it had not been for the annoying straps, and bulky crotch bar (other high chairs have a crotch strap that attaches to the waist straps (like most strollers), and would be easier to adjust, I would have given this chair 4-5 stars.  The shoulder straps were such a pain, that I ended up taking off all of the straps (since the shoulder straps are molded with the left/right waist straps, it is one piece and can not be removed unless you cut them off.) and attaching/rigging a more conventional waist strap when our son was older.  The chair has proven to be very sturdy, and easy to clean.  It has several height and sitting angle adjustments, but we have never used any other than the tallest height/most vertical sitting position.
