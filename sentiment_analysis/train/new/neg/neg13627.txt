Now I'm not a designer of baby teethers, but I'm a mom!  Only the nose is rubber, the feet are hard plastic, so they can't gnaw on that part, and the feet are easier to make their way into a baby's mouth by the design of the teether.  The company thinks that the baby will teethe on the rings around the neck. Not possible.  Babies don't teethe like a dog gnaws on a bone.  Skip this one.
