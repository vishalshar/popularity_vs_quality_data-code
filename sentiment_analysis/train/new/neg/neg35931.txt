My mother-in-law has dementia and likes to sneak out of the house when we're not looking (Especially not safe because she tends to walk in the street and not just the sidewalk).  Easy to install and it was a blessing to have for the first week we had them.  Then the clever little cougar figured out how to open it....  There is a 50-50 chance that she can open it on her own, depending on how hard she tries and if her fingers aren't oily.  Sometimes she just hits it hard enough and the knob cover pops off.  For the most part, it works as a deterrent because she will sometimes give up on it....but otherwise, don't depend on it to do the job because there is still a chance they'll get out.
