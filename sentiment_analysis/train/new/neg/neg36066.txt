I've happily used other Burt's Bee products in the past.  I had been struggling to find something to help my infant's eczema.  I had tried a small amount of this in the bath previously just to test it out without incident.  However, when I pulled it out again about 2 months later and put the full strength in her bath, she broke out in head to toe hives and welts and was in horrible discomfort!  I was so worried that she had swallowed some by playing with her bath toys, but fortunately after getting her really rinsed off, taken her to the doctor to get some prednisone, she was much more comfortable.  I presumed that she may be allergic to milk after this incident, and sure enough she is highly allergic.  With the increasing incidence of dairy allergies, just use caution with your little ones!  It was really scary and I felt horrible for my little girl!
