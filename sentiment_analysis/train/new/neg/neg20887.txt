I was looking for a shopping cart and high chair cover for my almost 6-months old baby girl.  Call me a germaphobe, but like most people looking for such an item, I wanted something that would prevent direct contact with the grimy carts/high chairs and my daughter's mouth.  The description for the cover seemed to be everything I was looking for and more:  plush cover, pretty neutral colors, easy to slip on, AND folds easily into a handy tote bag.  Plus, the price was hard to beat.  Needless to say, I was sold and immediately ordered the cover.  I was excited to receive the cover and couldn't wait to use it right away.  When I took it out of the packaging, I was satisfied.  Then I tried to fold it into the "handy tote" and it RIPPED!!!  The material started to fray and the seams started to come undone.  And it's not like I was tugging at the cover to get it to fold.  The cover is simply way too bulky while the tote material (the outer part that would be touching the cart) is way too flimsy to accommodate the product.  I could have dealt with the bulkiness of the product when folded, as it is not as handy as described, but the poor quality of the material definitely has me packing back for return.  So disappointed!
