I bought this because it had more slots for photos than other versions, so that's a plus.Stitching is solid. Easy for an adult to add photos but tough for a kid to take them out. Page covers are wipeable with a mild vinegar solution (I use that to disinfect, anyway).The downside is that the cover has an ugly graphic on it that looks cheap. The colors are off. I'm going to sew a patch on the front to cover it.The back inside cover has what might be a mirror but it's more like a gray kind of shimmery plastic that no one can see a reflection in. Not sure why they bothered with that change of material since it doesn't function in any way.My 17 month old son throws everything so we got this at a good time. He can throw it out of his play yard or around the living room and the book and my furniture is unscathed.I should have waited til the price went down on it because it isn't worth what I paid for it.
