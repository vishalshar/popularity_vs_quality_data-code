The brand I got for my iPhone 4 doesn't exist anymore and it's a shame, because it lasted me 2 years and was still good when I upgraded my phone to iPhone 5S. Now this one is very good to protect the screen (I'm a mobile groomer and I have my phone in my pockets with my key set all day long), but fingerprints stick on it, even with VERY clean fingers. Plus, if you wear polarized sunglasses, the colors are distorted and very hard to see clearly.
