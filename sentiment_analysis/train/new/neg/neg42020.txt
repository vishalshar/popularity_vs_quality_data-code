We've had this item for six months now and I tend to agree with the postings I read here before purchase that it could do with a few extra features. Still, I have a lot of trust in Philips and Avent, so went ahead. It's a very important piece of new baby equipment, so ease of use problems play second fiddle to reliability. This unit has worked very well, the tunes are nice (they've sent me off to sleep listening on the handset), the light is OK, the battery life is good too. Importantly, as well, is the temp and humidity readings and warnings which work well and give me a lot of confidence. But, I agree with older postings that you should be able to switch on the tunes from the handset. My biggest peave with this unit is using it in the dark or dim bedroom. The buttons aren't lit. If you use nighlights and things that may not be a problem and the untis rock solid performance justifies the price. I'd recommend this unit and just give you the heads up about using it in the dark. Hope this review was helpful and enjoy your new baby.
