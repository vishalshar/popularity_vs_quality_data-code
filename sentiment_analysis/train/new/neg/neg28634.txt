When I bought this it was just $13 - a steal. The colors are bright and as shown, and it easily folded down very small being made of nylon making it great for travel. The adjustable shoulder strap is nice since I am shorter and many cross body bags hang too low. Ample space inside (two changes of clothing for toddler and baby, three diapers, wipes, snacks, toys, wallet, phone, keys). I liked the parent pocket on the front but could have done without the bottle pocket. We don't use bottles and the pocket is not suited for much else, being stiff and the top opening is small.After a month of use the design is peeling off - a big disappoint. The Velcro also isn't enough to really keep the bag closed and items from falling out if tipped. We won't need a full diaper bag soon, so I doubt I will get another bag to replace this and will probably end up using a larger purse.
