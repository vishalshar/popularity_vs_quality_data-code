I bought these in part because I thought Eddie Bauer was a good name and I liked the low-key color.But the product simply does not work.  The suction cups do NOT work at all and fall off.  The hinges on top are off no use b/c you need to keep the window open - not a smart idea when you need the shade in the SUMMER with the a/c on and don't want wind and noise of open window on baby.
