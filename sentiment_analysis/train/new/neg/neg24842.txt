Having experienced the mini version of Spectra  breast pump Spectra M1, I had high hopes for the Spectra Dew 350 given the rave reviews. Sadly it's just not for me as the unit does not have a let down mode. I have found trying to pump with this model rather difficult and had to resort to the M1 to fully drain another 1 oz each session. I had to return the unit for a refund as it affected my supply after 3 sessions.It should be noted that in all reviews of the model in comparison with the S2, the company have said that the pump works for 95% of moms. I must sadly belong to the 5% that needed the letdown mode to get them going. ðŸ˜§That said, having used it 3 X, the pros and cons belowPROSGreat value for a hospital grade pumpReally quiet for a pump.. sounds like a quiet washing machine at workStrong suctionLight compared to my previous pump Medela PISAEasy to operate... its literally idiot proof. Switch it on and turn the dial to adjust the level of suctionCute design (debatable by some other reviewers as it does look like a massive blue boob)ConsLack of let down mode (a pain if you do need one before expressing)Not much instructions enclosed to guide you on setting up the collection bottles and tubing and cleaning before first use. I had to search for instructions on the spectra baby Australia website.Set arrive with flanges for 28mm and wide neck bottles. A pain if you have already invested in Medela bottles and breast flanges are not the right size for you. I used my Medela collection set instead.I didn't use the valves or flanges but the valves feel really soft and fragile.
