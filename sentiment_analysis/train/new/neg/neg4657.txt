Our daughter has an earlier version of this car seat, so we bought this one for our granddaughter.  It is a comfortable seat for her (age 1), is easy to install, adjusts easily, etc.  BUT, the cover is terrible.  The fabric is fine (keeps cool, cleans ok), but the design of it is bizarre.  It has huge unnecessary openings along the sides and every single little bit of food falls through the openings and down into the base of the car seat or onto the seat of the car.  There is also an extra padded insert that came with it that just slid around and had no means of attaching it to the cover, so was useless.It is a good car seat for compact cars.
