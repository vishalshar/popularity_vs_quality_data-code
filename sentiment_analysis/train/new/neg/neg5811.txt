These are great but after using for 1 1/2 months the silicone cracks and the hard plastic part is exposed.  I threw out the first one before taking a picture only because I thought I just received a defective one.  But now the second one is doing the same thing.  You can see the air bubbles on either side of the pacifier in the picture which is exactly how the one I threw out started.
