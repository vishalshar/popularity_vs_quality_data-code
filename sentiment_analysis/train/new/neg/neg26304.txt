I love the bottles (except the extra parts to wash) so I had high expectations for the cups. My biggest gripe is that they are slightly leaky, therefore the three star rating. You buy sippy cups because they aren't supposed to leak, and although it leaks only a little, it's a nuisance.  Other than that, the cups are great. Handles always line up with spout (unlike many other cups) and my child drinks well from them. If a large amount of liquid is used, they seal better, but for small quantities, use something else.
