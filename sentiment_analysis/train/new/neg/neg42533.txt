Delivery was prompt.REALLY helps baby fall asleep.Volume is a bit loud, but tape over speaker gives appropriate volume for putting baby to sleep. Pulling tape back gives appropriate awake volume.Drive motor for mobile is as loud as music when speaker taped.  White noise probably good for putting baby to sleep, annoying to adults.BIG problem is that on/off switch broke at 1 month. The ears on the switch inside the machine are too thin, one side bent so slide would not return to off position. Am bending other side to equalize, flattening the bent side would be a short term solution.  Am hoping this is longer term solution. Screws to open unit are a goofy triangle drive.  Just the right size flat screw driver got them out but annoying.Would only recommend this product to people willing to fiddle with mechanical things.  Dealing with it this was a hassle but not a big one.Someone who was extra ginger with the switch might do fine.Happy to keep unit because REALLY helps baby sleep and don't mind fiddling.
