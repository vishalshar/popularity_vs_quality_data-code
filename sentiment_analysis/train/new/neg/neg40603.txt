SO CUTE. Wanted to love it, but it's just way too stretchy. I bought it when my daughter was one week old, and granted, she was larger than most babies at one week old (10.2 pounds), but even with my husband tightening it up several times, within a few minutes, she was sagging and I felt so insecure that I had to use both hands to hold her, which basically makes this worthless as a baby wearing device. I returned it and got the K'tan, which I love. I just wish this had worked for me, because the fabrics are so much cuter than the K'tan, Moby, etc.
