I do not use this in my child's crib since the lights distract her from sleeping. She enjoys playing with it on the floor. When she was little I lay her on her back on a mat and she could watch and listen to it. Now that  she is older she likes to sit next to it or push up on it while hitting the  heart button. She seems to like the cause and effect of controlling the  on/off switch. I bought my sister a similar type toy by a different company  that converted into a shape sorter and musical note playing mode. My nephew  still plays with it and he is 3. I feel that toy is better from a  developmental stand point.
