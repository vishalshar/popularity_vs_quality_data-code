This is a glossy roll of flexible plastic. Not flexible like a hallway runner, but flexible like those semi rigid plastic sheets you unroll to go sled riding on, that make a noise like thunder when you shake them.  It comes with a cheap hole punch (my handles bent before I finished installing the shield) and a bunch of crap, crappy zip ties.Honestly, when I opened the box I was disappointed for what I received considering the price.Having said that, after installing it, it works. It's high gloss finish picks up dirty little fingerprints and dog nose marks no matter how often you clean it, and it is noisy when someone or something brushes against it, but it keeps our dogs from getting between the bannisters and upstairs. I think if our 3 year old pushed hard enough, the punched holes would rip out of the thin plastic material, though.It was hard to trim neatly with scissors so I ended up using a box cutter with a new blade, which worked fine.I didn't want the fine mesh style ones because the dogs could chew through them, but I'm on the fence about this. It doesn't seem like you get much for what you pay for, but at the same time, though flawed, it works for the basic purpose it's sold for. I wouldn't recommend it fully to a friend without the aforementioned reservations.
