This is the coolest bottle.  I just gave it to my two and a half year old today and he LOVES it.  He keeps saying "look at the pretty bottle!!"  I was questioning whether the top would stay on because it's just suctioned on.  you do have to push it down further on the glass to make sure it does not leak.  i tested it.  i laid it on its side, shook it upside-down and it didn't leak a single drop.I did notice though, when i opened it after he drank the whole thing that it gets very wet on the sides of the silicone cap.  I'm sure if you left milk sit in there for couple days the silicone would get all kinds of nasty.The reason why I bought this is because I don't want to use plastic bottles.  There aren't many out there and this one seemed really nice.  I did SO much research on other bottles but I found NOTHING on this one!  Only one review on amazon.  I am very surprised by this because it is so obviously awesome!  My guess is that is a fairly new product.I also bought the Safe Sippy 2 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056YPABO/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  Which I also LOVE.  My son does too :)The silicone is very thick and seems to protect the glass nicely.  The glass itself is just a plain glass, slightly thicker than a normal glass.  There is a small hole on the top of the silicone cover for ventilation.This is just my review of having it one day.  If something happens I will update my review promptly.  But, my first impression of this sippy is GREATI would recommend!!UPDATE July 7th 2014 - the glass broke after one week.  My 2-1/2 year old got a little too excited and dropped it on the floor from his high chair.  All the glass stayed contained in the silicone which is good but I had to throw the silicone cup part away because glass was stuck in it.  I did keep the cover and I use it on small juice glasses, so I still use it and it is a great alternative to plastic cups.  I will upload a photo of that he cover looks like on a juice glass
