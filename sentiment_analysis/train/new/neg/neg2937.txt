My kid #1 didn't really play much with these.  We are still waiting for kid #2 to be old enough to care.  I think they are super cute and my husband and I had a good time chugging them across the floor for kid #1.  As with other toys, it seems that if they don't play noise or flash lights in epileptic sequence then kids aren't as interested, or maybe it's just our kids.  I think they were worth it, but the kids really haven't played with them much.
