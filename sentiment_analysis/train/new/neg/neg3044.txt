I bought everything Blue Jean Teddy for the "perfect" nursery, including the mobile.  We used it for about 2 weeks.My son slept in a cradle in our room while I was breastfeeding.  The mobile was too big for the cradle (any mobile would have been) and got in the way of putting him in, or taking him out, so we took it down.  As soon as he outgrew his cradle and was in his crib, we put it back up.  He did love it, but only about 2-3 weeks after he was in his crib full time, he started standing.  As soon as he started standing, we took it down per the manufacturers recommendations as it was unsafe to have it in there if he could reach it.For what it cost, and for the amount of time we actually used it, the mobile was a waste of money for us.If you get a lot of use from it, it will be a nice addition to your nursery, and our son did enjoy it.  Unfortunately, it wasn't the best choice for us because of our situation.I do not recommend using it with a cradle as it takes up too much space and got in the way.
