The ergo recommends using this insert until your child is 15 lbs, but the few times I tried to use it, I couldn't figure out how to situate everything to make my little comfortable. Born at 8 lbs, I started wearing her in the Ergo at around 2 or 3 weeks, she would just cuddle to my chest and go to sleep. I check her airway frequently and she's never had any issues in it. Now 4 months and 11.5 lbs she prefers to be tucked down into it, rather than sitting in the insert. So if you already have the ergo and you carry your little one just fine in it already, I wouldn't suggest you buy this.
