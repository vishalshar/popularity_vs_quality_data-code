I have purchased 3 of these toys for my son to use while he is in his highchair and for whatever reason, this one seems to be his least favorite. We do have some issues with the suction cup not sticking completely to surfaces, but usually if you wet the bottom and push down hard enough, it will stick, although he can still sometimes pull it off if he yanks hard enough. Also, you have to hit the ball a bit hard for it to light up but, all in all, he likes to spin the toy and it provides a good distraction while I am preparing his food or when we go out to eat at a restaurant.
