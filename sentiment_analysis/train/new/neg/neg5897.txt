I purchased this seat when my son was about 4 months old. I did look at the responses on here as well as other sites to decide on this seat over the Bumbo Seat. He loved to sit in it and felt secure in it. It was nice to take to restaurants and use in the booth next to me. We did this before he could sit up on his own and would not be able to use the booster seats or highchairs most places have. It was also much easier to have at the table than the entire stroller. The chair does look like it is hard plastic, but as others have said, it is softer than it appears! Very easy to wipe off and clean. My only problem with this was the pummel came off. It actually tore off! I had my son in it and he was super wiggly and pushed on the pummel and it tore right off! Well, with out this piece, your child will not stay in the chair. I don't think it can be glued back together since it seat is made of foam. But it was VERY useful before it broke! I would have used this product again for baby #2, but since it broke, I will not be buying a replacement unless I can get one secondhand.
