This product was recommended by a mommy I trust to give great recommendation, however, for my infant, this was not a winner.  The sleepbag itself is wonderfully constructed and is cozy (without a doubt) but my child is a sleep roller and the extra fabric at the bottom would twist and get her tangled in uncomfortable positions that frustrated her so much I had to stop using it.I want to love the growbag but if you have 'active sleepers' or little ones learning to stand, this is not necessarily what you are looking for.
