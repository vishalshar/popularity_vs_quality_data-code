These are okay.  They are the 1/2" thick, which is nice.  I didn't want the ones with any cut outs because I knew my son would put them in his mouth if they came out after being on the dirty floor, but they were cheaper than the similar ones without cut outs.  The letters do come out very easy, even when just picking the tile up.  A connecting corner came off after a week of use.  I'm not sure how, so I'm not thrilled with the durability.  There are also some indention type holes from heavy toys.  These are not made to last forever.
