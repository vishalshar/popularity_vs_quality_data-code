I bought these for my twins and initially they were great. Inexpensive, and they kept the kids at bay for at least a couple of hours. However, now that they're older, my son lunges forward, and basically falls out, while his legs are still strapped in. His arms will be on the floor and it looks as if he's doing pushups. I adjusted the straps, but the same problem happens. I think he's just outgrown it at 18 pounds. My daughter is 15 pounds and it's just fine for her. So if you're going to purchase it it's great while they're young but definitely unsafe as they get to be around the 6 month Age.
