Just bought this from a local Target tonight.  Instructions are mediocre, and could be improved - for instance, why is it necessary to insert the rails under the mattress then shorten the rails by a peg?  Unless your mattress is made of granite, you could easily get the right width by measuring, then wedging the mattress to the bottom of the rails.  The way the instructions are stated you have to simultaneously hold your mattress up far enough to push in the peg with a screwdriver while also constricting the rail to fit into the next closest peg - not easy at all if you're installing without someone to help.Also, the pegs themselves are of poor quality - one on our assembly would not slide back through the hole until I pulled it out of the rod, straightened, and reinserted it.  If I'd left it as it was the assembly could shift with weight, negating the entire reason I purchased the product.Finally, getting the fabric assembly around the rails was very difficult.  The structure must be taut, which explains some of the difficulty - you don't want your child to get caught in loose fabric - but I'm not sure why this part doesn't come assembled from the manufacturer.Haven't tested the assembled product yet.  If there are flaws during use I'll post again.
