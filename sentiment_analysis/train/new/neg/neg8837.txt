Great idea, sloppy manufacturing.  For a baby product, one would expect smooth, rounded edges and no pointy corners.  Unfortunately, this one is all very sharp edges and corners.  After cutting myself on the edge when opening the storage compartment, I had to run a knife edge to bevel the edges and trim the plastic.  Nevertheless, it is our goto portable potty.
