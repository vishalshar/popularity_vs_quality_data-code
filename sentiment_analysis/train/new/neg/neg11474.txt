This brush is supposed to be more convenient because the nipple cleaner brush is attached to the base and is retractable.  Well, it only took a few uses before it came unthreaded and detached from the base.  I was able to screw it back into the base but the base is made of cheap plastic so it never holds very well, and falls off with almost each use.  The nipple brush is also too short to extend into some nipples (i.e. the Avent nipples for wide mouth bottles).  The sponge is for sure sturdier than that of Munchkin bottles and Dr. Brown bottles and hasn't fallen apart on me yet.  Each bottle brush has its limitations but this one was by far the most annoying.  The concept would have been good if the nipple brush was not manufactured as a separate piece.  I'll probably have to replace this one or repurpose it soon as it gets to be too annoying to use.
