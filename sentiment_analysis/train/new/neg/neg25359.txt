These are cute and cheap relative to the Aden & Anais brand, but I must say, the A&A are MUCH softer. I definitely use the Summer Infant blankets, but I'm not blown away by them like I am by the A&As. If you are buying a gift for someone, go with the Aden & Anais- much higher quality, much softer for baby and mom. If you are just stocking up on more for yourself, these work great. That's what I was doing. I already had 4 A&A blankies but I wanted more because I use them so much and I am kind of a laundry freak. At the end of the day, I basically throw everything in the hamper that has been worn or used that day. It just makes me feel more clean, and I only end up doing 1 load of laundry a day anyway.
