This stroller was a big fat disappointment.  While I didn't expect to use it for "jogging", I did expect to USE it.  I thought it would be a smoother ride for our baby, but the tires keep going flat, the front wheel lock engages when you don't want it to, and the hand-release doesn't work at all.  I think we've used it twice and it sits collecting cobwebs in our garage.  I need to check into whether or not it's too late to return it.  I wish I would have read the other negative reviews more seriously (I did have my reservations, but liked the price.  You definitely get what you pay for.)  I would NOT recommend this to anyone and in fact, saw my cousin was registered for it with her first baby and advised her to get something else.
