I had been looking at this shelving unit for quite some time. The design is gorgeous and I love the colors. I finally ordered it from Amazon - it took about two weeks to get to me. There were about 20 wood pieces and a hundred screws and bolts. It took me over two hours to get the shelves together (you need two people) and another hour of extreme frustration to get one of the swinging doors on. The second swinging door was utterly hopeless to screw on straight and I am pretty good at putting stuff together. So, I now have this unit missing a door which is such a drag but it looks okay. Again, the design is very pretty. But the hassle to put it together and the lack of a second working swinging door makes this a RISKY PURCHASE.  I'm not sure I'd buy it again in hindsight.
