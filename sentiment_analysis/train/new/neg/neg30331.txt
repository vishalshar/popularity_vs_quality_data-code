These provided comfort but just didn't seem realistic to me. You are supposed to wash or clean your nipple when you take them off and before you feed your baby. Seems like a lot of washing and cleaning both the product and your boob for the amount of comfort it provides. I would recommend trying the Medela SoftShells for Sore Nipples instead since those let your nipples air out without anything actually in contact with your nipples.
