First I bought an Evenflo and it backed up and the motor died.  So I tried this one.  Initially I loved it, but two weeks later the motor crashes and I am left stuck with a hand pump that takes 20min per side (not somethig employers are happy about) at work.  So I emailed them on the website, two days later I have yet to receive a response.  So I call the 800 numbers on the back.  One is a completely different company offering me a job training course and the other is a recording that tells me to call another 800 number.  Of course by this time the business hours are over and now I have to use a hand pump until Monday.  I am terrified that my milk will dry up and my baby will suffer because of this deffective pump.  I cant buy another one until I figure out if they will give me my money back.  For something as important and non-renuable as lactation, you would think the response would be more timely.
