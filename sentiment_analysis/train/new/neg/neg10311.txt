This was advertised as a dog gate for dogs up to 17.5 pounds. My 10 pound yorkies jumped over it repeatedly till it toppled over completely broken. The inside wood looks almost like balsa wood, light, cracked, barely there. The hardware it came with didn't fit, they had to ship me new ones which took almost two weeks, the dogs broke it within 2 more weeks, and they refused to refund me or send a new one because it had been more than a month. I couldn't even use it the first two weeks! Very unsatisfied customer. WIll add photos of snapped wood.
