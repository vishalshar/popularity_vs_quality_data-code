UPDATE: Amazon contacted me promptly (unbidden, they just responded to my review!) and offered me a partial refund due to the confusion on the description. They also asked me to submit feedback on the item description, as I have done. Thanks, Amazon!Maybe I'm an idiot, but I ordered the "pink parfait" color of this product, and every image accompanying the product shows 4 of the items. Nowhere in the product description does it say how many come per package, so all I had to go on was the photo, clearly showing 4. I shouldn't have assumed, but they need to be more clear in the description.Needless to say, this item is sold singly.
