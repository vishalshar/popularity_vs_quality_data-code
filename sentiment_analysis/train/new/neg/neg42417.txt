I purchased the Dream On Me 2 in 1 Portable Folding Stationary Side Crib a few weeks ago. It came with a 1 inch mattress pad, which is just to thin and not comfortable enough (this fit in the crib fine). So when I purchased this Dream on Me Mattress (same brand), I expected it to fit properly into the crib. There is a gap on each side that is significant enough that I do not feel safe letting my 6 month old sleep on it. This is being returned tomorrow.
