I got the 4 pack of the cotton breast pads and they arrived pretty quickly so I was happy and anxious to use them! But when I opened up the package, there were only 3 pads and 2 were defective! One had the strings coming off on the sides so that breast pad was coming apart. The other one had a huge FOLD/ Crease sewn in on both sides so it has a huge fold that is noticeable when you wear it in your bra so I can't wear that one out. What am I supposed to do with only 1 normal breast pad? I tried to get them to replace them but it didn't give me an option to replace it and only to return the item. I have left them a comment to just send me the replacements ( I'll need 3 new pads so I have 2 full sets...) so we'll have to see but so far I'm pretty upset.
