I have no idea how this sippy cup gets such good reviews... That was the reason I bought it, because it was highly rated by other customers. I received it in the mail yesterday and I hate it !! this cup leaks all over the place, making a big sticky mess! I am returning it, and I would not recommend any mom waste their time or money on this cup!!! The straw is hard plastic and way too small to actually be considered a straw. Unfortunate because my son loves Thomas. Keep shopping
