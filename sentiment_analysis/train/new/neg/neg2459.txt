I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this product.  It's super cute, and I figured that it would help support my newborn's head and body perfectly while bathing her.  What I didn't think about was where I was actually going to give her a bath.  This is way too big for the sink, and I don't want to fill a bathtub with that much water for a small infant.  I didn't end up being able to use it at all, and ended up purchasing the Precious Planet Whale of a Tub.  I absolutely love that tub.
