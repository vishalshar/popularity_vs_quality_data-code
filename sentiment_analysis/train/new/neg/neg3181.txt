I have had this stroller for over a year and have been happy with it. I was surprised to see the poor report. The reason we had to buy this overpriced stroller from Graco is because of its more compact size when folded.  Most people might not notice that it's a bit more compact, but it really is.  I have 5 children and when we're all loaded in my Expedition, I need to fit the stroller within the space left with one seat down in the back...it was quite tricky to find the right double stroller.  The only other one that fit was the Sit-n-Stand, but that was not optimal for a small baby.  I've always been happy with Graco and so trusted their brand again.  It fit my Graco Carseat perfectly, and shaded my children from AZ sun.The reason I gave it a 3 star is because I think it is very heavy, even for a double stroller.  And it is very pricy compared to their other Graco double stroller.  The back sunshade doesn't swivel either and their cup system is terrible I didn't like the cups in the front, we lost one right away on a plane trip. I think it is better to have a full tray for the children in the front too...it's an extra support for them.  But it has a full tray in the back, which is a must.It manoeuvres fine for us (and we took it to Disneyworld), but of course, as well as pushing a heavy stroller and two children goes...it seems that people tend to forget that part!I also get a lot of comment on my "space ship" stroller, or "high tech"...its look is different and I loved the handles.  I found it sturdy and well buit.  Funny how this color got crappy reviews, but other colors got better reviews...I doubt it's all about the pattern of the seat, it must be random!  So keep reading reviews before you make your decision.All in all, it has been an enjoyable stroller for our family that fit my space and my style.
