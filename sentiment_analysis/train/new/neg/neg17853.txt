With a new baby and a 2-year-old, I occasionally need to put the baby down to help the 2-year-old.  I tried a plain bouncer, but the baby hated it.  I figured maybe if there was something to entertain the baby while baby was put down, baby wouldn't cry.  I got this because it seemed to have ALL the bells and whistles, and I thought the Kick & Play feature would be great.  IT WAS...  both times I could get it to work.  I called Fisher-Price to find the model was discontinued and they weren't planning another seat with the Kick & Play feature (too often it would break, apparently).  Strike One.Okay, other than the Kick & Play feature, it worked great.  All the lights and music worked, and the vibrator.  Baby was happy in the seat, not making a sound.  But I HATED it.  The music in the preview is similar to what it sounds like, but...  it was loud and FAST.  I think it is physically impossible for a human to sing "Do You Know the Muffin Man?" fast enough to keep up with that seat.  I thought it was too much.  Strike Two.I finally decided to send the seat back to Fisher-Price and get a voucher for a new seat.  I had to mail them back the old one (to prove I wasn't scamming them for a free voucher) and it would take a month to get me a voucher.  A month to get a new seat?  Babies aren't in these seats long, but when you need one, you NEED one.  I borrowed a Fisher-Price Aquarium Bouncer from a friend.  Baby LOVED it.  The sounds are quieter, slower, and actually soothing rather than overstimulating.  The toy bar is in baby's line of sight, but doesn't block baby's view of the room.  Baby's reaction was SO different.  Rather than looking fixedly at it like a couch potato, baby was smiling, cooing, waving.  I guess the Kick & Play was too much for baby.  I feel bad I subjected baby to it.  Strike Three.I don't recommend this one, but if you can find a different seat with the Kick & Play feature, give it a try.
