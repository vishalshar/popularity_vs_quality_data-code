These mesh bags are good size. I'm a C up and the bras comfortably fit. Each bag comes with a plastic wire buildt into it to help support the bag. However, after only two washes, one of the plastic wires popped out of one of the bags. Elaborating on that, I do have the traditional top-loading washer with an agitator. I'll be the first to admit that the agitator is pretty rough, really. If you have the newer side-load washers and wash in delicate, I think you will be just fine. I gave this two stars because I think there should be a line in the description for recommended use in side-load washers on delicate.
