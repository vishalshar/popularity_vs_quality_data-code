I love this back pack design, but the belt support is clearly not as durable as it should be.  I have owned it for a few months, but only used it about 10 times around the house.  My son is about 20 lbs and there has been no extreme use or wear and tear.  There is a plastic flat piece that is the back middle of the belt support.  It has holes stamped in it to allow the belt support to be raised or lowered.  As I was walking with my son, I pulled to tighten the belt and the whole plastic part split in half.  This left the entire belt support split in half (see customer photo).  I will be contacting Evenflo for a replacement and will update this review based on their support.
