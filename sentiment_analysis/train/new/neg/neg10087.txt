I love the panda print and the idea, and they do the job pretty well.  But, the flaps that the absorbent liner fit under shift around, esp. when little people pull them up and down, which can be uncomfortable and/or affect the position of the liner.  And my husband and babysitters are guaranteed to forget that they have to put a liner in at least 30% of the time, which leads to big messes.  The cover also usually ends up wet (someone has a fast flow) even after #1 accidents, so I never get to reuse a cover, which defeats the purpose of the re-useable cover.  In short, I'd rather use something that looks more like underwear, esp. since my son is less likely to have an accident the more like underwear it is.  HOWEVER, I do like these for nighttime, when I can put two hemp layers in and have "nighttime underwear," since he doesn't want to wear diapers at all anymore, but he's not dry overnight yet.
