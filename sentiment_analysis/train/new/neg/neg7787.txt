My daughter is breastfed 90% of the time and only takes mam bottles/ pacifiers. Bought this thinking she has outgrown her newborn slow flow nipples at around 5 months. I tried sucking on both and truly there is really not much difference between the flow of this nipple vs a newborn. My daughter although now almost 10 months old still doesn't seem to prefer it to her old slow flow bottles. She drinks mostly from cups or straws now so I probably won't bother trying the next size up. Also didn't like that you can't choose girl or boy colors, our bottle was different from the one shown and not very cute (which I know doesn't really matter), but still.
