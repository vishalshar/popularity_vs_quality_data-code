I thought the  pattern was extremely cute which is why I ordered two rolls for our new nursery.  When we went to put up the border the two rolls that were sent, were from a different Lot number and while they looked the same, they did not match up exactly when you go to put up the border side by side.  One roll worked great, where as the other roll we had to add additional paste to the roll to make it stick.  Over all not pleased with the product for the cost.
