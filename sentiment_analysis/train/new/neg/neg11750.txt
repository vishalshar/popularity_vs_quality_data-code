Great calendar. bought for Baby #2 coming in Oct 2016. Has all the great milestone stickers and pages to write whats happening with the baby that month, some places for pictures too. I would've given a 4 star but it arrived very wrinkled at the spine area throughout the calendar, and the plastic case was wrinkled and cracked.
