Disappointing...even when on sale. "Galaxy" print was blue not purple as stated by other reviewers. Ties were gray not purple as shown in photos. More importantly, quality was cheap. Cheap jersey like cotton material (not lined with fleece as stated in other reviews). Other than the ties being a good idea, this was not a quality product. Needless to say, blanket was returned immediately. As always, Amazon service (shipping and returns) is amazing.
