the lightswitch itself when off, hits the top portion of the giraffe, which sticks out *almost* as far as the lightswtich. This makes it a little hard to flip the light on as they sit almost flush. Once you realize this its not hard to work around, but still seems like a pretty easy thing to have caught before production and just changed the shape or size slightly to avoid the issue. Its super cute and looks exactly as advertised, just not sure if i would buy this again because it is slightly annoying when I go into my sons room to change him, and have to attempt to turn the lights on twice (once to miss it, and a 2nd time when i remember i need to really get under the switch to flip it).
