I bought this stroller in March of 05, six months ago. Within a couple of months of light to average use, one footrest strap had snapped. I called Kolcraft in July and was told I would receive a replacement part with instructions. I received nothing.Now the other footrest strap has also broken. This means my kids' feet are either dragging on the ground or kicking the wheels--lots of fun to push. So I called again last week and was told that the original order was never entered into the "system." Whatever. They placed another order for me and asked me to email pictures of the damage, which I did.I received the replacement straps yesterday, with no installation instructions. I emailed them and got a quick response with instructions: drill out the rivets, buy a screw and locking washer and screw them on. Except I need to buy a special rivet drill bit. And then I get to have a screw sticking out waiting to impale my kids' legs? Unacceptable.I emailed Kolcraft again and was basically told that it was my problem. Not in so many words, but that's the end result. This stroller is still under warranty, but they won't honor it.The sun canopies are also substandard. They're too small to block any sun and prevent the stroller from folding properly when attached.I would not recommend this stroller to anyone!
