My baby can't get it to go anywhere. The (too) soft rubbery back tires have only been on a tile floor and somehow they're almost worn to nothing.Also I am reporting a choking hazard for a recall on this product right now. One of the little red light bulb covers came off and my baby of course automatically started to put it in her mouth! NOT SAFE!!!!!!
