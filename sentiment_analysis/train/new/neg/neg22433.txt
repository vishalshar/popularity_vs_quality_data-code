I already had a set of these that I had purchased from Target several years ago. My three year old has been using them and I really like them compared to the other disposable sippy cups because if he drops the cup on the tile, the lid doesn't pop off.The wanted to get more of them since I was down to two cups (one melted in the dishwasher when it fell and was sitting next to the heating element on the bottom). I purchased two sets on Amazon.I am finding that getting the lids on the new cups is very tricky and difficult. I have to try several times and then "test" it out over the sink before I give it to my son to make sure the lid is on and doesn't leak. However, once you can get the lid on, it works great! I am hoping maybe this is just happening since they are new. Maybe they need to be "worked" in.
