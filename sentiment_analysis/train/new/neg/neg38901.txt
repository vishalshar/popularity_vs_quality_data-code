I had a Nosefrida, however I lost the syringe and mouth piece, and could no longer use it. I didn't want to drop another $20 on one, so I chose this product because of the price. It does work, however I felt like my lungs were going to collapse every time I sucked. I seriously had to put some muscle into it every time I wanted to clear my kid's nose. I finally got smart and attached the syringe and mouth piece to my Nosefrida and I no longer have to huff and puff just to get some boogers out. Nosefrida is worth the price.
