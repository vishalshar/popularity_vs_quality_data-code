I loved the style and color of the crib. I also like the idea that converted to a toddler bed when your child was little bigger. The problem I had with it was as soon as my daughter was teething she sucked on the railing. The paint immediately came off of it when she did. It was like the paint needed a sealer or something? It was smooth and didn't feel like flat paint, but it definitely acted like it was flat paint. I put railing covers on it after that.
