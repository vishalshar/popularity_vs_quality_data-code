My son is skinny.  He weighs about 28 lbs so I ordered the XL swim diaper for him. It was SO tight, it would dig into his legs and leave a mark.  So I ordered the next size which is for a much higher weight range than what he is... same problem.  Now I spent about $20 on these things and they are useless to me.
