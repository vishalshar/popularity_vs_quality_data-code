I am not too impressed with this product. The quality is good and I'd love to use it, but I'll have to see if a smaller size works. Even though I used the sizing chart, this was too big for my daughter. This didn't bother me too much, but what did bother me is that the collar just keeps riding up over her mouth and nose. I had a hand me down sleep sack when she was younger, and didn't use it because the collar did the same thing.  Seems to defeat the safety purposes! The only thing I can say to refute that point is that I haven't seen any safety recalls or complaints.
