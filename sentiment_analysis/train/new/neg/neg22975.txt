We tried these after getting one of the portable mats that didn't work out.  This item too didn't work for us.  It won't stick it there is a table cloth.  Then 9 time out of 10 when we would get it stuck our daughter would pull it up with one hand!  It really ended up being more trouble than it was worth.We started carrying a package of cleaning wipes in her bag...we wipe down her part of the table really well and let her have at it.  At 14 months she doesn't really make too much of a mess and if she does we just had an extra couple of bucks for a tip and apologize for the mess on the way out.
