I bought these to put into a diaper cover for my baby. While they fit good into my pretty slim baby's diaper cover (he's over 8 lbs now but not chubby), they are not thick enough. I have to double them to increase the absorbency. So yes they are a good size for diaper cover for newborns or 0-3 months. And they are soft. But they are not as thick and absorbant as the Osocozy prefolds I got.
