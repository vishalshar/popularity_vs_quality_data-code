the pair of scissors is pure useless if your baby prefer texture- meaning unless your baby is still at the stage of soft, squishy food this scissors will be fine but once your baby outgrows that 1st stage this scissor is just useless. It's hard to even cut a medium cooked broccoli, thinly sliced meany and considering its price (cuz of ceramic) it's not worth it.  Just get a pair that's going to be $7 and get the job done. Save that extra $20 for yourself.  Will be returning this soon
