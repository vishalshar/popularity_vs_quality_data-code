Our umbrella stroller does not have a canopy/shade, so I read some reviews and the product description and figured this would do the job.  The canopy came in the mail a few days later.  As soon as I opened it, I knew I was screwed.  It is one of those pop-up shades that you can fold up into a circle to store.  In other words, it is a flat, black oval.  The outside of the package says "Use on buggies that don't have a canopy or extend existing canopy just by pulling it down." Then I read the directions and the VERY FIRST THING it says is "Your stroller must already have a sun shade (or top/roof) structure for this product work as designed.  It works as an extension for current shades.  It is not a replacement for those strollers without any shade protection to all."Oh.So I tried to make it work anyway, but if there is nothing for it to anchor and conform to, it isn't going to happen.  I'm sure it works great on a stroller with a shade, but I'm giving it 1 star for a poor product description.  I hope this saves someone else the trouble.
