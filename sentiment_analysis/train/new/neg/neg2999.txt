I am expecting my first child, and wanted to start an album for the baby. I liked this album because according to the pictures it had pages to record information about the pregnancy, parents information, and babies first as well as places to hold photos. I was surprised when I received the album to find that it is not the same one in the pictures. It is just a photo album! The pictures showing the incorrect product should be removed! I will keep the album because it is too much trouble to return it, but it goes to show how helpful it can be to actually see the product you are about to buy!
