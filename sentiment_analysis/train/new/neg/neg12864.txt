We had the same problems other people did with this potty. Pee sprayed out when my daughter sat on it, and the splash guard is useless for a boy since it doesn't stay in place at all. The seat comes off of the base all the time, and the lid closes on the child's back while they are sitting on it. The bottom is narrower than the seat, so it is prone to tipping with a kid on it. The step stool is too low to actually be helpful for getting a small toddler onto the big toilet. The seat didn't fit on top of our toilet very well either, but we managed to use it anyway, although maybe others have different shaped toilet seats that would work better for this. Also, in order to use it as a step stool you have to snap on separate little anti-skid thingies, which cannot be kept on it when using as a regular potty chair or it won't close properly, so they are likely to get lost somewhere in the process of detaching and reattaching them between uses, since the potty has no built-in storage area for these little attachments. And, its construction makes it pretty difficult to keep clean. I wouldn't recommend this and am looking for a better seat to buy.
