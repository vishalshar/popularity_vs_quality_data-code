These are too big for the bob straps, but even on thicker straps they flop around. Very thin, no padding, the design doesn't look quite like the picture either. Mine had 'ummer' parallel on side that shows, guessing its cut off summer, but there's no words depicted in picture. Probably wouldn't card if 's' was there! I don't think there's enough Velcro to hold them in place which would be preventing the ends from rolling up. Cheap so I kept them as back ups but found an 8$ pair that are thickly padded that don't roll up.
