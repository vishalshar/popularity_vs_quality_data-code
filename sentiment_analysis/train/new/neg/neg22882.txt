I bought this for my almost two year old daughter and when it came time to train her to use it created such a mess.  The front lip that is supposed to help keep fluid inside the potty isn't quite large enough, or maybe not the right design for this.  Instead as she went potty everything splashed off of it causing an even bigger mess.  Because it was making such a mess she became scared of it and will not even sit on it now.  I mean it really went everywhere.  All over her legs, the sides of the potty, the floor, etc.  I'm pretty disappointed because I think this has set us back a few weeks since now she is completely discouraged.
