At first I thought this was a great seat. It's cute, it matches my daughter's bathroom, and it fit my toilet perfectly. I would raise the seat and put it directly on my toilet so it wouldn't be too high for her. It was very stable and wouldn't move around at all. Once I realized my daughter was ready for full potty training, we started to use the seat constantly. She did a great job going to the potty in the beginning. She wouldn't complain or anything - she'd RUN to the bathroom for potty time! Soon however, I noticed she was uncomfortable and cried whenever it was potty time. I tried different things to get her to go, like painting her finger and toe nails, reading to her, singing, giving her little pieces of a Hershey's bar (her favorite) as a reward - nothing worked. She didn't like pottying anymore. On the third day of her potty training, I noticed two red "carpet-like" burns on the inside of her thighs. Well no wonder! I think the problem was a combination of two things; she's petite (25 months old, 24" tall & 24 lbs.) and the way she sat on the seat. I think the width of the duck's head might've had something to do with it too. Whatever the reason, the seat quickly lost its appeal. I replaced it with a Munchin Deluxe Potty seat and that did the trick. My daughter is back to pottying - comfortably!This seat is really cute, has some pretty great ratings, and both kids & parents seem to like it. It just didn't work for us and I thought I should share that problem with other parents. In my opinion, this seat isn't made for petite toddlers!
