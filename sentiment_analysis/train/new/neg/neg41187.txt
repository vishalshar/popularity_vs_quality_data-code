We bought this immediately after our son had RSV and was hospitalized. It is much more effective and quicker than using just the plan "bulb" shaped nose sucker. My biggest complaint is that there are quite a few pieces involved when cleaning it. There is also a very thin "o" ring that MUST be there for the item to work but it slipped out and went down the drain within the first week we owned it. Without that ring, the product is useless and they do not sell a replacement. We probably could have gone to a hardware store to get a new one - but opted to just buy a second unit. My son loved playing with it to hear the music and quickly lost a piece of the new one... Very functional, but too easy to lose the pieces. Now that we have baby #2 - we bought a different brand of the same type of thing.Make sure you use plenty of saline solution in the baby's nose and get it over as quickly as possible - they still hate it, regardless of how well it works.
