The instructions that came with this sprayer did not make it clear how to assemble the sprayer head. My clever husband did eventually figure out how to assemble it and how to make it stop leaking around the spray control, but had trouble attaching the plumbing splitter tightly enough to keep it from leaking at the water source. The low-quality plumbing splitter broke while he was trying to tighten it and will have to be replaced. Also, the included hose for connecting the sprayer to the toilet is not long enough if the water source is on the opposite side of the toilet from where the water enters the toilet. We will probably replace the part that we broke and attempt to use it, but taking into account the disclaimer that came with this product that the life of the product may be shortened because of high water pressure, I'm not expecting it to last long. My advice: spend the extra [...] bucks and get a quality one that will last!
