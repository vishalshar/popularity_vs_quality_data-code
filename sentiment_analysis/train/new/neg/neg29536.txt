Not the worst, but not the best.  I had my daughter's puffs or formula in these.  Sometimes they stuck when unscrewing them, but otherwise they got the job done.  They were definitely better for formula then snacks because little fingers can't fit into those holes but taking the cap off would cause a mess or a disaster.  These were useless after the first year since we stopped using formula.
