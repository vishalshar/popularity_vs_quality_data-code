Sadly this page doesn't reveal that this travel system is made by Safety first. Go to any baby store and you'll find very cheap products and much of the time their name is on the recalled list. They have a horrible safety backround.Not too many years ago Safety first's parent company Dorel was fined 2 million dollars for hiding safety defects in their products (anything from cribs to carseats and swings) and kept them on store shelves rather than embarrass themselves and recall (it was one of the largest baby recalls in history after the government found out about what they did). They had prior knowledge of their products hurting young children yet they did nothing. Simply google and you'll find the infomation)Back in 2009 or 2010 their car seats were recalled THREE times in a six month period.Is this a company you'd trust with your children whom you love more than life itself?Moms and dads who research travel systems prior to buying them don't have Safety 1st on their list of posibilities.If you look at their quality in store you'd see how poorly their constructed. Prior to bringing these out they were still selling travel systems in 2010 for just $120. I'd rather spend my money with Chicco, Graco or baby trend.Check consumer reports
