I received Milton and was quite surprised, the Milton I received didn't quite look like the picture. It looked more like a stuffed mouse than it did a Monkey. The part where its nose and mouth is at, sticks out farther than in looks in the picture, can't really see the mouth. The little hair bunch on the top looks nothing like the picture, the picture shows 3 little humps of hair and the one I received has one- like a small child may have cut it out. The feet aren't quite as detailed either.All-in-all I am quite disappointed in the product I received. I am using it as a gift for a monkey themed baby shower, If I would have thought for a minute that it would arrive looking like a mouse, I would have never purchased it.
