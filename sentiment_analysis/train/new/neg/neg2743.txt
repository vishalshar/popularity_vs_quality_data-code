I purchased this gate because I already had another one by the same company that works well. What I received was not exactly the same. The latch on this gate was completely different and useless. So useless that my 18 month old son figured out how to open it after just a few minutes of inspection. I'm not sure, is there a piece missing that's causing it to open so easily? I didn't even notice the latch was different from my other gate until after it was installed. Now I had to go out and purchase an additional cabinet lock in order for this gate to do what it's intended to. I have included a picture of the latch along with the cabinet lock I had to add to keep my son from opening it. Btw, my other gate (same company) has a red plastic slide guard and the hook/latch has what seems to be a tight fitting spring inside so a toddler CAN NOT OPEN IT!
