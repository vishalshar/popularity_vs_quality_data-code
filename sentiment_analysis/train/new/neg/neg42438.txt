These cups look nice, but my son did not like them. We've bought every sippy cup on the market and so far we have not found one that works. I think he'll go straight to drinking out of a regular cup.  The biggest problem I see with this particular cup is that it takes too much effort to get anything out. And the mouth piece is not chewy/flexible enough.
