The bedding is cute, but not the quality I expected. The quilt is smaller than the crib bed. I don't know if this is normal for crib quilts, but it seems odd to me that it doesn't fit the length of the crib. When you wash the bedding it gets extremely wrinkled and must be ironed. You do get a lot of items in the package, but for the price I was hoping for a little bit higher quality material. i do not recommend the hanging picture add ons, they are flimsy and cheap ( they are not included in the package but are in the picture and can be purchased separately)
