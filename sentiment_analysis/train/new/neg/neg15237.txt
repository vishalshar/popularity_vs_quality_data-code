I ordered this nightlight for my sons Mickey themed bedroom.The light arrived earlier than expected, so I was pleased with that. I was not pleased, however, when I opened the packaging and the Mickey plastic piece was split into two pieces. I imagine that this happened sometime during shipment and it was nothing a little super glue couldnt fix. I will say that the light isnt as bright as a plain nightlight but the Mickey design is bright and cheerful. It makes my 17 month old happy, so therefore I am happy.It may not be the best light solution, but for the price and the cute design, it is worth it.I recommend this product to anyone who wishes to tie together a Mickey themed bedroom, or who simply wants to give their children a colorful nightlight.
