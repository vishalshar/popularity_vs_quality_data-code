After one of our plastic Jeep stroller hooks finally gave out after more than a year of hard use carrying a diaper bag for twins, I decided to go for metal stroller hooks.  Upon receipt and installation, these hooks seemed like they were nice quality and the slim hooks allowed bag straps to slide on and off nicely.  Also the low profile Velcro straps fit nicely on our stroller handle bar without slipping.However after a couple months of use, the stitching holding one of the metal hooks to the Velcro strap ripped out causing the hook to fall off and rendering the hook useless.This really is a poor design as the hook eyelet doesn't go around the main Velcro strap but rather a little piece of nylon that is sewn onto the Velcro strap.If you plan on heavy duty use I do not recommend these stroller hooks as they failed way before our plastic hooks ever did.  I'm one on my third (and hopefully final) brand of hooks.
