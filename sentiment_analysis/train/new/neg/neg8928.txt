This is a comparison with the Belkin NetCam Wireless IP Camera for Tablet and Smartphone with Night Vision and Digital Audio. The other reviews can give you a sense of this camera.SAME FOR BELKIN NETCAM:* Infrared illumination for night. This creates a surreal type of scene, since the shading is different than you'd expect with a black and white camera. It is very effective in giving you a view from a dark room -- without visibly lighting the room.* Set up involves pressing some buttons on the camera, switching your phone/tablet to the wifi network of the camera, creating an account, switching your wifi back to your home router. The camera appears in a list. If you have only one Motorola camera, you will only see one.BETTER FOR MOTOROLA BLINK1:* You can tilt and pan the camera from your phone/tablet* If a scene is illuminated (bright), the camera switches to a color video view. (not b&w IR).* Faster, nearly real-time video if you are on your home network. Not as good as facetime, but basically realtime. The Belkin is only 2 fps.* Stays connected. The Belkin auto-disconnects and you have to tap the screen and reconnect.BETTER FOR BELKIN:* Sharper image* Better night view* Wider angle (though the narrower angle of the Motorola is compensated by the ability to tilt/pan).* Much clearer, simpler manual.* Better looking camera, smaller box.----Personal preference: Although they both have flaws, I prefer the Belkin even though the specs are actually worse and it's a worse app. It's cheaper, and for the same money I could get two Belkins, which would be even better than a motorized Motorola.
