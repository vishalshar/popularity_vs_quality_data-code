Do not waste your time ordering this. Where do I start! It was completely mis-shapen, the hood was squint and useless, the lining was way, way too big & the mattress was way too small. So apart from anything else, this moses basket would be dangerous for a new born baby to sleep in! Oh yes, and zip-ties are used to keep the handles attached!! Lovely!!!
