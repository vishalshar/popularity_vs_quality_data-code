Medela wouldn't send me a free ac adapter either. I purchased mine in 2011. They told me to go to their site and order one for $25 so I decided to order a Medela adapter from this seller. They did not send me a Medela adapter. Instead, they sent me what looks like a medical device adapter that makes this weird buzzing sound when you plug it in. I've tried contacting them and haven't received any calls or emails back. It's been a total headache! I would not buy anything from this seller - just pay a little extra and get an adapter from the Medela website to ensure you're getting the product you ordered. It's not worth the few dollars in savings. Good luck!
