I love the idea and the fact that is can be used at the top of steps but I cannot seem to get it lined up right.  It is very hard to open (it gets stuck) and I have to push it closed and make sure it latches every time.  I have another one of these from another company that works much easier.  Maybe I drilled the holes incorrectly and that is why I am having trouble.
