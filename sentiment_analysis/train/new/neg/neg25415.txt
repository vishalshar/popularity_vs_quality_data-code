I bought 2 of these thinking they were the original insulated cups but I got the Click and Lock version instead! FYI- Munchkin changed all their insulated cups to the Click and Lock. I hate this because when you twist the cap onto the cup (1) it's hard to turn it to the lock position (2) the lock breaks easily! The item pictured is the original version which is much slimmer on the top. The Click and Lock version is much bulkier on the top. When I contacted the store they said its a mistake made by Amazon for listing a different picture but they never mentioned their title of the product was wrong too then!they should have mentioned its a Click and Lock cup too!!
