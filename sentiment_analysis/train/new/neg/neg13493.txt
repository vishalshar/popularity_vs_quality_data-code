I have a love hate relationship with these cups. My son took to these so much faster than any other sippy cup we tried, and for the most part they work well. He'll drink so much more out of these than the other ones we have. However, every so often the tops pop off and water gets everywhere. If your little one shakes or drops his cups off of his highchair you are bound to have some messes. I've also had a few bad experiences with putting this in diaper bags. We are moving to milk soon and I will not be using these for anything but water! Also, not all the lids and cups seal together the same way. Some combinations are too loose so you have to play mix and match to get the best fit. With that said, these are really inexpensive and are worth a shot if you are having trouble finding a sippy your little one will use or are on a budget.
