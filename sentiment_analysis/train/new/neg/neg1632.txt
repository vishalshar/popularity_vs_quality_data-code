Nobody wanted to love this product more than I did. I love the bright colors and thought it would be interesting to my son. Unfortunately, this mobile is just too darn noisy. I have to turn the volume on high to drown out the sound of the motor.  I had read reviews saying the motor was noisy, but I thought surely it couldn't be THAT bad. I was wrong, it's terrible. The motor noise isn't the only loud part. There are these sliding wafers attached to each arm of the mobile and as it turns, you hear the constant slide and clink of the little disc. I have no idea why this was even added onto the mobile as it doesn't stand out and isn't very noticable other than the noise it makes.  Lastly, my 6 month old was only interested in this mobile for 2 days.  I waited to install the mobile until he was a little older... I am unsure if that was a mistake or not.  I wonder if a newborn would even be able to sleep with the noise?
