Ordered the Trend Lab Butterfly Wall Clock for my new baby's room. The clock arrived and looked great, but I was suspicious of the cheap clock parts the manufactures selected to go with. The second hand was not connected when the clock arrived. My wife and I really liked the look of the clock and it matched our baby's room so well, so we put in the battery and hung it on the wall.The clock does make a fairly loud ticking noise but it did not seem to bother our little sleeper.After about three days, as suspected the clock parts got stuck and stopped moving. The inner gears were still spinning but the hands on the face weren't going anywhere.We asked Amazon for a replacement and they quickly sent another one, but unfortunately it arrived in even worse shape.The second clock looked great just like the first, but this time around the clock parts didn't function straight out of the box. We put the battery in and the gears started spinning but the hands on the clock face didn't move. In fact, the second hand actually started moving backwards. We requested a replacement again, but Amazon intelligently said they would rather send a refund and no longer listed the item as their own.The clock really did look nice with the vibrant colors and design, but if you want an actual clock that keeps time and works correctly you would have to go to a hobby store and replace the cheap clock parts with your own.We considered just hanging the clock for decoration but felt the price was fair for a working clock not a faulty one serving as a wall decoration.Amazon handled the returns and situation very well. I did not buy from Trend Lab, but I would not recommend buying from anyone that does not have a FREE RETURNS policy.
