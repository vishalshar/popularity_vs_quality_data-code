I was really excited to get this, it has a wonderful print and solid inside compartments when all the buttons are done up. That being said, it's not stiff on the outside, which is really dissapointing. Like, if you don't have a lot of stuff in there it's pretty much like a blanket with a handle. Not worth the money in my opinion, but I knew this before I purchased it and that didn't stop my. Also pretty tiny, make sure you understand the size before you buy.
