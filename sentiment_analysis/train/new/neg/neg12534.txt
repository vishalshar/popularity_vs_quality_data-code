This product is okay. It's comfortable to lay on if you are not pregnant or if you are only up to 20 weeks pregnant or so.I'm a chiropractor who specializes in pre- and perinatal care. I usually need my pregnant clients to be able to rest comfortably on a table for 10-20 minutes. I found that my clients who were bigger/further along couldn't be comfortable on this pillow for long enough to complete my services with them. I have another brand (Body Essentials, I think) that is sturdy enough to support a woman until the day she gives birth. I should have just paid the difference and gotten the higher quality pillow. I'm considering returning it.
