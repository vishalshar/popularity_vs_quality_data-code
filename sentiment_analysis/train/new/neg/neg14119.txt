The leopard looks a little cheap. The inside seems like it'll rip easily. And the inside smells really strong like cheap fabric. Then again, the price is inexpensive so I guess it's expected.I wish it had pockets on the outside. Seems more like a purse than diaper bag to me. There is a small photo album that hangs off the strap that holds wallet sized pictures. Outside material seems sturdy and like it would hold up well. It would wipe easily with a rag if it got dirty so that's always a plus.
