These are more of a novelty item to me then a practical baby item. I think they'd make a great gift though. I bought them because I kept getting peed on by my baby boy. At first they worked good but every time they get pee on them you have to wash and then I just wouldn't have one handy all the time. Honestly I'd just use a wipe for the same purpose. On the bright side, my baby boy stopped peeing on me at around 3 months - yay!
