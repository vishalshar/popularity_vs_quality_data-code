Nice canopy but the actual color is different than the color pictured. Just be aware that it's not teal, but a dark forest green. A bummer for me because I have a stroller/car seat combo that is gray with teal accent fabric and thought this cover would be perfect. It does its job and is nice and soft though, so I will keep it - I'm 9 months pregnant and the idea of a return over a color is just too much at this point, lol.
