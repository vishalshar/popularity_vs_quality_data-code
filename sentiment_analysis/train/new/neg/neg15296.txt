There are a few reasons why I hate these training pants.1) The "pocket" isn't sewn very wide (and is actually TAPERED--so the pocket gets skinnier and skinnier the further it goes) so it's hard to stuff with...anything, really. I've had to fold everything in half, which just adds a lot of bulk. My son hates wearing these.2) The design is really weird. When you get these on the poor kid, they look fine from the front but the back just looks ridiculous! My son has a puffier butt in these than he does with cloth diapers!! Weird design. I really don't like it.3) Leaks. Always. I know it's not a fit issue and I've stuffed these with every type of material out there. We always have leaks. And we only put these on my son during nap time--AFTER having him got potty beforehand. Completely useless.4) HOLY HANNAH, THEY STINK!! I think it's the material the inner lining is made of. Oh my goodness, do these retain smells!! NONE of my other cloth diapers or training pants stink after being washed. I wash these with all the rest - so no different treatment - and these come out smelling like they did before being washed! They LOOK clean...but they smell AWFUL.Bottom line - these are a waste of money. Hard to stuff (which is why I bought them in the first place - so I could stuff them for nap time), weird puffy butt design, leaks, stinky. Bad investment. Glad I only bought one to test it out!
