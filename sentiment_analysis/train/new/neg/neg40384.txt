I ordered it about 3 weeks ago when amazon said it "ships in 3-5 days". But since then the shipping status was always pending, untill this morning I found an order cancellation email. they said they could not found it available through any souces. Actually I am very surprised that amazon did not update item availability.So my suggestion is that if you need it like SOON, go local or try the target.com item that amazon carries. You pay shipping but at least you know it is coming.
