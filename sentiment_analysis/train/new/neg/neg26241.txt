I was trying to replace an item we had for my oldest, but this still wasn't quite it.  This is very cute, and once my baby can pull the frog, it will be great.  I just wish there were a way to turn the movement and/or music on all the time for when the baby is young.  Otherwise, she just looks at it and we pull the frog for her.  It should have music, at least, that you can turn on.
