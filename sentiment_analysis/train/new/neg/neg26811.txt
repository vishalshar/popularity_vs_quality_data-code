Note: I had to change my review due to a recent experience with this product.[...]This gate is great for smaller cats, probably about 10 lbs or less. I have one cat that is approximately 18 lbs and he can't fit through the opening. Instead, he has to jump over. If they made a larger opening, the gate would be great.Though I would purchase this gate again, there are some points of interest to share:1. The gate leaves black marks on the walls. Our walls are a tan/creme color and we have black rings and smudges from the rubber stoppers on the side of the gate.2. If your baby is anything like ours, once our son became more mobile, the cat hole became a game for him. He throws small items through the hole to the other side. Mind you, he does the same over the gate but in case you have any concern about this, it's good to know.3. Finally, the gate can shift along the wall if enough force is used. Our son is 28 lbs and is able to shake the gate and move it along the wall. He hasn't succesfully moved it enough to have it push down, but it does shift.I also wish that you didn't have to leg over this gate. If it would somehow open and allow you through and still have a pet hole, that would be ideal.Bear in mind, we don't have a lot of experience with other gates so the points I've listed above may just be normal in the world of baby gates...I think though if you do have a smaller pet, this gate is worth it.New comments:Recently my son was able to push the gate and fell on top of it. It seems that the tension starts to wear out and doesn't hold the gate up as well. Our son is now 32.5 lbs. If you have a kid that's strong, I would probably opt for a gate that attaches to the wall and let the cats jump over rather than putting the kid at risk...
