My 17mo old LOVES the Baby Einstein videos, especially the puppets, so I ordered one for Xmas and the picture looks WAY better than what it really is.  The quality is awful and it's cheaply made.  I didn't expect to get the exact puppets on TV but I was hoping that when I at least put my hand inside to move it's mouth, I wouldn't have to exert so much effort!  There is no structure to the mouth so when you open and close your hand to move it's mouth, you hand moves but the puppet's mouth doesn't.  I would have returned it if it wouldn't have cost me half of what I already paid for it.
