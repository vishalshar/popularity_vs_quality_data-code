I love the crown clip for this pacifier holder, its pretty and sparkly and is unique compared to most. I thought the ribbon on the clip was sub-par and quite boring but really the worse part was the construction. The ribbon is so long as to be a choking hazard for an infant/smaller child and was sewn together so poorly that I could rip the velcro off the end very easily with my fingers.I love the actual clip part so I just used my own pretty ribbon and added snaps for durability. If you don't want to mess with it be aware that the velcro may not be sewn on all that well and could end up falling off.
