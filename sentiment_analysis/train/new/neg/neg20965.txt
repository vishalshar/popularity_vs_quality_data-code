I gave this 3 stars....not because my baby doesn't love it...but I am dissapointed in two things...First the packaging was absurd, everything was packaged like it was a bar of gold...and they wanted no one to get the gold. There were zip ties everywhere....after finally being able to open the play mat I discovered that the cat didnt completely work 100% the sound doesnt work at all...and 4 out of 5 lights work...also the giraff doesnt attach to the play yard which I find odd....but that doesnt stop him from loving it...I just wish I got what I payed for...and that everything worked like it was supposed to.
