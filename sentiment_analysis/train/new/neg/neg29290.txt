We have gone thru three of these locks in the last 6 months as we have a 2 year old who is a master at thinking outside the baby gate (we have yet to find a baby gate or child safety lock that he can't open, and thus the addition of a combo lock to slow him down). After searching for a combo lock that we felt he couldn't open we ordered this one.  The lock initially fixed the problem, but we found that it does have a major Achilles heel.  Our child figured out that once the lock is engaged, if you rotate the white part of the lock over itself repeatedly(thus twisting the cable), the cable will eventually break off from the metal latching piece.  After a few rounds of twisting the cable, small sharp metal strands began to poke thru.  The cable also kinked up so much that it made it difficult to create a snug fit and retract it. This wasn't a good lock for us, but depending on your needs and the curiosity factor of the person(s) your trying to keep out this may be a good choice.Pros: The loop style lock fits in unusual spaces and the cord can be extended or retracted to make a snug fit.  Combination code is changeable and slows the older kids down.Cons: Cable becomes kinked easily and stays that way making it hard to retract.  Repeated twisting of the lock will snap the cable off at the metal insertion point leaving sharp cable strands sticking out.
