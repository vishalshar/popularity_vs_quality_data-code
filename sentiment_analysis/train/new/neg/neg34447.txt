Item looks as shown, but the ad was confusing.  You only get the music box, not the arm to hang it from. You get two of these music mobile-holders and each one only plays one song each. So, because you get two, you get two different songs.  From the title of the item, I thought the item played six songs and had a switch that you could use to select the songs- I assumed wrong. I didn't get the chance to choose the songs, because I didn't know there was a choice when I purchased it, so one of the songs I have never heard before.  Music doesn't play very long; not long enough to complete one round of a song.I don't recommend this item and I wish I could return it, but I waited too long to open it (my baby came sooner than expected due to medical issues and it took a while before I got to open it and set it up in the baby's room).
