I was very excited about this stroller.  I wanted a side by side double for my 3 1/2 year old and infant and I wanted something with durable "bike" tires.  We live in Chicago and walk a lot and I wanted to be able to take my kids on outings; I should have listened to the reviews about the width of this stroller...it has made it virtually impossible to use in our current apartment.  When I first got it, we were living in a first floor 2-flat and we didn't have a problem getting it in and out of our place; but now, it's sitting and gathering dust on our porch.First the pros:It's a dream to steercomfortable for my kidsplenty of storageeasy to fold in and outhandles pot holes and uneven side walks greatCons for city living:*too big to get through MOST doorways; of our apartment building AND stores, shops and restaurants in the city - even when we could get it through the door of our old place, I found myself having to avoid certain favorite shops and stores because we wouldn't be able to get in with the stroller*the front wheel does shake...it would stop if I tightened the bolt on the front tire or "locked" it; but it was really annoying.If we lived in suburbia and could store it in our garage and then just use it for walks and going to the mall...it wouldn't be a problem; which is why I gave it 3 stars...but like I said; for city living, it's been a huge pain and I'm in the process of buying another stroller right now (probably a sit and stand).
