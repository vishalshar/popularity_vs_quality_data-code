Fast delivery, item as described.  I ordered several of these throughout the year I was nursing (partly because I kept leaving them places.)It did the job, I just didn't like that I could not boil or steam sterilize (tubing turns white and stays white.)  The tubing did pop-off from the little piece (cannot think of what it is called at the moment.)  They also look "cheap" compared to Medela brand (not sure if I can trust the "no BPAs" label.)This product does the job, but you get what you pay for.
