I am pretty disapointed with this. I will say it smells awesome. My problem is that it seems to be giving my child a reaction. I use it for his cloth diapers, and he never had an issue with any of the other types of detergent  I've used. But ever since I started using this, he's been having a nasty red swollen rash. He's even woke up very upset. I'm switching back to the kind I used before.This might just be my kid. He and his father are very sensitive to scents and things. So if your family is ok with scents, go for it. It washes very well. It's just not for my family.
