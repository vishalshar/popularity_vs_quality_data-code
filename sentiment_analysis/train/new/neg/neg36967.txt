Although the animals on this crib set are very cute and I liked the look online, when it showed up it was MUCH darker than it showed online. I was looking for the paler colors, and it looked like it would be closer to a sage or mossy green, but it's quite dark, and the lion that looks kind of golden is actually orange. Not what we wanted, and I will be sending it back.
