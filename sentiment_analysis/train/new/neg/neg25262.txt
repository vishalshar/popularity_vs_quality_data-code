Purchased based on friend recommendations and reviews, but not a fan.The zip pouch is nice, the straps are smooth and slim, but baby was not compliant to the position required for a good fit.The Performance Carrier is a much lighter weight fabric than the other Ergo carriers -a definite plus when participating in any outdoor activities.Does require more set up than the Bjorn Active carrier -which is what we had.Ergo does fit a 5'4" (petite) to 6'4" (husky) size differenceDid not find the mini LED Safety Reflector Light to be worth the price hike -wish that the performance carrier came in more color choices
