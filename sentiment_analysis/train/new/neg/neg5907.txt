The breast plates are not "official" medela parts but they all fit well. In addition to this you need to purchase the Barrier filter and the port connector in order to use the Classic Medela pump. It would make a lot of sense to include it in the kit but it is not.Item Numbers:  Medela Pump Connector w/ Port Plug #8007195, Medela Classic Breastpump Barrier Filter #8007064. It is still cheaper to buy these individually then to buy a Lactina or Symphony set if you are only using the Classic Pump.
