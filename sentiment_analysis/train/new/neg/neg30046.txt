I am overall impressed with the quality of this spoon. I figured it would probably leak but I could feed my son soup out of it if I wanted without any leaks. Very easy to clean too.The problem is the actual spoon part is too deep for my 7 month old to get the food off of. It is like leveling a measuring spoon every time I give him a bite. Maybe when he gets a little bigger he will have the coordination to use his upper lip to scoop the food out of the bowl of the spoon... I just wish the tip was a little flatter
