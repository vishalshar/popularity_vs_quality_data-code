This product definately wasn't what I expected. After buying and returning many faucet covers (due to not being practical or functional), this seemed like the perfect problem solver. I was so anxious to get this in the mail! Well, it was a waste of money! What you can't see on the box/ packaging of this product is that it's made for side by side seperate hot & cold faucet handles otherwise it doesn't fit! I have a standard bath faucet and this product is way too small and won't cover it properly. If this product was made into a larger size, I think it would have made a great product...unfortunately it won't work for me.
