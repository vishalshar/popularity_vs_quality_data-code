The first few times I tried this it didn't hold my daughter's attention at all.  ( I bought it at 6 mos)  She watched the fish move for a few seconds and went on to something else. There really is nothing for her to hold on to, that lights up or makes noise so it doesn't seem to amuse her for long.  I do think that this is a toy that requires supervision.  My daughter does like to bury her face in the plastic.  I could see that being a risk of suffocation if you left your child unattended.  Weeks later I pulled this toy out again and she batted at the fish for a few minutes.  It remains to be seen whether she will grow to like this toy more as she gets older.  I would say that there are probably better toys on the market for your money.
