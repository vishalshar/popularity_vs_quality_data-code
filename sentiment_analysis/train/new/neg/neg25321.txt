Medela makes (or perhaps, made) two types of Nursing Bra pads, and my wife is very particular as to which she prefers.  We ordered this product, which is shown as the round "bra" pads, and instead received a different product called "disposable nursing pads" that is a butterfly shape. They don't look as discreet under her clothes and she doesn't like them as much.I've ordered this item twice and received the wrong item both times, and neither were eligible for a refund. Its possible that Medela no longer makes the round disposable pads, but if that's the case, this seller needs to update the image shown on this item.
