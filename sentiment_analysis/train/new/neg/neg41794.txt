This fits the purpose as a placemat, but it is a little flimsy and the kid often grabs the sides and picks up everything on the placemat to dump on the floor. I thought the placemat would be more firm and would work a bit better, but not so much. I will probably get another placemat that suctions to the table and see if that works better.
