I was really excited to buy this bedding for my son. The packaging that it came in was so cheap looking, the zipper was broke on the bag it came in. When it arrived I was so happy to open the package and see all the stuff it came with, and as soon as I opened the package I was disappointing. The sheet didn't fit the crib mattress that we bought. The blanket feet cheap and had a musky smell. The stitching was off everywhere on the blanket. The crib bumper didn't line us and I wasn't actually able to tie it to the crib no matter how many times I tried. The curtain was so ugly that I threw it away. I looked everywhere for camo bedding for my son and this was all that I could find. I wish I had looked some more and found something with a little higher quality. My dust ruffle was just plain old brown and very ugly. I refused to use it. The diaper holder was cute and the stitching was correct on this but that was about it. I wish it was a higher quality. This is now sitting in my sons closet. I refused to use it. I was never able to get the funky smell out of it even with hanging it in the sun and washing it. I'm not sure if I just got one that was a bad batch or just unlucky as it had pretty good reviews.
