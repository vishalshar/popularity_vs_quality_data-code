I would return this sheet if I hadn't thrown the packaging away.I have no idea how anyone can say this is designed to fit a standard crib mattress. It is not even close in size. I prefer tight sheets so, even though it looked small, I thought I'd be able to stretch it to fit. Seriously. That is never going to happen. I really tried.The sheet is so small we're using it as a changing pad cover. I have a contoured Summer Infant changing pad and it fits that exactly like the changing pad covers designed for it. That is how small the sheet is.As for quality, it's basically what I expected for the price. The fabric isn't the softest, but the seams are apparently pretty durable since they survived the strain I put on them when I was trying to stretch it to fit my crib mattress!The color is true. So I guess there is that.If you're looking for a changing pad cover, this "sheet" works. If you want to actually use it in a crib mattress, don't bother.
