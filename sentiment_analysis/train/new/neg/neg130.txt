After I spent all that money, I was told that some women can't pump too much even though they produce a lot of milk. Of course just to make me angry, I wasn't pumping much (even though I am making enough milk). That is why i recommend that before you buy such an expensive pump, try to use a cheap manual pump to see how it works first.
