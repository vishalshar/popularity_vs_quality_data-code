We bought extra bases so we didn't have to share a single base across 3 vehicles.  The plus side is we have extra bases so we don't have to play musical bases anymore, and once they are tightened down, they stay nice and snug and it makes getting baby in and out of the car very easy.  However, the downside of these bases is they are a PAIN to get in and out of the car once they are tightened down.  Sometimes they are easy to get out (can do in under a minute) and other times it takes me 7-10 minutes; you just never know.  My husband has trouble with it sometimes but not as often as I do, so perhaps having man hand strength is a requirement for successfully loosening the buckle once it's tightened??  I don't know if it's a flaw in the buckle design or what, but if you want a base that is easy to put in and take out, DO NOT get this base!
