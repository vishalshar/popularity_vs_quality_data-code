I rarely write truly one-star reviews, but this one I just had to - and I have been meaning to for months.I bought three different kinds of waterproof bibs for my one-year old.  Meal time has been getting messier and I wanted a pocket.  All three products suggested that I hand-wash the bib.  REALLY?!  What Mom has time for that?Anyway, regardless, I tried to keep them all out of the washer.  But, I have a husband.  And, I love my husband very much.  But, he most certainly was not attentive to the fact that the bibs need to be kept out the washer.Both other products held up perfectly fine in the washer - and three months later, they continue to.  So, i appreciate them telling me that the product would be better if I handwashed it, but at the end of the day, they produce a quality waterproof bib that is still in rotation at our household. Even going through the washer on a regular basis and, gulp, sometimes even the dryer.These Neat Solutions barely made it two weeks and one washing and they turned to garbage.  Sadly.So, I recommend the Luvable Friends Baby Bib with Waterproof backing or the Bumkins waterproof super bib.
