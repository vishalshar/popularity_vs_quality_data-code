There are so many options and every one talks about how their system works perfectly to reduce colic and other issues that babies face when they drink through the bottle.I have tried medela, this and mam bottles. I didn't see any major difference. I am using avent just because I bought it. The baby is fine no matter which company I use. He drinks from any bottle, no issues.One issue that I do have with this avent bottles is the way the bottle is constructed. It is the most annoying part of the bottle for me. If I knew it before, I wouldn't have bought these. The bottle has kind of a ridge at the top and is not a smooth curve. When the milk goes below that ridge, the milk gets stuck there.  You have to shake that bottle to make the milk fall to the nipple. And as the baby keeps moving sometimes, you have adjust the bottle or take it out of his mouth and put it back it which makes the milk get stuck again at the ridge. So you have to shake again. The medela and mam bottles get the milk to the nipple till the last drop.
