My 2 year old bites and gnaws on the Angel Dear froggy I ordered a year ago and still looks great although grimier and well-loved looking. I ordered these as spares. The head of these frogs are smaller than the original. They are less filled-in and flimsier. They are still nice and soft except that the original one was made even better. Sturdier and bigger. I gooe she doesn't notice the head size is smaller now.
