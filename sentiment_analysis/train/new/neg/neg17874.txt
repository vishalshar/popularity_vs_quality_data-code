I for the life of me could not get the seat to stay in place. It has five straps you have to pull through slits in the back, and three plastic buttons you have to push through holes in the front that slide down. Well great, there is nothing that keeps any of those things in place! The holes in the front were to big to securely snap in and slide down and STAY down, the straps would come back out as she was moving up and down. It would have been 5stars if it was made better. My daughter loved the toy bar. I just went out at and bought another walker from another brand.
