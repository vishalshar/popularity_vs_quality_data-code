I researched many sunscreens and read a lot of "expert" input on what ingredients you should have and should not have in a sunscreen.  Badger came recommended because it does not have oxybenzone and it has zine oxide. So, I went out on a limb and purchased what I would consider an "organic" sunscreen.  I normally use Coppertone or Banana Boat sport of some sort.  I bought a 30spf, 15spf & 30 face stick.  After using the 30spf on my first day out, I burned so bad.  I re-applied several times as I always do in the sun.  I'm very conscience of sunscreen and the amount of expose I have in the sun.  I haven't burned in over 12 years.  I haven't pealed in over 12 years.  This is by far the worst burn I have experienced.  I went back to my normal coppertone & banana boat sprays for my back side for the next three days while I was face down or under the umbrella and didn't get one ounce of sun/sunburn at all!  So much for organic...I'll take the oxybenzone over a sunburn and skin damage any day.
