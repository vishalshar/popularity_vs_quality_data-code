It was perfect. I liked how it looked, the cup holder on the side was great and it fit my son perfectly. After it's first use, I knew I was going to have problems with the zipper. It continued to get stuck and was hard to zip open/close. On our second use, I used a little force to zip up the backpack because it was sticking and the zipper latch (?) broke off. Ahg! Should be 'Kid tough', right?Now I'm on the hunt to find another one, yet again :(
