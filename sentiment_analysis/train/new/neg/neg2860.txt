These are ok.  I find that my son has trouble getting water out of these.  He is far more successful with the Munchkin straw sippy cups, as well as the Take n toss sippy cups.  I bought the Tommee Tippee cups because we used their bottles exclusively and loved them, but I'm just not as crazy about these cups. In addition to them not being great for my son to drink from, they leaked in my diaper bag.
