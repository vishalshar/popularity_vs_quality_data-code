I only gave this sippy spout 3 starts because it is OVERPRICED! I bought the OrganicKidz bottles because they were made of metal and kit I got was a pretty good price but if I had know how expensive the replacement spouts were, I probably would've gone with another brand.  I couldn't find any of their spouts locally (no Babies R Us, Target, Walmart ...no where) so I had to buy these.  They came as expected and although I was looking for "organic" and more healthier option of a product I was also hoping they were made in the US but they are made in China so I don't know
