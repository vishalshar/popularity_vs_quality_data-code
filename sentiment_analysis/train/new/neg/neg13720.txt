I actually liked this sippy cup until today, where I discovered gunk build up in the spout (green part). I wash all of these parts daily and give ample time to dry (over night) and am very disappointed by the build up. On top of that, my daughter has been drinking from this cup for who knows how long before I actually examined the spout. You can tell if yours have build up by looking down into the spout and you'll see the black stuff.
