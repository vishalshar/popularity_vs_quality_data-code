My son started playing with this set of toys when he was around 1, but he's never shown a lot of interest in them.  Now almost two, he can nest the vehicles in one another, but it's difficult  to stack them on top of each other.  You have to be pretty precise.  He likes pushing them around when he does play with them, but that's about it.  They're very durable, as they've lasted through a few mini tantrums.
