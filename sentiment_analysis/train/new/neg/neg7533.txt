After being given one of these cups at the hospital, the take & toss brand became the only sippy brand he would accept. The issue is, he tends to have a habit of biting down on the spout so I decided to buy some more. With these, the top would easily come off, spilling the contents all over my son and making him cry. He still enjoys the cups but I have to watch carefully and hope the lid doesn't come off. Now please keep in mind that more often than not, they stay on but it is still frequent enough to drive me insane.â€‹
