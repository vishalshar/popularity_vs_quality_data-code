Not sure if there is something wacky about the one I received, but the lid does not seal at all, it sits loosely on the bowl.  My 9 month old figured out how to get the bowl off within a few minutes, but it seems this is typical.  I'm keeping it in the hopes that the bowl may prove useful when he is learning to use a spoon, but as a bowl for finger food - not very useful.  Disappointed with this purchase.
