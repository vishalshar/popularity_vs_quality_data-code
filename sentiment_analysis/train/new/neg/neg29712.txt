Product works alright as a toddler bed, but is ridiculously difficult to clean and more importantly roll up for travel.  Unless you have to have one that doesn't blow up... I'd recommend something else.  Also by itself it doesn't have much cushioning.  I'd recommend buying a memory foam cushion to put under it.
