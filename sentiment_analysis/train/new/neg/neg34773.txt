It's a cup with Spongebob characters on it. Nothing very exciting. It leaks 90% of the time, from the top where the lid and cup screw together. The straws got chewed up within the first use, so if your kid likes to chew of straws, these won't last long. It seems more of a hassle cleaning the cups and storing liquids than it is really worth. You are really paying for the brand and characters, not for quality. Wouldn't recommend. Pay more for a better set of cups for your child, one that is actually spill-proof & leak-proof.
