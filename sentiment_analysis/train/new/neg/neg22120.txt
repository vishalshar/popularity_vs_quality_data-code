Let me say I'm a total OXO nut. I think they have remarkable design in their products, but these bibs fall short. See attached pictures of the mold that can grow on the material.Our son is 12 months old, and has been using 2 bibs for the past 6 months. I bought 2 to be able to rotate, and always have a dry one. I make sure the material completely dries out between feedings, and I am religious about using soap on them after each feeding--I wash it at the same time I wash the high chair tray. (FYI--the material does keep the moisture off the baby's chest; it feels like a specialized material that you'd find in a high-end gym bag to keep moisture from seeping into a different compartment).Also, I'd like to mention that I did try cleaning, including a bleach soak, followed by drying in the sun, and no luck in getting the mold to disappear. I'm not a 'mold freak' about it being on my kid, I just am annoyed by the fact that I can't get the bib clean, so it's basically rendered useless in my book.SWITCHING BRANDS: So far I've tried the 'Summer Infant' bib, and that does the job, but it doesn't nearly have the nice curve to catch the food that the OXO bib has; too bad).I'D BUY: Only to store in my diaper bag for mobile feedings. I like the fact that it curls up and locks closed. Even with the drippy, sloppy feedings of a toddler it kept his neck dry.I'D STAY AWAY: From using this as a daily bib.Last item to mention: I live in a dry climate in Southern California--aka a desert--so general humidity in the air is not an issue that would contribute to this problem.
