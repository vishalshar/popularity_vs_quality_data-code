I probably would have given it 3.5 stars if I could have.  I bought this pillow towards the end of 1st trimester.  I am now in my third trimester and sleeping is now extremely uncomfortable.This pillow does help.  There are some pros and cons, though.  I've never used a full body pregnancy pillow but I love the fact that this pillow doesn't take up a ton of room in bed- this was really important to me when considering between this and the full pregnancy pillow.  My husband and I really like our own space while sleeping.It is also really easy to turn onto your other side with it between your legs.  I like the fact that I can have part of it between my knees and the other part underneath my belly for the support.  It also works great to prop myself up while I'm watching tv in bed.  My husband loves to cuddle with it too and I have to ask him for it back when I'm ready to use it!  I also really like that the cover is removable and washable.My only real problem with it is that the pillow is too soft.  Sometimes when I need extra support I have to sort of squish it and double up underneath my knees and then use a regular pillow for under my belly, or vice versa.  I also don't think it'll last through a second pregnancy.  It is already collapsing due to heavy, every night use.  And I still have lots of hip and back pain when I sleep.  It definitely hurts worse not to use any pillow at all though.
