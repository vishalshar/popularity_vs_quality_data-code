This crib met my expectations as far as aesthetics but we couldn't use/assemble the product because one of the bolts is defective and as a result I have a partially built crib sitting in my baby's room - a major inconvenience. The company has a website for part replacement and I've put in a request for a replacement so I'll review the product again once we actually get the replacement but needless to say this is a poor first impression of the Baby Mod brand.
