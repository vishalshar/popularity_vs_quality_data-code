I bought this tray because it's cheaper than the Beaba brand tray.  And the reviews made it sound like the food easily pops out.  After freezing some pureed peas in it, I had a really hard time getting it out of the tray.  I thought the food would come out easily, but no such luck.  I had to run it under hot water until the edges defrosted a little and then push the frozen puree out by turning the tray inside out.  Wasn't as easy as I had anticipated it to be and my hands got really cold from dealing with the frozen tray for some time.  I popped out all the food and stored them in a plastic bag, like ice cubes.  There was no way I could get just one out at a time.The cover doesn't seal like a Tupperware would, where you would feel confident that if it dropped or fell over, that the cover wouldn't pop off and the contents spill out.  The cover is pretty solid, so you could easily stack a few of these trays on top of each other.  That wasn't a big deal to me though.  But if you're concerned about odors getting into the food, then it'll probably be a problem for you.I'm actually really disappointed in this tray, although I'll continue to use it because having frozen cubes of food on hand is still convenient.
