I received this as a gift from my sister-in-law.  It worked pretty good for the first 6 months but then I started experiencing a lot of static and that has nothing to do with batteries because I always used it plugged in.  I changed the channel and that temporarily solved the problem, but got static problems later on.Now today....the receiver is dead.  Completely dead.  I have had the receiver in the same location, plugged in the same outlet, for the past 6 months.  Today I turned on the monitor in my room while the receiver was on in his room and it was all static.  I switched channels and the same thing.  Then I looked at the receiver and noticed the little green light showing that it's on wasn't on.  The thing just DIED!  I'm so frustrated and I don't think I'll buy another Safety 1st item ever again.
