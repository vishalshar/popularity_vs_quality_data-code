The plastic stretches which leads to it being not the size of the screen anymore. With the protector on it (which creates bubbles because it stretches out as you pull it off the sheet) it makes your screen feel....sticky? You can't slide your finger easily anymore because it feels like you're trying to slide over rubber. This is by far the worst screen protector I have ever bought. Plus if you want to read instructions on how to use it you can only do so by watching a video on their website (it just simply does not get delivered with instructions) so you're watching a video on the phone you're about to put a terrible screen protector on before you can do so leads to not being able to apply it while watching the video. I never leave reviews but I am so so disappointed and furious about this product that I had to let everyone know who cares about reading my statement....
