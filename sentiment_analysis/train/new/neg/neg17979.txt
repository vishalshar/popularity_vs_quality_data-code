Pro:1. This helped our baby sit up a little better. he was annoyed between ages 12-18 months because he couldn't see and this did make it better for him.Cons:1. This is LITERALLY a piece of cardboard that has been stiffened with some sort of coating. You could make your own for free. Someone else said that in a review I read and I didn't believe them. It REALLY is a variegated board with a coating. Just make your own.2. The real problem is that the angle of the stroller when adjusted all the way forward is just a little too far back for a 12-18 month old. maybe a 9-18 month old. They get board because they can't see. Once they get some ab muscles and can move better on their own they are happy.Summary:Wast of money and waste of time (shipping) but easy.
