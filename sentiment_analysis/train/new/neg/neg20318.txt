In the description of Material type, there is no mentioning of PVC, which is the material the mat is made of. You can go to the company website to double check this. The manufacturer proudly claims that the mat is free from other toxins but purposely withholds this piece of information. Customers have the right to know this to make an informed decision. I find it hard that Amazon allows this, even after I have complained to them.
