I bought this for use with my existing B-Agile stroller and Chicco Keyfit 30 carseat.  My first child was born before the B-Agile stroller came out (I used a Baby Trend frame to cart him around for the first 6 months).  With my second child now who is 2 months old currently, I want to be able to take walks in the neighborhood with the better ride which the B-Agile stroller provides.PROS-installs very easily and seems sturdy-Chicco carseat clicks into the adapter just like the car seat base so you know you have inserted it properlyCONS-I verified this with Britax customer service, but the canopy of the B-Agile stroller cannot open fully (only the first segment with the mesh window will open).  This is a problem for any carseat which is too wide because it blocks the other segments from opening.  This to me is a real con because as Chicco carseat owners know, the canopy is skimpy.  It was important to me to be able to shield my baby better with a combo of the two canopies.-B-Agile stroller much harder to steer with a carseat inserted because it quite top heavy
