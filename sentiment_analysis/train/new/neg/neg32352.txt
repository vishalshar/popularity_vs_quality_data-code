The description on the product page says, "directional stop prevents gate from swinging out over stairs". And yet, this morning the gate swung out over our stairs, and my toddler almost fell down an entire flight of stairs. The only reason that he didn't fall down was that I happened to be standing right next to him, caught him by the collar of his shirt, and yanked him back just as he was about to topple down. It was sheer luck that my son didn't fall, nothing more. It was horrifying to me b/c of the close call but also b/c I have an infant that hangs out by this gate all the time too, and it could easily have been him instead...no longer, as we are returning it ASAP and getting a better gate. You cannot rely on this gate to protect your children.I have attached a photo of the gate opening over the stairs. The mechanism to prevent the gate from opening towards the stairs is very poorly designed. It is cheaply made and the stopper (the part which prevents the gate from being opened accidentally or by a child being curious) is about 3/16th of an inch thick. Very easy to push it open and have it swing out over the stairs. It can happen to anyone...please do your family a favor pick a better, sturdier gate and skip this one!
