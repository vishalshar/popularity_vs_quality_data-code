Bag is of quality construciton.  I actually returned the item because it was to small for what I needed.  The customer service was great when I did choose to return the item.  I attempted to put the following items in the bag:  2 Playtex Narrow Bottles, 6 diapers, wipes in the provided wipe container (Which only holds about 12 wipes).  Also wanted to put additional formula in one of those Munchkin Brand three slotted containers.  Other items was a blanket and a change of clothes.  The Munchkin brand container and similar sized items were too wide to fit in bag.The straps were kind of narrow as is the bag in general.  Does not carry like you average back pack that you would be use to from going to school.
