My son loves this and has played with it for months, we kept it suctioned to his high chair, tonight his finger got stock in the bobble head part!!! He's seven months old and when my husband was finally able to break the head and free the toy his finger was so smashed it looked like the end was about to fall off!!! He finally fell asleep after crying for over an hour! The photos below are after 30 minutes when the indentations came out of his finger and it started to swell. He's bending it and the swelling has gone down slightly but if it starts to swell more we will be going to the ER and we will be reporting this toy!!!
