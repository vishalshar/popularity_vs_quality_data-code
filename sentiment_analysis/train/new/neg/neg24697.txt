These are very small in size and "paper-towel-like", kinda feel like napkins that are made with recycled paper. We bought a pack and just couldn't use it because it is so small. I'd rather just use paper towel instead if I were to use these. For us we now use the babies R Us brand, they are much bigger and has a plastic feel to it, which is much more durable.
