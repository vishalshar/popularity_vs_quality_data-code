After seeing how good of reviews these locks received, I decided to purchase a set of them over a number of other locking devices I was looking at.  While the concept of these locks is great, the product itself leaves something to be desired - particularly when it comes to installation.  I cannot even begin to tell you how god awfully frustrating these are to install.  The placement of the catch to the lock itself is crucial, hence the reason they supply adhesive templates for where both pieces should be mounted.  Unfortunately, the portions of the template that supposed to be removed to expose the adhesive portion...don't (see attached pictures).  I swear the paper backing was super glued on as some sort of cruel joke to an already stressed out new dad.  I tried everything to peel the backing off.  I even got my wife with her professional adhesive backing removing nails to try to get it off, to no avail.  I finally got a razor blade out and was able to SCRAPE away the paper to expose small sections of the adhesive material, but not enough complete the installation.  I tried all of the eight templates and each one had the same result.  I'm hoping that this is actually a good product and I just got a bad batch...
