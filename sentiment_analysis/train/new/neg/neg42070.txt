This brand of blankets were a favorite of my son when he was a baby (he's 5 and still wants them in his bed). I ordered the Bunny Love pack for my then unborn niece, but when my brother-in-law took a picture of her today upon her arrival home from the hospital in a blanket with green elephants on it, I mentioned that they looked like the same brand, and he said that it was the blanket they received from us. I'm very disappointed that product I ordered was not what was delivered. I'm just relieved that they didn't get one with cars or monkeys.
