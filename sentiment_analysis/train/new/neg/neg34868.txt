The handles I ordered came in good condition, however I missed the small insert in the description that says to chose colors via email. I assumed they were green and orange as they are shown in the photo. This seller needs to add color choice into the ordering form like other products use for color and size. Since I ordered three sets, they sent me one of each color, but now my son has two pink handles. This could all be remedied with an add in for color choice and I am unsure why they would not utilize this tool.
