We already had a camera and monitor for our first kiddo, and purchased this additional camera. Set-up was easy to connect to the existing system. Image quality with the newer camera is significantly better (don't know if that's because of wear and tear over time, or what). Sound quality seems the same. The cons are that this new camera doesn't swivel and move almost anywhere like the first one, so I am struggling to aim the thing and have to prop it up with boxes and whatever I can to angle it down over the side and into the crib.With this system, you can set it to mute and only turn sound on the monitor when a noise is detected by the camera unit. Pretty cool, except that what stinks is that if I have my monitor set to view and hear kiddo number two, and kiddo number one starts crying, it doesn't make any noise at the monitor. It was a pretty cheap setup, as far as baby monitors go, so we suck it up. If I could go back, I might have done the monitors differently.The bottom line is that if you have one kid and are watching multiple rooms, this is a decent, inexpensive option. If you have (or will have) multiple kids you want to monitor, you might want to keep researching.
