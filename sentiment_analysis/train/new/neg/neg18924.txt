The spoon is soft so i don't have to worry about it cutting her mouth and the curve allows me to scoop the right amount to her mouth.  I like that it has a travel case as it was only used when we went out.However, after about 6 months of use, a crack developed in the silicone, it was always hand washed and the silicone remains soft.  I don't believe my daughter bit it as it was a crack and no bits were missing.  I'm disappointed with the short shelf life - but was happy with it's usefulness while it lasted.I purchased the 2 spoon set(without the case) as i still have the case to use with my 2nd baby- hoping the crack was a fluke.
