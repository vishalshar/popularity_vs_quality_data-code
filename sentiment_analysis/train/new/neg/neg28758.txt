I had the diaper genie before I got this. It broke. Sadly. It worked better than this does but it was a lot uglier in case that matters to you. The diaper dekor is a decent looking diaper contraption, and it means well, but it just doesn't seal out the smell like I want it to. I started attaching air fresheners to the inside and outside of it to help with the smell but it can get pretty rank. Thank goodness for the trap door between the can and the lid... that thing is a lifesaver in more ways than one. Not only does my 16 month old really really want to dig for her used diapers for some sick twisted reason, she also loves getting her arm stuck in there. So we figured out that you can lock that trap door and stop that madness in it's tracks. I also love the trap door because it does contain the smell better than you'd think.. but the moment you pop a diaper through that bad boy prepare for a nasty nasty puff of the foulest smelling air you can imagine. I usually hold my breath before I put a diaper in and then run as fast as I can to get away from the lingering odor. I imagine changing the diaper bag more frequently would help but we do change it at least 2 times a week. I realize I could change it every day but then again, why would I buy this? I could do that with a normal trash can. And I live in an apartment with the garbage like a mile away from my building... why am I justifying my actions to you?  The point is... it's OK. It could be better. If you're on the fence between this one and the diaper genie (which has it's own flaws trust me), and your main concern is smell.. the diaper genie wins. But if you have an older child who wants to get into it and play with their old diapers.. this one is a good option for keeping them out... just know that none of these is a miraculous cure for the nasty smell of poopy diapers.
