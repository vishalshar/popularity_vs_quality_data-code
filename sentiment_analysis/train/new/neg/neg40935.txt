Loved the concept! And they did work great...... for a while..... The first problem came around 2-3 months the insert just would fit as easily. We do dishwasher them on the top shelf. So they would pop out randomly with simple knock-overs and defeat the purpose.The BIG problem can around 6 months. The edges start cracking. I didn't think anything of it at first. But after they crack, pieces start to come off.... Sometimes while they are drinking or falling into their drink.If you don't mind the price, can afford to toss in a few months and buy different ones do it. BUT if you want a product to last for longer than six months and thru multiple children buy something else.
