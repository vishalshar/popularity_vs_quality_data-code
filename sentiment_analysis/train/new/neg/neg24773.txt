Maybe useful for the mini sippy cup that I think you buy as a bottle and then replace nipple later, but pretty useless for the standard sippy cup as it has a bottom on it (not just a sleeve) so it's like a beer cozy.  Because of the bottom it only comes up about 1/3 of the way, I had imagined a sleeve that I could slide up to the middle of the sippy where my daughter holds it.
