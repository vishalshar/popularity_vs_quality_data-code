This is my second Graco stroller, and I went straight to Graco when I first knew my wife was pregnant! What a disaster! There are some serious safety concerns on this stroller. The very first one you can notice is as soon as you assemble it, you feel the handler some like loosy. What I did to go around it was I folded it totally down (there are two side buttons you press together). As your baby starting sitting by himself, he'll fall back sometimes, and that's when you'll see the side junctions are too high, extremly dangerous for a baby to hit the back of his head. The front handler is soft, but has a small device on the middle that works along with the baby car seat. A protection should be added (and we do so) to avoid the baby of hitting his head or avoid you of hitting his knee or legs when pulling him out of the stroller. There are too many metal and plastic parts that a baby can get hurt on. We also had to put some softners to make it more confortable.
