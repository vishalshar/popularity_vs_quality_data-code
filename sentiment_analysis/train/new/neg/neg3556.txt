The mulitple compartments are nice, (if you can remember where everything is). The only problem is the seam down the front tore after 1 month of use, making it one big compartment that hung open so far you couldn't use that space. Its not as sturdy as of diaper bags I've seen and used. I actually am going to try to return it or at least exchange for a new one so I can give it another try.
