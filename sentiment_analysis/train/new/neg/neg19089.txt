Usually I'm pleased with Jeep products but this was a fail. The bottom pocket of the organizer is only attached to the rest of the organizer by velcro. I decided not to use the bottom pocket since it seemed like it would just fall off. The rest of the pockets will hold a few things but mostly the contents will spill out. I still use this organizer to keep stuff for my kiddo but it really doesn't do the job I wanted. I will probably buy a different one very soon.
