The whole concept of the pacifier closing when dropped is amazing and the panda decoration is so cute but the structural design is off.  The 2 pieces that close over the part the baby sucks on stick out too far when the pacifier is open and when the baby is sucking on the pacifier it leaves red marks on their cheeks and also tends to fall out more because of this.  Designers should have angled back the plastic to accommodate for the protruding covers.
