Great quality, beautiful pictures, good size.I'm subtracting two stars for the price. It's my fault for not noticing that there are only 6 cards. Six cards is not enough to hold a kid's attention, although you can flip them over for a reverse-color version of the same thing. I ended up taping them to the inside of my kid's crib for her to look at.
