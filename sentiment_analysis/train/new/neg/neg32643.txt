JUNK!  JUST PLAIN JUNK!They to not keep the fizz in soda. They are nearly impossible to remove. Even my big strong husband has a hard time removing them. He couldn't get one off yesterday so it sat on the kitchen counter all night. He tried again this morning and finally got it off. They are going in the garbage. You are better off pouring any left over soda in a small glass bottle (from juice or club soda) with a screw on cap.THEY ARE A WASTE OF MONEY!
