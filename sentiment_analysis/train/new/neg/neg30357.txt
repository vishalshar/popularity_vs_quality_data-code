I got this nice-looking gate to use in our living room where we have very pretty wood that I didn't want to drill and where a white pressure-mounted gate would look strange.  The first one I received was a little warped so if the bolts were tight enough to keep the gate secure, it was impossible to open.  Customer service was very nice and replaced it with a working unit without much fuss.  But ultimately I think we have more dings on the wooden door frame from this thing getting knocked out of place and having to be pushed back than I would have had with some nice, neat screw holes and a hardware-mounted wood gate.  Part of the problem may be that the space is just wide enough for the rubber pads -- it might be less problematic with a little more wiggle room for the mounting pads.
