I thought it was "ok" the colors were a little duller than I tought. I was hopping the brown would be a little darker but it a little "washed off" brown. My nursery id a tiffany blue and looked ok with it. I do use the diaper holder a lot but i did not use the pillow. After a few washes the string fell ripped off and could not use the bumpers any more. I may or may not buy again
