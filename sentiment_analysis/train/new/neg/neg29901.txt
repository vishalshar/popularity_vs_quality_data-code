I bought the Combi Twin Sport 2 double stroller for my daughter-in-law.  When it arrived, she was quite pleased with how it came out of the box ready to roll - no assemby required.  She was also quite pleased with how light-weight it was and how small it folded up to.  However, the first time she took it to the zoo, she found the storage space to be a very big problem.  The baskets underneath the stroller are very small and very difficult to get to.  She had put my purse in one of the baskets and I had to get down on my knees to get it out.  We ended up returning it for one by Graco which was just as lightweight but had much larger and handier storage.  If storage isn't a problem for you, this is a very well-built stroller.
