I purchased this product a year and half ago. The non-skid material at the back of the seat started to stick to the leather seats of my Infiniti. I suspect that this material deteriorates with thermal cycling. I managed to remove most of this sticky material from my leather seats but some of it remains stuck probably forever. This was a disappointment given that the product is advertised as a "Premium 2-in-1 seat Protector". For me, it's definitely not a good seat protector if you have leather seats in your car.
