We've had these about four months.  About a month ago, I noticed that one of the nipples had almost completely ripped off (a huge choking hazard). I wrote to the company and they sent me a coupon, but asked for the item and the original packaging, which I obviously didn't have anymore.I mostly figured it was a fluke, but continued to check the nipples daily to make sure they were ok (you can never be too safe).  Well, today another one has started to rip off.  So, these are going out and we're going to find something else.
