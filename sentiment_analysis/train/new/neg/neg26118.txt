I purchased this item because I recently gave birth to my second child. We already owned the Graco nasal aspirator and were happy with it but I didn't want to use the same one on both kids. I thought that having disposable collection was super sanitary and that meant I didn't have to carry two around. WHAT A WASTE!! This thing does not get the job done. It says on the packaging that it only gives you 5 seconds to get the job done. If you have ever chased a 2 year to clean her nose you know you need more than 5 seconds! And with my newborn....forget it! And the disposable part is really only good for one use. Trust me I tried...it deflated but once dried it became clogged and would not suck out any more.
