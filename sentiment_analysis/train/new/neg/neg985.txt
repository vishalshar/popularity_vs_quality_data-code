I'm really surprised at the positive reviews. This product looks like it came from a dollar store! I ordered 8 of these for a thank-you package, and the whisk on all of them is either bent or crooked and the top does not rest seamlessly on the base as the picture implies. I certainly wouldn't use this to cook with, and I'm a bit embarrassed to even include it in my gift bag for this weekend.Edit: I forgot to mention that the paint is chipped in multiple places on the yellow chick part, as well.
