This walker has been a real let down in more than one way.  Most importantly, and it is a safety issue, there is no padding at all between the cute, colorful cover and the hard plastic underneath.  While this isn't that big a deal around the tummy area as a baby blanket is a nice buffer, it is most definitely a problem when it comes to the headrest.  It is hard, and when the baby's head went back a bit and hit it - HARD - he cried, and I felt like crying myself.  So now I find that I have to drape a fluffy blanket over the headrest portion as well as a baby blanket folded up between his tummy and the play tray.  Naturally the blankets work their way out of position, and usually fall out and obstruct him walking with the walker.  I have seen plenty of walkers that have ample padding in the appropriate areas, meaning no blankets need to be used for comfort and safety.  Oh, how I wish I had bought one of those.  There was no way of telling when I was looking at the listing of this walker that it is such an uncomfortable piece of hard plastic - most especially when it comes to little ones heads.  Please, look at a different walker.  Don't buy this one.  One other thing.  The cross piece on the play tray that goes across several inches in the center with little toys on it - it simply will not stay in place.  The bits that are to hold it in place in the tray are malformed in some way and it keeps coming undone on one side.  Calling customer service was also a disappointing experience.
