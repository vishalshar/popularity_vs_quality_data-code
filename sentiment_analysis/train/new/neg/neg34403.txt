I really love the one piece top that these cups have, no parts to loose, replace, or to slide out of place and leak. They are super easy to clean with no bottle brush needed.Now the down side, I got these cups for my 3 year old son who has just found the fit stage in life. He is in the throwing faze. You know the one where they throw themself down,  throw their toys, cups, and anything else in reach when they don't get the answer that they want. Yes, that stage. Well I thought that I had found my new favorite sippy cups until he threw his cup one angry afternoon and it literally split up the whole side, milk flew everywhere and cups went straight into the trash, all of them!So if you have a child that isn't going to throw and drop this cup then really it is a fantastic cup, if not I would say find something a little more sturdy.
