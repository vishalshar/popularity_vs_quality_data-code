came broken i guess.  It feels super flimsy and fragile.  the parental unit crackles and pops when its receiving any signal at all.  the monitor has a blue light that shines from the bottom of the unit but it seems to turn off and on at will.  your getting what you pay for.  spend the $49 for a higher quality one.
