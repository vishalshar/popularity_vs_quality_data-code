These are absolutely horrible. My 4 year old has problems with bed wetting so I ordered these rather than repeatedly buy pull-ups. My babies are cloth diapered so I figured I'd just wash these with that laundry bc it wouldn't be any more work on my part. I washed twice before wearing them on him bc I figured they'd need at least two washes to gain maximum absorbency. They leaked the first night so the second night I added a hemp insert, the leaked again. The fit is good around the top and legs. With as bulky as they are there should be no leaking and no reason to add an extra insert. My son literally looks like he has a giant marshmallow butt! It's insane how bulky they are. I wouldn't mind the bulk if they actually absorbed but they leak every single time he wears them. I've tried microfiber, hemp, cotton and nothing works. My son is limited to only a small sip of water after supper before bed and goes to the bathroom before getting his pjs on... I wish I could return this product as I bought two. 60 dollars down the drain ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜”
