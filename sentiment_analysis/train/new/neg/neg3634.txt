You get what you pay for, and that's just what I got. I purchased the mattress to accompany a toddler bed, but ended up switching it out with my daughter's crib mattress. The matress is fine for the crib,  but on the toddler bed, it just didn't work, because every time someone over 20 pounds would sit on the mattress, it would flip up on the other side! There just isn't enough support or weight to the mattress. I spent 3x the amount on the crib mattress and when I put it on the toddler bed, it resolved then issue.
