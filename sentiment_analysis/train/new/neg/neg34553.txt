I bought this hamper for my 3-year-old son's room.  He has used it for a few months. The very first day he had ripped it around the handles.  Now it is ripped in more places and is kind of falling apart.  It was smaller than expected and the handles were not very durable.  When I pick it up full, it feels like they are going to break.  They are just ribbons really.  I ordered and bigger, sturdier one for him and am throwing this one away.
