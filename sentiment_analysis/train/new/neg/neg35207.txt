I totally agree with prior reviews regarding the suction strengh, it is very weak. I also got this pump via the insurance company as breast pumps are free as provisioned by the Affordable Care Act.  The pump is extremely weak.  It is very frustrating and time consuming to wait for the drops of milk. When I 1st received the unit, the pump did not have any suction. After calling Ameda customer service, it was determined that I have a bad adaptor.  I also told them that the flange was too big for me and they said they will send me smaller flanges as a courtesy.  I am very pleased with the customer service, but it is the pump that is what matters. The new adaptor solved the suction problem however, the "smaller" flanges are flexible "inserts" that I would need to insert into the hard plastic flanges. The flexible insert flanges have three small holes at the end where the milk should then drop into the milk container. However, my milk will always build up at he tip and accumulate there instead of flowing freely and easily into the milk container. In addition, to create a tight seal around the breast and the flexible flanges, I would need to press the unit harder against my chest. Sigh, I am going to go back to another pump I used three years ago.  in my opinion, it is such a waste of money for the government/insurance company to provide such a poor pump to the public.
