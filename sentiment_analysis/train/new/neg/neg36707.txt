i got this thinking it would help stay in reach for my son so he wouldnt freak if it fell out of his mouth. thats the idea i got from other reviews. but in my experience its just a boring toy. he actually used it like 3 times. other than that it just hung out on the shelf. he never used it again. so hes now 6 months and not interested in one either way so a 20 dollar product went in the trash. if it were cheaper it wouldnt be too bad but its a little pricey for a stuffed mcdonalds toy (basically)
