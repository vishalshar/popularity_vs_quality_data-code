The stroller was nice and loved the basket under the seat.  However, the wheels were a big disappointment.  They are hollow plastic and look like something you would put on a doll stroller.  For the price, this stroller will do me fine for my occassional strolls when my granddaughter visits.  But I wouldn't purchase it for a full time stroller.
