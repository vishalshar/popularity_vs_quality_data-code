I gave 3 stars because the camera is excellent if you get one that works.  I originally purchased the entire system (camera, monitor display, charging cradle) from Target.  The first one we purchased kept malfunctioning.  In the middle of the night the display would randomly turn to black with a lost connection message.  So we brought it back and exchanged it for another system that has been working great since March of 2014 (it is now September 2014).  We decided it would be nice to have a second camera for the lower level of the house.  It is hard to find one that is compatible with the Baby Touch "BOOST" system in stores so we purchased this from Amazon.  After less than a month of use the camera started to malfunction in a similar manner to what we experienced with our original system.  In addition to loosing contact with the display, the camera would also pan and zoom on its own.  I am giving the item 3 stars because if you are lucky enough to get one that isn't defective it is awesome with great resolution and night vision.
