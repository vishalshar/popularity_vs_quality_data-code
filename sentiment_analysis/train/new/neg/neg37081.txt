Yes, this product looks pretty good but the wood is definitely already scuffed and gouged in places, just from putting it together! Not very durable, it seems. I should have read the reviews closely and followed the recommendations concerning:The dresser is SUPER small. There's no way it's going to hold much past the 12 month mark. The clothing will simply get too big!This furniture is also VERY noxious smelling. We aired out the room for 3 wks. and when we have the door closed overnight it STILL gives an odor the next morning!!! We purchased this set over 3 months ago, so that's a long time to have fumes going on.If I had known when purchasing this that the a) soft wood b) ridiculously small dresser and c) noxious off-gas fumes were going to be such a bummer I wouldn't have purchased this and would've spent the extra money on a better set. Bummer.Also, the glider material is super cheap so I have covered mine with other fabric to help protect it. Consider yourself warned!
