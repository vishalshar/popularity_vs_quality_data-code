I ordered two of the covers for the long rails of my son's crib and a package of two side rail covers (sold separately, but by the same manufacturer) in the gray color. The grays didn't match! The two long rail covers (pictured on the left) are a noticeably lighter blue/gray. The short rail covers (pictured on the right) are the color gray I expected. I plan to re-order the long rail covers to see if it was somehow a fluke, but I'm not holding my breath. I may have to switch to another color entirely rather than stick with the mismatched gray covers. Very disappointing.
