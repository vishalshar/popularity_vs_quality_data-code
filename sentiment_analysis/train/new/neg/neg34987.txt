I LOVE the fact that these are great for the environment and they are sure to save us $$$! I bought these months before our baby was born we bought the smallest one the amazon hadand they were extremely huge....but cute. So I was not able to use them until he turned 8weeks and he was 11.5lbs, when we diapered him they were still large. So i begin to wash and dry them and they shrunk a little which was ok for us, he is now 15lbs and they fit perfect just bulky...(looks like he has a huge fanny its so cute to me).I don't like the fact that the diapers leak through to his clothes especially when were out & about and I have to keep changing his clothes :-(. So we use these only when were home, still looking for cloth diapers to wear when were out...So overall they are cute, stains come right out and fit great on our 15lb angel, but they leak straight through to the clothing.,so im not sure if all cloth diapers do this as these are our first set.Hope this helps with your purchase decision!!:) NOTE:  This review is from a paying customer your negative opinion on my experience with the product i ordered is not needed!!
