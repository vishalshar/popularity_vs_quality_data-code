My 11 week old breastfed baby was diagnosed with mild acid reflux (she doesn't vomit, it comes up in her throat causing crying spells from the heartburn).  She also has a sensitive stomach and is gassy so we decided to try these when she was 8 weeks old.  They were horrible!  We like the Playtex Premium Nurser and the Playtex Ventaire (chubby bottles) MUCH better.  We tried the regular Dr. Browns, but she choked on the nipple so we ordered the chubby bottle that has the nipples more like the breast.  With both kinds she sucked too hard and ate too fast...when I sat her up to burp her after her usual 5 minutes (@ one ounce with the Playtex bottles), to my surprise she had already sucked down 3 ounces!  We had a horrible night both times we tried the Dr. Browns - she cried all night from a bad tummy ache from the fast flow (we used the slow flow nipples even!).  I also have a friend that had the same problem with her baby choking and gagging on the slow flow nipples' too-fast-flow (formula fed baby).  I HIGHLY recommend the Playtex bottles - they are easy to clean and never leak.  We only tried Dr. Brown to see if it would alleviate the GERD symptoms - it did not!!!!
