Buying a car seat is STRESSFUL. I definitely felt pressured to buy a Britax, which everyone swears is the best, but we couldn't afford it. A co-worker offered me some valuable advice: it's a car seat, and no matter what the price, they wouldn't be allowed to sell it if it didn't do it's job, right? That set me at ease, so we went with a mid-range costing seat from the well-respected Graco brand.A few main selling points for me: I liked that this seat had two cupholders, which can be removed for washing. I also liked that the cover can be removed for washing (as I learned, this is surprisingly not a feature on all seats!). The fact that it will seat our child comfortably up to 65 lbs is nice, though who knows if we will want to get a booster seat by then. The padding is decent and the seat is not excessively large in size, which I've read can be an issue for some models. At 16 months old, our son has been using it for about 4 months and is perfectly comfortable.There are a few drawbacks. Installation was a bit tricky and frustrating because the strap can be difficult to tighten, but once the seat's in, it's in -- I wouldn't let that deter you from purchasing it unless you will need to remove and reinstall your car seat on a regular basis. Because of his age, our son is still rear-facing, and while I can tighten the seat belt I don't always feel like I can get it as tight as I'd like without effort. I'm not sure if the straps are catching on something underneath the seat, or what.This seat has served us well so far. There may be a few things I'd prefer were different, but the main thing is that my son is safe and comfortable. He doesn't gripe about being strapped into it and sometimes has fallen asleep in it before we even started the car. It's a great seat if you are looking for a reliable company and don't want to break the bank.
