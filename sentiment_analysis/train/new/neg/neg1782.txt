I bought this for my 2-yr-old.  Six months later, she hasn't shown too much interest in it, and I don't care for the functionality.As other reviewers noted, the buttons are very difficult even for an adult with average-sized hands to work.The belt is too small/tight to be interesting to her and too simplistic to actually each her anything about fastening a belt.  I wish it either had a style with notches or the two d-rings that need to be navigated.The zipper page does not allow for practice in starting the zipper - you know, the hard part that might require some effort and concentration on her part.I haven't figured out purpose of the clock yet.My daughter isn't ready for it yet, but the shoe-tying page might be good ... if the inherent flimsiness of a fabric book doesn't make it too difficult.
