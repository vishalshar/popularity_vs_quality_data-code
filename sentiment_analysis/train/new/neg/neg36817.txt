This girdle is way to expensive to have so many flaws! First off if you have any booty what so ever this will give you MAJOR panty lines and a wedge! And it was to short for me and I'm not a tall person (5"3') because it was short it gave me a muffin top and back cleavage which isn't pretty! And if you go off their sizing chart you will be buying another girdle in a few weeks. Overall I'm disappointed in the product considering it cost me $100 it didn't meet my expectations
