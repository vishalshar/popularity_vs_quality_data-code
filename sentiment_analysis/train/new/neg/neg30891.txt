this is going back asap. picture is very cute and promising, reality is different. it looks very cheap, as if it's made in china. the strap is very thin, flimsy and not sturdy enough. i'm sure that when that bag is full of stuff it will cut into your shoulder and be very uncomfortable. i also didn't like that it lacked inside pockets. also the bottle holder is small (i do not think it fits an 8oz bottle but only a 4oz one), not insulated with aluminium foil as other brands, it just have regular lining. overall the bag size is perfect for what i was looking for, but i don't think is worth just for that. you get what you pay for.
