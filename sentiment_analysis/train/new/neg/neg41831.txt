These ARE very pretty prints...and they ARE on nice quality paper....but that's all it is...photo paper. I knew they weren't framed but I guess I expected them to consist of a little more considering the price. I should have read the reviews because I see now that some mentioned paper prints. Nice...but the high cost for what you get is the reason for my 2-star rating.
