I had a medela pump before this that worked amazing but being a working mom I used it a lot and it needed a part replaced I couldn't find anymore(after a year and a half) so I bought this one.  It's awful.  After 20 minutes I don't even think I have half an ounce. My hand hurts and it doesn't extract any milk.
