I waited for a while to post this review since I have really mixed feelings about these hooks.  Pros: they are well made and durable.  The velcro that holds them onto the stroller handles is tough and I don't have any fears that they will fall apart on me.  Cons: If you want to move them from stroller to stroller, then they are just as cumbersome to deal with as the others that are for sale--only these are far more expensive.  In fact, I would have returned them except for the fact that I didn't want to pay for the return shipping.  I regret not buying an open hook because getting my diaper bag onto these is tricky and I have to support it with my knee so that I can get it high enough to latch onto the carabiner.  I feel like they "get" you with this by pricing them so high that no one wants to return them.  I probably wouldn't purchase these again.
