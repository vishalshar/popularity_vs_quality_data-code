Cute but flawed design. Nipples and rings dangle precariously on the short "branches", easily toppled over with a mere bump or whilst reaching for other items. Moreover, zoom in on the base -- super slim. With the weight of multiple nipples and items on the branches, it becomes top-heavy and has a tendency to tip. Every time I go to grab an item, i accidentally knock over others.Design-wise, the base should be a tad bigger for stability, and the branches slightly longer to prevent frequent "fall-out". In summary, it's cute BARE and minimal when empty -- but when laden with bottle accessories, it looks like a clusterf*k of stuff attached to a stick.If you're looking for a clean, streamlined look, then just get a bigger patch of "grass" instead and have everything neatly laid out.
