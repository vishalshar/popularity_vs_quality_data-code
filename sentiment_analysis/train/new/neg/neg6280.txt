It bothers me hat I can't close this bag 100%. Great for use as a trash can liner of sorts but when it comes to bringing the bag to the laundromat I can't get it fully closed because of the stretch band top which means I can't fully contain the smell. None of this would matter of course if you have a washer/dryer at home.
