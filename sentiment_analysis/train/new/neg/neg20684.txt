My twin boys are 14 months old and can now escape from these chairs. Yes, even buckled in. Yes, even with the tray on. The back pads were ripped off early on and we stopped using the dishwasher safe part of the tray because it was much more work to have that to clean as well as all the food that sinks down the sides of it. You have to clean the bare tray either way, so we just had them eat directly on it. I think if the straps were designed better - as in, not with all three straps coming out of only one hole/port/source - this may work for hyper toddlers. As is though, they can turn completely around and slither out the top even with the straps tightly secured. I don't have girls, but maybe girls are generally calm enough as toddlers for this to work well? Just a thought.
