This drawer has great reviews among products in the same category, so after much contemplation, we decided to purchase it for our nursery.After assembling the drawer, I felt very disappointed for the design and manufacture of this product. Although the material is wholesome hardwood, the craftsmanship is not even comparable to Ikea. Assembling this product is frustrating. With all the pieces and parts barely fitting together and screws that can't go all the way in, the end result is a drawer that is barely standing upright.In terms of the design, the drawers does not take advantage of the bulky outer structure, cheating the storage space by at least 40% of its potential. If you are someone who cares about the details and the fit, this gruesome drawer will keep you awake at night. If you still decide to get it, purchase it after your morning sickness goes away and months before the baby arrives because the paint DOES stink.
