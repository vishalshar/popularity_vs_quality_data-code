Bought this for my infant who had outgrown the carry seat. I have a highlander SUV and this barely fits behind the front seat. I had to put it behind the passenger seat.now someone can sit there but they will have little legroom and  recline. This will be corrected somewhat when the car seat can be more upright but infants under 22 pounds are supposed to be at the full recline mode per the seats instructions. Over that they can be more upright. Something needs to be placed under the front of the base base to achieve the recline. I like that it goes to 40 pounds rear facing and 65 front facing. I like the reclinable base but wish it was removable. The fabric ranges from soft velour to a cloth like tweed pattern. I like the cushion inserts. This seat is very wide, could not be used in my center rear seat. Sits very high on the seat in recline rear facing. Its an overall nice seat,just will work better frontfacing.
