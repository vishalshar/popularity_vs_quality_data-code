I love the look of this mobile and my 2 month old loves it as well. I am very disappointed however at how quickly it broke. It will play music but will only spin half way then stops unless I manually move it. I got a better working mobile from Walmart 5 years ago when my son was an infant. Looked into returning it but it's past the allotted time frame so I'm stuck with a $50 mobile that's looks pretty but doesn't work as should.
