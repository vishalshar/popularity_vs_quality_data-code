I really wanted to like this pillow even though some reviewers had problems washing it.  I was hoping that by closely following the care instructions the pillow would stand up to washing.  Alas, it did not work. After one wash the filling turned into a lumpy clumpy mass.  There was even a dime sized hard lump of who knows what inside to top it off.  Sending the pillow back.  Shame as I was looking for something organic for my toddler to use and it was great before the wash.
