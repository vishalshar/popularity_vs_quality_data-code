I want to love this stroller, but it seems that we may have to replace it within the next year.  Attaching the car seat to the stroller is not easy.  I wish it was like the other perego strollers where you can just "click" it in, this one has two traps that you have to tether and you have to make sure to slide it in just right to make it straight otherwise the car seat is not aligned with the stroller, after 7 months, it still takes us time to place the car seat it just right.  If your baby is sleeping, poor baby is awoken from all the movement of trying to get the car seat strapped onto the stroller.  Not a smart design by perego!  It's easy to fold and light, which is what made me want this.  I have used this for 7 months now and the wheels rattle and shake when I walk a little too fast.  It feels like the wheels are about to pop off.  I have to walk very leisurely.  The whole stroller does not feel sturdy.  The handles also feel loose.  What I do love is how the seat can pretty much fully recline and the large hood.  We initially wanted to get the Maclaran stroller but bought this instead because of the large hood and the price.  I have a hand me down Graco stroller that feels much sturdier than this one and the Graco has already been through two other kids, my child being the third.  Like I said, I really want to love this stroller because I like the color and it matches my car seat, but it's just too flimsy!  I guess that's what I get for not checking out the stroller in the store before purchasing it!
