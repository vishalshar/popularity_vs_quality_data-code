this is my second svan chair, i now have one highchair and one youth chair. i think they are beautiful, that's why i'm sucked into buying them, but the screws often come a little loose so the chair gets a little wobbly and we always have to re-tighten. they also made the model a bit larger, which i really don't like because it's one of the reasons i was originally attracted to this chair, most other highchairs are huge and take up so much space. their new cherry colour is also not cherry at all - it used to be, but currently it's quite close to natural which was a bit disappointing. i actually prefer this chair as a youth chair (rather than an infant chair) because the baby part is a bit hard to get babies in and out of and it doesn't tilt back like a lot of the plastic ones do but as a youth chair, my 2 year old can climb in and out herself and sit and eat comfortably.
