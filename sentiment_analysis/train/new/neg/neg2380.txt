We purchased this same mattress 2 years ago for my sons pack and play. My son used this post pack and play as a reading corner cushion so When we had a new baby I got another one.  I am sad to say even ordering it from my old order this mattress is not the same size.  It leaves very dangerous gaps now he my youngest son can roll allowing his arm to get caught so we have now used the original matress in the pack and play.  Very disappointing
