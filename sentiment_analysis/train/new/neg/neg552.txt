There is the positive that my infant son does find the swing comfortable - the HUGE negative is that this swing is made from very CHEAP plastic and therefore gets EXTREMELY HOT very quickly (in the sun)...I don't want to have to bring layers and layers of blankets just to be able to place him in it.  Had I known it was this horrible of material - I would have paid more for a better swing.
