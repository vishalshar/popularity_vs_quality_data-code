I was very dissapointed in this product and returned it. It is flimsy and if a decently sized child ever actually got ahold of it while it was attached it would probably break right off. The stuffed toys were all slightly "off" looking and were not of a very good quality, and if I had screwed the attachment on firm enough to actually keep it upright it would have chewed the finish right off the crib (as it is it left a mark I had to paint over). If you HAVE to have your team, it's really the only thing out there on the market, be prepared it is NOT worth it unless you are die hard and don't care about the quality.
