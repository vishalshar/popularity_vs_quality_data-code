My son loves this!  He never puts it down...which is why we have bought 3 so far. Two of them have started leaking. We do not freeze it and only rarely put it in the refrigerator. Only because he carries it around everywhere will we get another. It has never burst, it just starts to leak. I'm not concerned about his safety, just irritated we have to keep buying the same product.
