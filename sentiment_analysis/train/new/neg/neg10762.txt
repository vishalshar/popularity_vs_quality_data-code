My twin boys LOVE these things! When they were 4 they picked out the 2 boys, snuggle bug and lil peanut.  Then later had to get the girls and now I'm getting the twins. I never watched boys play with dolls before, but its pretty amazing. They do care for them like babies; putting them to bed, feeding, and carrying them around. But they also pretend they are attack ninjas, throw them in trees, and hurl them at each other like snowballs. These pods are tough! They withstand very rough treatment and i've washed them a lot. I think all children benefit from playing with little toy people and these are great toys.
