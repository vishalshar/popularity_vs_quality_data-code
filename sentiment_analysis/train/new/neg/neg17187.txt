I used to sit on a Swopper [...] at my old office. It's unbeatable. Unfortunately my new office is more cramped and more formal, so I thought I'd try a seating disc on my regular chair to get some of that dynamic seating and core workout. Well... it's not bad but it's surprisingly uncomfortable if you use it for more than a couple of hours. As I don't have the space to put it aside every now and then, I ditched it and went in for a wedge cushion instead, so I get at least the pelvic tilt if not the dynamic seating. I think if this disc could be sheathed in a thick cover/case, it would be a winner.
