I wanted to love this. When the first one leaked, I assumed I must have had a faulty product since others who reviewed this loved it so much. So, I exchanged it for another one. The replacement leaked too. Perhaps it was because I didn't store it upright. I put it into a gallon-size Ziplock bag and threw the whole thing into my diaper bag. It was sideways, upside-down, maybe sometimes even upright... I don't know. But each time, there was a little leakage into the Ziplock bag. Not a lot leaked out (just a little), but I guess I was hoping for zero leakage. (Were my hopes too lofty?) Thankfully, I had the plastic bag; otherwise, items in the diaper bag would have gotten wet too.Otherwise, I think this is a great concept. It's a simple, practical and convenient design. Maybe it's the quality that is just lacking.I wouldn't automatically discourage others from getting it, especially if you don't just throw it (any which way) into your diaper bag like I did. If you have an upright pocket on your bag or if you have a way to keep it upright, it's perfect for you!
