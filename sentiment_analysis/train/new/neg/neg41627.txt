I wanted to love these sticks, but I had to throw them out. My son kept sticking the wrong end in his mouth and gagging on it. There's no way to ensure the right end goes in his mouth and is used safely unless I was holding him and the stick the entire time. If I wasn't holding him still, then he'd want to crawl or stand with the stick in his mouth. With as many face-plants as this kid has in the learning process of being a biped all I could imagine was him falling and jamming the stick into the back of his throat somehow. He also leaned on it once while crawling and the plastic of the shield immediately made a white stress mark. I did not need to have him do that again and have the shield snap unintendedly (yet another hazard). I did not feel like this was a safe teething tool for my son, and regret the money I spent on this item. I'd rather get something that is difficult for him to get that far back in his throat/mouth that's not a gagging hazard.
