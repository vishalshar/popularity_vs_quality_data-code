My 1-year-old son has had a difficult time finding sippy cups he likes.  He really didn't take to any of them, until these.  It was an easy step from a bottle, and the soft tips make drinking pretty easy.However, they really could be better.  In no particular order...(1) They're not very leak-proof at all.  Sure, some of it is that my kid's not very careful, but they'll spill a bit whenever they're dropped.  It's a sippy cup; it *will* get dropped!  Also, because of the tip design, a little bit of water or juice or whatever will be left at the top when the kid's done; this will spill, too.(2) The tip isn't well-vented and gets sucked into the cup.  As our son drinks, it gets worse and worse, almost turning itself inside out.  I need to squeeze the tip to let air in, and let the tip return to its form, regularly.  This also makes for more messy drinking.(3) One of the bottles just cracked from being dropped.  Yep, it'll happen, but these are more fragile than the other sippy cups we've bought.So, on the plus side, my kid loves them and drinks from them without complaint.  On the minus side, they're kind of awful in a few ways and much messier than most other sippy cups.  I guess that makes them three-star.I'd only recommend these as a transition step away from a bottle, or if your kid is having trouble with other sippy cups.
