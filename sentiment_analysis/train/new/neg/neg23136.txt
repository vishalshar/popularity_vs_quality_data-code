Bought these stickers for our baby's nursery and looked adorable...when they actually stayed on the walls. I am always trying to keep them up by putting pieces of tape on them bc our daughter loves looking at them, but it is a constant battle. Today the dolphin fell down, which seemed to be her favorite to look at, and was all stuck together...it ripped horribly and had to be thrown away. Not worth the money. We have some other wall stickers in her room, that are a different brand, and never have this issue.
