I wish I had read all the reviews for this washcloth (like the one above). As there are many different colors, people's reviews are spread out among all the different types, and I missed this one important review. As a result, I accidentally ordered these not knowing these were smooth cotton on one side and terry on the other. I was just looking for 100% cotton baby washcloths. So if you are looking for all terry washcloths, don't get these. Still, after looking closely at them after I opened the package, I did not think these are good quality, even if you want cotton/terry. The washcloths looked a bit stiff and looking at the stitching, it looked like a home project I could have done myself. The colors were cute, but the quality is not worth the price. I also am not sure why anyone would want smooth cotton on one side of their wash cloth, since that side would be less absorbent. But to each their own. Since I wanted to return them, I did not wash and use these washcloths, so I can't say how they are in use.
