Yes, this travel crib is lightweight. Yes, it is easy to set up and fold away. But, here's the thing: the mattress sits on the floor. If you have a baby whom you can just put down in his crib and he will go to sleep, then you'll probably have no problems with this crib. But if you have a baby who needs to be nursed/rocked/held to go to sleep, then you will quickly learn how difficult/damn near impossible it is to transfer a sleeping baby from your arms to a mattress on the floor! By the time I've leaned halfway over the edge of this crib, my sweet seven month old is already waking up. The journey down is so far that it's just physically impossible to do it as smoothly as I do at home. To be fair, it seems all travel cribs are designed this way, not just the Bjorn. (The Guava Family Lotus crib seems like it might be easier, with its side door, but I haven't tried that one and haven't done the research yet on its safety.) This crib might be better when my baby is older, or maybe just as a place to play.
