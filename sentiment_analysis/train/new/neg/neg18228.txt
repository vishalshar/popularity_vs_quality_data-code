I was hopping the cover would be fairly stiff... Its not. Whenever my carseat is properly sinched down in the seat, this cover just folds down into the seat as if there was nothing was there.Fed up with a couple of these now, I took a piece of cardboard, folded it a few times to make it stiff and placed it between the car seat and the seat cover... Works great and it was free.
