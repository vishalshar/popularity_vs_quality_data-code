It's ok and in theory would work on some babies who are not startled by it turning on. It is basically a heavy rubber ball inside the housing that spins around, so it needs to be mounted tight so the crib moves with the vibration of the rocker. I think it would work but wasn't able to attach it to my crib as it had the wider slats. I liked the noise detection operation and that seemed to work well but couldn't get it attached so it was useless to me.
