Cute cover with vibrant colors... But it fits slightly baggy on my Costco high back booster. BUT the fit can be overlooked as it is a "universal" cover and needs to accommodate several different styles of carseat design.That being said, my only major complaint is that the inner panel is Velcro. And when a child sits down in the seat the Velcro gets pulled down slightly exposing the rough Velcro material and potentially scratching the child's back and/or causing discomfort.I think that I can easily fix this with a few stitches along the inside of the panel, but then I will have to either cut the stitches out and replace them when I am done... or completely undo the seat, and take out the straps...  Regardless, the carseat cover does its job and looks cute. And for the price I am pleased. Although next time I might be tempted to put another $10 into the purchase to make up for the aggravation.
