We bought this car seat because it was highly rated, because it fits into an attachment for our stroller, and because "97% of one-year-olds" will still fit it. Guess what, our 7-month-old, who is 10 pounds lighter and 4 inches shorter than the size limit claimed, can no longer fit into this seat. Well, that's not exactly right - she fits the seat fine, but getting the straps over her shoulders is almost impossible, at least if she's bundled in her winter coat (kind of a necessity in February where we live). We've done all the adjustments we can, but there's just not enough strap. So tomorrow we'll be hitting the shops to shop for seats for 20 lbs and up.The other thing we've never liked about this seat is the fabric. It is plasticky, not soft and natural, and our baby has never found it especially comfortable. We should have handled the car seat in a retail store before ordering it online, to make sure that we liked the feel. Had we done so, we would not have ended up with this model.The final negative: we live in Europe, and this seat does not come with an EU safety certification. That means we've been driving her in an illegal car seat for seven months. (Most people shopping on the US site probably won't be affected by this issue, but we had to buy a US car seat to fit our US stroller because jogging strollers aren't so available here...)Other than that, it's been a serviceable seat. Not wonderful, but easy enough to get in and out of the car and stroller. Just don't expect it to last until your baby is a year old.
