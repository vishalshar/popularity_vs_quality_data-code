I was excited to use these to encourage my kids to eat yogurt. Unfortunately, this set was a waste of money. The pouches aren't of high enough quality enough to warrant the price. More importantly, it only comes with two tops. My one year old was able to take the top off and dropped it from the stroller, so after using it twice we are down to only one ill-fitting top.
