This car seat was a real disappointment! I would not feel safe to let my child ride in this car seat.  It's made of really thin bendable plastic, and it would be as bad as letting him ride in a cardboard box.  I would NEVER recommend anybody putting their child in this car seat and getting out on the highway for any amount of time.  It's just too cheaply made.  It looks nice and study in pictures, but that's very deceiving!!  The cup holder doesn't even feel strong enough to hold a drink in it!  I couldn't believe it and thought it was a joke or something when I opened the box and saw how  pathetic this car seat was!  I returned it right away and bought the Graco Nautilus instead.  A little more money, but an excellent car seat!!
