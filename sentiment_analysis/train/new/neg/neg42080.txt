I recently purchased the Playtex Insulator 9 oz Cup 2 pack(I ordered 2 of these, so I actually bought 4)..I was/am very pleased with the seller of the cup. The item was shipped and delivered as promised, and packaged and described as promised, so this is no slight to the seller in any way. I rated these cups 3 stars instead of 5 because they have this unique "locking" feature on them where you are supposed to hear this little "click" as you turn the lid into proper position. Well, sometimes you do, sometimes you don't. I have found that these cups also appear to leak, when left on their side(as toddlers will do!), and I have found my grandson soaking wet more than a few times now because the lids are also NOT toddler proof, and he(grandson) is MORE than capable of opening the cups on his own! I don't plan on returning them, because it's more of a hassle than its worth, for the money, and as long as I'm right there, I can make sure that they aren't left on their side..Besides, I also do have other playtex cups, and it never hurts to have more of the replacement rubber pieces for inside the lids! Other than that, they are durable, they have a great design, and I love the size of them. They are a nice, big 9 oz, rather than the typical 6 or 8 that you see..They have a nice variety of color and design to choose from, and I would definitely order Playtex sippy cups again!
