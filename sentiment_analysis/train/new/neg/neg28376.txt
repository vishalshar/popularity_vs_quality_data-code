I usually like Munchkin products, but that was not the case here. I'm shocked at the reviews for this. The biggest complaints seem to be because it doesn't last. You wouldn't expect a brush like this to last more than a month or two anyway, especially at this price.I bought this because of the built in nipple brush, and the material at the end. From the picture, it looks like it will be more of a coarse loofa type material, but it's just a cheap foam, similar to what you would find in the stuffing of those seat pads you put on folding chairs. The foam isn't bad, just a bit useless when it comes to scrubbing. We use formula because of milk supply issues, and if I forget to put a bit of water in the bottom of the bottle until I have enough bottles to do the proper washing, it creates a bit of a buildup at the bottom that this foam struggles to get off.I hated the bristles. They are far too thin, coarse, sharp, and useless. They felt like the branches on a really cheap artificial Christmas tree or those fiberoptic table lamps. They are also really sparse. It was practically useless. I used it once, it didn't do even a half decent job so I went back to the OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush I was trying to replace (because it's three months old and has no nipple brush) and it got everything off.This isn't worth even trying to return. It went right into the trash. I will be ordering the OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand instead to replace this.
