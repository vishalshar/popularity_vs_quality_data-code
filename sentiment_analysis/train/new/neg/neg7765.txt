The toy I received seemed fine, but I was expecting three of them based on the price and the product description. I also found the exact same product at Wal-Mart for only $4 apiece, instead of $8-9 each as priced here. I haven't used the toys I got from Wal-Mart yet as baby is a few days away, but am concerned that the cord will be a little too hard for her to pull on to make it shake even when she is older.
