This blanket is part of Aden + Anais's B-quality line, the name of which is Aden by Aden + Anais. This is the type of product that is sold at stores like Target and Buy Buy Baby; it is slightly more affordable, but the quality is different as well. There are several differences in the products, including their size (as mentioned by another reviewer--this blanket is not the advertised size), but the most important difference is one of weave (which is similar to something like thread count--the cheaper Aden line is much less soft than the original boutique line). So, if you don't mind the Aden line, this is the blanket for you. But if you're looking for the original Aden + Anais quality, this is not it. This does explain the too-good-to-be-true price. Amazon: you should be advertising this blanket as coming from Aden by Aden + Anais.
