You get what you pay for ................. This thing looks nothing like the photo shopped picture . It would take six or seven of them to look like the picture . They are really delicate .They ship slow boat from china and take forever to get here with no tracking number .When I ask for a tracking number they told me that this type of shipping does not provide a tracking number .
