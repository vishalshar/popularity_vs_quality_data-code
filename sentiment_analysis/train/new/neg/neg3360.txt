I am starting to think that the carseat industry simply has the worst designers, or they are all only able to focus on 80% of the essential areas:Pros:- The chair is comfortable; my 5YO loves it- the cupholder is the right size and can be reached- Latch system is awesone; allows for climbing up by holding the handles- Materials and design look greatCons:- The little (food) drawer keeps sliding in, and children can't really open it themselves- This one I really really don't understand: the seatbelt guidance thing SUCKS, absolutely SUCKS. How how how can they have people that design entire safe carseats, and not properly design a little piece of plastic with a slot in it.... The thing is too flimsy; the seatbelt keeps coming out of it, but at the same time it graps the seatbelt and completely disallows my 5YO to pull it herself. Seriously, I don't get it...
