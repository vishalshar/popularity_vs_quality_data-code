I found my 8 month old baby wailing on the floor after putting her to sleep in this crib. The side panel was defective and she pushed it out herself and fell through the gap, scraping her face up in the process. Highly, highly unsafe. We are lucky she wasn't more badly injured. I am disappointed that I bought this due to the high safety ratings and sustainability considerations and had this negative of an experience. Also, now I don't have a crib. Do not buy.
