Isn't long enough to cover entire front rail of my standard size crib but still protects my daughters mouth as she likes to bite the front rail. Not very attractive in color or with the strings included to attach it. Did not come with instructions on how to lace strings and it comes with a lot of loose strings so I had to guess.  That is probably why its not very nice to look at either.
