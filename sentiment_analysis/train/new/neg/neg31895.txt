the chair is okay but I think for the price it should have a lil more back support and cushioning, I've seen other brands that are a bit less expensive and better quality. also it has 2 "extra cushions that are not attached to the seat they come separate but I honestly think they are pointless. one fell on the ground when it was raining when I took my toddler out of the seat and it got so muddy and full of debris that I had to throw it , the other one is floating around somewhere in the house.
