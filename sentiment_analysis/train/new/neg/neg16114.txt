It arrived broken and won't work! I am very sad seeing as I spent $25.45 on a clock that arrived broken. I can send it back and pay the 17 dollars it would take to ship it since I am stationed overseas! So I end up spending almost double the price. It is very unfortunate since the clock itself is super cute. You should really look over your products before sending them out Trend Lab. It's a great way to lose customers delivering a product that is broken. My luck since I am stationed overseas and it isnt easy to ship things.
