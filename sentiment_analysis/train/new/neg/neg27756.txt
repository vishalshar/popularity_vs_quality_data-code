I would not recommend.  The whole purpose of have a baby tub like this is for the water temperature control.  The LCD water temperature gauge stopped working after a couple of months and past the Amazon replacement/support time frame.  ABSOLUTELY NO support from seller called 4moms.  What a waste of money.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND.  FIND DIFFERENT STYLE.
