This is a good looking stroller with lots of features that we wanted, and at first, we thought we'd found the one.But, there are issues with it that don't appear until you've used it for a while.No carry handle so there is no simple way to carry it folded.You can't fold it one handed which is a dealbreaker when you're trying to get two kids on to a New York City bus.Unfolding it is also a two handed affair.Handlebar height is too low. My wife is 5'8 and complained about it.It pushes like a pneumatic drill on anything rougher than marble floors. The rattling was so loud it was embarrassing.The brake seized up within 3 weeks and was so stiff that we stopped using it altogether. A bit of oil helped but didn't make much difference.The steering is not great. You can't really push this one handed.If you're looking for a lightweight stroller, there are better out there. We switched to a MacLaren MK2 and have been very happy.
