My daughter has Down Syndrome and I read on multiple sites that the Bear bottle was the way to go. I unfortunately do not feel like it was worth the cost. The bottle is basically a very cheap honey bear that I could have gotten at a 99 cent store. The straws are basic bendy straws. Nothing about it was something special. With the exception of the small valve that traps the liquid in the straw. So far I haven't had much luck getting her to use it. But I wish I didn't pay so much for something I could have made. It seems like sometimes items made for "special needs" children are purposely overpriced.
