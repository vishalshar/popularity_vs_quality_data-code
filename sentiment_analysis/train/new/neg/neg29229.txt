I bought this to have a more reliable thermometer than our forehead model.While our forehead model gives us reasonable readings, it can be tricky to get a reading. This safety first thermometer has never given a reasonable reading. When we aren't sick, it reads in the 96s or 97s. When my son was obviously sick and getting 101+ reading on our forehead model, this Safety 1st model read just over 99 degrees. Maybe it's consistently about 2 degrees too low, but I don't want to have to do any guesswork when my son is sick. I threw it in the garbage yesterday as I bought it a year or so ago. Wish I tested it right away so I could return it.
