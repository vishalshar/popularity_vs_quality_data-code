I bought six of these for my son. They work reasonably well, as well as any of the sippys I've tried, but their customer service is horrible. Not long after we purchased them the piece that keeps the lid closed broke on one. I wrote to customer service to ask for a replacement lid (just the lid!), and they said, sure, for $2. Really? For $15 bottles, of which I bought six, I don't expect to be nickle and dimed. When I responded as such via email, they never wrote me back.
