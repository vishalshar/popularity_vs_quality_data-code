I bought this pump because I am a stay-at-home mom and knew I wouldn't be pumping a whole lot. It started out fine (I hadn't used others at that point so I didn't know that the suction wasn't very good) but after 2 months, it lost power in the motor and definitely wasn't providing enough suction after my son was eating more aggressively. I originally didn't want to spend the money on a nice double pump, but I ended up doing that anyway. I would recommend getting a double pump if you're even pumping every few days.
