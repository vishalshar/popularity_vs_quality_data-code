I give this pump at least one star because it was more comfortable than the Medela handheld; however, there was also not enough suction to produce enough milk in a decent amount of time...and YES, I went through all the troubleshooting information! I repeat, this pump is more comfortable than the traditional ones, but also no good if you need real suction to get your milk out!
