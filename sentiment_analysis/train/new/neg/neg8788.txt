This is a cute toy, but I'm a bit disappointed in the "interactiveness" of it.  Granted, it is called a "clutch cube" because that's about all you can do with it --clutch it.  I had mistakenly thought this was a cube that I saw on line made by Zolo toys.  The Zolo toy cube has "lift up tabs" on EVERY FACE of the cube with interactive things, such a streamers, squeakers, pull things, mirrors, etc....  You should NOT get this toy if you are looking for an interactive toy.  Instead, get the one by Zolo Toys.  I thought every face of this cube had a "hidden thing" underneath, but it's only one side -- the mirror side.  If you notice, that's the side that is advertised in the picture.  Don't let it fool you -- that's just about it with the flaps.  If your kid loves to "clutch things" then this is a good cube... but if your kid loves to actually interact with a toy, then this is not the toy for you.
