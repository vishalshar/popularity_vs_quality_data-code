With a new baby at home, my husband and I were looking for a new baby carrier that would be comfortable for both of us to wear. The ratings and positive reviews were what lead me to this particular baby carrier however I found myself disappointed once I actually received the item.Overall, the baby carrier was well made and the chevron print/colors were amazing! But that's about where my happiness ended. I felt that this baby carrier was difficult to get on/off alone despite the instructions that made it seem Otherwise. In addition, since this is a sash tie carrier it was extremely difficult to get it tied tight enough where I felt secure carrying my newborn around in it.  I'm sure with practice this would or could get easier but I don't really have the desire to work on this issue. Most importantly I was mostly bothered by the fact that the shoulder straps would not lay flat!! They were turning up causing the edges to dig into my shoulders. No matter what positioning I attempted and assistance I had I could not get the shoulder straps to lay flat.
