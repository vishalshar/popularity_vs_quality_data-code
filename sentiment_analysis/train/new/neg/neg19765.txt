Absolute worst thing I have ever purchased on Amazon.  Bought these to make burp cloths for cousin's baby.  After 1st wash and dry pilled like crazy! Filled the dryer's lint trap completely.  Washed and dried again hoping the "pills" would go away. No success, after taking them from the dryer the 2nd time, I shook them to get the fuzz off of them.  It went everywhere, covering my shirt, even clinging to my eyelashes.  They look old after being washed, may be fine for a diaper with a cover on it, but not so great for cloths to be laid over shoulders in public.  Since I paid almost $20 for these I will still embroider them and give them as a gift.  Maybe she can use them in the privacy of her home and not be too embarrassed.  Would not purchase again.
