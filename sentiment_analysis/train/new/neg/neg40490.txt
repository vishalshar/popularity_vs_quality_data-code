I purchased this to use as a back up/extra breast shield with my Medela PISA breast pump, both to have spare parts on hand but also to help reduce the frequency with which I would have to wash the pump parts. I chose this specific breast shield because the listing indicated it was sold by Medela, not one of the knock off companies and as such it cost a few dollars more. Unfortunately, even though this is supposed to be an authentic Medela replacement part I am seriously having my doubts. First off the design of this breast shield is completely different from what was received with the actual pump with the location where the pump tubing is inserted in the breast shield- on the backside- instead of on the top like the breast shields I received with the pump - It is also a single piece breast shield (which doesn't really matter to me, that actually makes it somewhat easier to clean). It is designed so poorly that every time I have to use this breast shield it moisture gets into my pump tubing - that is a big NO, NO - both for the life expectancy of the breast pump but also the sterility of the breast milk. Due to the design of this breast shield, specifically the location that the tubing is inserted, there is no way to avoid moisture getting into the tubing. I have tried the suggestions of Medela and other users and repositioned the valve in different directions but to no avail, moisture gets into the tubing each and EVERY time. I don't understand why they would design a product like this? Are they trying to intentionally ruin the breast pump so you have to buy another one? Is it some scam to get you to buy more tubing/replacement parts. It's very disappointing and frustrating. I would not recommend this product to other users and I would have returned it if possible- a total waste of money and will likely cause me additional costs in the future in additional pump parts and possibly even pump replacement.
