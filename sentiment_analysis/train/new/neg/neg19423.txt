This is a cute potty, but I found myself annoyed with always having to take it apart to empty it. I guess it'd be good if you have a curious one who might try to empty it on their own and spill, but it was always hard to get the seat apart from the base because the prongs that connected them bent and it always stuck together. It also didn't entice my daughter to use the potty any more than she would have with a basic potty. We gave it away and for my younger baby we'll just get a basic one.
