The bottles that arrive most likely won't look like the picture. I recieved bottles and lids losely in a box. If this was something for myself I might not care, but every baby item I purchase I have always made sure it is sealed for sanitary reasons - most of the items I purchase are Medela and they have the safety seal stating that if the seal is broken, the item cannot be returned, which i like - it makes me feel safer about the products I am purchasing. However, if I use the bottles, it will be helpful that I can freeze then un-freeze and feed without having to transfer from a bag to a bottle.
