this product is a super idea. poorly executed. The "adult" section is smaller than a conventional seat, and due to the design, you have to touch the bowl every time you lift the seat.--gross--  it is made of a cheap plastic, rather than whatever heavy, solid material good seats are made of. I replaced a Kohler seat with this product, and Wow! what an el-cheapo difference! It's much smaller to sit on, and far less comfortable. It flops all around the toilet, as the cheap hardware does a poor job of retaining it. You cant just tighten it up more, as it is cheap and will break. The slow/ quiet close feature is nice...but I've had it a month now and it's already wearing out. And if you are buying it for a boy, well, be prepared to clean up, a lot, as it doesn't address "the angle of trajectory " and urine finds its way all over the place. Great Idea...Cheap,disappointing-quality product. If you are unfortunate enough to order one, the shipping will be delayed, as they feel the need to re-contact you to see if you did indeed order what you want,(size,color). Take this opportunity to cancel your order!
