When this item arrived, the pre-installed batteries were dead.  No biggie, I changed them out.  My daughter played with it for about 10 minutes the next day and then it sat turned off for the remainder of the day.  The next time she attempted to play with it, it would only play half of the songs and some of the buttons didn't even work.  Thinking I had bad batteries I changed them out again.  The same thing happened with the new set of batteries!  This toy, while cute, is a battery-eating piece of junk.  :(
