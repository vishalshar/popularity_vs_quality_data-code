I really wanted to like this because we live in Florida and between the muggy heat and the rain a thinner easier to dry carrier would be great. However, it is so thin it offers no support for you or baby. It seems a lot smaller than my original carrier or my performance carrier. It barely holds my (admittedly tall) 9 month old, there is no way it would hold my two or three year old, something the other versions of the Ergo do perfectly well. I HATE the mesh shoulder pad lining. It rubs the skin on my shoulders raw within 40 minutes or so.I know there was a back and forth between some reviewers about the chest buckle, so here's my two cents: It has to be higher than the original. I have no problem with the chest buckle with my other two ergos (original and performance) but even when I adjust everything that can possibly be adjusted the chest strap on this version is uncomfortably high.Long story short, am returning this and sticking with my original.
