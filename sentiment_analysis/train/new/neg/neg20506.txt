I have both the wide neck and skinny bottles at home and the skinny ones are way better. The wideneck bottles drip sometimes when we're warming the milk. I'm not talking about a few drops but a whole stream of milk running down the side of the bottle. I love the look but I hate using these bottles because I have to stand right next to the warmer to make sure it's not going to start leaking. Thumbs down for sure!!!
