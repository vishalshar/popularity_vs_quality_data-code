My 11 month old daugther loved her Fisher Price activity house (not sure what it's called) at her grandparents house, so I bought this learning tree thinking it was similar. She isn't interested in it at all, and it makes no noise, which I was surprised at. She will play with it for a few moments before moving onto something else...guess it just isn't that fun! Also, the bee that you move back and forth makes a disc spin, and several times the disc has gotten stuck and hasn't spun...not sure if it's very durable or not.
