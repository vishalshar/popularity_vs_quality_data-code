I'm not sure if it is poor manufacturing or simply a defect in the product that was shipped to us, but within days of giving this toy to our daughter one of the ears fell off. The thing to be aware of is because this is a small 8.5" toy, the ear, once detached, became an imediate choking hazard. In fact, we discovered the ear had fallen off when my wife found it in our baby's mouth. Thankfully we found it in time, but both of us felt compelled to come back and share this review so others could be aware of this problem.The main issue seemed to be that each piece was individually sewn together so the head is not one complete piece. Because the size is so small, the stichting becomes undone very easily. I would highly recomend looking at a different toy and letting this one just pass on by.
