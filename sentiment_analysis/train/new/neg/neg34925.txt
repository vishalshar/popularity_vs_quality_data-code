The tub works well for kids that can sit up on their own, but definitely no younger.  The air provides some insulation, and combined with the larger volume of water it doesn't cool down as quickly as small hard plastic tubs.  It's really great for travel. Two complaints:1. The side of the tub at the "filling" end is still too wide, so many bathtub spigots don't get the water into the tub without having to deflect it with your hand.2. The build quality is very cheap, considering the price- think dimestore beach ball.  Ours died shortly after we started using it with our second kid, who really liked to grab the fish- the seam holding the fish on went.  Get the simpler non-deluxe model and it would probably last longer.
