We purchased this darling chair for our 18-month old son.  He loved it immediately, climbing into it and naming each of the animals on the chair.  Since his room is done in the Malawi theme, this chair was a delightful addition.  Sadly, he got just a smudge of dirt on it.  When I tried to clean it by dabbing it with water (just dabbing...not rubbing, as I had read others' advice against rubbing), the green color fabic faded badly right away.  This was just with a dab of water!  So we returned the chair (amazon was great about this!) and got a second one.  The second one had a small rip in the arm upon delivery.  So we have returned it and are awaiting a third chair.  Hopefully the third time will be the charm, because this chair really is CUTE!  But if there's something wrong with #3, then we will give up on the Malawi chair and buy something else.  So sad.
