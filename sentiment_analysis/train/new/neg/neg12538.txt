Perfect fit for the Infant Optics DXR-5 monitor, I just with they battery itself lasted longer.  I've had to replace it after only 6 months because the one that came with the monitor lost some chargeability and would only power the monitor for 15 minutes on a full charge.  When new it runs for over 2 hours just like this replacement one does.
