We have 2 granddaughters and at the time of the purchase a nearly there grandson. We had some spill issues at our Tree Decorating dinner and so purchased these cups in the hopes of avoiding the kid distress and adult panic when the flood of chocolate milk hits the Christmas linens. We introduced the older child styles to the 2 1/2 and 5 1/2 year old girls Christmas morning. Both were attracted by the color and style. The dots on the exterior are not raised as I initially stated. The narrow cylinder fits little hands. The older girl wanted the shorter of the 2 cups because of her predilection for red and was not pleased that appropriate height was the determining factor in distribution. Now for the bad news: neither girl could drink from the cups. Apparently there is a sucking kind of technique required which neither child was used to or interested in learning. Since the cups were introduced Christmas morning with all it's attendant excitement, distractions and (yes) stress they rejected instruction and just wanted to have their breakfast. The cups are useable without the lids but we're back to spillage issues the chances of which are now increased by the height of the cups. I imagine if introduced as the child's first cup or in a quieter moment the cups would be more easily accepted. If I find that they are effective at spill avoidance and easy for the kids to adapt to and handle I will update this review.
