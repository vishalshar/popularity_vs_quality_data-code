I like it, my husband hates it.  You have to take it out of the tub every time your child decides he'd like to lie back for a soak.  Husband: this is too much work.  Me: Whatever.  Husband: All I'm saying is that when it's full of wet crap, and I have to take it out of the tub and it drips all over the place, I'm not cleaning it up.  Me: Take it out of the tub BEFORE beginning bath.  Husband: I'm going to write my own reviews.
