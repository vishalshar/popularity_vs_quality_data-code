Good if you have a quiet household. If you have company over you will have a hard time hearing your baby through this monitor. Looks great though and is compact and easy to take when travelling.  However it does not fulfill the main purpose of being able to hear your baby right away. It took me a while to setup too. It also randomly stops working & u have to turn both units on & off (restart) until they sink up again.
