1. Annoying music.2. Music starts automatically - usually after putting your child down for a nap - just when you are about to fall asleep yourself.3. Other toys fit inside. Normally you would think this is cool, however, my child is very good at jamming in items that are just a tad too large to remove. He then gets frustrated and screams. I (Mama) then try to remove the too large toy - unfortunately I can't always get them out (Daddy!).4. Hole in top is just large enough for little hands to get stuck when they try to remove one of the aforementioned toys. It took a long time for my son to figure out why his hand was stuck. Lots of crying and screaming.5. My son has yet to actually roll it (he's had it for months).6. You can never find the balls that go with it. They always seem to be under a piece of furniture or at the bottom of the toy chest. And there are only 2 or 3 balls, so it's not like there are extras around to be seen among the million other toys.7. My son loves to stand on this toy. One of these days he will learn the hard way that barrels roll.I can only think of one good thing to say about this toy - there aren't a million parts.
