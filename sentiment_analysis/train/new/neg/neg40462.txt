I was very excited to buy the Naturepedic Organic Cotton Changing Pad, and the cover to go with it as well.  But I was disappointed by both when they arrived.  They weren't nearly as soft and comfy as I was expecting and it looked like I'd just constantly be doing extra washing to clean the cover as it got peed on day after day.  I love that the entire thing is organic, but it wasn't as luxuriously soft as I was expecting and the entire package of changing pad/cover was kind of crinkly and not comfy feeling.  I sent it back and got something different.
