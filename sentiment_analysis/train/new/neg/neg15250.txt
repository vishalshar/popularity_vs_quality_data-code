Our 20 month old granddaughter likes these smaller cups and usually chooses them over her clunkier cups with handles and such.But do understand these are the "old style" cups, like the old Bell Tumblers from Tupperware, that don't have the fancy "no leak when turned over" features inside the lids.  That suits me fine most of the time as I don't care for the clunkier cups with hard to clean and easy to lose little pieces.  Those do have their place, though, when she's going to be in the car with her cup, or on the sofa or church pew, and we don't want juice or even water stains on the seat if she drops it.Pros:  They are smaller and don't take up so much room in the cabinet, the fridge, on smaller high chair trays, or in small diaper bags.  The colors are nice and you can always use a certain color for different drinks.  We use yellow for milk, green for juice and blue for water.  They are just clear enough that you can see what's inside - grape juice or orange juice, etc.Cons:  The lids split too easily.  We have two sets of these.  One lid split the first time we put it on the cup. Two other lids split within a week.  The others have not split after a couple months of continuous use.  Hit or miss, I guess.  For the price, we are satisfied.
