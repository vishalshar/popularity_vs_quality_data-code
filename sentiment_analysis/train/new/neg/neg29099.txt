This was not worth my money. It says it can hold 8oz per cup, but every time it got over 2oz milk started flowing up the tube. I was able to connect it to my spectra 9 using the spectra dew back flow protector to protect my pump, but milk still got in the tubes so often it was useless. It's not all that conceivable, you look like you have giant lumpy oddly shaped boobs. The one pro, and the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that if you had a very low supply, and needed to pump as frequently as possible, you could keep this on and power pump while you are doing other things.
