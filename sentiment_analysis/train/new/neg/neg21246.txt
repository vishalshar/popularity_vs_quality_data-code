Do not buy the Brown/Tan version of this booster seat - it's dangerous.  I've used the blue/white/green version for months and had no problem with it.  When I got tired of dealing with a high chair, I decided to order a second booster seat so I could keep one at home and use one for travel.  I liked the colors of the Brown/Tan, so I ordered it.  For some reason, the straps to hold the child in the seat are different on this booster than on the other color combinations.  Rather than the waist straps being anchored to the back of the seat (so they go around the child's waist), they're anchored to the seat part of the seat, so they're under the child's rear-end and come across the thighs (don't touch the waist at all).  This design flaw means you must rely completely on the tray to hold the child in place, rather than having the safety straps serve as the primary securer.  Aside from the potential dangers to the child if the tray is not properly secured, my daughter started to fall out of the seat (while still strapped in) in the 1-2 seconds between me taking off the tray and reaching to undo the straps.  Fortunately, I was right next to her and there was no harm or injury done.  However, I immediately boxed the seat back up and exchanged it for the red/white version, which has the same proper strap design as the blue/green/white version.
