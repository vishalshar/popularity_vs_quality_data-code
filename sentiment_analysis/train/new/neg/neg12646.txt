I use this at the top of the stairs on my front porch so that if my two my small dogs run out the front door between my legs, they can't run down into the street. I like the two opening options, either swinging it open or pushing it into itself like an accordion. However, both ends are made to open and if someone has gone through one end and doesn't attach it correctly and you come through the other end, the door falls to the floor and you could possibly go with it and the dogs could still get out. The opening gear is a little tricky too, and and then you have to fit the stabilizing point at the bottom into an eye on the post (zoom in on the pic), so you can't be in a hurry. I am going to put on a simple hook myself and try to make the other end stationary. I guess if you need it for small kids, it's a good gate. You want a gate they can't manipulate. Still, one end should be stationery at all times, unless you could be assured everyone is closing the gate properly every time. If you are handy with tools, maybe you can make it stationary. Shop around and take your time before deciding on this one. Depends on your needs and how handy you are. Well made, though for what it is.
