This crib toy was received broken.  The music doesn't stop as it is supposed to after each song which means it will run all night if we don't get up and turn it off.  Extremely inconvenient!  Especially if our baby hits it in the middle of the night!  So now we can't leave the switch on for our baby to be able to turn on the music herself which renders this item almost completely useless!  Very disappointing!
