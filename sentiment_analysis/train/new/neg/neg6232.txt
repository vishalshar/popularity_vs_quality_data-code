This pillow was a great size for our 3-year-old son, and we were pretty happy with it at first.  But we noticed that the fiberfill tended to separate pretty easily inside the pillow where my son would lay his head, leaving a gap between the fluffy parts.  I would try to fluff it back up, but over time the problem just kept getting worse.  We are now looking for a new pillow because the fiberfill is too lumpy and separated now (we've had the pillow for about 10 months).  Very disappointing.
