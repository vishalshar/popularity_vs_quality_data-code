I've been using this bather with my child since May 2013 every other day. I make sure to wring it out and then hang it up over our air vent in the bathroom for faster drying. All was well with this product until about a month ago when I started to notice this smell in our bathroom. I thought it was from maybe a dirty towel or washrag so everything got washed and I still couldn't find the smell. Lo' and behold it was the bather. I was hanging it with the side you sit in facing out and when I flipped it over to smell it, there was mold all over it. The bather was not up against a wall or anything, it was free hanging on a towel bar. I immediately put it in the washing machine on hot water and non chlorine bleach. Mold spots are still there but the smell went away, until the next time I used it. Smell is back and the mold is growing faster. I repeated the washing but with a mold killing additive to the wash and nothing. Never put in the dryer as I don't want that smell to get cooked in. I can't get the mold or the smell to go away. Contacted the seller and they said since it's been past the 30 days it's my problem now. I so loved this product as it keeps my 7 months old in one spot in the tub. I probably could have used a laundry basket for this purpose instead of this bather that's going to mold after a few months use.
