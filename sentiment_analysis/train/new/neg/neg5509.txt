The box it came in was a little banged up as if it was handled carelessly or it was a returned item. When I opened up the kit and took every thing out, I noticed that the emery boards were a little chipped and everything had scuff marks on it. It just looked a little dirty. I had to wipe off and clean every item. The nail clippers are VERY fragile and they almost came apart when I practiced using them for the first time. The nasal aspirator's clear plastic part becomes unattached from the white bulb when I push on it (like you're supposed to). That can be a nice feature because it's easy to clean, but if it comes apart when I use it on my baby, then it'll be worthless. I tested it on my hand and didn't feel any kind of sucking- isn't that the purpose of an aspirator? The kit includes everything I'll need, but it's such low quality that it just wasn't worth purchasing. I don't expect it to last very long. Very disappointing! I would definitely spend a little more if it means that I get a higher quality kit that is going to last more than a few uses.
