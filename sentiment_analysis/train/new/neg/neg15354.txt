Cute puzzle, and it's neat that the pieces are both two-sided AND can fit in multiple spots, allowing a wide variety of "solutions."However, the paint on the pieces doesn't seem like it's going to last, as there were flakes of paint and (very small) imperfections before we even took off the plastic wrap it came in (we bought two as gifts, so it wasn't great that the puzzles looked slightly beat up already.) Plus, a couple pieces were cut a little too large and are a very tight fit â€“ a toddler wouldn't be able to get them in place without some serious effort. I think a little strategic sanding would fix this, but still, a $20 puzzle should be good to go.If your kid is into bugs, it's still a cool puzzle, just be prepared for some slight issues...
