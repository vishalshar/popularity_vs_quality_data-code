I got this bag because of all the great reviews and how much space it seemed to have. And also because my hubby is in the army and well, I thought it was cute being that it had the pink camo on the outside. God knows I have enough of the everyday green camo in my life! Well I have had nothing but problems with it. It doesn't hold enough of everyday items. All the compartments are cute, but really are a waste of space. Seems to me that if they got rid of all the little compartments, there would be more space for all the baby stuff that is needed on an average days outing. The bag is not "older sibling" friendly either. Just not enough room! Very hard to keep clean or to clean after it gets alittle dirty. The one strap that it has to carry it around can also cut right into your shoulder - makes airport running around VERY PAINFUL!!! The suede that the bag has on the outside is not great for those babies that tend to spit up from time to time. Cute bag, just not something I recommend for the mommy who depends on her diaper bag to do what it's made for. Good for show - very pretty and girlie looking. But not good for the mommy of two very active girls!
