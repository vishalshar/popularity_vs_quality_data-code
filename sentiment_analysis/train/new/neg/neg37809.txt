This is a poorly designed bumper. Without the ties at the bottom you have to tuck it in between the crib and mattress, making the bumper short. It also collapses very easy, does not have enough ties at the top, and is very thin. Bad purchase, and now the manufacturer is no longer making it... Can't they replace this crappy product for their newer version for customers?
