My now 8 month old daughter was ready to hold her bottle, so we began searching for one with handles that she could easily grab herself. At the time the only one we came across, and liked, was the nuk trainer. I have 8 kids all aged 9 and under so I have been through my fair share of baby products, bottles/sippys included. So let me say I have never ever seen nipples tear and need to be replaced as quick as these. They fall apart and get huge holes in them in no time flat. You may think oh the baby chews on them, no not the case, she still happens to be toothless. I have had her on this particular bottle/sippy for about 3 months now and I have to change the nipples out every other week. That is absolutely insane. Though I truly enjoy the bottle, they need to figure out a way to make the nipples a little more durable. Having to change nipples out on numerous bottles every other week can get very pricy very fast. For the ones looking in sippys, try another. For the ones needing new nipples, no you didn't get a faulty pack. They ALL fall apart super fast and super easy.
