I searched high and low for a piggy bank for my second nephew. This one is cute and spacious (unlike many I found), but the material will not hold up well. With its long neck it's been difficult to find a place to put it in his room where it won't get destroyed but he can still reach it. I don't think it's been used since I gifted it.
