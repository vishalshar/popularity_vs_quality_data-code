At first I REALLY liked this item. BUT, within a week the pillow case split and then so did the pillow. The seller offered to replace the pillow case, but being physically disabled it was too much of a hassle to get to UPS to send back the original case. About a week or two later the pillow itself ripped in the same spot, right at the middle of the inside curve at the top.I darned the holes and that did the trick, even though it isn't the best looking patch job int he world. Now, a few months later, though, the filling is getting lumpy and the pillow is getting hard to fluff. You WILL need to fluff this on a regular basis as you end up shoving the stuffing out where your knees, head, and elbows rest.Even so, I'm waking up with less pain, so I'd still recommend it.
