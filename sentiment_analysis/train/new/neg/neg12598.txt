I was very excited to get this for my niece but after the 3rd time it was almost a joke to learn that it arrived in pieces despite a flimsy piece of bubble wrap they put in the box. It was not packaged properly. This has become more of a hassle than a gift for my brother as they have to send back 3 piggy banks.
