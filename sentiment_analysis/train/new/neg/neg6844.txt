I bought these to use overnight with prefolds to keep my baby's skin dry.  Completely uneffective - they were sopping wet (even when used during the day, not just overnight).  I don't understand the point as the added absorbancy is minimal and they don't provide a barrier from wetness.  A waste of money, unfortunately.
