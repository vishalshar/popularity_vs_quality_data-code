At first I loved it but as my daughter started using it more and more I notice it smelled like urine, I did dint understand why because  I took it apart and sanitized it every Time she used it, but then she went to used her potty and I heard a bubbling sound, I looked closer and I saw that the seat had soaked up a lot of urine, there are holes at the bottom of the soft seat attachment that soaks up the waste, I am so disgusted I tried to soak it and no matter what I do I can't get the urine out of the seat cushion, very sad because she really like this potty and now I have to get her used to another one, not to mention that it is a waste of money
