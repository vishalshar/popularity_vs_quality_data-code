Everything looks exactly as pictured, however in order to install properly and securely, a drill IS needed, and we don't have one :( So now we have to buy a drill. I wish it would have said this in the description as I probably would not have purchased it. You "can" attach it to the wall by attempting to find the studs, but how many walls are going to have 3 that close to a corner in the exact right spots? Probably none.Otherwise, seems ok. I wish it were bigger. In hindsight I also probably would have ordered a larger net instead.
