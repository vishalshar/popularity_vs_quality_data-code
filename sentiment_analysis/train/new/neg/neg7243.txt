This cream is pretty sensitive stuff, good for a baby that has no serious diaper rash, and good for a mama with an aversion  to chemicals. It reminds me a bit of burt's bees lip gloss. We have switched full time to A&D. Its cheaper, I don't have to order it online, and it actually works better. We use the kind without Zinc Oxide. It still is not as pure & natural as this stuff, but this really is protective & preventative, not healing. Our baby has really sensitive skin and it did not irritate her. She has eczema and everything. A&D didn't irritate her either. I have not noticed a difference with A&D on my cloth diapers. If it gets gooky though, (has not over several months) I will just do a vinegar rinse and -voila-. I bought this because I was worried about waxy things on the diaper.
