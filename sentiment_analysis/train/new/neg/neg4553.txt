These were not at all what I was expecting to receive. I thought by "slow flow" they meant the slowest possible...for a newborn. Not so much. I already had bunch of these, as it's what the bottles come with to begin with.It's not worth the effort to send them back, so I'll give them as a gift when a friend has a baby. Just know these aren't for a newborn who only needs one hole in the top as opposed to two.The nipples themselves are fine, though, for an older infant.
