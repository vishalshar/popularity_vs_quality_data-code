I am a big fan of Aden & Anais, but this was the first Aden by Aden & Anais product I've bought and it was a far cry from the normal quality I'm used to. As you can see by the photos I posted of this product (left) and regular Aden & Anais sleep sack (right) this one is much thinner. It also ft a huge hole under the arm hole within the first week of wearing and I promise my son was not doing any crazy stunts in it, he couldn't even roll over yet when I started using it on him. So if you are in the market for a lightweight muslin sleep sack (we live in Florida so they are great for warm climates) then I highly recommend spending a little more for the original brand.
