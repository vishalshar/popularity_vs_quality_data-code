1) These locks only work on furniture with square corners.  That being said, they fit on my son's chest of drawers fine.  However, they are pretty annoying to lock and unlock (not a great design) and they don't automatically clasp when you close the drawers.  In order to re-lock them I had to manually snap them back (as if I was opening them).  But they functioned to keep my 9-month-old from opening the drawers as he cruised around the room.2) I've had the locks on the 3 bottom drawers of a chest for approximately a month.  On two of the drawers the adhesive had let go and the locks no longer functioned.  I completely removed them (and picked off all the excess sticky stuff) a couple days ago and now the 3rd one has also given way.Overall, don't waste your time and money on these.  They don't last long enough to be of much help.  The adhesive is just too delicate.
