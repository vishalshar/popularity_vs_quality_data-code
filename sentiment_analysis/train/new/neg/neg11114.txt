I wanted to like these nursing pads because they were thinner than the type I usually buy.  They were hard to put in my bra without unhooking the nursing flap and I found the sticky tabs to be annoying.  The sticky part would grab onto the back of the pad and then I would have to pull it to straighten it out.  I ended up not taking the paper off of the sticky part and using the rest.  They are absorbent, but I will never buy them again.
