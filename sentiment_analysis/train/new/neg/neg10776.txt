This little cat looks so cute in the picture, but in real life is rather disappointing. The blue isn't blue (more of a shabby light grey), the hard head portion protrudes awkwardly into the body, and the terry cloth feels rather rough and feels as if it will fall apart if washed twice. It's definitely not a snuggle kitty! The only real plus is that it's organic. If you want organic, go check out the Organic Farm Buddies toys... I ordered one of theirs at the same time as this cat and the quality, color, and softness is so much better.
