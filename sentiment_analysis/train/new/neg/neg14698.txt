It does the job but feels flimsy. The ladder is wobbly and makes my kids hesitate while climbing up. This isn't the feeling they need when they need to go potty NOW. The seat is kept in its place by 4 small plastic tabs. Most seats has a plastic tab that goes all around to make sure the seat is positioned correctly. The problem with this seat is that the child needs to be careful when they go number 1. If they don't, it'll go between the seat of the Helper and the actual toilet seat. This creates a messy situation.
