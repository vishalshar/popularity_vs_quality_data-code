I'm a FTM and ordered this item before the arrival of my baby. I went to the baby k'tan website and used their tool to choose the size. Maybe K'tan didn't want to offend women by calling it postpartum size but they clearly ask for the mother's pre pregnancy size, which is misleading because no one goes right back to their pre-pregnancy size immediately after giving birth. Maybe it was my own lack of judgement by actually putting in my pre-pregnancy weight and size when I used their sizing tool. But the K'tan I ended up is a size too small. I now have a newborn that I can not carry around with me and the couple of times I forced him into the K'tan, his head was squeezed so tight against my chest, I didn't feel it was safe for the baby. As babies tend to grow fast, I won't be getting any use out of this.
