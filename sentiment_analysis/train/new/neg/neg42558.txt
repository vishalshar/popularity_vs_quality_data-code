These things are not flushable and will clog your sewer system or septic system. We used them only about 2 weeks about 3-4 a day. They plugged my sewer line and the main in the street. I do not recommend this product if you plan on flushing them. Cost me 400 dollars to have the lines cleaned and they pulled out pile of the liners. I put 10 in a bucket of water for 3 days and they do not break down. I added a picture of what the sewer snake looked like after the first try to unclog my sewer. As you can see from my picture the liners do not break down.
