My 12 month old toddler ripped this bib off within 2 seconds of wearing it (material is like paper towel).  This bib is flimsy and the pocket doesn't catch anything heavier than cheerios.  I guess that's expected from a disposable bib though.  Nevertheless, the material could be a little stronger than paper towel.
