I have been watching this one posting for the past few days now, we will be finding out the sex of our child in a few days. Now that it has doubled in price since yesterday I now have ZERO interest in it.  It's beautiful, but since its out dated it's not one that I want to make a quick decision on and spend that much on, knowing that its quite possible I will not find everything to match.  Price should have gone down not up, if someone was going to buy it they would have bought it at the lower price not the higher price.
