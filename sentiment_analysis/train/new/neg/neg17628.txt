These are very light-weight as others have pointed out.  I would be OK with that...if they worked.  With the sun high, these do block a barely perceivable amount of sunlight.  However, when the sun is lower on the horizon - they don't do anything!It says it has a "Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) Of 25+" - so "MAYBE" it's blocking the UV light, which is good if you don't want a tan (or sunburn).  But it's called a sun SHADE - and it does NOT block ANY visible light.Worthless!  $5 lesson learned!  You get what you pay for!
