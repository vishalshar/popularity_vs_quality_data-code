DO NOT BUY, NOT SAFEThe reason I got this thing was because my four month old was too big for the bumbo seat and I wanted to try something similar, this was a huge mistake. This thing is a HAZARD, I can not believe they make it for babies. In order to get the blue tray on completely the child has to be sitting in the seat with the rest of the tray around the seat. You can not get it to connect with out using a large amount of physical force, you have to be super careful when doing so to make sure the child's fingers are not pinched or that their legs are not in the way of the latch system, which can scratch your child. The lady bug toy can badly pinch fingers and the two tall toys when let go can spring back and smack the child. When you go to try and get the child out, again the tray will not come apart. Returned, thankfully didn't waste any money on it.
