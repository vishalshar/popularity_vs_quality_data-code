I had bought a Simple Wishes bra in the past, and I loved it, so I wanted to buy one that I could leave in my work bag, and another for home. BEWARE! I bought this time from Amazon, and should have known better when it said "Sold by: JMR Ventures." This bra was flimsy, had a poor zipper, and was suboptimal. I am returning, and buying only from the Simple Wishes website (and using Promo Code SIMPLE50 to get 50% off - even with tax and shipping, is cheaper than the listing on Amazon).
