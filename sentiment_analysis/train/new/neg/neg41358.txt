We are sending this back tomorrow.  We purchased the Uniden wireless camera for $40 less, and it's much better.  The video had white lines going through the display, popping audio, and would loose it's signal every once and a while.  This device is plain unaccepable.At first, I thought that this device was as it good as it was going to get.  WRONG.  This is the worst it gets. Once we purchased and installed the Uniden 2.4Ghz set ($139 Sam's Club, or $169 Amazon), I saw that I was dealing with something that could be better.
