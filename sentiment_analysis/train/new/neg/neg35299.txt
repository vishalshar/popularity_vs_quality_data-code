The problem with this toy is that it is sewn on to the pacifier! Since the manufacturer recommends that the pacifier be replaced every few months, this is a serious issue. It also makes sterilizing (or even cleaning in the dishwasher) impossible.Also, please note that it doesn't work with any pacifier clips.
