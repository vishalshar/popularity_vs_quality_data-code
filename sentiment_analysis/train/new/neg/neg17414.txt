Over priced talcum powder. You can achieve the same thing by buying "Equate" foot powder at Walmart for 1/3 the price.It works okay for powder with Calamine. Beware, it has perfume in it for anyone who doesn't like perfume in their underwear.Two photos I attached are: 1- monkey butt product, 2 - foot powder product for a lot less money.Salicylic acid is also anti-fungal. (Does "aspirin" sound familiar)[...]The other chemical in the foot powder "methyl salicylate" is from "oil of wintergreen", a natural product.First and last time I'm buying this product.
