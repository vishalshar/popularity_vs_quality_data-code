While these are cute, my stickers do not stay stuck to the walls. I had issues pulling them off the paper because they'd tear easily. I'm not man-handling them, I was careful but they still tore in corners/edges and especially the long, larger pieces like they weren't cut out entirely. Once I had them off in 1 piece (or several pieces) and were on the walls they continue to curl back away from the wall. I have some large decals from a specialized online store and everyone thinks I painted it myself. That's not how these look, they're shiny plastic and reflect light. They look like stickers- on the wall. Yes, they're very easily removed and a few of them removed themselves overnight. I have slightly bumpy walls, they aren't completely smooth but they aren't dirty either. My paint is eggshell or satin and maybe that's the issue? Everyday whether cool or warm I am pressing half the stickers back down. Maybe they'd work great on mirrored sliding closet doors or very smooth walls? I'm glad they were very inexpensive because I won't be sad if I have to throw them out. 3 stars for being cute, and for how many you get and -2 stars for only half of them staying for the most part and also tearing when pulled off the sheet. Good luck with yours! Your walls will be darling if at least for a little while.
