My husband and I read all of the poor reviews on this product, and we really should have listened to them!  However, we were drawn to the bouncenette's pretty neutral color and seeming usefulness.  We were wrong--it wasn't useful.  Here's a list of all that we found wrong with this bouncenette:*When our baby was a newborn, she wasn't properly supported by the seat, and would end up in very weird positions (head near the bottom of the seat, slumped over to the side, etc...) while sleeping.  We thought of placing towels or blankets on either end, but that didn't seem safe.*The vibration is weak.*The toys are very boring and out of the baby's reach, which is pointless.*It's awkward to carry around.*After only two months, we coudn't find any use for this product.We went back to the store and bought the Ocean Wonders bouncer, which is cheaper and a much better product.  Listen to the reviews--don't waste your money.
