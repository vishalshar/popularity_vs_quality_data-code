I got this to use for short periods of time and it works fine for that.  But after an hour or so, my shoulders really start to ache.  My son is 15 months, 32 inches, and 27 pounds and he fits comfortably in the carrier and we haven't had any trouble with his straps digging into him or causing any discomfort.  And it's not bad to carry with that amount of weight; it's at least an hour before I start to hurt and I can make it 2 hours before I'm in real pain.  The waist strap is comfortable (and I'm short--5'2"), but I've had trouble with the chest strap (I'm also busty, though) and haven't been able to get it perfectly adjusted.  My son loves the ride and the view and it's definitely handy.  It is hard to put on alone; you need another person or a waist-high table (my SUV's tailgate works fine) to get it on safely.  If you just need a carrier for the occasional short trip, this is great for the price.  But if you plan to use it frequently or for long trips, go with something better.
