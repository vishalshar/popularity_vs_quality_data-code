I'm a new mom and I am a big believer in the Avent line of products. This bottle warmer, however, is not one of their more stellar efforts. The instructions say that once the bottle has reached the appropriate temperature (which the device is supposed to know, based on the amount of time for which you've set the dial), the warmer will maintain the warm temperature until such time that you're ready to use the bottle. Well, it does, in fact, warm the bottle, but the machine just keeps making the bottle hotter and hotter! I put a bottle into the warmer and got distracted by my little one for a few minutes. When I went back to get the bottle, so that I could feed him, I was shocked to discover that it was so scalding hot that I could barely touch it! Not only is this inconvenient, it could also be very dangerous! After only two uses, this warmer has a new home on the top shelf of my pantry, where it will likely sit until the end of time. Save yourself the money and just warm your bottles by putting them in a bowl of hot water. Much easier, less time-consuming, and cheaper!!
