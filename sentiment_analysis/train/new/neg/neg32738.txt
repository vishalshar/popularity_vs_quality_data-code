I had two munchie mugs from the munchie mug site a couple years ago. The fabric stretched out so I just bought two new ones from amazon. I am not pleased. The munchie site says they come with the stay fresh lid like my 2 previous ones did. However, the two I ordered from Amazon did not. Without the lid it goes from 5 stars to 2 stars. This means that if my children do not eat all of the contents then it will have to be thrown out or at least transferred to a zip lock. If thrown in the diaper bag, puffs and cereal may be stale before I pull it out to use. The lid is a must. I will say they do an awesome job of keeping snacks from spilling though.  I will most likely return these and order from the munchie mug site so I have the lids to use.
