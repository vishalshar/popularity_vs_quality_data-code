I really like the Zoli cups, however I wasn't too happy with this bowl.  I got it for my daugher when she began eating table food.  I thought it would be the perfect bowl as you can seperate the foods or use it as a big bowl and I was excited that it also suctioned to keep the bowl from moving or tippng over.The suction never did work well for me and because it seemed to be top heavy and easy to tip cause there was no grip on the bottom.  I used this ONCE to try it out and I HATED it!  I would NOT recommend this to anyone.If you're looking for a good bowl I would highly suggest the OXO kid bowls.  I found the OXO ones since I wasn't satisifed with the Zo-li bowl and I LOVE them...my daughter still uses them till today and she's 3 now.
