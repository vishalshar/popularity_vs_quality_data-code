Ok, I wanted a toddler couch to replace my Mickey couch they have had forever, my expectations were a couch with storage and something they can't move by themselves or tip over. This couch is cute but failed all expectations, even one of the handles is on crooked. For what they are asking for it price wise I would expect it to be better quality, also on the arm of the couch near the bottom it seems to no a upholstered well and already to becoming apart and my kids haven't even used it yet. I would return it but they have already seen it. I would expect this couch to be worth no more than $40 in my book and that's pushing it, idk maybe I got a dud? Both of my kids can sit on it and my 18month old drags it everywhere, be careful if your kids get this because he has already had it tip over in him when he was sitting on it and looking over the back, thankfully he wasnt injured because I caught it lol!
