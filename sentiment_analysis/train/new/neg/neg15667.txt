I love that my baby can hold this toy easily at 5 months old, but the rubber smell is killing me! I leave it in his crib so it can be a quiet play toy when he wakes up, and it stinks up his whole nursery. I have other natural rubber toys that don't do this.3 stars for the shape & design, losing the other two for the smell.
