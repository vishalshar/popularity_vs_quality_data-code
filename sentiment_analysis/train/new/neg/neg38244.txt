I wanted to love this because it was simple and good size.  But the netting ripped after 3 months.  The mattress does not lay flat and the middle portion sticks up so it is not smooth at all.  It is not easy to take down and put back together.  That was a disaster the one time that we did it.  We are dealing with it since it works for a "playpen for a few minutes" when in the bathroom or we need to run upstairs.  But not something that we could use to travel or for a long period of play time.
