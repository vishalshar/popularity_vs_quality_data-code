The plastic night light is flimsy and kind of cheap feeling. But my daughter loves it. This is the style with an on/off switch rather then the automatic light sensor. So it doesn't run all day with the shade drawn, but if she turns it on and leaves it on I have to notice it to correct.  Its all right and for the price a good value.
