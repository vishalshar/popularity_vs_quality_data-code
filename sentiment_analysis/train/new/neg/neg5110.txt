Admittedly, we have an unusual toilet (a Duravit) so I wasn't sure this adjustable seat would really work.  It doesn't.  It won't fall in the toilet or anything, but it shifts around too much for my son to feel stable on it, even adjusted to its largest setting.  Oh well on that front.My big complaint though is the design itself.  We did try to use it a few times, but the actual opening is so small that my son inevitably ending up peeing between the two pieces (the cushy seat and the base).  Which is pretty gross to clean up. He's pretty good about pointing down so he doesn't make a mess on other seats (which I have to hold so they don't move) but this one was impossible. The two-piece design is a problem.  It may be fine for girls.
