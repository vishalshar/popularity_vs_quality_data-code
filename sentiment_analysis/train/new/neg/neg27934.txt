This has been a horrible monitor. We needed a third monitor but couldn't buy another of the same excellent models we have so we took a chance on this one. Wrong choice! It hums all the time and is very hard to hear our baby. It's very cheaply made compared to our VTech and Sony ones. Throwing this one away when our new one arrives in two days.
