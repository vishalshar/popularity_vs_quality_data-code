I had ordered this for my son, it appears to be soft but it looks as if buzz and woody were sewn on making it stiffer. However my son loves it though he has yet to use it. When we got this in we checked to make sure it worked which it did not so we had to replace the battery pack. It's a cute pillow but not a soft comfy pillow that I was anticipating.
