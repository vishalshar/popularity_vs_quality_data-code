I purchased this diaper bag because of it's claims to be "large". As a formula-feeding mom, I needed all the extra space I could get. Upon receiving the bag I was disappointed. The bag opens no further than a standard backpack. After packing the standard formula, bottled water, bottles, change of clothes, diapers, wipes and other miscellaneous things a baby need when you leave the house the bag was practically over flowing with stuff! Also when the bag arrived the designs were bright and glittered, but now they have faded and are dingy looking, and most of the glitter has fallen off (onto my coat!).If you absolutely have to have a Hello Kitty diaper bag I recommend looking further than this one.
