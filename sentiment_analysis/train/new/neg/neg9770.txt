I like the look of the set, and the baby seems to love it too, but I'm slightly disappointed overall.  The valance isn't large enough to cover an average window.  You will need to buy and additional valance and combine them (makes the set a little  pricier than it should be).  Plus the winding mechanism on the mobile broke within ONE month!  And I wasn't overusing or misusing it, either.  In order to get a new one, you have to go through the hassle of returning the entire set instead of just the mobile - pain in the butt!  Looks nice, but a little overpriced for the quality you get.
