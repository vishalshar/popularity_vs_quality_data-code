I love how this combo looks, love the features, love that it raises so high to fit our bed, but I cannot find sheets that fit the mattress.  I am frustrasted beyond belief that I only have a cover for the mattress and not a real sheet.  If anyone can possibly help, I would be grateful.  At this point I have bought flannel recieving blankets and will be making sheets, but obviously, would like to have the convienence of purchasing pre- made sheets for proper fit.  Thoughts, comments and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.....
