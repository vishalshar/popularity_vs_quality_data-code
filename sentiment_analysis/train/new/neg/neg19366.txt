These are NOT diaper service quality premium diapers. I have been using these for years to make embellished burp cloths to sell as I like the non-pilling, twill fabric used and that they are 100% cotton without synthetic padding (which can develop odor over time). I used to be able to find them at Babies r Us, but they've stopped carrying them, so I looked here. The packaging and description were the same as the ones I've bought for years, but the quality has decreased dramatically. When washed the first time, they shrank a full inch shorter than they used to. They are also noticeably thinner than they used to be, so much so I can't include the older and newer versions in the same set. I won't be buying these again. I'll have to switch to a more expensive "real" diaper brand, and have to raise my prices as a result. That sucks.
