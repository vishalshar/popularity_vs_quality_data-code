I bought this item in the fall & was so excited to be preparing my baby for winter.Now winter has arrived & I am NOT using the item for the following reasons:1) It is very tight & hard to put on the car seat (I have a Chicco)2) Car Seat hard to place in car b/c the item needs to be removed for straps to fit (we don't use a car seat base)3) I am worried about my child's safety  - I get comments from passersbys who worry if my child has enough air to breathe.  They suggest item is unsafe, but too new for lawsuit to have happened yet.Instead, I use a plastic cover with regular blankets underneath.Unfortunately, I can no longer return the advice, since I put it in advance of the season.
