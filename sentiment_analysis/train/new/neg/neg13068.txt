Update 10/6/11After using this seat for almost 2 years I have found the strap to loosen and tighten the belts is extremely hard to use. It has gotten to the point where my wife cannot loosen the seat without really forcing it. Other than that we love the seat. It seems comfortable for my son as well. In the future I probably wouldn't buy this seat. I have used some other chairs purchased for $40 at other retailers and had as much success as with this chair.Original Post 12-29-2009:I Purchased this in a little over a month ago and the seat is satisfactory.Pros:This car seat was easy to install. The connectors are easy to find and once the straps are straight easy to connect.Cons:The strap you pull to tighten the harness looks like it is already having a lot of wear and its only been a month. Although the connectors for the harness have enough room to work out twists in the harness they are also large enough to easily allow the straps to twist making it so you have to fix them almost every time you strap in your child which is annoying.
