I wanted a reusable solution for homemade baby food and I have the infantino squeeze system. I liked this idea and it was able to be cleaned with my bottle brush, however, my baby was not able to use this by herself like other squeeze pouches because it constantly sucked air in when she took it out of her mouth. This made it extremely frustrating for both mommy and baby. Would not recommend this- just stick to disposable squeeze pouches that infantino makes.
