I have not tried this sling out with my newborn yet but I wanted to leave feedback about two things because I expected something a bit different. It does have a pocket but unlike the other PS sling I have it does not have a key/toy ring attached to the pocket. I also didn't realize it had a padded rail along the inside edge. I will be interested to see how it holds up to the heat since I will be having baby #2 in July in TX. I will definitely hang onto this one because I really like my other PS sling - but I will be getting an unpadded ring sling too for more options.
