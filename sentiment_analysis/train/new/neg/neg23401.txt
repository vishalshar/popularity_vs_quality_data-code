If you are considering buying this system, mothers seem to have one of two opinions.  Either they hate it or they love it.I hated this system.  My baby was born early, just 4 lbs, 8 ounces when we brought him home from the hospital.  His mouth was very small.How this boy suffered trying to negotiate the huge Avent nipples.  We had painful delivery with serious complications, and if I had not been in such a medicated daze, I would have figured out sooner that the Avent bottles were the problem, not my ineptitude of inserting a bottle into an infant's mouth.Being my first baby, I struggled and struggled to feed him properly, but he constantly gagged and spit up.  He could not take in the full nipple to get a good "latch on", so formula was just spilling out of his mouth.Not only was this messy, I worried constantly that he was hungry.  And he was.  He would feed every two hours!The Avent nipples have a strange bulb at the end (not similar to the bulbs of other systems).  The silicone material is very hard and thick, not natural feeling to the touch.Although some mothers may disagree, this is not an ideal system for preemies or low birth weight babies.  We struggled with this system for two months when I finally replaced it with an inexpensive brand with sensitive response nipples.  We are completely happy with the cheaper brand!I actually prefer the narrow bottles to Avent's wide bottles because they travel better: fit in diaper bags, strollers and cupholders with ease.If you wish to try Avent, I recommend buying ONE Avent bottle  (bottle, nipple #1, ring and cap) to see how your baby likes it when s/he comes home.  Have a small, cheaper set in waiting.  If your baby loves the Avent bottles, send Grandma to the store with your Gift Card (assuming you get one :)) to buy the full set.  Otherwise, save yourself big bucks.  I wish I had.
