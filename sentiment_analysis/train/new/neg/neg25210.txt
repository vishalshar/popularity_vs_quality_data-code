I bought this product because I am anticipating a road trip with my seven month old and wanted something that would allow me to be discreet while nursing in my car at rest stops. I think it is a great idea, and it would likely be great for use with newborns, however, once your child is old enough to start grabbing at everything in sight (4 months or so), the "hooter hider" (not a fan of the name either, by the way) becomes a nuisance. My son likes to yank on the fabric, every which way, to the point that wearing it draws attention as opposed to diverting it.I find that while I am wearing it, I am spending more time rearranging it than concentrating on the task at hand, which is feeding my kid.Again, in theory, this is a great product, in practice, it is awkward and more trouble than it is worth. I will stick with closing the blinds while I am at home. As for the road trip? I am not looking forward to busting out the hooter hider, but it may just be a necessary evil in that situation.
