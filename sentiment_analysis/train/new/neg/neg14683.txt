we got this stroller on clearance at toys r us, so i need to mention that foremost.the stroller had no cup attached to the cupholder, and also there was no manual.aside from those 2 minor issues, let me get right to the pros and cons of this stroller:pros--full shade,  many recline positions, BUT RECLINE feature needs two hands to use and also would be rather difficult to  recline with child  seated inside. didnt like this concept at all!  cute colors,  leg extension (for younger kids),  pouch for parent attached to hood,  big convenient basket on bottom.  nice height for 5'6", any taller (5'9" and up), and you may find it too short.cons-- wheels squeaked out of the box! and they didnt stroll as claimed "all-terrain", it seemed like it would pose a problem for me on concrete...i only tested it out in my kitchen and on my fam room rug, and it didnt turn as smoothly as i imagined.  leg room was quite uncomfortable for my son..he couldnt put his feet on the rubber strip on bottom without the leg extension getting in the way...  the seat width could be sufficient for about a 32 pounder at most...my son is both tall and big for his age(2.5 yr old). he is by no means fat, but he is 38 pounds and wears a size 3-4T pant. the seat width was a little squishy for him. he didnt look too comfortable in it.i was really excited to make this purchase, but it  just didnt fit our needs...we need a really comfortable ride for our son and upcoming baby. i hoped this owuld be it, but unfortunatly it didnt work out :(
