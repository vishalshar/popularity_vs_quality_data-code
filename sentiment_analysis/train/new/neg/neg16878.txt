This cooler covers the opening to the bottom of the stroller and makes it completely unusable. It's a pain to get on and off so if you use the space under your stroller you can't use the cooler, and vice versa. I have a city mini elite stroller. There is very little storage on the stroller to begin with. I'm really disappointed because you should be able to use both..the same company created the cooler and the stroller. The cooler itself is good quality, it's just not functional.
