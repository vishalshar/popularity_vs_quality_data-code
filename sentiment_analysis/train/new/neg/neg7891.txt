We bought this for the design.  The box it comes in is super sturdy and nice.  The cards are made in China and the card stock is low end American Greetings level. I wish they took the money they are spending on the box the cards come in and upgrade the notecard stock to something of a higher grade.  Especially for the price of the cards.  I would get again for the design.
