I purchased this for my youngest granddaughter who outgrew the other seat I had.  I wanted a five point unit that would work with just a seatbelt as I do not have shoulder straps in the back of the car.  (I would have prefered the Fisher Price 20/60 five point unit but they stopped making it.)She fit in the seat with the straps in the upper slots.  Unfortunately, there is a lump about an inch below the upper slots in the middle of the seat where one of the latching straps is attached to the rear of the seat.  She felt this through a light winter coat.  I had to put padding between the seat and the seat cover to prevent the bump from bothering her.If a child is smaller enough for you to use the lower strap holes they probably won't feel the lump as it will be between their shoulders and their neck.  However, if they are large enough to require the use of the upper strap holes they will have the lump pressing against their spine.
