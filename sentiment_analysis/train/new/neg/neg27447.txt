These are the bibs I grab when we are going out and I dont want to wear the ugly ones that actually work better and have stupid sayings like "I'm in Charge of Dinner" etc. So for those babies who don't constantly drool like my son who needs 4-5 bib changes a day these are cute and I always get compliments on them.
