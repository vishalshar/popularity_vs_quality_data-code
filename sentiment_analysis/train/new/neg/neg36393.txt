This just did not work for me.  I am a plus size chick, about a size 22 on top, and this cover was just too short and not wide enough for me on the sides.  It made me feel even more self conscious than if I was using nothing at all or just using a blanket.  I gave it 3 stars because it probably works fine for normal sized women and the pattern is pretty.  The neck, with the stiffness to be able to see the baby, was fine, but it seemed to close to my face, likely because I am bigger so the neck strap wasn't as long as it could have been.  Unfortunately I had to send it on back and I can't find anything longer or wider for bigger women.  Manufacturers need to realize plus sized women DO have babies, too.
