This car seat is not good for long drives, which will be an issue for our drives from the bay area to the Sierras (3-4hr drive) This is the reason I gave it 3 stars.I was originally going to buy this seat in the Chatter (Black,$19), but ended up buying the Baker (light blue, $25)since it looked like a newer model and was a little more expensive. The reason was that I had read that this car seat did not have much cushioning, but that reviewer thought the Nov 08 model was going to have that. I researched on the net for which model would be the new Nov 08 model, but wasn't able to find it. Therefore, I looked at the pics and price and took a chance that the Baker would be this newer model with more padding. I am sorry to say that I was wrong.Got the seat and for the price it looks pretty good, but it really has NO PADDING. The only padding is what's used to sew the cover and it's THIN. This booster is going to have to be a "around town" booster, but I would not take it along for any long-drive vacation trips. Unless, of course, I can add some padding myself to the seat. I wish I would have just gotten the Chatter for less money.Luckely I also have a Compass 510 that is excellent for long drives... I saw it got bad review in that carseat study. I went back out to our car to check if the lap belt really is too high up on the stomach on our child, and in our case/kid this is NOT a problem. I would just recommend to try whatever seat you get IN YOUR car with your child. Hope this review help you car-vacationers. =)
