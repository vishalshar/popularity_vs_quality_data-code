These knob covers work well to prevent our toddler from opening doors that she shouldn't. I feel very comfortable using this as a deterrent on the door to our basement steps and to keep her out of the bathrooms unsupervised. However, they are slightly too large for the door knobs in our house which also makes it a bit of a deterrent for our adult guests. If you have smaller knobs, it can be challenging for some people (especially grandmas and grandpas) to get their fingers on the knob to open the door easily.Because they do get the job done and safety is my primary concern, I haven't bothered to find try a different brand. These will keep your little one from opening doors. Just be prepared to be slightly irritated at them yourself :-)
