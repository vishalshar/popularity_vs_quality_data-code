I picked these up as my daughter was first showing interest in feeding herself.  It was a great product for what it was, but might really have been labeled for a slightly older child than just one who is a "sitter."  My daughter sat at 8 months, but could not grasp the concept of getting this product back to her mouth by 10 months old.  Once she did get the hang of it, she thoroughly enjoyed being a "Big girl" and "feeding herself."
