I expected a toy that could at least work for me, but the rackets are so poorly made, I couldn't even hit one (professional birdie) straight.  Amazon refunded my money without even making me return the items, so what does that tell you?  Amazon, tell Vilac to create a good product and quit filling our landfills!
