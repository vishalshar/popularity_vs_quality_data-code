This was advertised as a teething ring, and although it makes for a great toy with lots of colors and interactive potential, I'm not sure this is a #1 choice for teething.  The keys (as well as other components) are very hard, and although the baby will put anything in her mouth, she does a little grimace when chewing on these, so I'm unsure if it's uncomfortable or not.
