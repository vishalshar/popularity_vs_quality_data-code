I bought this about a month ago for my 14 month old. I bought it because it was ranked highest on consumer reports for safety and came at reasonable price. It was not super hard to install but we have the latch system. I will say I did want to put it in the center seat but our car only has latches on side seats and when I tried to combine them in the middle it left more than an inch of movement...so on the side she goes!She is also still rear facing per the new recommendations and even with a towel wedged her wee head still flops forward when she sleeps... will be trying pillow soon.I do like the room it gives her within the seat and the seat itself does not take up that much room in the back of our 4 door sedan....it still allows 2 other people to sit in the back.
