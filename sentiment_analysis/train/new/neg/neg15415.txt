Works and looks great until I washed it and noticed my daughter's fingers was covered in lint and I mean it was wrapped around and snagged in between each of her tiny fingers and under her nails. It was horrible! It took awhile to clean up her hands. I instantly threw them away. I should've taken a photo but I was too freaked out about it
