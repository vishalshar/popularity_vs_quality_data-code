The product is well designed and has great features, however the motor is terrible.  At first it was ok, the motor did have some noise and it was definitely noticeable when the music is off, but I could still stand it.  However after a few weeks of use, the motor got much louder, even louder than the music.  I didn't really want a mobile that would also be a white noise machine, and now it has past the return period so I can't return it anymore.Attached video shows how loud the motor is.  It's a very cheap motor.  I would definitely find something else if I had known this.
