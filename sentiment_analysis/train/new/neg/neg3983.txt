I purchesed this bassinet for my newborn baby girl and we are overoll satisfied with it. It looks really good, the mobile has nice songs and the vibrating option is what helped us get our baby to sleep at night. The only thing with that is that it stops after a few minutes and we have to wake up and turn it back on when we do that its kinda loud and strong and it can startle the baby. But either than that is a good product and this way we can make our baby get used to sleeping in her crib later on.
