We purchased these to be used in our church parking lot to alert incoming traffic of the children playing on the playground that is right off our parking lot. Although the signs are a bright yellow that is easily seen, it really ended up not serving our purpose because they were just not large enough. They are so lightweight that we couldn't keep them in the parking lot if there was even the slightest bit of wind as it would blow over and even blow away. At one point we were using something to weight them down just to keep it in place. The material was not what we expected as it was more like a corrugated cardboard that just had a slick type covering over it. We used this until we were able to purchase something that worked much better for our purpose. I would not buy this product again as the value for what was paid really just wasn't a worthwhile investment.
