Ordered the crib in the "honey oak" stain and unfortunately had to return it due to manufacture's defect that prevented a complete assembly, and there was a hole in the mattress pad.  The mattress pad is totally unacceptable for long term use - it's a thin pad of cheap foam wrapped in vinyl lining.  The stain was really golden and kind of yellow, didn't impress in person.  I will say the customer service in coordinating the return was excellent and UPS picked up the package within 12 hours at NO cost to me!  Awesome in that regard.
