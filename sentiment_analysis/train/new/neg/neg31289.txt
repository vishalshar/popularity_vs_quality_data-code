I loved the look and the quality is fine but this is not safe to use. I bought a variety of stools because I have twins and three bathrooms. This has a smaller width and length than other stools so it tips easily. They may not slide off of it but the whole darn thing is going to tip over at the drop of a hat. We have been lucky they have not hurt themselves significantly. I have it on a flat non carpeted surface so it isn't due to uneven surfaces. I would not recommend this one bit. I am not even going to sell it at a garage sale because I would not want to endanger another child.
