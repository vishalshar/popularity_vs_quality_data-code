Very small. Thats all i have to say.I have a one year old petite girl and the plate is not big enough for her meal...the price is right about three dollars and free shipping with A. Prime. Which made it worth it. But the "slip resistant" claim is not all that. it does slip if you slap it...oh yeah my daughter loves to do it.for the price it is ok, but don't expect too much use out of this little plate.I really like this brand, because things are modern, simple, and the price is affordable, but this is just a piece of plastic with a type of rubber under it to reduce slip. Think about it...
