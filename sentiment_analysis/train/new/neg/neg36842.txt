I was expecting "Stage 1 Slow flow" to be slower.  My baby still chokes on the speed. (She's used to breastfeeding at a slower pace.)  I even attempted 'paced feeding' (bottle horizontal, breaking often)Positives:[+] The design seems easy for the baby to switch between breast and bottle. No rejection of either.[+] Good quality design. Thick (yet pliable) materialNeutral:[*] A few more pieces to wash. (Not a huge deal. I had no problems lining up the parts as other reviewers might have.)Negatives:[-] For being "Stage 1 Slow flow", it sure was fast flowing compared to my Avent bottles!  Holding upside down produced a rapid drip (2 per second), where my Avent bottles dripped 1 in every 5 seconds.[-] Milk gets 'caught' in between the nipple parts (between clear and blue section). There are 4 small 'tabs' to drain the milk back, but as long as there is pressure in the bottle, it won't drain back in.  (Unscrewing the bottle to release the pressure allows the 4 drain tabs to work, but this is an extra step I find annoying.)  In our case, we're using previously pumped breastmilk, which makes 'wasting' even more aggrevating.Summary: I will save these for later. I'm not impressed with the fast flow from a "Stage 1 slow flow" nipple, but it is a nipple not rejected, so I will not abandon it completely.
