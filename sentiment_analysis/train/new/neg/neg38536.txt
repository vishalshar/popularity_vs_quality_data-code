I somewhat agree with the reviewer who called the gate "shoddy." This is not a gate that could withstand a lot of use from a baby who is learning to walk (ie pulling up on furniture.) The gate itself is fine, the attachments to the wall/stairs on either side is pretty cheap. The side with the hinge is plastic and only held in place by four 1/2 inch screws on both top and bottom (2 screws on each side.) The side with the click open piece is also plastic. My husband and I were able to push through pretty easy. We have installed an extra piece of wood on the outside to make sure if my little man does push through he will hit the piece of wood first.  All in all this gate will be a barrier so that you can grab them before they try to go down the stairs but I would not expect it to be a good enough barrier where you could leave them unattended for long periods of time.
