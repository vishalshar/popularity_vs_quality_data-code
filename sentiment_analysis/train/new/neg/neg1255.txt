I put these up in my son's room, along the baseboard of his walls, about 2 weeks ago. They seem to be doing fine, although a couple of the corners started to lift, but I just pushed them back down. One thing you should know, though is that these do take a while to put up, as there are many pieces. For example, the trees are 2 pieces (1 for the leaves, 1 for the trunk), the wheels are separate from the cars, the helicopter is like 4 different pieces.Update - Have had these decals up for about 2 months now, and they keep curling off the wall. Other decals (different brand) that I bought at the same time from a different seller haven't lifted at all. With these decals being so much more costly than the other ones I bought, I would have expected more. I don't think I'd buy these again.
