Not padded for comfort, but it should work well on a smaller child.  We had this in Yellowstone because of the danger, but we wanted our 3 1/2 year old to be able to walk the paths.  This was a compromise.  It barely fit him, though he is a little thick.  Made me feel safer walking about the geothermal ground.  He hated it, but came to grips with it.  In the least, I was able to threaten him with using this if he didn't hold my hand and walk with me.  Either way he was safer.  If any adults make comments, just tell them when the adult muzzle come out you'll buy one for them.
