We bought this for our B-safe car seat and were frankly quite disappointed.  I mean if you didn't know any other cover existed for this seat, perhaps we would have been fine, but instead I ordered both this Britax one and this Brica one: http://www.amazon.com/BRICA-Infant-Comfort-Canopy-Cover/dp/B005FWCEGG/ref=sr_1_1?s=baby-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1408417561&sr=1-1&keywords=brica+car+seat+cover and between the two, the Brica one was WAY better.  VERY simple to install and remove, a much neater fit and feel to it, and FAR more functional than the Britax solution.  To be honest if I was Britax I would license the Brica design and build and just brand it as mine and get rid of the crummy one they are offering here.  Brica > Britax on this one hands down!
