This appears to be a cheap knock-off version of the real Baby Aspen "Let the Fin Begin" robe. First of all, it comes in a package from China with no tags by Baby Aspen. Second of all, it is very cheaply made, with a rough material that has threads coming loose all over the place. My husband and I compared the cut of the robe we received with the one in the photo, and the teeth and tail are obviously different (different shape and cut). I don't understand what happened since the listing says it is sold and shipped by Amazon, and when I received it, it was postmarked from a seller called "Stylish&express." This is a garbage product, and I am returning immediately.
