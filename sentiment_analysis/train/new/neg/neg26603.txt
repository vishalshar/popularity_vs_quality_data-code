While I believe this cover has potential and I do like it, mine arrived without the inserts and I've had to use prefolds that I had already with it. The prefolds tend to saturate quickly and then this cover becomes damp, especially around the leg holes. I was informed by Amazon that I would receive a full refund since a cover without the inserts is not what I paid for and it has been over 1 year and 2 months now and I'm still waiting for my refund to process correctly. Amazon has proven to have terrible customer service on my issue and I'm starting to doubt I'll ever receive my refund. So for the price I paid, this cover was not at all worth it. Also, the color is straight up bright red and grassy green, the image made it look a bit more pinkish...not a big deal and I should have known from the color name anyway (chili pepper). Lastly, the size of this diaper is nice because it fit my newborn a bit better than some other adjustable diaper covers. I expect she'll grow out of it more quickly though.
