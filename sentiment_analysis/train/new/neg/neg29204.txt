I was so excited to try these out since they really do seem like the perfect thing for typically breastfed babies.  Maybe we just got a bad batch or something, but I hate these bottles. The outer nipple is designed to feel like a breast, but when my 3 month old gets it into her mouth it collapses onto itself, then the suction from trying to drink from it and the milk gathered in the nipple seem to create some kind of vacuum and make it hard for her to drink. At least that's what it looks like to me. Maybe she just hates them and is fighting me on it.  This also seems to be one of the worst bottles that I've tried as far as air getting into the bottle and making baby uncomfortable.  Since my daughter has/had some reflux and gas issues, it was a no-go for us.  I also used ours pretty rarely and at least two of them (out of the starter set) have cracked already.  They don't leak yet, but there are little fissures in a sunburst pattern on the bottom of the bottles.  The plastic feels pretty thin and cheap, and apparently it is.  It seemed like a good idea, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired, and the design, for whatever reason, isn't working out for us.
