The material is heavy and seems very durable - but after our first wash, the stitching on one corner had ripped and the elastic had unraveled slightly. We only hang to dry, and the remainder of the stitching has held up well over lots more washes, so it probably was a fluke. But still, had to dock 2 stars for it unraveling right away. We were so swamped with the first few weeks of dealing with a newborn, so I didn't think to return it at the time, but in retrospect I definitely should have. That said, it's still holding up well considering the damage - which otherwise seems to speak well of its quality. So - buyer beware, sadly.
