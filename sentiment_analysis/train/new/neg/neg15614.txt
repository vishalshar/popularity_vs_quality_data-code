I bought these to store my milk in while I pumped at work.  I liked that they hold about 6 oz, and I use Avent bottles, and thought it'd be good quality.  I was VERY disappointed because once you start using them, the lids stop working properly- they become extremely hard to close because they don't seem to screw on correctly.  And once you think it's screwed in well, you push down on the lid and it's still loose.  Many times when I get home, I find that milk has spilled out of the bottles while I was driving!!  And another problem is that when milk gets in the grooves of the lid, it makes it really hard to open.  And when you put it in the refrigerator, and milk gets cold, it's almost like it becomes glue in the grooves. So you're fighting to open the lid, just to have it spill when you finally open it because you're using so much force.  Sure, it's nice that the bottles stack, and it's easy to store the lids together, but at the end of the day, do not use this to store milk.  I'm a working mom and EVERY drop of milk I pump is priceless.  Unfortunately Avent didn't do a good job in designing this for it's primary purpose - to save and store milk.  Oh, I also went to the Avent website and saw in their Q&A section a question about the lid/leakage problem.  The answer in the website was that they didn't recommend using these more than FOUR times because the cups/lids become warped and could lead to leakage.  Really?  Four times?  I mean, did they really expect me to buy a new package each week?
