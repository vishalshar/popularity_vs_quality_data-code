I primarily use my Bebe Au Lait nursing cover but couldn't resist this due to an awesome deal in the Amazon Warehouse. I like that it folds into a pouch but not crazy that its not weighted in the corners like my Bebe cover. Lets just say that my wriggly 8-month-old has lifted the whole shebang up while nursing a few times. If I would've paid full price, this would've been returned.
