Honestly I have a Baby Einstein one at home that is absolutely great.  This one I got as a 2nd for my child to use at daycare.  Granted if it's just a spare, then it's totally fine for the money, but for one you'd use normally it's not worth it.  The top is spring loaded, so under the very top play portion are some springs, I'm assuming so the child can jump in the thing and play.  Truthfully, they don't need springs to be able to jump when they are ready to.  Also, the 3 feet on the very bottom that you pull out so the saucer does not rock, are quite flimsy and don't really do what they are intended to do.  Between this and the spring loaded top, it's more like a coaster ride for someone too young to appreciate it.  Instead what it does is makes the thing feel very unsturdy to me and apparently to my child as well, who is always scared when left in it, because the thing moves all over.  The toys are just ok.  If you just want plain toys fine, although I prefer something a little more educational or something that appeals more to their senses.  My child just sits there and doesn't touch anything.  Partially probably because he's scared the thing will move again and partially because they aren't all that exciting.  Yet, put him in the Baby Einstein one, he's happy as a clam.  I've heard of other people that purchased the higher-end Evenflo ones and although I haven't tried them, they were happy with those.  But for the value and what you get, I'd definitely choose the Baby Einstein over this.
