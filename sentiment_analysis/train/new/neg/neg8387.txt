This is a great toy! However the paint comes off which makes me give it a one star for safety. Babies put their mouths on everything and I'm afraid of my little boy getting paint in his mouth. Of course I've been meaning to replace it but I missed my window. I still let my little one play with it when he has socks on. (I also have not used any harsh cleaning supplies or chemicals on it.  The paint just started rubbing off on its own).
