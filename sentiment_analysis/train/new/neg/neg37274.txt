I purchased this set for my daughter 3 years ago when she was a baby. She didn't care for them and also she constantly made herself gag with the long legs of the giraffe (this sounds funny writing it down.. ) so I gave both away.. Thinking that all babies are different I purchased another set for my son (when he started teething excessively) a couple of months ago but he doesn't care for them either! Same issue also.. giraffe's legs make him choke.. I guess they are not for everyone..
