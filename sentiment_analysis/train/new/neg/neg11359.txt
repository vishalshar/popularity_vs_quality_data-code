I bought this for my toddler with the expectation it would minimize the mess she would create.  The spill catcher serves its purpose as much as it can be expected to. The major negative is that it says it is dishwasher safe, top rack, which I abided by, but the suction cup and spill catcher easily mold into a new shape based on the surrounding dishwasher rack structure or items-- reducing the suction.  I probably should have anticipated it, but I take "dishwasher safe" literally as I hate to hand wash anything and assume that everything kid-oriented should be machine washable.  I would not buy it again.  It was my first suction cup bowl and probably performs no better or worse than others based on other reviews.
