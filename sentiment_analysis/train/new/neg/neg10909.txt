We were so excited to buy this product. But our son hates it! He is currently 1 month old, and we have tried using the snuggle nest for the past 3 weeks now. It has made us miserable. He screams and cries the moment we put him into it. The only way we can get him to sleep in it at all, is if my husband or I do the "5 S's" from The Happiest Baby On The Block, and wait until he is in a deep sleep. Then we sneek him into the snugglenest, and he sleeps in it for a maximum of about 5 minutes before waking up screaming again. He sobs to be comforted or fed, and the walls of the snugglenest prevent me from doing anything for him. I have to pull him out to do those things, and put him back in. Lastly, it scared the heck out of us. The other night he managed to wiggle his way down the snugglenest as I slept, and rolled face first into one of the two side-bumper pillows that is supposed to keep them from rolling over. I am so incredibly fortunate that I woke up for some reason or other. Something inside of me insisted I wake up, and I found him face first into this bumper, with a muffled cry that was so faint. When I quickly scooped him up, he gasped loudly, looked terrified, and then cried in my arms. I comforted him, and my heart raced. I hate that thing now. I never want to use it again. (Last night I did not use it, and we finally slept well without the baby screaming in protest for a solid 4 hours straight! This is a miracle for us! We are now using Dr. Sears' methods for co-sleeping safely, and we are all so much happier as a result. :)
