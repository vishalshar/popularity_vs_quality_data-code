Our daughter (12 months) has been learning how to drink from a cup at school.  They use tiny dixie cups and I haven't really found anything similar to use at home that's not disposable.  I was hoping this would work, but I feel like it's too wide at the top for little mouths and too narrow at the bottom for her to successfully set it down by herself.  This is probably fine for an older toddler.  I do like that the plastic is BPA-free and unbreakable though, and I think the lip probably helps a little with ease of drinking... but for now the liquid ends up on her and on the floor, not in her mouth.
