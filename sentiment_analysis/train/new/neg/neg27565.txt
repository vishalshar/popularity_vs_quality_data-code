Works well with dr browns wide-neck and medela! Leaks sometimes but you just have to make sure your bottle is straight up when pumping. Because i know sometimes when we do hands-free pumping, we move around and get into other things therefore tilting the bottlesslightly sideways. Just always check your bottles position and you'll be good!
