I bought it for my 7 year old.  I'm sure he's going to love it, because it is very cute, but I was very disappointed to see how small it was. it's not your average size carry on.  I was hoping to be able to pack his clothes for our week long trip in his own suitcase, but there's no way I'll even get 3 days worth of clothes in it.  It's good for overnight trips to grandma's at best.
