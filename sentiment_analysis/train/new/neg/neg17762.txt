The old and great G80 gate is not available anymore, and we were sent the new, crappy G3000 version. After asking for a refund, I got myself talked into accepting the gate, but after setting it up, I now realized how much it sucks. It is not nearly as sturdy as the old version, every joint wobbles, and this puts pressure on the walls, on top of being dangerous. Come on Kidco, why did you have to update the design to something so ridiculously bad when the previous one was working fine?
