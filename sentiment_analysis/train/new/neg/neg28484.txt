We bought this clip as read somewhere it oferred extra restraint protection.  We have  a 3 year old mid-functioning autistic.  Our little Houdinni debunked the clip in seconds and went free-ranging about our van.  Wouldn't recommend unless you need a replacement clip for your existing seat and couldn't get one from it's original manufacturer.
