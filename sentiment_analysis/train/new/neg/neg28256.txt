I bought these so that I can take surface wipes in my diaper bag without having to 1) take the whole container and 2) buy the expensive travel size. The zippers do not work very well and my wipes dried out. I liked the idea of having a soft pouch, but the fact that the zippers can hardly contain my wipes was very annoying to me. I read on the instructions not to put too many wipes in it, otherwise the zippers may "derail" and not zip. I find that the most I could put in was about 5 -7 wipes before the zipper failed. I don't have time to keep refilling the pouch, not to mention that 5 - 7 wipes may not be enough to last me a day. Wish I could return.
