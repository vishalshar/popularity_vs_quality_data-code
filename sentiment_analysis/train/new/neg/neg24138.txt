I think the concept of this is great, however it probably should not even be made in the larger sizes. Unlike swaddling blankets a baby could not get out of the Woombie no matter how they try.  I think this is dangerous for babies who are old enough to possibly roll over because their hands are not free to help them roll back over to their backs. I think Woombie makes a style with arms which would be better for older/bigger babies.  I only used mine at a couple of times because my baby was just starting to roll when I started using it on her.  For larger infants who still enjoy swaddling I would recommend Aiden and Anais Swaddle blankets.
