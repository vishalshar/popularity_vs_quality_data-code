Take heed to reviews of poor construction/improper fitting lid....wish I had! Bought for son (Godfather) to give his niece as a Keepsake Memento of her 6/7/15 Baptism. Extremely disappointed it did not meet expectation had hoped to display on nursery shelves until she can use rosary for her First Holy Communion, Confirmation, even tucked in somewhere on her wedding day....only lid keeps falling off so "Keepsake Box" cannot be used as intended.
