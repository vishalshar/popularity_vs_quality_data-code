We bought this stroller because consumer reports gave it a good rating and we loved the sporty color of the Metalica color scheme.  Also, we were looking for a light-weight compact stroller.  I know this is a long review, but after spending major $$$, I think it's important to share my experience.  We have used it for about 10mths now.(PROS)The stroller is very lightweight, compact, folds like an umbrella with the canopy, full recline (great for an infant or a sleeping older baby), sturdy, nice fabric, and looks very sleek. It does come with a parent cup holder & has a cup holder/snack tray for the baby.(Note)This stroller is compact = very small basket underneath, no storage space near handles (like to keep a wallet or keys). So, if these features are very important to you, then this may not be the stroller for you.(CONS)(1) Also, the stroller cannot be opened and closed with one hand. There is just no way around it.(2) It's hard to explain - but the harness is not fixed to the back seat, instead it is removable.  Just yesterday the `cloth piece' that holds the harness in place actually came off.  I called Peg Perego customer service.  They said, "the `cloth piece' is not meant to hold the harness while the child is sitting in the stroller nor is it meant to help restrain her/him."  They continue to say, "the `cloth piece' is only there to keep the straps of the harness out of the way while putting the baby in the stroller."  So in essence this is a 3-Point Harness or a 'Floating' 5-Point Harness.  I bought the stroller thinking it was a 5-Point Harness (that is what their web-site states).  I asked if they could fix it but I was told it was considered an `Upholstery' issue and that `Upholstery' on their strollers are covered for 90 days and not 1 year.  So, I took it to a nearby tailor and got is sewn back on for about $8.**  If I were to give a new mom advice on buying a stroller.  It would be to get one with a good 5 point harness, all other features are just personal preferences.  A 5 point harness is not a standard on strollers as it is on car seats.  But, I think they should be. It is much safer to have a 5 point harness to keep the child secure in the stroller. *****  If a true "5 point harness" and a true "one hand open/close" are really important to you.  Check out the Zippy by Inglesina.  It is very similar to the Peg Perego Pliko but does not have a parent cup holder, no child snack tray/cup holder, and does not fold with the canopy on. ******* No mater what stroller you decide on, if possible, check it out at the store - open and close it yourself, lift it up to make sure you can lift it, test out all the features you are looking for, etc. ****
