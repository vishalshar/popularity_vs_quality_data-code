SO SMALL AND THEREFORE SO OVERPRICED!You are paying for packaging, which is nice- but what is the point? They're cookie cutters. If you're giving these as a gift, perfect, very cute.Try to find it in person, you'll never pay $9 for these two- the small one literally should be $0.50 max. Sorry I paid what I paid.That being said, the shape is on point, and I wanted the birds for spring. They are cute, but they are so small. If it came with one size bigger as a third to the set, for the same price, it would be 100% perfect (I thought it was coming with 3 cutters because of the picture but that's my fault).
