The one star is because it is easy to clean and Amazon won't allow NO stars.Very poorly made and not very accurate or dependable. I bought this on a recommendation to use for weighing the obese shelter kitty I adopted. A cat's weight loss has to be monitored since fast loss can cause major health problems. The scales 4 "feet" on the bottom are suspended in 4 round holes and each held there by 4 thread-like pieces of plastic. I can only assume these are supposed to be what pass as levelers. They are so flimsy that the first time I sat this down on the floor and slid it a little 3 of the plastic threads broke on one of the feet. It made a funny noise so I picked it up and turned it over to see what it was & THAT is when I discovered the plastic threads. It gets better. Supposedly the scale recalls the last weight and then zeroes so you can get a new reading. Sometimes yes but mostly no. It usually recalls around 4 lbs. instead and then often ADDS that to the current weight of kitty. One day it says she weighs 18 lbs and 3 days later it says she weighs 22 lbs...then 3 days later she weighs 18 lbs again. I have tried turning it off and on repeatedly to get it to display zero which occasionally works.On a couple occasions the scale worked the first time. I've even tried taking out the batteries every time I use it so it erases the memory recall but that doesn't always work either. Just get a plain no frills scale and write down the weight it you can't remember it. I am going to recycle mine to the dumpster.
