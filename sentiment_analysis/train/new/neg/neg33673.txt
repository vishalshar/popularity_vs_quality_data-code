its just so difficult to fit the bottles in them . let alone take off the bottle , if you were ever able to put it in .i'm not sure if its my type of bottles ?i use tommy tippee and Avent , and they both didn't really fit well .i even tried cutting the front part from the tummy of the toy to give more space to fit for the bottle . once i was able to do so . i faced difficult time to get it out .also baaby wasn't able to really hold his bottle . it just feel awkward for him .i'm just using it now as a cute plush toy . i have to admit they look cute . but not for the original purpose .
