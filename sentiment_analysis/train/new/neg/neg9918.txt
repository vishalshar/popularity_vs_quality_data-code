Terrible.  We had to return it 3 times. The reason I kept giving it a try is because I have all Born Free bottles.  I bought two; one for the kitchen and the other for upstairs for night time feedings.  Both do not heat the bottle well.  For example if I have 6oz of formula I have to set the warmer for 9-10mins just to get it warm.  There have been many nights when my baby is screaming because she's hungry and I have to heat, and reheat.  OR it would be the opposite and over heat to where it was boiling hot.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND unless you don't mind absolute frustration at 2am with a screaming baby.
