I'm not happy with these at all, we have about 20 Medela bottles, all purchased through Amazon, or in a store... They were all the same quality... High quality.... I got these in the mail today the plastic right off the bat feels thinner and not near as strong as all of my other bottles.... Which concerns me when beating milk in them... Second the tops, the tops are completely different and so thin. They provide no seal like my other bottles ( I checked the seal filling it with water and immediate leaking) needless to say, these are already back in the box and on the way back... The bottle on the left is my normal Medela bottle and the right is what I received. Not a happy customer... I forgot to add, the bottle kids were completely different from the packaging on the box. Ones shown on box were the normal Medela quality we have. This feels like a cheap knock off
