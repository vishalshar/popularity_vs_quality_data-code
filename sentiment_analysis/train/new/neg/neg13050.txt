We bought this for naps and for sleeping away from home. The naps didn't work out so well, but it it wonderfully portable for our trip home for the holidays and when we spent prolonged time with the in-laws at a local hotel. We chose this model because our daughter already has a changing table and a crib (and we only live in a two-bedroom apartment), so we didn't need the bells and whistles of the other Pack 'n Plays. This thing is ridiculously easy to set up, and take down gets easier with practice. Keep in mind though that the bassinet insert only works for the first few month at which point your child becomes too heavy. Also, I'm not sure if I'd want to use this as my child's bed because the mattress is very thin and hard, and I'd worry about a flat head with the back to sleep SIDS rule. Also, the instructions tell you not to insert your own mattress, again for safety reasons. I know many people do this though, so use your own discretion.This is a bit off topic, but the mesh is amazingly strong. We have a cat who has tried to sharpen her claws on it a few times and you'd never be able to tell.I'll write an update after Christmas at which point our baby will have slept in it for three weeks. But for now, we probably could have lived without it since we already have a crib and live in a small place (and our daughter was not a fan of naps in other rooms at home in this), but it is definitely convenient for sleeping on the go.
