Art work design is what attracted my daughter-in-law to this style.We ended purchasing 3 of these for the nursery of my 1st grandchild.It matched perfectly to the bedding she had for the crib set.The color is true rasberry and wear is adequate for the workmanship.It's been in use now for 15 months and still look very good.Well worth it if you want a true match to the Lambs & Ivy Raspberry Swirl crib bedding.One actually arrived with just a minor edge issue but since I sew I took a needle and threw to it and reinforced the edge - rather than returning.Otherwise good rug.
