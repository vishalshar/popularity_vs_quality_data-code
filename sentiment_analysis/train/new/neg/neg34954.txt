Seemed like a great idea but is generally a waste of money. The holder is cute, but it comes with so few bags. It's hard to tell when you're close to the end of a roll. The bags are handy to throw dirty clothes in when you're out and can't immediately do laundry but don't want to put wet/dirty pants and onesies directly into the diaper bag. However, we have dogs and have found that the rolls of "poop" bags purchased at PetSmart are a much better value and are the same exact product. We've started to refill our duck holder with the dog bags. I would recommend purchasing those instead.
