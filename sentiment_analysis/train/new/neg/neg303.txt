Although this was a great concept, it isn't perfect.Ours broke after just 6 weeks of use. The lid no longer opens and closes. The gears inside stripped from my older child manually opening it once. We have had it more than 30 days, so we can't return it and who wants to return a stinky diaper pail?As another reviewer mentioned, the lid has to be taken off and screws undone to replace the 'D' batteries. This battery cover is a little too close to where the diapers travel through, so it is a really gross process.Our pail will hold about a half of a week of diapers. They should be emptied more often than this anyway.The ball part inside that holds the diaper and then drops it in the trash can gets gross, no matter how hard you try to be careful and contain the mess.And the smell! It does absolutely nothing for the smell no matter how many of their filters you buy. There is the constant smell leaking from it, but when you open the pail to put in a diaper you just want to go running from the room before the smell overwhelms you.I wish I had saved my money and just bought a trash can.
