We have had this stroller for almost 2 years now, and it honestly has not been used too much. My daughter out grew it quickly not long after turning two she could reach the floor with her feet making it difficult to use. On some floor surfaces it is very difficult to maneuver. Our stroller also got a hole along the seem of the seat where the support bar is. I would not recommend this stroller or buy it again. The only pro is the storage basket is bigger than some similar strollers. The shade is also pretty useless.
