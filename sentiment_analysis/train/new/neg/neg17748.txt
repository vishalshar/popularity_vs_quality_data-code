This obviously has some sort of oil in it that just floats on top of whatever else is in the solution. You can even see this in the product picture if you look close. When you shake it, it doesn't mix. It breaks up a little and the oil quickly floats back to the top. This means when you pour it to use it for wipes you either get oil, or other.
