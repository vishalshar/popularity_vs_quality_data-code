This booster seat is very attractive and 4 year old says it is comfortable.  I like the 5 point safety harness, but I have a little problem unfastening the chest fastener.  It was extremely difficult to install using the car anchors, trying to get it tight enough.  Nobody wants to take it out when we need the seating space when the child is not using it.
