This bottle bag looks so cute online but not so much in person.  We have other Built NY products that we love and this one doesn't compare at all!The material is not the nice, smooth neoprene like our other items but more of a rough cloth that easily picks up dirt.  The pockets are super small and awkward when trying to fill them both.Finally, it does not keep our daughter's bottles cold AT ALL.  I can't even use this product.  O am either going to throw it out or give it away.
