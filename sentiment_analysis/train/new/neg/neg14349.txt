I am so disappointed in this product. First, the description showed a lined area where I would write my son's information on the band. When I received the band, I see no lines, only a tiny blank space on the crocrodile's back, small enough to fit his name and phone number. Second, the entire back of the band is littered with advertisements and other junk instead of blank space for more of my son's info such as allergies, etc. Third, there are no instructions on how to apply the band or take care of it or whatever. I gave this piece of junk two stars because the clasp worked. Never again. It is worth $1.
