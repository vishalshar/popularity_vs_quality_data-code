We were unfortunately not able to use these side rail covers for long, my son would just side it to the side and chew on the wood. He would also remove it without any trouble. This would be better if it would attach left and right to keep the cover from being slid aside and a stronger Velcro or a different kind of closure that is not so easy for kids to open would make this a very good product.I love the way it looks, but unfortunately, was not usable for me.
