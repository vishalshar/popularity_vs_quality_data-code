Had this for a few months now. Bought it after using the Munchkin Ducky Inflatable Bath Tub for over a year. The Munchkin Ducky tub is GREAT! But we bought this because it seemed more age appropriate when the Ducky got a small leak in it (after a year)PROs:-Kid LOVES the design.-A little bit wider and maybe a little bit longer than the Ducky tub.-suction cup or hanger ring options for storage between use. So far the suction cup is much sturdier than the one on the Ducky-adjustable backrest. The back rest is a separate compartment, so you can put less air in it if you'd like. I had do so because my kid's got long legs.CONs:-no drain plug. It's a much bigger task emptying the tub after each use. You can't just flip over the tub to empty it, you'll eventually put a hole in it. You have to empty it with a bucket. The Ducky had a drain plug/cap at the bottom.-the seams a kinda sharp. Not sharp enough to slice your child, but when my kid leans in the seams (which by the way aren't easy to avoid, it around the entire perimeter of the tub and all around the backrest) he get red lines where he had contact with the seams. Bad design.-smells like plastic/manufacturing chemicals for weeks.This is okay to use.But if this thing catches a hole and starts leaking, I'm going back to the Munchkin Inflatable Bath Tubs. The drain plug alone is a good reason.
