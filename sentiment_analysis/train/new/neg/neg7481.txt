I bought these because I read online that the other regular pacifiers are unsafe and some scary stories about mould growth.. The price is great and these are really hard to find at BRU or Target but my son hates these.. Its good in a way coz he lost his dependence on pacifier to sleep.... Hmmm... maybe a great weaning pacifier ;)
