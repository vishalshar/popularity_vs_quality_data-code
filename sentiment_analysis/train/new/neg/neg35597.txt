We purchased this swing because we owned the previous version as a hand me down from my sister. When the swing starts up the motor grinds as if it is not catching, the noise reduces when it continues but never goes away.  We spoke to Mattel/Fisher Price customer service and they sent us out a new motor, that motor made an even louder sound. I am returning the replacement motor and keeping the old one (I threw out the box for the swing so I am going to have to keep the swing).Overall our son is able to sleep and play in the swing, but I would recommend looking for a different swing if you do not want one that makes this much noise when it starts up.  I am afraid the grinding will eventually break the motor.
