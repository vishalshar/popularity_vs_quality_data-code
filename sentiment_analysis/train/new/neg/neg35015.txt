I bought this 2 years ago for my son.  He used it for about 2 months (a total of maybe 15 times). i never picked it up by the handle because i felt it was just more mess to clean up  (the inside of the lid is a different plastic and not easy to just "wipe".  it's a more rubbery material to help with the seal i guess?  It worked fine, although i absolutely hated cleaning it.  What a pain and mess!  We use cloth diapers, so I was completely burned out on cleaning up my kids waste!  We put it away for the past 2 years and I recently got it out for my daughter.  again, I NEVER pick it up by the handle, but when i went to empty it the other day it tilted a bit and leaked all over my leg!  Disgusting!  It also is hallow, so when you rinse it, if water gets inside the parts, you've got water leaking out forever!  Do not buy this product!  what a mess/waste!  I was trying to be kind to the environment by not purchasing the travel potty with the plastic linings, but now i have a huge plastic toilet that is going to the landfill!  Maybe I'll try to put it in the recycle bin?
