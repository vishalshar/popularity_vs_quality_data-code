We tried many different types of swaddle blankets (e.g. the Miracle Blanket, etc.) and the Kiddopotamus was the only one that worked right.The Miracle Blanket definitely kept our baby swaddled, but it literally took 2 of us to get it on her correctly, and it was such an ordeal that she was very upset by the time we were finished. In contrast, the Kiddopotamus is extremely easy to work with and wraps your baby up very quickly.My only word of advice is to buy the cotton knit instead of the flannel. We thought that the cotton knit would stretch more than the flannel (and indeed it does), but we thought this would make the cotton knit less effective (as in the baby would be able to get out more easily); however, what we found is that the stretchiness allows you to wrap it more tightly and effectively than the cotton flannel.Also out of 3 flannel ones we bought, 2 tore holes in them very promptly. And even though the cotton knit was used probably 10 times more often than the flannel, it never tore a hole.
