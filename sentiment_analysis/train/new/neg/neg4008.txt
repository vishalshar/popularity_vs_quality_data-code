This is good quality and a nice, warm cover but I put it on the car seat for the first time and found that it covers the latches in the front of the seat so if you don't pull it up then it won't lock into the base properly.  It works fine once you move the fabric out of the way but you have to be conscious of this.  I also wish the blanket had some velcro to keep it down because it flopped up over her face while we were driving and when I went to get her out of the car I realized it was covering her face.  It's nice if it's cold and windy but I don't want it covering her face unnecessarily and when she can't move it out of the way!
