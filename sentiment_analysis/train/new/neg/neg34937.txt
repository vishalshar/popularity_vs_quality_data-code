These fit WAY too snug. The video says up to 40lbs and it is too tight on my 29 lb 2 year old. The video also states these are bamboo velour inside with microfleece under the velour (similar to the old style snugglebees). Which is what sold me to buy these. However these are a simple PUL outer layer with a white microfleece inner.The insert is the typical stick-to-your-finger microfiber on one side with the hemp on the other. However they stuck the tag on the hemp side of the insert, which according to the description you are supposed to be able to place facing your child. But in my house this wont work since my child has sensitive skin and ANY tag causes her to itch like crazy. It is also hard to stuff as the insert feels too large for the diaper and is bunchy. In fact even if you don't stuff it and just lay it on top it still sticks almost an inch out the back. So I had to cut off almost an inch from the back of the insert and sew it closed. This cut the tag off (solving that issue) and also made the insert fit better into the diaper.Also after just one day of use one of the leg snaps just pulled out as I tried to unsnap this diaper!  I am returning the other three I purchased and would not buy these again.** UPDATE **  I just was researching around and found out that the video on this diaper is for the Babykicks 3G Pocket Diaper, Meadow/White Snaps which DOES have the bamboo velour inner, contoured insert and fleece gussets.  The video needs to be removed off this listing.
