I ordered the Britax Head and Body Support Pillow for my daughter. It arrived on time and the packaging was okay. However, the item itself was dirty. It was stained on the body section of the pillow. The head pillow appeared to be cleaned but the lower half was dirty with what looked like soot on both the front and the back. I will not be using this pillow for my 8 week old daughter, as I have no idea what this is. I was really looking forward to using this item. the idea of paying to return it is ridiculous to me. I will call it a loss, and not order certain things online again.
