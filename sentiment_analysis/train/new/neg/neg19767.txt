My little guy doesn't entertain very easy (he mostly responds to toys with sound and the color red, go figure) but I thought this with the combination of sounds, lights and dangly toys would be perfect to keep him entertained in the crib and maybe encourage him to to do stay a little longer on his tummy.But unfortunately, at three months (and now at over 4 months) he didn't care much for this. I wouldn't necessarily blame the toy for this because I think it's a decent toy which is very motion sensitive (even the slightest vibrations of us walking sets it off) and very vibrant with a glass mirror which shows a true reflection (not the distorted kind, like in plastic mirrors).On the flip side, I think it should have had more variety of sounds with lights that coordinated with the sound (they just flash at random) to make it more interesting. And the "noises" in the  dangly toys, like the squeaking and rustling are something meant for older babies (above 5 months, who have more control to press and squeeze) but utterly useless for younger ones (unless you're right down there with your baby).All in all, it's an alright toy, but my baby probably needs something more engaging. By the way, I got this for 20 dollars at Toys R Us, it's being sold for 10 dollars more here.
