I've had great experiences with the munchkin toys and my kids needed a new bath toy. They LOVED the munchkin faucet thingy so I thought I'd get them this.After fighting with the dumb thing for an hour to get the batteries in correctly and get it to turn on, it only worked for a minute before crapping out and just producing a tiny little dribble! Dried it off, took it all apart again, put it back together with new batteries, same thing! I couldn't get it to actually squirt water for more than a minute. Huge waste of time, major disappointment.
