We bought this stroller when we were expecting our twins.  (Based on input from another multiple mom who couldn't stop raving about it).  We were happy with the stroller for the first several months.  However, there were things about the stroller that DEFINITELY need to be improved:1)  The basket underneath started dragging on the ground after just a few uses (with light toys stored underneath).2)  The front wheels started getting caught in the basket when we would open the stroller...which is happening almost everytime we open it now.3)  The harnesses are SUCH a pain.  They should have made them similar to the harness that they use for the car seats that accompany this stroller.4)  If you don't remove the front tray EVERY time before folding down the stroller, it gets scratched up easily.5)  As our children got older, the stroller became harder to maneuver.  One of the reasons I wanted this stroller was that I was told how easy it was to turn with one hand.  However, my children are only 18 & 21 lbs., and it's already difficult to turn the stroller.6)  The weight.  It is definitely one of the heavier strollers.  However, I've gotten used to that.7)  Only two seat adjustments on the back seat.  All the way reclined, or all the way up.So, all in all, this was a good 'first' stroller for twins...but not something that we can use for much longer.  It did maneuver well at first, but no longer.
