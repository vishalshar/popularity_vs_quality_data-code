This is my first review - I had done what I thought was a good amount of research looking at diff brands, 5 pt harness, latch/no - latch, cup holder, height/wt requirements, and so on, but I did not see what anything alarming when it came to this seat, and then I got it in!I can not get the latches out to actually latch it to the seats (an extra 20 dollars for that feature), the piece in the middle that keeps the child's seat belt near their waste so they do slide down keeps turning the wrong way (you have to take the seat out of the car to get it turned the right way and in a small car its not the most fun to take in and out), the cup holders are REALLY hard to pull out (at first I thought it was a good thing bc then they wont slide in easily knocking over the drink, but it almost hurts my fingers trying to pull it out).I had the Britax Marathon before this so its not my first Britax purchase and i would give that 5 stars!!Britax is a great product I am just not satisfied with this one. I felt I could have spent 60 vs the 120 I spent and gotten the same results.Nice pattern and fabric though
