Good Points: Easily adjustable straps make it easy to fit to baby's size as he grows; Padding and padded straps are very comfortable; easy to get in and out of car; handle adjusts down to balance seat when out of base; handle not ergonomic. Negative Points: Mfg should stress that seat only fits infants up to 26 inches!!; baby sweats in seat no matter what we do (lighter close, blanket underneath him, etc.); does not snap on to shopping carts. I wrote to mfg and they claim that it will snap on to SOME shopping carts. I have not been able to do this.
