I bought this product based on the reviews but what I realized upon receiving them is that the towels are very thin... thinner than I expected.I gave 3 stars because there are advantages to the thinness.First they dry quickly.  They are also easy to use to get into creases etc. as they are not bulky.The water from a wet baby does seep right through them so not good for wrapping a wet baby to keep her warm.For a hooded towel to wrap baby up and keep him warm and dry I would choose something thicker like the Spasilk 100% Cotton Hooded Terry Bath Towel with 4 Washcloths, Yellow.I would use these luvable friends towels for the actual drying... cloth diapers(unfolded) also do a great job!
