While this is a unique idea for babies born into these families - the cost is outrageous, plus you have to buy a separate package to make it work. I bought the extra package for 2 moms. Anyway, the box was bent when it arrived, the binder was bent so I pretty much scrapped it and went to Wal-Mart and bought a nice photo-album in the clearance section with a photo window on the front then put the guts of the album inside. I feel like it was a rip off and unfortunately, if it was the brain-child of a LGBT person, the idea lacks sensitivity financially. I had several people at work go in it together to afford it, and I was a little embarrassed that they had to fork over the amount they did. I took creative license and had to spruce it up to make the whole thing presentable. I'd say, work on the outside binder by improving the quality while lowering the cost to make it more competitive with other baby books out there. For this price, it should have been wrapped in swaddling clothes and lace and arrived in a sturdy box worth presenting.
