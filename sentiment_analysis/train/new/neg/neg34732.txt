The net has holes in the handle tubing so water can enter and it is hard to drain out - possibly causing mold.  The little fish are a great size for kid hands and my son likes to chew on them but I have noticed the paint has come off of the items. Once I noticed it, I rubbed a fish with my thumb and realized it comes off fairly easy.  I wouldn't recommend.
