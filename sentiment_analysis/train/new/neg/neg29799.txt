We bought this stroller 8 month ago when our son was 3 month old. We loved it. All the good things said about this stroller in other reviews are true.Problems started when our son turned 11 months. He became big enough to reach the bumper bar with his mouth, even when he was buckled up properly in the seat. So he started chewing the bar and it crumbled. He got lots of tiny black crumbles in his mouth and on his face!Of course, we contacted Phil&Teds customer service, but they basically said to blame the baby. They offered us to buy a new bumper bar, but did not guarantee that it would not crumble again.This bar is covered with some kind of black foam. Beside the fact that the foam crumbles, it also difficult to keep clean - you cannot wipe it and be sure that all the dirt and germs are gone...So now we cannot use the bumper bar at all. Disappointing for a $600 stroller.
