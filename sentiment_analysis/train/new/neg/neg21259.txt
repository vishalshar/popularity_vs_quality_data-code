This baby monitor kit might seem like a good deal, but once you start using it you can see that it's actually pretty crappy. The problems are various:-You can't use the receivers with the included AC adapters without them catching a lot of static and making weird noises.-They drain batteries in two days, and i'm using eneloop rechargeables that usually last much longer than regular batteries whenever I use them other electronics (I did not even dare put regular batteries on these, so as not to waste more money)-From time to time they'll just lose sound, that's to say I know it's receiving it, because the light indicators respond to noises I from the monitored room, but it stops outputting through the speakers, specially if a loud sound comes over, it kind of shocks it into silence. This will last usually a few minutes and I have to turn it off for a little while and on again, which is very annoying. I have checked that it is not the channel, the volume or the transmitter, as I have two receivers, and the other might be working fine while one is in this mute mode.-The transmitter design is a bit awkward, I have mine up on a wall, and I had to string a bit of wire through two little hoops it has to attach it to a hook in the wall, but the positioning of the light button is not the best idea, as when I had it on a flat surface, it was hard to turn ON and OFF, the light is very weak, and you can see objects in the interior which makes it unappealing.That being said, they're not all bad. When they work, the sound is not bad, it's actually pretty good, in a quiet night I can hear my son breathe through these with no discernible noise, on batteries of course. You can find a better deal on other brands or other models on this brand. I do not recommend this product.
