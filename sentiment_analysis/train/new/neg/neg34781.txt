I've tried several different brands of washable nursing pads including:  TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, NUK Reuseable Nursing Pads, Philips Avent Washable Nursing Pads, and Bamboobies Washable Nursing Pads.  The Bamboobies are my favorites by far and are well worth the extra money.  The TL Care pads are just okay-they are nice and soft but small and not very absorbent.Absorbency:-The bamboobies are the most absorbent followed by Philips, then TL Care, then NUK.Feel:The NUK pads are really scratchy and uncomfortable.  The Philips pads are soft and comfortable although not quite as soft as the TL Care pads.  The Bamboobies are really nice and soft.  The Philips and TL Care pads are smooth cotton while the Bamboobies have a velvet feel to them.Leak Proof:The Bamboobies do the best job at preventing leaks-they absorb more than the other pads and also have a backing that keeps the milk from going all the way through the pad.  The rest of the pads are okay for small leaks but larger leaks will go right through the pads and start soaking your shirt.Quality:The TL Care pads arrived with several loose threads and lots of other threads have come loose over time in the wash.  The pads still work fine but it's annoying.  The other pads have held up well.Other:The TL Care pads tend to bunch up when I'm wearing them and don't stay in place very well.  The NUK pads also bunch up a lot and don't stay in place.  The Philips pads have a lace backing which helps keep them in place.  The Bamboobies don't bunch up and stay in place pretty well.
