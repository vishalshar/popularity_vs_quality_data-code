I bought these spoons because of the good reviews, but wasn't impressed.  The holes weren't a problem, but didn't seem to be a benefit either.  The handles are just too short.  Not only did they usually end up down in the bowl, but they weren't easy for my kids to hold.  We much prefered the Nuby spoon & fork set, which we got at Walmart under their store label.  They worked great from when the kids first started feeding themselves, and my 4 year old still prefers it over a metal spoon.
