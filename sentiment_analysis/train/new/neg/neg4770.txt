I was excited to get a shape sorter that was not a circle or a square and to top it off the elephant also had some cool tricks. We opened it and played with it as soon as it came in the mail. It is super cute and my daughter likes to spin the middle but some of the shapes are hard to get in if they are not placed directly in the hole. That makes this toy very frustrating for my 18 month old who is still perfecting her fine motor skills. I actually first noticed the issue myself. I was also disappointed by the trunk which lowers to let the shapes out when the ears are pressed. The trunk lets the shapes escape regardless of the ears being pressed, so you can never truly put the toy away and the shapes go everywhere while carrying it. This means my daughter will pick up the toy and take it across the room to play with it but when she gets there all the shapes are gone. Even with the "bad" I would still recommend it because it really is the most unique shape sorter out there and the features are fun and different for the little ones.
