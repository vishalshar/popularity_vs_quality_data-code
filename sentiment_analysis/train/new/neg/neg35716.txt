Hardly holds enough milk to be worth it! what this product is are two pieces one silicon that straps over a hard plastic piece and you have to hold up next to your breasts. there's a little opening that goes over your nipple. but there is no suction to keep it in place and it does not stay very well. the opening is so large that if you have normal sized nipples they don't fit snuggly so milk runs on your skin and out of the cup defeating the entire purpose. the nipple shield is really nothing more than a plastic cup. I totally regret purchasing this item. also the little cup barely holds more than a tablespoon of milk so if you are leaking a lot like I am there's no point in using them. good in theory but not developed well.
