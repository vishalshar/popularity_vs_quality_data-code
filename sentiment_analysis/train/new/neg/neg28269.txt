Like some others have said, the item you get is NOT what is pictured.  I was VERY disappointed.  I got this design because not only is my daughter obsessed with Dora, but with Butterflies as well.  She still likes it, but I'm not happy because it should have been what I actually ordered.  Not worth the hassle of returning since it does have Dora on it.  But it is not the same pattern and not even the same color as the one pictured.
