This works fine, but I prefer the Zo-Li On-the-Go Travel formula and snack dispenser. You can only pour formula using the spout from the top container (obviously), but switching the order of the containers is not easy to do for two reasons 1) each container has a separate lid piece and 2) the bottom compartment must remain on the bottom. On the Zo-Li dispenser each compartment has a threaded top and bottom so that any compartment can be attached to any other in any order. This is a huge improvement and means that once you've used the top compartment, you just screw it off, move it to the bottom, and put the lid back on top. Also the Zo-Li is large enough to hold my Playtex nurser nipples.
