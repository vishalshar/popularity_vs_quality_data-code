I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could. I like the stroller overall -- it's well-made (mostly), easy to fold and stow away, and is easy to push over a variety of surfaces. We've been on trails, the beach, roads, etc., in addition to longer runs, and like the maneuverability. My main complaint is about the front wheel mechanism: it's terribly rattly, or chatters, over anything but the absolute smoothest surface. It's something related to the suspension components as far as I can tell...when you hit even the smallest bumps something in the front wheel clacks together. Over and over and over again. It's hard to believe that such a well-designed stroller would have this issue. Baby Jogger was nice about swapping out front wheels for me but nothing changed (actually, the replacement wheel was worse). I'm glad I picked this up when the price was more reasonable...it rattles like something much cheaper.
