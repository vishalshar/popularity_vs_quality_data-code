After spending hours, upon hours searching online and in the store for the perfect stroller, I unwisely decided to get this beautiful stroller. I am so disappointed to realize it is not a practical or functional stroller.Pros:1. Out of the box, I loved it because it looks beautiful with vibrant colors and nice thick fabric and was supper easy to set up an assemble.2. It has a spacious reversible seat and a nice handle bar (included) which is padded with a zippered washable cover made of the same fabric as the canopy and shoulder straps.3. It has a nice 180 degree flat recline without the V shape scoop in the middle (contrary to Uppababy for example) which makes it perfect for changing the baby on the go and avoiding use of filthy bathroom changing stations.4. Easy fold mechanism and compact fold with or without the seat on. also relatively light weight especially with the seat off.Cons:1. when the seat is reclined, it can be raised without pushing the recline button so if you bump the stroller or your 5 year old decides to push on the back rest, it will go from 180 degree recline to 90 degree recline in a second. this makes it both unsafe (incase baby is not strapped in) and inconvenient (when the baby is sleeping).2. The Right front wheel (one of the larger ones) started to wobble and shake after a few uses. I was afraid it was going to come off. I have read other complaints about the wheels. I called Mamas and Papas customer service and talked to a very nice sounding british guy who was polite and eloquent but unhelpful. He did not know what the problem was and did not offer a replacement wheel since I had to wait after 30 days of purchase before the manufacturer warranty becomes effective. So I decided to return it to Amazon since I did not want to risk losing my return window and given the unhelpful customer service, and all the flaws mentioned above, I parted with this beautiful but impractical strollerI ended up purchasing the Uppababy Cruz instead.
