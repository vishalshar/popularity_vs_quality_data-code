The sheets are not very soft, at least in my opinion. I washed them once on a gentle cycle and they came out rather stiff. I was looking for a satin-like crib sheet, to help with my daughter's hair (it's very curly). I'm still on the hunt for silk-like sheets. These will have to work in the mean time.My daughter isn't old enough yet to use a pillow, but when she is I plan on getting a silk pillow case.
