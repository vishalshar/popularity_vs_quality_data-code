There is absolutely no reason to spend a ridiculous amount of money on this product. I got one for my daughter because I thought there would be something special about it, or that it was safer. There was not really any difference between it and the one my sister got for her daughter for $60.00. My husband gave me grief for getting a yuppie bed, and I have to side with him on this one now. It is completely a yuppie bed. There's no other reason to buy it than as a status symbol that our kid isn't gonna remember or even care about. Therefore we sent the yupster bed back to Yupsterland and just got the $60.00 one. We used the extra money to get our daughter a zoo pass and membership at the bounce house which she loves more than a bed.For functionality I would give it a 4... because... well it's a bed and kids can sleep on itFor value I give it a 1... because... well it's a bed that doesn't do anything that a $60.00 bed can't and it costs 10 times more.
