I really wanted to like this carrier. I have the ergo sport which is the most comfortable carrier in the world. It's not bulky at all and is so light weight and easy to adjust. But it has one major problem, no head support. The Lillebaby has it all. There are many positions you can do that you can't with the ergo, the head support is great, there is a pocket for your phone, and there is lumbar support. It's essentially perfect in the description. But one major problem- it is so freaking uncomfortable. It's bulky and heavy and even though the baby's weight is on my hips, it still feels much heavier than the sport. Also because of the bulkiness of this carrier, it is extremely uncomfortable to sit with this. I sometimes have to wear my baby in restaurants even though I take her in a stroller, I have to breastfeed her and eat at the same time and sitting with this carrier for an hour is so uncomfortable. On the plus side I can be completely hand free, the head support is so good and adjustable. With the ergo I had to use one hand to support her head while I ate. Another problem with this carrier is the straps. They are so hard to adjust by yourself. I don't know if it's because it's new or what. My ergo is secondhand and the straps are so easy to adjust I could do it with one hand. Regardless of the extreme discomfort wearing the Lillebaby gives me and the annoying straps, I am still considering buying another one just because of the head support and outward facing position. I think some discomfort is worth letting my baby be able to see and enjoy views in a couple of months. And the head support helps when I'm doing housework. So overall, this is a decent carrier just beware of the uncomfortableness. Sorry if I'm being repetitive, these are just my opinions of the product.
