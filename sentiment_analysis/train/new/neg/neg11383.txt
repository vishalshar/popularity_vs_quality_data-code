I like the designs of the bibs and the size of them.  My only complaint is the velcro isnt as strong as I would have hoped.  My daughter can easily pull the bibs off.  If your looking for something to keep your baby clean they are great.  If you are looking for something to keep them clean and not be easily pulled off...you might want to try another bib.
