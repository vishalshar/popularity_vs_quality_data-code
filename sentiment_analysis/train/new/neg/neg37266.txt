I liked it because it's way lighter than the car seat and you can carry the baby in it in the house. It's a little on the cheaper side but thats ok for what I wanted it for.  I wish the strap would adjust a little bigger cause it just about fits around the baby's belly.  It's nice to feed the baby in and just move him from room to room when you are doing things and can't always carry him.
