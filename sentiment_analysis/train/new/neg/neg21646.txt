I can't say whether this product has helped my son or not. He does seem to be less crabby most of the time while wearing it. I haven't had any issues with safety and I leave it on him 24/7. My son is 8 months old and he's been wearing this since he was about 4/5 months. It doesn't seem to have any quality issues and is holding up well.
