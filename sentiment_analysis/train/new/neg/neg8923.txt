I think the design is probably fine for its purpose, but I wasn't able to use it. As photos show (but I needed to try it) it requires holding it with bent  fingers, then pushing down on the button. It is more painful for me to do that than to just grit my teeth and push on the button--and I don't have to keep looking for the device in the backseat.This would probably be useful for those who don't have extreme problems, but the finger placement is something to be aware of if your fingers already hurt. .
