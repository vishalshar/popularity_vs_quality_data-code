I was very excited about getting this toy in the mail for my daughter. When I recieved the box I thought it felt a little light. When I opened it I couldn't believe how small the toy was! For a pull toy I was expecting something about the size of a large Kleenex box. This toy is just about twice the size of a little Matchbox car. The beads it is made out of are small and that makes me too nervous to let my daughter play with it without me because she still puts everything in her mouth. It's very cute but it has become more of an ornament than anything at this point. However, she does enjoy playing with it when we do take it down to play with. It hobbles along quite nicely. I wouldn't send it back but I certainly wouldn't buy it again.
