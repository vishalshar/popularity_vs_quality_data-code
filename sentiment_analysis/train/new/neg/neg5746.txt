This is a very good stroller for the value, however, we've constantly had trouble with the front wheel falling off.  It is fine when you are moving, but if you have to pick the back up to go up a curb, the front wheel falls right off.  Otherwise, we love the adjustable handles, and my daughter fits very nicely in it.
