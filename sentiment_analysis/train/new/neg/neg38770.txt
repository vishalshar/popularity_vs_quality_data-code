The pacifiers that my baby likes don't have loops, so I would have to loop this on the hole of the pacifier itself, which doesn't work because the loop on this thing is pretty big. I really wanted to like this because my baby has a habit of sucking on the ribbons of her other clips, so they end up soaked in saliva. Gross!  I wish the loop on this was smaller.  I use it to hold on to her teethers and clip them to her car seat. She also lives to play with it
