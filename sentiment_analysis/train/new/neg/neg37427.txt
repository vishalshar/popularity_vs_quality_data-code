So, I purchased this for my little one...appx 5 mo old at the time, he's 9 mo and still using it.  There are, however, some drawbacks.  The music is wayyy too loud and there's no volume control or switch to just turn it off, so basically we removed the batteries after about 5 minutes and never turned that function back on.  The wheels are pretty crummy - even on smooth floors like our wood ones. Imagine an old grocery cart you struggle to push through the store...half the times the rear wheels arent even on the ground all the way due to his changing position inside the cart.  We never used the rocker function because...well, it's kind of boring to sit stationary in a toy you know moves around the floor (just as my kiddo).  I do like the 2 height adjustments, although there appears to be some joint fatigue now around the axis where the cross-bars are. The plastic is turning white so I probably wont be able to use it much longer.  I did like that I found a walker, they certainly are not easy to find...of course, just days after ordering this Target rolled out a whole bunch of em, so I wish I would have waited before spending twice as much money.  I can say this, it's sturdy - it works - it does seem to lower to an acceptable height for the younger kids that are ready for a walker...beyond that....wouldnt necessarily pick this up in a store.
