from reading the other reviews i was a little concerned about what my product would look like when i received it. I received it today..it took 2-3 hours to put together..very time consuming (but what isn't nowadays) it was not hard at all to put together, it specifically states what goes where you just have to pay attention...and partially use common sense which not everyone has..so for some maybe it was difficult. Whenever my son is done using it as a changing table, i think it would work perfect for a regular dresser to put knick knacks on in his room..it looks how i expected it to and it is perfect for his nursery. If we move somewhere where he has a bigger room, i will just add more furniture..something like this piece you have to know how to dress it up..Overall i rate the product on a scale from 1-5 5 being the best a 3.5! However it does scratch easily..but that's when common sense comes into play if you know it's flimsy...don't handle it like its sturdy! Hope this helps...Signed, tired mommy from putting together DaVinci Dresser! :)
