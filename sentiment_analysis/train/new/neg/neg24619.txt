I purchased this item as a shower gift.  I was satisfied with the look of the package and quality of the product.  The problem I found was that the "4" pack of blankets I ordered only had "2" blankets when it arrived.  I tried to advise the store of this but ran in to one road block after another and eventually decided it wasn't worth my time to pursue the issue.  Since you've give me an opportunity to review the item I am sending this information with the request that I received the 2 blankets I believe I'm owed or an explanation as to why a 4 pack of blankets would contain only 2 blankets.  I appreciate this opportunity and look forward to your response.  I was pleased with the choices and time in which I received my order. I hope we can get this little glitch straightened out.
