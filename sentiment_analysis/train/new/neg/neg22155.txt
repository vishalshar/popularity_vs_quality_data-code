While I really loved the idea behind this potty chair and it's price. My son on the other had did not find it so exciting or even mildly interesting. Though he seems to be interested in our actual toilet and not any kind of "fake" toilet that I keep telling him is "his" potty. So I'm sure we'll end up with steps and a potty ring for our toilet. Keeping this potty chair in case the next child has more of a leaning towards a potty chair instead of the big potty. As for the performance of the potty. I'll have to try to come back and update after we have our next kid!
