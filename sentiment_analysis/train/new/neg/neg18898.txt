I registered for the Boppy because everyone said it was a "Must Have". I am breastfeeding my baby and I do not think it is a "Must Have" but it is nice to have - just not for breastfeeding.I tried using it for breastfeeding and found that there are other pillows out there that work better. The reasons are:1) It is designed to fit around your waist but it keeps sliping out on my lap.2) The top is curved and the baby can easily roll off the Boppy, especially as he gets bigger.I later purchased a Tresor breastfeeding pillow that was recommended by a lactation consultant and found it much more useful. It comes with a buckle that can be attached around your waist so it stays put on your lap. Also it is much larger and flat accros the top. I do not feel like the baby is going to roll off the pillow, which is nice when you are trying to undo a nursing bra or grab a burp cloth.I do love the Boppy for other reasons. I have used it as a "nest" for my napping baby. He is now 8 weeks old and frequently I put him in the Boppy to curl up while I am doing other things. He seems really comfortable and stays put. I'm sure as he gets older we will use it more for sitting up and tummy time.The fleece cover is nice and seems to stay clean. It has washed well a couple of times. However the extra covers that we purchased came apart in the laundry.I recommend getting the Boppy for other reasons than for breastfeeding.
