I spent like 15 minutes tried to take off red stickers! I wish they came out easier.Thats why I give 3 stars. Over all the product is good. I think when people write a review that the adhesive is weak it's because a different type of tile they have. I have it's for more than a month and a huge amount of toys in it and it's stays on the wall
