Phil and Teds obviously do not care about their customers but just making more money!  You will be buying more every coup,e of months!  I have spent more on tires than I did buying the original stroller!  These tires are so HORRIBLE and everyone says the same thing!  I've had mine for over 5 years and I'm constantly replacing them. I will never recommend this stroller to anyone because the tires are that bad!  I love the stroller but can't and never will recommend it!  I have called them up and complained about it and they blow me off!  I am beyond frustrated at this point!  This is my last child so I'm not about ready to buy a new one but I will be writing bad reviews and letting the world know that this company is HORRIBLE and to never buy from them, all because they won't do a thing about their stupid tires!  Really dumb on their part!  They will loose a lot of sales on this!
