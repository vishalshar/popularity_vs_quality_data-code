The concept is good, but they're too narrow and poo easily ends up off the sides, onto the cloth. Mine pilled after about a month and the Bummi's customer service rep admitted they do have a shelf life. I agree with the "most helpful critical review"er that if you can find a value fleece at the fabric store- like I did for $1.75/yd., then you have control over the width/length and if you don't mind hemming/stitching the edges (really quite simple and worth the effort to make a custom liner), then you can have an adundant supply of fleece liners that cover the entire width and length of the cloth! And to me, that makes the most sense.
