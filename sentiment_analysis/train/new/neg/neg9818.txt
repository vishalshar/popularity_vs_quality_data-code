This item was a complete waste of money.  Stick with a grinder.  I liked the portability of the Wean Machine and the idea of it but it didn't work.  Whatever well cooked (or over cooked) food you put in this item, it does not come out of the grates.  The food just gets stuck in the bottom getting mashed flat below the grates.  I am very sad that I bought this.  I was planning on buying this and then trying it out for my 7 month old before purchasing it for some of my pregnant relatives.  I thought it would work as well as a garlic press, but I didn't even get enough food through the grates to have a spoon full for my child.  Don't waste your time or money on this.  Look for something else.
