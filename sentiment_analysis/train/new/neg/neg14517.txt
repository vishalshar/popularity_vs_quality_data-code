I have tried pretty much every type of washcloth Amazon sells in the baby dept., to try them out as wipes to accompany cloth diapering. If we are using reusable diapers, why not use reusable wipes?? So, we have our little bowl of water next to the change pad, and we dip the wipe in water, and wipe. Most washcloths were just terrible, they simply didn't wick up the water, and it was really hard to get them properly moist. Others, more towel like, felt rough and abrasive when swept across delicate skin. These ones are just perfect!! They soak the water right up, they are very soft, and clean wonderfully well. We adore these, and so we ordered more of these, and just donated all the other ones (hopefully someone can use them). Highly recommended.EDIT ON FEB 2013We had kid #2, and so I bought more of these because #1 is still in diapers. What a bummer!!! They've been through 4 or 5 washes already, and they're just not as absorbant as they used to be :(  They must have changed something. I am no longer impressed, and changed my review from 5 stars to 3 stars. Looking for alternatives now...
