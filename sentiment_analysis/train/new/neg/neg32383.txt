I love all OXO products, as a rule. This one, however, has failed me, not once...but twice! The first time I ordered this, it did its job for a few weeks, but then ripped of the wall...toys inside, and all.I sent it back, and amazon promptly provided me with a replacement. I was extra careful to follow the directions explicitly, but n day two, with NO toys in it, it lost suction and fell, anyway. Thank goodness my son was not hurt in either incident. I'm hoping amazon/oxo remedy this little tragedy in a swift and proper manner. We shall see....
