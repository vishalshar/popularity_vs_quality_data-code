These pacifiers are awesome, but because the 2 packs say so in the name, and show that in the image, I thought this was a 4-pack, especially because they're more expensive than the others on Amazon or in baby stores for the same product.  Don't know why anyone would pay $8.99 for just two of these. After looking more closely, I finally saw that the details said this was a 2-pack, so it's my fault, but figured I'd leave this comment for anyone else who may miss that detail.
