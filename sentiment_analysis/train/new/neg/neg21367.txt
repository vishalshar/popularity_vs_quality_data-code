I was excited about the positive reviews on this item, so despite the cost (which is significantly higher than most other similar products), I went ahead and purchased a pair.My little boy has eczema so he is constantly scratching and what was worst, he would scratch his face and head hard (I keep his nails as short as possible!) as he was trying to settle in to fall asleep.  I purchased these when he was 3 months old - he is average size, at the time of purchase, he fit into 3 month clothes, I purchased the S/M size.Pros:-Stay on for sure, these didn't come off like the cheaper kind-Well-made - fabric is nice and they seem to be of good quality-Very cute fabric choicesCons:-Take forever to dry - I guess it's the fabric and the fact that one of the sides is double layered (like a pocket) but these took forever to dry.  I air dried them to make sure they didn't shrink.-Run a little small as other reviews stated-They are a little bit of a pain to put on and take off and I have to make sure to adjust the velcro exactly (see below!)-The velcro if not secured exactly, sticks out.  This part scratched my little guy's face once when he rubbed himself with it.Overall, I don't think there is a perfect solution if you have a little one that scratches.  These take a little too long to put on and take off and my guy loves chewing on his hands too, so these would just get soaked and then take forever to dry once washed.  I finally gave up and threw them in the dryer.  They did shrink a bit but they still fit.  They are very well made and much better quality than other alternatives.
