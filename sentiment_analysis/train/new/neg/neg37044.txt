Used this pillow when my baby was about 1.5 months and strangely her head for flatter at the back because in the hole where the back of the head lands, it is flat and I think because of the pillow, she could turn her head and could only face upwards, this having the back of her head smacked flat. I read that it could be washed and washed it, but the filling inside shifted around and the pillow became lob-sided. I've stopped using it a since and she's 4 months now and the back of her head is no longer flat. We put her on her sides and changed sides and she does a lot of funny time when she's awake. Perhaps it's not for newborns but I wouldn't recommend this pillow based on my experience.
