Great product quality, but HORRIBLE customer service from My Blankee Company. They failed to respond to customer inquiry emails yet I STILL can't get them to stop spamming my inbox after the 2012 purchase issues (arrived about one month later than expected - they failed to see the issue once we finally communicated by phone).Thanks Olga et. al.for the stellar experience.Classic example of a company making money despite themselves I guess. Hey Karma - hello? Is anyone there? Anyone? Bueller?Getting down off my soapbox now. Carry on.....
