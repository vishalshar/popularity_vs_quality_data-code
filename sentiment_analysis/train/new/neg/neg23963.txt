Oh my goodness! The instructions are incorrect. I was still able to put the crib together about 75% of the way and came up with 4 screws that were too short. Card the company and the lady said , 'oh yeah, the wrong instructions are in with that frog's. Really would've been nice to know beforehand! I have a similar Graco crib and really liked it and I'm sure once I've taken this one apart and reassembled it with the correct instructions it will be fine. I fimd it very irritating that the Graco/La Jobi company didn't seemed at all like it was a big deal that the incorrect instructions were included.
