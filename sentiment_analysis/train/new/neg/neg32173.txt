This looks horrible.  It comes with no instructions.  The company website has nothing but an 877 number which doesn't work.  I tried to install it but it doesn't seem like the velcro lines up.  One of the pieces needs to be turned upside down, maybe? It's far bigger than the sides allow so it's baggy and looks like it's about to fall down.  It only fits with the mattress in the lowest position.  There is nothing to hold it tight so I can promise you he will pull this down the first time he pulls on it.  I'll probably order the super expensive one that matches my crib set and sell this at a yard sale.  Worthless garbage.
