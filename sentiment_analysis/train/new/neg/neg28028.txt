I'm old enough to remember when disposable diapers were just introduced.  As shower gifts I had received cloth diapers from my much older friends who weren't "with the times".  I didn't use the cloth diapers for their intended purpose, but for burp cloths and years later for dust rags.  The old Gerber Birdseye diapers were soft with salvage edges (salvage edges? Never see those anymore!)  Decided it was time to replace my dust rags and ordered these.  Yikes have they changed!  I can't imagine putting these on any tender newborn's bottom!  They're thin, rough and have crude hems.  I kept them as it's too inconvenient to return, but will never order again.  I feel sorry for the younger generations...they will never know just how excellent most products were in the past.  They have to settle for the substandard quality, from China, that has become the norm.
