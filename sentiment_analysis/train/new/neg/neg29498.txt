I know it was a freak accident case but just thought other mommy's and daddy's should know. I bought this bath two for my 2years old and 9 month old. They both loved it . last night my 9 month old stood up in his bath and fell back down (like all kids do in the bath tub). But when he fell he fell directly on this toy. The plastic arms are stronger enough that it punctured a hole on my baby's but and went inside him .we spent 8 hours getting seen by different doctors an sugeons and getting sent to better hospitals. by the grace of God it was centimeters from him having to have serious surgeries and extensive care. He wasn't left alone or not supervised it just happened and I just want all parents that are considering buying this to know that the points on the legs are hard and potentially very dangerous, I am aware this case was a freak accident but if it can happen to me and my baby it could happen to others and if something like this happening would've clear to me I wouldn't have bought it.
