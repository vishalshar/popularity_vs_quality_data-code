Pretty disappointed at the workmanship. Paint has run. Either a terrible sanding job on the side panels or it wasn't pressure washed before paint. A LOT of dings and chips that I cannot blame on the packaging and shipping as it was packaged beautifully. I am really quite disappointed I spent $130 on it. For the same quality or lack there of I could have gotten a crib from a yardsale.
