sorry but I really do not like it! the small one was the first bottle I used for my baby! they leak a lot! there is always a problem with the air flow in it and it makes it so hard for baby to drink milk and suck easily instead will swallow lots of air! which is so bad!  I stopped using avent and started using Dr. Brown! such a great bottle! it saved our lives! since I had this larger avent bottle! I said let me give it another chance and try the larger one to see what will happen now that my baby is a bit grown! omg nope!!! it wont work! he can latch stronger now and I just noticed that the nipple was sunk!!!! inside and it was impossible for baby to latch on it! again it was leaking and the air flow was stopped! I never recommend it and I really do not like AVENT! bottles! a big NO!
