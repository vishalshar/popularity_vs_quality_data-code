This is the first time I've ever given a bad review. My daughter is 5 months and I just gave these to her to play with for the first time. I noticed after a few minutes that she had a shallow cut on the corner of her mouth that curved up her cheek. Apparently, some of these cups have a sharp edge to them (on the inside of the curved part of the cups) that my daughter cut herself on, because she did what most 5 month olds do, she put the cup in her mouth. My daughter had fun playing with these cups and the small cut she got bothered me more than it bothered her, but I can't give them back to her. I do want to note that it's just a couple cups that have a sharp edge so I'm not sure if I just got a faulty product.
