This bed, like everyone has said is hard as a rock and my 4mo old woke up very frequently on it. I found it cheaper at Jet and we kept that one and put a 1" piece of natural latex foam on top. The mattress plus the topper plus sheets adds up to about $330. I would have just splurged on the nook bed.
