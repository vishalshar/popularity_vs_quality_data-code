The delivery was delayed. I was supposed to receive this on Saturday but didn't get it until Monday. On top of that, the cup holder was missing. Hopefully, I can get the cup holder part mailed separately since I don't want to return the booster just to get the missing part (too much work). I do like the designed and the harness at the back that keeps the booster secured. My one star review is based on the delivery and the missing cup holder. It's inconvenience for me to try and get the missing cup holder especially this was supposed to be brand new.
