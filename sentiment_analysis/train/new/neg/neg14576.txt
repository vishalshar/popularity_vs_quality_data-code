I bought this toy for my grandson who is 6 months old.  It had great reviews on several sites, but he is not interested in it at all.  Compared to several of the other toys he got, it is the least interactive and awkward to play with it.  I have put it aside and am hoping to bring it back out in 3-4 months to see if he enjoys it then.  When it arrived, I wasn't pleased that I could hear the music playing before I had even opened the box and it had been opened and unsecured in the packaging.
