I really wanted to like these but I ended up giving up on them. I used them for about 4 months. And yesterday was the final straw with these bottles. The bottom leaked out and into my purse. I was always very careful about drying them and placing the seal on correctly. And for the most part they tended to leak at least a teeny tiny bit. But a few times the whole bottle of 4-8 ounces of milk would leak very quickly. It's just completely unacceptable for a bottle to leak like this; even if it is rare. Playtex needs to stop making these.
