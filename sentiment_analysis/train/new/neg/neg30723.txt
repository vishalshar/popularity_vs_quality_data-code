This splash mat is a very thin piece of plastic, may work with non skid backing on carpet, but I am afraid to put it under the high chair on hard wood floor, I am afraid it would either ball up or just cause a person to slip and fall. When my boys were young back in the 80's I got one from pampers, from pamper points or ups, that was wonderful, very thick plastic, no sliding around or balling up..it was probably almost as thick as the mats you use under office chairs. These day things are made so lousy. If i wanted something a filmsy i could have gotten a tablecloth from the dollar store. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product to any one.
