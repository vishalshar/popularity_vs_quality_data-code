I researched for weeks trying to find a product that would fit my wide, angled and very different shaped stairs.  This product can bind at almost any angle and in any direction.  It is extremely quick and easy to install.  The reason I gave it a bad review is that it is almost impossible to open the gate with one hand. With a baby in hand it makes it hard to use this gate in areas that you will need to access it a lot.
