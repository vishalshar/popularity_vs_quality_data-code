Ok SO i'm in the middle with this product. I love how it looks on the curtain but it's really flimsy and bendable and not really sturdy so you wouldn't want any handsy children playing with it... But i'm pretty sure if I would have looked hard enough I would have found it in a local  dollar store. So yes I like it and know i didn't have any issues with the product BUT I could've spent those 5 dollars on lunch if you know what I mean lol
