The car seat is super comdortable. it's the only one my toddler will go in withoit crying for the entire ride. I used to have a graco my size and my daughter would cry the entire time she was in it. Now she is happy and comfortable.The cover is a bit hard to snap on, especially if rear facing. Straps tend to get stuck and can be difficult to properly thread.Also still haven't figured out how to attach the cup holder. There is no mention of it in the instructions.The safety alert system I don't even use because it's a major hassle. When we first got it, the electronics ribbon attached to the system broke the same day. They replaced the bottom of the seat but my phone can still never find the car seat on the bluetooth. It's a nice feature to add to car seats but it's not properly executed. Needs more work/protection of the system from easily breaking/more instructions.Car seat is the most comfortable thing I've ever seen though. My daughter loves it. Just wish it was a little easier for parents
