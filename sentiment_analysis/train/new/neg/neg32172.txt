I purchased this product for my little sister who had twins. I bought it for her baby shower back in June, but she didn't have the babies until the end of August. We set up the swing to prepare for the boys' homecoming. It was ready to be used until we tried to turn on the swing. When I opened the battery box, it was completely corroded, including the battery spring.I e-mailed the seller requesting a return or exchange. The seller worked with me on returning the product, which I was grateful about. However, he/she wouldn't refund the original shipping, and I had to pay the shipping of the return shipment as well. Although I wasn't too happy about this part of the deal, I accepted.All in all, in order to ensure that you don't waste your money, don't just assume the product should work just because it's new; make sure to test out the product in its entirety when you receive it.
