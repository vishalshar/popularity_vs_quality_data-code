I needed a stroller that I could run with and that would be solid and take the life of a busy active family. I went with the Mountain Buggy as I was familiar with it through friends and clients, though it had a serious competition.Now I really wish I had not bought it though.It has been two years since it arrived bran new to our doorstep. One of the wheels started falling only a year and a half later. Now, I have to replace all three wheels!!! the bearings are shot on all three of them, and the stroller is completely rusted through around the wheels!Utterly unhappy about the quality of this stroller.My friends' strollers were from ten years ago, and I wonder if they lasted because they were manufactured better. I bought mine based on their old image. I wonder if mine was not the same as the image. Their strollers have lasted through several kids, mine lasted only two years of once a week use. My stroller was manufactured by the new owner phil&teds in China, and not in New Zealand by the original design&manufacture Kiwi co.Would be happy if the amazon.com would send me the replacements of all three wheels with bearings and axles for free (will cost $200 to replace it on my own).
