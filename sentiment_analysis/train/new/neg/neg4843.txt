So small it does NOTHING to pump even a small pool ball!  Takes FOREVER.  I am an healthy individual who cycle and swim regularly, yet this takes soooo long, far too many pumps that it hurts my thigh muscle.  Do not buy.  But the better ones that has a larger yellow body.  I did.  Bought one for $2 in Daiso Japan, so much better than this one.  Wasted my time and money, tossing it out.
