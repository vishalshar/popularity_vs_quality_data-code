It has potential but gets cold way too fast, which defeats the purpose! My daughters both.had ear pain on the plane but I resorted.to asking the flight attendant for half a cup of hot water, and that's what actually did a better job as they held their ears against the cup tilting their heads downwards. If it actually had metal inside, perhaps it would stay hotter.
