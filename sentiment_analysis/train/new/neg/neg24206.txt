We have the Prince Lionheart Wipe Warmer and love so I thought getting the travel version would be useful. It's heavy and bulky and holds less wipes than a normal wipe case. I ended up taking it to my mother's house so she could at least have a wipe warmer but we found it to be useless there too due to the fact that it only holds about 10 wipes.
