this fabric is wonderfully soft and cuddly. I love the Aden + Anais muslin receiving blankets so I just had to try this sheet. It is adorable and I would love to order more of them ... unfortunately, I have found a problem with the sheets and oddly enough, it's the fabric. The fabric snags. After only a single wash and dry I noticed that there were several snags on the fabric. I was so disappointed and did not expect that to happen as it never happened with any of the receiving blankets that we have. I honestly can't justify spending $20-30 on more of these sheets because they snag so easily. After 2 washes I can easily count at least 6 snags in the sheet. Keep in mind, we have a year old, high-end front-loading washer/dryer set that has never caused even minimal damage to any of our linens or clothing ... so it is definitely not our washer or dryer.So sad about this because they are comfy and the prints are so cute.
