At first we loved this very much.The picture is fine for the needs, and audio too. Don't expect HD performance and I don't think anyone will.The problems start after 6 months -1. the battery lasts for 10-30 min max2. bought a new battery (not original, couldn't find one), but it doesn't last more than 10 minutes, so it must be plugged in constantly.3. frequent disconnections between base and camera, we didn't have this problem in the first 6 months.This is the type of product that has an expiration date, like many products these days, it sucks.
