This cup worked fine for a few weeks. The problem is that Nuk uses extremely soft silicone in the spout. Year-old babies have teeth and will quickly chew up the nipple in a matter of weeks. When that happens, the cup still works but is no longer spill-resistant since it opens up a 1/4" hole in the spout. You also have to be concerned about what happens to the rice-sized bits of silicone which get chewed off. Do they get swallowed, or spit out? Our other cups and bottles with silicone spouts do not have this problem - only the Nuk spouts are damaged severely by our baby's chewing.So this bottle does work, but you can't expect it to last long.
