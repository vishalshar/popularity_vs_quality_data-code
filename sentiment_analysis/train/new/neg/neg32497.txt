This changing pad cover was very soft but I noticed that a lot of the fabric was being pulled out because of my rings.  I have washed it quite frequently since we received it and the ends have not frayed like many others have said, the only complaint I have is that a lot of the thread has been pulled but I think with a snip of the scissor it should be fine.  It fits the contoured changing pad quite well.
