First and foremost, full disclosure, we will be returning this product. Our first impression was a great one. Our kid immediately took to it after some struggles with finding a bottle that he would take post baby bottle. We were ecstatic! But when our mini cooler started stinking, our tables started getting milk marks on them, and our pants and everything else you put this on got soaked...we were not so ecstatic. This is not a defective one off, we bought a second shortly after and it also has this problem. So in essence, this product leaks which to state the obvious is a problem. Bottles are errrr...supposed to keep what's in them in them. I would spend a bit more and get something of better quality. Don't waste your time here.
