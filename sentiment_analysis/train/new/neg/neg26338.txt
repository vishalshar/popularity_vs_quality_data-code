The snaps would close after just one time in the dryer, the first time I washed it.  Packaging is long gone, so I dont know if it said no dryer, but I don't think it did.  I  should have returned it but I had just had a baby and didn't 2ant to deal with a mail back.  The material is decent and the legs are good.  The design is better than the alva covers I have which leave marks on baby's legs.  Now that dd is 9 mos I have tried it again, since it is stuck on the biggest size, but she is getting too big for velcro.  The velcro is not the worst, but it can come undone by an active baby just moving around as usual.  The velcro is way better than alva velcro.  If it wernt for the snaps this coukd have been useful.  It was a learning experience for me, j try hard to only dry anything with snaps for 15 minutes at a time now.
