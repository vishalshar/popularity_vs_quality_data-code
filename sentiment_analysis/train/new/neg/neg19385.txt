I searched for a long time before deciding on this bedding set. Very nice soft quality material,soft and gender neutral tones makes it great for both girls and boys. It looks great in our baby girls room. We bought everything in this theme including the diaper stacker and window valance for her room.My only complaint is that the set I  recieved is very poorly stitched. Some places on the quilt they have miss stitched completely and the stripes on the diaper stacker doesn't match up the way they should(it actually looks skew as a result. The same with the dust ruffle. The stitching is not straight, and looks like it was a 5 year old that did it. A lot of money for a poorly made set.I do still like the design, and still think its a lot better quality material used than a lot of other Winnie the pooh crib sets out there. Perhaps I just got a badly made set.
