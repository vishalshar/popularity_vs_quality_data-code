I gave it 3 stars because what I feel is wrong with it, is just my personal preference.  It didn't break, it's comfy, and it's easy to set up.  I bought this item based on price, having compared other small and inexpensive gyms with it.  I saw that the info said that the hanging toys are attached by velcro, and it didn't occur to me that meant I couldn't add toys to it without some fanagling (making my own loops to add).  I'm disappointed with the tiger--he looks really cute, but he's very hard plastic, and it wasn't easy for my son to get the music to play for the first 2 months of use (at 3 mo.+). The only way to get the music to play, is if the ball it's holding gets "rolled" between its paws.  This is the only noise-making item on the gym, except for the roller ball at the foot pad.  Now that he can consistently make the tiger play music (5 mo.), he's really getting too big for the whole gym.  I also wish that I would have chosen one that has travel closures, but I knew ahead of time that this one did not.  So my opinion of flaws are: no loops to attach your own toys, not enough/easy enough interactive items, and no travel closures.  One thing that I added to make it more fun is the Infantino chime animals:  Infantino Tag Along Chimes, Frog and Duck  The loop on those fit perfectly around the bar.
