I love the Medela Symphony breast pump, so I thought I would get compatible bottles and nipples. You can hook up the bottles right to the pump, which is nice. The bottles are easy to clean and my baby has no problems eating from them. However. the nipples and collars that come with this set ARE NOT the "wide base" nipples that you can buy as replacements. The nipples that come with this set have a narrower base, and the collars only fit the narrower base. The collars that come in the set DO NOT fit the wide base replacement nipples. Annoying!! Also when I warm up the bottle, I have to fiddle with tightening/loosening the collar or they leak. And when the bottle cools off back to room temp, it leaks even more and more adjusting is required.
