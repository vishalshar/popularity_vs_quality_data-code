I ordered a Moby Wrap to try with my twin babies. My impression was that it is simply too complicated and a hassle to use, it is just a lot of material to wrap around yourself, it falls to the floor when wrapping it by myself, I never fell it is tight enough, if I need to use the restroom I have to take it off and re-do the whole thing because it simply loosens up too much, etc. The first times I used it my babies enjoyed being in it so I ordered a second one, which I never used because they were uncomfortable so in it and so was I. I thought of going to the grocery store or any other public place and having to bring out this looong piece of material and wrapping it around myself. I ended up returning the unopened wrap and purchasing a Beco carrier instead...much easier to use and I feel my babies are safer and more comfortable in them. I do think that the wrap is great for the first few weeks of a newborns life as it soft and helps them feel secure and close to mom or whoever is carrying them, but in my case once my newborns were over 10lbs, they pretty much hated this wrap. It is a good product and I received my order in great condition, it is just not "the one" for us.
