This would have been a great chart, but it arrived folded (not an amazon thing, just the way it was made) and as such, it is very cheap looking.  We tried a number of things to get the folds out prior to hanging it, but it nothing has worked.  If it had been rolled for shipping it would have been great.  Wife and I are likely just going to chuck it - not worth the hassle to return for the few bucks it cost.  You get what you pay for.
