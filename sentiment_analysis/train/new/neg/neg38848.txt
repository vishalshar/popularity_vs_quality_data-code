Like many aden and anais products there are two different quality levels. It's pretty easy to figure out with the swaddle blankets, the higher quality are 47x47" and the lower quality are 44x44". It's not as easy to figure out with the bibs. I thought they were all the same and assumed these being sold for $10 each while others sell for $22 per two pack was attributable to amazon price fluctuations. I was wrong, these bibs, while functional, are somewhat smaller and much thinner than the higher quality ones. I'm not sure if they are fewer layers or made of a thinner muslin but they're not nearly as absorbent as the higher quality version. The size difference is noticeable but not really a big deal, they're still plenty large enough to function as the nicer ones do. I really wish amazon described the product in a way that made the differences clear before purchase.
