My two children have large piggy banks and I wanted one about the same size for my new baby. When I saw the dimensions on this pig, I thought it was perfect. However, when it arrived, it was significantly smaller in every direction than was advertised (at least an inch on every side, and in length, almost 2 inches smaller). It was a beautiful bank-- bright green and glossy. So I was so disappointed that it was so small. I returned it because it wasn't as advertised.
