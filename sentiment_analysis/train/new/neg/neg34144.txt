My major complaints are that 1) while it will hold a standard plastic water bottle, it's too small to hold most of my slightly larger reusable water bottles or a larger (but not uncommonly sized) beverage, 2) because it has so many large holes, you can't use it to reliably hold items, like your car keys or the like, and 3) I really don't like the way it attaches to the stroller. Even though I push it down all the way till I hear the little click, it has been knocked off a few times when I've accidentally grazed something. It's just in the way with the way it sticks out. I'd much prefer a cup holder that is in the middle or off to the side of the handle, facing you. It just looks awkward.
