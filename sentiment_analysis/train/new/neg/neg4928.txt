Product is hard to install. I have a lot of experience installing and uninstalling car seats of all models and this model is frustrating. The mechanism that allows you to loosen the straps jams frequently and we have almost had to cut the car seat out of the car. For now we are not moving it but I would not recommend it. The material is also tough to clean. Stains do not come out.
