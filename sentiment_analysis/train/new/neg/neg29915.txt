I went with this bag because it had some good reviews and I figured it was something that both my husband and I could carry around.  I wish now that I had just gone with my initial instinct and stuck to a regular backpack/messenger bag (which is what we're using now).  This bag doesn't have as much space as it seems at first- once you pack the inside pockets with diapers, wipes, and a burp cloth, there's not much room for anything else (at least not in any organized capacity).  Like some other reviewers noted, the outside zippers for cell phones/wallets/keys/whatever else mom or dad need to carry with them get stuck very easily and so those front pockets are essentially lost.  We wound up donating this bag (hopefully it'll make someone else happier than it made me!) and went with an Osprey messenger bag instead.  All in all- this bag isn't worth the money.
