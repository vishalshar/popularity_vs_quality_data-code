I very rarely give poor reviews, but I have to be honest with this one. I wasn't pleased with this product at all. In fact, I sent it back. It just felt very cheaply made, and the velcro wouldn't even stick on the pieces that had velcro. It's just a bunch of little stuffed food items. Don't expect them to actually open and close / velcro and unvelcro or anything. The one positive is that it was easy to return and get my money back, so I appreciate that.
