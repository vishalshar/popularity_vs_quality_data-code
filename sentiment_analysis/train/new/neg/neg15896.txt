I'm really annoyed. I bought these same chocolate brown corner guards from Amazon half a year ago and then again this time. It's listed in the same color and brand but the quality and color is no where near the same. The first shipment had contoured edges, this corner guard looks like someone just cut brown tubing and glued them together.
