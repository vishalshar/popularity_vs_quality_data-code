I still think there is a lot of work to be done with this technology, especially at this price point. I have seen ear thermometers "work" and be accurate but this one is NOT. The ear and the forehead measurements, BOTH, are incorrect... and when I say incorrect I mean not even close. I have 2 oral thermometers at home that I used to compare/calibrate this device. I took several measurements throughout the day from this device and the other 2. In every case, the ear thermometer was off by 3 degrees or more, and the forehead by 2 degrees or more. During my testing I took 2 measurements within 30 seconds from this device, both from the ear, then both from the forehead. Disturbingly, each of the 2 comparisons, taken almost one after the other, varied by close to a degree. So even the device is all over to place intra-measurement not to mention accuracy versus oral. I just don't see the practical use if it doesn't in fact provide an accurate temperature (which is what it was designed to do). There should NOT be add +2 to ear or add +2.7 to forehead to get a comparable, accurate value. That's not acceptable in my opinion.
