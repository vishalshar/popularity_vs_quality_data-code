We have purchased several of these (about one a year or so for the past 6 years) and with each one the quality decreases. The most recent one doesn't like to be turned on and left on the charger without reverting itself back to the times shut off (as opposed to staying on). also if you attempt to choose a color (instead of the color changing every few seconds) it will stay that color unless you place it back on the charger then it reverts to changing the colors. I have determined the connection between the moon and the charger is not quite right but I'm not an engineer so I don't know a safe way to fix it. So, I just have to frustratingly mess with the moon and charger until it does what we want it to do. Soon, I'm afraid once this moon quits working/charging all together we probably won't be getting any more.
