I really wanted to like this stroller because the price is great for the features:Pros:*GREAT canopy- entirely covered my little girl when I had this set up more like a bassinet*nice storage underneith the seat*Seat can face front or backCons:*arrived defective with a loose latch on the front wheel that caused the wheel to keep locking- I had to use duct tape to hold the latch up and I returned the stroller because of that.*The textiles are sort of cheap feeling- but that's after I played with my sister-in-law's Stokke- so my standards are high*It was flimsy feeling- the frame didn't feel really solid*Folding it might be complicated for some care-givers- there are many stepsI would have kept this stroller if it wasn't for the duct tape issue- but after doing more research and visiting some stores to play with more strollers I have a Britax B-Scene coming- quality and features seem more what I'm looking for but it cost 100.00 more.
