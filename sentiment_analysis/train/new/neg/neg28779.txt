I was disappointed with this item. The craftsmanship of the engraving is excellent, but the piece of board selected was awful. It has very large knots, some of which go all the way through the board creating large holes along the edges. It is far more rustic looking than in the picture. If a better board had been used this could have been a very beautiful piece and I would keep it. It is way to rustic for my decor and looks cheap. Also, there was a crack in it even though the packaging was not damaged. I am returning it at my own cost.
