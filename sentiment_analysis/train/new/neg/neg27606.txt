This gate has some hazards to it. I found my son chewing on a plastic piece that had come from it. After looking at each gate I noticed that each gate has plastic pieces that fall out of them. It seems that when they punch the holes into the gates they don't take the extra plastic pieces out. There were also plastic pieces that I was able to pull off the gate. It would be a great product if I wasn't worried about plastic pieces coming off and my 9 month old choking on them. Others have mentioned the stickers coming off. I have not noticed them coming off, but they do rip easily, so I could see my son pulling them off later.
