I order this along with a cheaper set of 3 towels. I found the cheap ones were better quality. The wash clothes have a sheep skin type cloth on inside. To me already looking a bit ratty. When you cut away all the little plastic pieces that hold them in the rolled up from they leave small holes in fabric. I wouldn't order again.
