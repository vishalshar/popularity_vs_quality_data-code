I love this carseat but the stroller has one big issue for me. The carseat is super easy to adjust straps while baby is in seat. It also latches into the base easily. I feel like it is extreamly safe for my little one and isn't to heavy to carry. Our daughter outgrew it because of height by the time she was about 18 pounds.I really like the stroller but the major problem is that when it is in the full upright position the shoulder area is very narrow. I would not fit an older child. I little one is petite and she was uncomfortable by about 2. I bought mine through diapers.com and was very happy. If you use the code BAIL2798 I think you get 20% off your whole purchase but I don't know what the cap on discount is. Some amazon offers are pretty good too.
