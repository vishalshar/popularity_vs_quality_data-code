My 8 1/2 mo. granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night.  I've got the correct bumper pads, etc. but babies do move.  She had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset.  I've only had the crib 1 week, she's gotten her leg stuck 2 times.  We caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer.
