I love Pampers wipes and have used them on my first daughter so with baby #2 on the way I decided to try these newer wipes. I like the wipe although they aren't much different from the regular ones. However, after a few days of using my newborn developed a rash. I had to switch to unscented wipes. These wipes have a very strong scent which I liked until I realized they were irritating my baby's skin. She can now use regular wipes but I still have avoided these (why chance it?). We used them for us...in the bathroom, to remove makeup, to clean my older daughter's hands, etc. and they are excellent just be warned that they might irritate newborn skin.
