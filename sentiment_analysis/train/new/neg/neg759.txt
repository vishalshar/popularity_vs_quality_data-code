My son has this toy but I haven't given it to him to play with yet, so I can't comment on how much he likes it, however I am compelled to leave a review because looking at the tag on this toy it clearly states MADE IN CHINA.  Yes Haba is a German company, and yes, some of their toys are manufactured in Germany, but some are also manufactured in China, and this product description is wrong in stating made in Germany.  I have other Haba products that my son loves, and do state manufactured in Germany, but if you are looking for something not made in China, buyer beware!
