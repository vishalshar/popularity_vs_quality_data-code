Quality of the item is great. But we haven't ended up using this much because it's bulky and it's another bag to drag around after you have taken the stroller out to use it. Good for use if you are flying to one location - not good for moving around while on vacation.  However one of our wheels recently got badly bent while flying, and I'd say we'll try to use this more often now. Before spending the money on it, decide if it will be useful for you.
