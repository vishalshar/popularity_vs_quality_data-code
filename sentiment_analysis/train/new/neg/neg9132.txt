I've had this stroller twice. The first time it was a hand me down. The tiny pin came out causing the stoller to collapse. I got this stroller because of the price and the fact that its tall and wide which is great for my tall toddler. Her feet dont reach the floor as they did with the jeep umbrella. CONs the stroller stalls the wheels sometimes get stuck. Rather than just pushing till it breaks I tilt the top wheels up. Another is that u have to put elbow grease into pushing this stroller. My family always wonder how I do it :-)PROs easy to assemble u only have to put the 2front wheels in. Huge for bigger toddlers my daughter was 17m when she got this and she couldnt fit into the smaller models, shes tall. Great price. Fot the price u get a decent size undercarriage and an extended canopy with a big pocket for diapers n wipes and a cup holder.
