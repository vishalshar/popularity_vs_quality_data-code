This is a piece of crap. That is the best I can say. Half the time the monitor didn't work or the video was bad. Our handheld couldn't pick up a clear video when we were standing next to the camera. We got the manufacturer to replace it, which was a ton harder than it needed to be. The new handheld device we received worked okay for a few days but then the channels would no longer change and it started picking up both channels at the same time. DO NOT BUY EVER!!
