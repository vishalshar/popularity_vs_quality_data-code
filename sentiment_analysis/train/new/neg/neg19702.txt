Received items promptly.  Good strong fan for kids.  But one fan did not light.  Instructions on the box says that the fan can operate with OR without the light.  This was not the case with these fans.  Since I had paid for expedited delivery, it was not feasible to return them as they were meant to be gifts.  Also, Seller does not replace, only refund.
