This is my second hold on handle. The first one broke after the first use. Amazon replaced it for me. However, my replacement broke after 3 uses! It's the same piece that keeps breaking. It is a small part that keeps coming out of the clip on handle. Since my return window has lapsed I guess I'm out of luck.This was a great idea. My son liked it, but quality of product is not there.
