We love our Diaper Dekor pails, so much that we have 3 of them.The Dekor refills work great.  There were some reviews of the biodegradable ones being less odor resistant, and I can confirm I've experienced this as well, but it was only slightly worse.  But I still purchased the non-bio ones for a little while.What I've found, as well as others, is that using tall kitchen trash bags is just as easy to use as the refills are.  You have to open up the top of the Dekor to do this, but it's really not that difficult.  It's cheaper, and if you purchase a trash bag with odor protection, then it's quite good at keeping odors at bay.I have mixed emotions here, I love the Dekor and feel a bit sheepish about using trash bags, but on the other hand, it's just like ink jet printer ink - charge me too much and I know you're just raking in the profits, so I go for the workaround that's cheaper for me
