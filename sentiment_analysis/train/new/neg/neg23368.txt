I researched a lot of nursing pillows before settling on this one. It worked ok. Honestly, I think normal pillows were sometimes easier. Anyway, when my baby was a newborn, this was helpful. I often used the two portions separately. It was nice to have the flexibility to use the big bottom one or the little top one or both together as shown in the pictures.
