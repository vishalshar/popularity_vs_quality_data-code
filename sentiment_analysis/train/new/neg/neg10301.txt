This is our third Foogo, first bought the stainless 7oz sippy cup with the handle and softer spout, then bought the 12oz stainless straw bottle. Loved them both so much that I didn't take the time to read the comments on this particular style. Bought this stainless hard spout 10oz sippy cup to graduate from the 7oz sippy cup and just as others commented, it is super hard to get any liquid out. I followed the advice of the commenter who said to cut slits in the silicone of the main spout hole. I cut about 1/8 slit on either side. I also cut one 1/8 slit on the air vent hole as well to prevent the vacuum effect. Now it works great. As someone also noted, there is extra liquid in the spout after a sip (about 1/8 tsp) so after multiple sips, especially if your little one discovers how fun it is to poor this everywhere, can be a bit of a mess. Sip - pour - sip - pour - sip - pour... Otherwise it is a great cup. Would be very cool if Thermos would offer adapted innards to make this cup work so that we don't have to replace the whole thing!
