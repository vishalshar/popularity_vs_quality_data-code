after reading the reviews of this booster chair, i was expecting something solid and worth the cost.  The booster seat is pretty, lightweight, but just a piece of rubber with nothing to recommend it over any other seat.  I should have done as well buying it in Dollar Tree.  IT lacks anything for food or drink placement.. and has nothing to hold it to the chair or whatever it is placed upon.  Don't spend the money on it.
