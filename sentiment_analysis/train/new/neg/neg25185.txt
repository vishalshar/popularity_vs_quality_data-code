I am appalled that babies r us would sell such an inferior product.  I purchased these baskets as a gift and am returning them right away.  I opened the box to put items in the baskets as a cute gift, but just can't be responsibe for putting such a hazardous item into a babies room.  The paint flakes off, the baskets have sharp edges all over them, and pieces of the baskets splinter away.  How are manufactures able to make these items specifically for a babies room?  I would never recommend any baskets like these.  I am not understanding how they are even on the market!?!?  Don't waist your money.  You will just be returning them when you see the poor quality!!!!
