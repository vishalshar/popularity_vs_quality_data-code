I ordered this set based on the reviews, its fantastic price and the cute pics.  I want to have 2 or 3 sets for my sons cot and as I live in the middle east the selection is much more limited than the US or even the UK, I thought this would be great.Everything arrived on time, in a compact clear zip-up bag.  I couldn't believe all 10 pieces were inside, it was so small!  I'm happy to report everything was inside.  All items were as detailed, bright, well stitched, cute design.  There were a lot of loose threads which were easily trimmed off.  I was also disappointed with the quality of the bumper.  It is VERY thin, and I will need to purchase another to place in behind it.These issues are all very acceptable.  I knew I wasn't paying for a plush luxury item, but what I couldn't forgive was the quilt.  It was filthy!!  It had several large yellow glue like stains on it and grubby grey marks.  I don't expect any item to be sold in this state, even at this price.  It really grossed me out!!Its still in the packaging in the nursery, but I will wash it (several times), to try to remove the 'stains' before the delievery of my baby.  I don't think I would but another set from this supplier.  As cute as the detail is, I'm disappointed that they let products leave their factory in this state.
