I bought this bag last year when I was in search for the perfect diaper bag.  Most diaper bags seemed to have bottomless holes for pockets and I was always losing my keys, cell phone, wallet and other personal items in them.  They were also hard to access anything with just one had.  This bag is great in that the compartments and pockets keep everything organized so that you can find things easily.  The changing pad is outstanding, and I would give it 5 starts as a separate item.  However, the bag is very bulky and not very good for everyday use, such as running errands/shopping.  I had a small diaper bag for errands that I would transfer my wallet/cell phone to, but that is getting to be a pain.  The bag is fine for play dates, doctor's visits, restaurants, but it just isn't practical for errands. It's great for travel,and the backpack feature came in very handy when we were flying, however the backpack feature is a bit problematic in that the straps tend to slip and it can take some getting use to.  I'll continue to use it for travel/overnight purposes, however I've ordered a smaller bag that can be used for everyday use, but is large enough to continue to use the baby bjorn changing pad.  If you're looking for an everyday diaper bag, I suggest buying the changing pad only and getting a smaller diaper bag.  If you're looking for a great travel bag, then this bag is for you.
