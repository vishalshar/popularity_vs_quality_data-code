Overall I like the crib and believe it is a good value.  It arrived earlier than predicted and was not too difficult to assemble (assuming you are reasonably handy) and seems to be well constructed.  I also ran into a problem mentioned by several other reviewers - that one of the pieces arrived damaged.  Unlike their experience, I was able to call the manufacturer who agreed to send me a replacement component at no charge.  Here are my warnings about the product:1) Pictures are not accurate and have been altered.  They do not show visible hardware which was something I liked in the product (and why I bought it over a similarly priced crib from another company.)  On the real crib the hardware is visible on the front and sides of the crib which was a disappointment.  I plan to purchase, stain and install cover plugs like another reviewer mentioned, but the clearance holes are not standard sizes and there are two different sizes - the holes on the front are larger than the holes on the side.  My expectations about hidden hardware may not have been reasonable, but I am quite disappointed that the pictures are not accurate.2) The pieces are not interchangeable and are not labeled. You have to deduce which leg is the front/back and left/right by closely inspecting the clearance holes.  It is possible but you have to be careful and patient (and even then I had to reassemble the sides when I realized there was a difference between the left and right side pieces).  Delta could save us a lot of hassle by adding a few labels.3) More of a tip than a complaint - the instructions come in an envelop that is tie wrapped to the mattress support.  Don't be too hasty about cutting the tie wraps.  The envelop does not interfere with the assembly or use of the crib and having it tie wrapped to the crib gives you a handy place to store instructions and spare hardware until it is time to convert it to the toddler bed.Hope this helps!
