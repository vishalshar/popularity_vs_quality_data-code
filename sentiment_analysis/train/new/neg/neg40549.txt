I bought these for Christmas for baby and thought they were very cute.  But for the price I expected them to be made here in the US.  They are supposed to be organic but after reading some articles I was not sure that I want this for my grandchild.Somehow that same little sticker that appears on novelty toys (you know that little round gold sticker that says "Made in China" turned me off and I returned them.  Thank you to Amazon for their excellent return policies
