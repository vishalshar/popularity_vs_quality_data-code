I bought two of these in preparation for my daughter's imminent crawling adventures. The build quality of the product was good, felt very sturdy. However, when I installed them, they were easily pulled off. The locking mechanism is too wide to fit securely behind the knob as shown in the product photo. They were installed properly and as tight as they could go, but to no avail. These won't work on my cabinets. I gave it three stars because it might work for you, and it's well made.  Just be sure you have more than two inches or so between your knobs and cabinet doors or it won't work as intended.
