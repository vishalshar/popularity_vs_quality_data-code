I never write these because as a mother of twins, who has time, but I felt like parents needed to be warned about this unsafe product. It is designed as a teething toy. We have 6 total because my kids loved them so much. This morning, my husband called me in when he found our 8 month old daughter COVERED IN BLACK PAINT FROM THE MOUTH AND EYES OF ELMO! This is a toy designed, allegedly, to be put in their mouths. This should not happen. I am outraged! DO NOT BUY!
