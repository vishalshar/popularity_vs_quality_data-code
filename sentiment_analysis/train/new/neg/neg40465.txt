This was my first furniture order through Amazon. Upon receiving the box, it fell apart because it was so damaged. When my husband opened it and we took all the parts out, there were three major parts damaged that would have needed paint or sanding down. But we gave it a shot and kept going with it. We built the drawer and half way through it, we noticed that we were missing parts that were being called for. After searching on Amazon.com for about 30 minutes, we finally were able to get someone on the phone and they are offering to send us a replacement. I will add another review once that gets here so hopefully it will be a better one.
