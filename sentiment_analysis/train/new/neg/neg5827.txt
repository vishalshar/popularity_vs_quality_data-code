Cute swing that saves on space versus it's bigger versions.  I like how it's low to the ground as well.  Got it for my 2 week old baby.  My only concern with it is that I don't notice much difference between the 5 speeds and feel that it is too fast even on the slowest speed.  This is why I give it 3 stars vs. 4 as I would love for the slowest speed to go much slower and see a bigger difference between the speed levels.  My daughter is not quite 8 pounds yet so maybe it will work better as she grows.
