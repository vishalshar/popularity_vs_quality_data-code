Echoing what so many people have said: this is super low-quality fabric. It's very thin, practically transparent white cotton - definitely NOT a percale weave as advertised - and the designs are screenprinted in a thick, stiff, scratchy paint. The seams are also pretty unsightly and careless (they ruin the direction and repetition of the pattern), and are of poor quality themselves: big, loopy stitches that fray and loosen after the first wash. These (I bought 3 different patterns) also came STINKING of a glue finisher; they smelled like chemicals and vinegar. They're cute, but for $5 extra you can get organic jersey sheets from Burt's Bees or microfiber sheets from Target, and both come in fun patterns and modern colors. I'll keep these to use in our playyard, but I won't be permitting them on her crib for everyday use.
