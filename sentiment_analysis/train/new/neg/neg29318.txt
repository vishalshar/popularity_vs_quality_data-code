Beautiful navy European style stroller. Looks just like the picture shows. Very sturdy and wonderful for outdoor use esp on bumpy surfaces/snowy/wet conditions BUT not practical in tighter indoor areas like at church or other places w narrow aisles bc you have to literally make a U-turn and with limited space it's not always possible. Basically its not easy to make turns with this stroller.
