The car seat is excellent. However, he seat I got was manufactured in Feb. 2014. This makes it 2 yrs old at the time of purchase. This brand of booster expires 6 years from manufactured date so the seat I received was a third into its life. I contacted Amazon about it and they were very prompt in sending me a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement had the same manufactured date. It all goes back.
