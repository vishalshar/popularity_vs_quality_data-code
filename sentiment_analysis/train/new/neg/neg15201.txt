I had a baby jogger sumit which I love so when I had my second baby (my babies are very close in age) I thought this stroller was the way to go. As soon as I got it I realized that it did not have the same maneuverability but that was expected because of the weight of two babies.  So depite the fact that the stroller was quite heavy to push I was happy enought for being able to carry both of my babies at the same time. However, after a year and a half of use the front wheel broke. I was bringing my kids from daycare and saw myself in a very unconfortable situation of having to walk them both home plus push the stroller with a missing a wheel.  This not to mention that my babies could have hurt themselves as the stroller tipped when the wheel broke and it was very difficult to stabilize it to take them out. I basically had to stop a bypasser and ask for help.
