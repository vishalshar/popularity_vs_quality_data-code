I've used a lot of the sleep sacks in the past, and they've been great. I bought the "walker" version for our 19 month old, since she obviously needs foot holes so she can walk. I read other reviews that complained about these being way too big, and wow were they right... I bought the Large (12-18months) because people said they ran big. Here's the rundown on the size-Sleep Sack is 12-18months, supposed to fit 30-35 inches, and 22-28 lbs.Our daughter is 19 MONTHS, 32 inches, and 23 lbs.THIS THING IS HUGE!!! I tried it on her, and the bottom part all the way around just drags all over the floor, a literal pool of material at her feet. She can walk, but eventually trips over all the material. She isn't able to stand up on her own because she steps on all the extra material around her feet, and is basically pinned down by it. So disappointed in the sizing. If the 12-18 month size is way too big for my above average height 19 month old, there's no way it would fit most 12-18 month olds. The large is the smallest size with feet, so this has to be returned. If the sizing was better, I would love this.
