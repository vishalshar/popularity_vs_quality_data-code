We are trying to transition our little one from our pillowtop bed. I purchased this item hoping it would create additional cushion for our crib mattress. My infant did not settle and would not stay asleep in the crib with this pad on.This pad is very thin and provided no cushion.  The pad actually made the mattress feel firmer.  It is no where near as plush as what is pictured.  The picture shown is the pad displayed on a standard mattress. Not sure if the quilted pattern would make a difference (different from what is pictured, checkered vs wave). And it did arrive with a "new product" smell, which I didn't want my little one sleeping on. Probably would go away after laundering. I am returning this product.
