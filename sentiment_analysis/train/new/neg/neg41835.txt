Let me set the leaking record straight here as I found the other reviews confusing.  There are 2 types of Avent bottles, the Classic series and the Natural series (the latter includes the glass bottles).  The Classic bottles come with and require an additional sealing ring.  The newer Natural bottles do not use a ring (nor come with one) because the silicone nipple doubles as the seal.  THESE ADAPTERS DO NOT WORK WITH THE NATURAL BOTTLES OUT OF THE BOX.  They WILL leak and bad (there is literally NO seal whatsoever).  The other reviews basically say "just use the ring, dummy", but this assumes one has the Classic bottles and already have rings.  If you have Natural bottles, then you would have had to have the knowledge and foresight to make an additional order for Classic rings.  I'm not even clear if Classic rings will retrofit onto a Natural bottle (there is no such thing as "Natural rings"), but I'm not sticking around to find out, I'm returning this kit for the aftermarket versions (which come with their own seals).  I am giving this product 1-star since Philips product description leaves out this critical information (all they say is it "fits Avent bottles").  I'm assuming they came out with this product when Classic bottles were their only bottles and they never updated this product or at least it's description when they released the newer Natural bottles.
