I did a lot of research on this item prior to buying them and read a lot of the reviews. Even after reading the reviews of the product arriving damaged, I decided to take my chance and order a set. The box condition was okay upon arrival. I have to say, for the amount of money paid, I was surprised to find the same quality that a lot of the other reviews have described. Almost every piece of wood in this box was damaged, dented and scraped. Multiple pieces had huge gashes and holes. The pre-drilled holes mostly lined up with our bed frame; however, I am not 100% confident that this is a sturdy, long lasting bed rail. I will look into other options in the future as this item is extrememly expensive compared to the poor damged quality in which you recieve.
