I got this highchair as a gift. I originally thought I wanted a compact highchair, but I do appreciate that this item can be adjusted to meet our table or wheeled out somewhere else.So, the good first. I loved the style of the design. It was modern and didn't look too "childish" in our dining room (I know...doesn't make much sense since it's after all a kid item, but it's true) I love the fact there is two chair covers and two highchair trays to wash. We are always washing one or the other, so I appreciate the extras.Now the bad. As previous reviewers have pointed out, this material is IMPOSSIBLE to clean! You can't wipe it down. You can only get it clean by throwing it in the washer. It's a bit frustrating to have to completely wash the cover when there's just a bit of food. Also, there is SO many crevices for food to get stuck in. There are parts of the chair that just will not come clean. I suppose if I get a box of toothpicks out, I might get it clean.Our tray did fit in the dishwasher, so that is nice, but over all, it's just too dirty even after I wipe it down.
