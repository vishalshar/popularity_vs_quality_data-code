As stated previously in a review by some other customer, what was received was not the same as in the photo.  There was no blue fish.  The duck hands were not as pictured.  Instead they had teething rings sewn on the end of cloth wings.  There was no duck quack but instead a musical rattle.  I bought it as part of a gift and will use it so.  But I am disappointed that the photo and the actual item had considerable differences that were not as good as shown.
