I had two of these sheets for my first child because that's all I could find at the time. Other reviewers are right on about the quality. VERY thin and not very soft either. You can see the pattern right through them.Now that we're expecting our second child any day and she'll be sleeping in the play yard for a long bit, I wanted to see what else was out there.I found the following brands at BRU, bought one of each and tried them on the bed. Here's what I found:Nojo: Terrycloth-like fabric. Soft but still a bit thin. They are elasticized though, which is easier to put on and stays on better. There were three colors available at the store (dark blue, light blue, white). Price $9.99Graco quilted sheet: Very plush, though the fabric is synthetic feeling (I didn't check, but I'd guess poly blend). Most comfortable of any that I tried. Will probably use it under a more natural feeling sheet. Elasticized and stayed on well. Was only available in a dark blue. Most expensive at $14.99Carter portable crib sheet: Knit fabric. On the thin side, but soft. Stayed on well, was elasticized and came in at least 4 colors (green, white, blue, yellow). Price $7.99Koala portable crib sheet: Listed thread count of 220 and it felt like a very decent quality. Elasticized, available in a variety of colors (pink, white, blue, green, etc) and one of the cheaper ones out there at $6.99Overall, I was VERY pleased with the options out there. Highly suggest NOT buying these, but going with an elasticized sheet. Both the Carters and Koala sheets are cheaper and are better quality.The Pack 'n Play fitted sheets will only be used as under sheets from now on!
