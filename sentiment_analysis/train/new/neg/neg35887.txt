I do love this potty and wish I could give it a higher review. I love the design. It is not an eye sore like our old boxy, primary-colored potty. It is two simple pieces, without any hinges or moving parts, so it's not really breakable like our old "three-in-one" potty. (Not jahgoo brand, maybe their three-in-one potty is better. Idk.) Another downfall of the three-in-one potty was the inside structure that was so hard to clean. This potty is very easy to clean, no pockets to get filled with dust and escaped pee. However, I wish the basin clicked into the base, rather than loosely resting on it. The one thing that I am really disappointed in is the size. I knew it would be small, but I didn't think it would be so tiny! This would be perfect for when I introduced my son to the potty at 10 months, but he is 25 months now, and he looks like a giant on it. Also, he easily falls backwards on it, because the base doesn't circle all the way around, but rather there is an open space and the backrest sticks out, so it isn't very stable. This potty is the *perfect* size for elimination communication or early potty learning, or as a travel potty. I am going to keep it and use it as a travel potty, and will save it for any future children, but I think I am going to look for another potty with a good simple design, but that is a little bigger.
