I wanted something I could carry around easily, and this fit the bill.  No big issues with fit.  It's not the most stable thing in the world -- you have to get it correctly into place, which generally means having it align at the front of the toilet seat, not the back.  It's helped me deal with traveling and going out and about with toddlers who are often anxious about using unfamiliar potties.  That said, it did slip one time when I was a couple of steps away from my daughter -- she sort of half fell into the toilet.  Not that big of a deal in reality, but for her it was really traumatic.  You need to stay right by the kid just in case.  And, shortly thereafter the seat did completely break.  We got about 9-10 months of use out of it.
