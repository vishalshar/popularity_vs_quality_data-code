Seriously should have just gone down to the hardware store and bought some cheap door hook for wreaths, you know the metal kind and just bent it smaller.  Probably would have been a lot cheaper and just as effective than this over priced piece of .30 cent plastic marked up for moms and dad who just can't wait to part with their money fast enough!  It works...but for the money just find something else.
