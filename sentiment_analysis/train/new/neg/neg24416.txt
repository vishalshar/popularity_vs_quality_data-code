I will start by saying that I don't have an issue with the product itself. I haven't had a chance to use it yet. I am just writing a note of caution because when I received the package (which was delivered on time) there was a coupon enclosed offering a 15% refund of my order if I left a 5 star review, and afterward copied the seller. This is enticement! How can we trust the integrity of the other glowing reviews? I don't anticipate having an issue with this product, but I did want to let others know to consider this while shopping.
