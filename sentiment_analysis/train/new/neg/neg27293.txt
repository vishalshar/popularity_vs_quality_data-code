These stickers are very cute for "month" photos the first year. They're a great size and show up well in photos. The 3-star rating is because the stickers are opaque, which wasn't clear from the picture or description (at least at the time I purchased them). I had to be very particular about what I chose for baby to wear with the stickers because any design could be seen through the sticker, and on some colors the month number was hard to see. If you plan on only putting these over white or grey shirts, they're perfect.
