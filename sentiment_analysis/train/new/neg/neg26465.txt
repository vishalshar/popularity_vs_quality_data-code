I bought this item 18 months ago and have reached a point of irritation that prompts me to write this. This is a safe, pretty, functional high chair. But, if you are a granny mom and the high chair is parked 95% of the time, you might want to reconsider. It does not fold. The leg span is 28" x 23", using roughly the same floor space as a recliner. It simply does not store nicely. Of course you can disassemble, but it isn't easy and it isn't quick. If you have plenty of room and empty closets just begging for stuff, great choice!
