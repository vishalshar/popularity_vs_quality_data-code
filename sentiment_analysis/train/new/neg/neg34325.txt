I bought this for my 14 month old after frustration with the short straws on the Playtex straw cups. This one has a nice long straw that reaches all the way down. It is pretty spill proof too. I have 2 reasons for giving this 3 stars:1. The top part that contains the silicone straw attached to a transparent top is pretty hard to put back in after removing it for cleaning. When you are running after a toddler, I doubt you can spare 3 minutes per bottle just to put it together.2. The top straw (the one that goes into the child's mouth) is really long - much longer than the one on the Playtex cups. Perhaps this is just an issue for my son, but because he likes to put the whole top straw into his mouth, the length makes him gag.3. The length of the straw also means that every time my son takes a sip and pulls away, the straw springs back and flicks some milk on his face.I'm holding on to it for now, but will wait for another few months before I try it again.
