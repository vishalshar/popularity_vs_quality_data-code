This is a great training pant.  Holds more urine than it needs to.  My complaint would be that it snaps only on one side-- which helps for those little messes, but it would be much better if the snaps were on both sides so if there was a poopy mess, we could get it all the way off and not have to take it down one leg.update:  The snaps come undone easily.  We used these for night training and they came unsnapped each time we pulled them down.  That was more trouble than it was worth, so I sewed up the snap side.  Now that we don't worry about poop, the snaps are no good.  They would be great if they were maybe a different type of snap that stayed closed.
