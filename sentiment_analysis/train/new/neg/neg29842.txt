My 2 year old son loves the Spiderman design but there are a few issues with the seat itself.1. A little small for my son who is tall for his age (40in) but might work fine for a regular size or smaller toddler.2.  Slides around on the toilet seat as the description is wrong and there are no skids on the bottom to prevent this from happening.  It does not slide enough that it or my son would fall off the toilet though.3.  The splash guard is a joke as my son sits above it and must constantly be aware enough to point himself down as to not wet the entire bathroom.  I would prefer the splash guard to be removable as it does not help.4.  The description on Amazon is incorrect, this potty is just the seat as pictured.  There is no Ziploc back for storage and the potty itself does not fold to take with you.All in all a slightly okay potty seat but requires some effort to make it work for my son.
