I purchased this item to match my daughter in laws set. It came assembled. When opened it fell apart. This product is not made well. The sticks that hold the hamper up, kept falling out of there holes. Had to send back to company, with postage and restocking fees, I'll be luckey to see any of my money back. I really dont see how this product would hold anything. I would not recomend this item.
