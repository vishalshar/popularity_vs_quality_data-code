I mainly purchased this gym for the foam mat because I loved the colors and all the animals on it. The mat I recieved is totally different, the main color in the center is the lime green, not orange, and there are only 4 animals on it, cat, croc, elephant and giraffe. I contacted infantino in the hopes of getting the mat that is pictured and they quoted the disclaimer on the box, "Items may vary" and said there was nothing they could do. Great, considering I didn't even see the box until after I purchased it, not that that would have made it any better.It may be a little picky but considering that's the main reason I went with this one and I was sent something uglier, I was pretty irritated. Now I have to go to the trouble and expense of returning it online.
