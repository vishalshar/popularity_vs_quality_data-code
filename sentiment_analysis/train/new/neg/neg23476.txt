Technically these are a better fit for small nipples, but the double layer of translucent plastic makes it extremely difficult to properly center the flange over the nipple, especially while wearing a pumping bra. Which means that you'll get more rubbing and discomfort than using the too-large flanges to begin with. I also had the same difficulty others mention with reduced suction and increased mess with milk getting trapped between the two flanges, but my primary complaint is the inability to see precisely where I've placed the flange. I get the idea behind integrating the flange with the rest of the pump piece - only one piece to wash! - but practically speaking, I'd rather have the flexibility to change flanges at the cost of washing two pieces. And I'd rather grit my teeth with a too-big flange piece than deal with the headache (and nipple pain!) of using these.
