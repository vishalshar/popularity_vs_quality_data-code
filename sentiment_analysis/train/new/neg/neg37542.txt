The necklace we received was not this color, much much lighter (more like the chestnut or sienna color). Also, I bought this one because it looked more "raw" and less shiny. In person, we got a much lighter VERY shiny one. I know a lot of people say it just seems like plastic beads, but really: it just seems like cheap plastic beads. SUPER disappointed.
