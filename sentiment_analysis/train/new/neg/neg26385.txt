This potty chair is a bit on the small (meaning low) side. As squatting is supposed to be a better position for going to the bathroom, we didn't find this to be a problem for our 2.5 year old. It's easy to clean because it doesn't have a bunch of strange nooks and crannies. It also doesn't have a bunch of pieces that need to be assembled in a proper order to be able to use it. (I'm lookin' at you First Years!) Just a seat and a removable bowl. But that's where the problem is...The bowl doesn't sit completely flush (ha!) with the outer seat portion of the potty chair. When the kiddo sits down she complains that it pinches the backs of her thighs. When she stands back up you can usually see the marks where it did just that. We purchased this just to have an extra potty chair, so I won't return it, but I won't recommend it. We'll stick with our Bjorn potty instead.
