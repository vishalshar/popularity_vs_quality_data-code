Although this is a light, easy-to-carry seat, we found it does not work for airplane travel. Both belt paths go directly under the thin cushioning, and because airplane seatbelts ALWAYS clasp in the middle of the lap, it means the big metal buckle is always going to be protruding into the small of the child's back or their thighs if it is secured as tightly as it should be. (See pics). After the fuss of having several flight attendants try to resolve it themselves (and no, a belt extender did not help), we had the choice of either settling for a very loosely-secured seat or asking the pilot to take everyone back to the gate.We just went with it, and when I called Evenflo about the problem after we arrived at our destination, I was told they were aware of some complaints about this problem, the only real fix was to twist the seatbelt (to make the male end a little shorter) and to pad the child's back with a blanket. This is what we ended up doing to get home, but no, I really don't accept I should have to pad the poor kids back againts a big metal buckle every time we travel. We bought this seat specifically for airplane travel due to it's light weight and some of the positive reviews about taking it on planes, but this was absolutely not our experience. It's going back to Amazon.
