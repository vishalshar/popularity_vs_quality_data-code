These seat protectors are worth their price, which isn't much. My daughter wanted something with pockets to hold her notebooks and pencils and books and I liked the idea of a seat protector as well. The product is quite sturdy and my daughter says it's comfortable, but since there's nothing holding it or strapping it to the seat, it slides out every time she gets out of the car. It's not a huge deal but I am considering sewing on a strap that will buckle around the seat to keep this from happening. The second day we got it, she hopped out of the car and it fell in the mud (with her stuff still in the pocket). So keep that in mind when ordering.
