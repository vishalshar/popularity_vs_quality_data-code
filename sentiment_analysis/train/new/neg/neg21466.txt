Update on 4/9/14:  I ended up purchasing another pair of these.  They do work for about 20 minutes before I have to tug them up.  My little guy wears them on our pool patio.  The elastic around the top/bottom does wear out after repeated uses/washings.About three months ago, both me and my mom each purchased the small size Kneekers for my son, who is currently just over a year old, so he started using them when he was 9 months old. They are super cute - the brown is a good neutral color and the rubberized Kneekers logo on the knee area is in a light green. Perfect for a boy or a girl.  In theory these should work great, but they inch down and I find myself having to pull them up frequently. We've tried fixes too - putting them on bare legs or over pajama pants, putting them on upside down with the smaller opening at the top of his leg, putting a cut off sock top underneath them before pulling them on, etc., and nothing seems to work for a sustained period of time.My son is average in size at about 23 lbs.Really thick sweatpants seem to work well to protect my little guy's knees from our tiled house.  Don't know if I'd buy these again.
