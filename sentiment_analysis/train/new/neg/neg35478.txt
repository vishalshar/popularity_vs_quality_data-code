I really wanted to love this brush. When cleaning our storage milk bottles we are always spraying water all over when pulling the brush out of the bottle. Also I've been searching for a Mam nipple sized brush - so I was thrilled to find this had a specially shaped tip for the Mam nipple. It also stands up in a Boon grass if you have one- so convenient!Unfortunately- unlike all the other user reviews I find I have to wash the storage bottles twice bc the silicone bristles don't thoroughly clean the bottles. I've even had milk residue remain on the nipple. Really disappointing.
