I bought this wet bag in early November 2015. Six months later, after taking it to daycare 5 days per week, filling it with cloth diapers, and washing nightly, I can report...Pros: cute print, good size (easily holds six Bum Genius diapers with room to spare), zipper works well, material still feels nice and looks great.Cons: plastic strips along the insides of the seams (which I would guess are there for waterproofing purposes) have all gradually peeled off, and today I found that an inch long hole had opened along one seam right under the strap.
