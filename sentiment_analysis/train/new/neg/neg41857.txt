I bought this rain shield after reading another review that said it fits Peg Perego strollers. Since we live in NYC, it is an absolute essential! We had a Prince Lionheart Rain Shield but left it behind on a trip.The quality of this shield is excellent; durable, heavy plastic, nice side vents, etc.The major flaw is that it does not hang down far enough in the front, and when we were out with it last, my 17 month old's feet were drenched because the shield left them exposed. He is of average height but since he will obviously grow before he is totally out of the stroller, this shield is useless to us. (I will save it for any future babies, when we are using the carseat/stroller combo).I am really disappointed and will have to buy another shield.
