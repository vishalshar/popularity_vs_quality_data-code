While I used this bottle for my first child, when I ordered it through this seller, the bottle was actually a fast flow nipple (not a slow flow as described).  BEWARE!!!!  It also arrived in pink, which I specifically did not want and was not described to be in this color.  It costs too much to return, so now I am stuck investing more money and buying a soft flow nipple to go with it or giving it away.  Needs to be more clear about color being ordered and nipple flow.  The product itself is great, but you need to know what you are ordering which clearly was pretty vague.
