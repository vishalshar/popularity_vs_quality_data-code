I was so upset when I saw this product. If I could post a picture of the size I would for sure. I have a 3 month old and I really wanted to have something natural for him to play with since he is always putting his hands in his mouth. Thought this cute set would be perfect and I thought the reviews were great! Until it arrived. Ok he is 3 months so his mouth is like the size of 50 cent piece. the rattle has balls on it that are the size of a MARBLE.. YES A MARBLE. I was like.. WHAT ... seriously disappointed. All THREE pieces came in a box the size of a newborn shoe box. Not visual. maybe 4"x2"x2". That is a small box. anyway the same for the egg. It is so small I swear my lil man is going to choke on this thing. He puts EVERYTHING into his mouth.. sigh... really wanted this to work. But returned is where it is going.
