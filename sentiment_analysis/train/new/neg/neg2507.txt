I have to agree with many of you. Overall It's cute and sturdy. My baby can excercise & strengthen her legs while she bounces, which was the point of me buying this. I like the educational factor that this jumperoo had over the others. Colors, Shapes, Alphabet, and Farm Animals. We can put these to use versus an ocean theme jumperoo. Now to the toys.  I love the veggie garden.  The garden teaches shapes & colors, and the best part is that the veggies are attached to a "cord" so I do not have to chase after any toys going overboard. My baby loves the spinning ducks.  The book is a hit w/ baby and mommy too. I like how my baby can reach for the cow rattle and cat toy. Now the bad.....The peek-a-boo horse sucks! As others describe the button only raises the horse about a centimeter.  The pigs..um WHATS THE POINT?  They do nothing.  I think they are suppose to pop up & down when you push them, but they don't.  The pigs and horse in my opinion is wasted space & really upset me for the money I paid.  On the flip side I remind myself that all the jumperoos I was looking at were also fisher price so I more than likely would not be 100% satisfied with those either. I do wish the seat turned with a little more ease, because my baby has a hard time moving it. I hope that the stronger she gets that this won't be a problem in the future. Fingers crossed. So all in all I probably made the best choice for our needs. Oh one more thing. It only plays a handful of songs (3 or 4) so they get stuck in your head all day long LOL. I wish there was more variety to the music. Fisher Price I think you need to go back to the drawing board with this product.
