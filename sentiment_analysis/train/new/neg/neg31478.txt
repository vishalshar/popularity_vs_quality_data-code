We got this seat for our 3 year old daughter based on some consumer reports ratings.  When it arrived it seemed like a very solid and well built seat. I was excited to get it into our car, however that is where the trouble started.  We have a 2006 Hyundai Sante Fe and for some reason this seat would not install securely into the car.  I even got into the car, pushed my knee into the seat and pushed my back against the ceiling of the car to get the most leverage. I tightened the LATCH straps as tight as I possibly could. Despite my best efforts, it took only a mild pull on the base of the seat to make the bottom slide out a good 6 inches. The LATCH straps seem to attach to the seat back too high up to get the right leverage on the seat.  Even still, it seemed like it was secure, as it was unable to move any more than this in any direction.  As soon as we put her in the seat, my daughter hated it. She could not get comfortable no matter how we positioned her. She complained and complained until we finally went out and bought another seat for her. I took her to Babies R Us to try out some other seats and we decided on the Graco Nautilus 3 in 1 for only a little more money than this seat. It installed much more securely, it doesn't wiggle at all. Best of all my daughter loves it.
