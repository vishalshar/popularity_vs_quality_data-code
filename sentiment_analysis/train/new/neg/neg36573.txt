While it seemed like an amazing product at the time (2013), my infant at the time was not too comfortable with this travel bed. We did use it for the occasional outing/picnic mini outside adventure but for what the product's actual purpose "travel bed" no. It definitely was not a bed. My child was definitely miserable during bedtime and did not fall asleep at all. :(
