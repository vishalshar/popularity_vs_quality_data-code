I bought this because I needed 2 extra panels to complete my daughters play area. When the package arrived it was all beat up, inside the top connector piece was all screwed up and so it doesn't lay flat/attach properly to the wall/other panels. If I didn't need it immediately I would return it but now I have to live with it! I don't recommend this product if you are trying to add it to your other gate, it is over priced and the quality is crap.
