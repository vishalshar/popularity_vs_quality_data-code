I purchased a few of these because our cats have a habit of opening our closet doors and knocking our stuff off the shelves to make room to lay down. After trying unsuccessfully to tie the doors together with cord (anything we could easily untie they figured out) I ordered these. There is a little rod that hangs from the main part of the lock so shorter adults can slide it, but at least on our doors the lock would not slide with the rod at all. No problem for my wife and I (both 5'9"ish) as we can both reach the tops of our closet doors but a shorter person might have some trouble. In the end, they do keep the cats out of the closets (so they should work well for kids too).
