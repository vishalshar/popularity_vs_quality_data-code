I bought this after seeing all the rave reviews. Also because I hated the horrible neck, shoulder, and back pains my Bjorn caused.The pros: Secure when used properly, distributes weight evenly across your back and shoulders, great for skin to skin time, baby seems way more comfortable in this than in other strap under crotch designs of carriers.The cons: Fabric is too long and can be a pain to mess with outside. (I hate letting it touch the ground!), fabric also can make you and baby very hot! I can't imagine using this in the summer time even here in LA.I'd love to see Moby make a shorter version with light and stretchy fabric that is breathable!
