We previously had some letters like these but they were about twice as big. Those letters started getting a bit dirty with mildew, so we threw them out and bought these to replace them. These are much smaller than what we had before, so the shapes aren't as clear (the "v" and "a" are similar), but they still serve their purpose.We have had these letters for about 2 years and they are still going strong. I make sure they are all completely dry before storing them so I don't have the same mildew issues as with the last set of letters. One thing I noticed, though, is that these little letters do not stay on the wall as long as the bigger letters I had. I assume it has something to do with surface area, or something. Before, I could leave the bigger foam letters stuck to the wall and they would stay all night and day until the next bath. With these smaller letters, they will fall off within a couple of hours.If you are going to give these to smaller children who bite things (like my one-year-old), the letters will end up with permanent bite marks. I try to keep that to a minimum. So far, the bite marks have not prevented the letters from sticking to the wall, so it hasn't really been an issue.Overall, my two kids really like sticking the letters all over the tub and my 3-year-old likes to spell simple words with them. I think anything that helps teach kids about letters is a great toy to have. Both of my children learned their ABC's before they hit 2 years old. These simple, colorful toys are great for exposing young kids to the alphabet.The downfall I find is that they are a pain to clean up every time, so we only use them once in a while!
