I wish I did not have to give a star rating because even one star is to much!! I ordered two canisters of this formula. Not only was my shipment 3 days later then expected but upon arrival, one of the canisters was broken open with tape wrapped around the lid in an attempt to seal it. Seriously?! You want me to feed my child this?! WORST. PRODUCT. EVER.
