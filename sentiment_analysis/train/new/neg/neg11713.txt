My granddaughter loves Minnie and was really excited when I told her that I had a treat for her at bath time.  We opened the package together and took out the toy, and I showed her how to pull the string to get the toy to operate.  She did as instructed, and this toy not only did not move forward in the water - it partially sank in the water!I had relied on Amazon and Disney - two big names - to deliver a quality product.  It is a shame that this experience was a total let-down.Extremely Disappointed
