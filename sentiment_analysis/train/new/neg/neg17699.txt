Nothing special about this one. I had previously bought a set of 12 stickers for my son when he was born, and they were quite nice, large and printed in high definition on a professional material. I was very disappointed when I got this set of stickers on the mail. It is as if someone with a regular color printer bought some adhesive paper and printed on it. The design of the images are nice, just as in the picture, however the quality of the printing and the sticker material are very poor. I do not recommend this item. Look around a bit further or maybe do it yourself at home and you will be better of than spending $13 on these.
