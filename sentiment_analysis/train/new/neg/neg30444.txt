When my daughter was born I had purchased a different Lambs & Ivy set with animals, including matching valance.  I was thrilled with those.  Vibrant colors and very high quality material.  So, I was looking for something a little more "sophisticated" for a little girl's room since she had outgrown the cutesy animals from the original.  Although I wasn't planning on buying the whole Hello Kitty set, this had no HK design and seemed a perfect next step for her.  So...I was really disappointed when it arrived and the colors were NOT vibrant and the material was thin and cheap. Plus, the length was shorter than my original one from them, so it doesn't bunch/gather (like in the picture), which also makes it look cheap on the window.  I had expected more from L&I products and wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  Seems like they've made significant downgrades to their quality.
