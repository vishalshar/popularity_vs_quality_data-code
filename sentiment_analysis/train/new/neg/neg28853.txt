I wish the musical mobile could do much more. Out of all the Papagayo items that I had purchased, I was slightly disappointed in the mobile. For the price I had paid, I wish it could do much more. And the quality is not the greatest. It doesnt even look that great and the music barely lasts! A little disappointed with this product.
