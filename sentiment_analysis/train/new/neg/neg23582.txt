The image quality on this is just awful.  Our infant sleeps on a full sized mattress on the floor, and in night vision mode I can barely distinguish him from the top sheet unless he's wearing a completely contrasting color tone.  This makes it pretty useless if you can't even tell if the baby's in the bed or not.  Maybe the picture's a little better with the lights on, but unfortunately the baby doesn't sleep with the lights on.  Amazon was great about letting us return it, however.The one nice thing about it was the pan/tilt, which works fairly well.
