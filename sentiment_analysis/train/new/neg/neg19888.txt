I wonder if I got the same pillow as everyone else? That woman in the picture must be very tiny. This is not a thick pillow. I can easily fit my hands around it, and almost can put one hand around it. Not much support for my thigh. I'm not pregnant, I was looking for something to keep me on my side because of my back. It seems to work for that, which is the only reason I am keeping it.
