I would have returned this immediately if my daughter didn't think it was so cute.  She is 6 and I suppose visually it's alright from a child's standpoint but the quality is poor and the fabric is cheap.  If it was half the price then perhaps I would not have been as disappointed but I would suggest you go out and buy a quality basket and your own blanket.  On the plus side it does fit all of her dolls (tightly packed) sitting up; 6 small and 4 tiny which is a spacesaver and if she chooses, she can carry them all around at the same time.
