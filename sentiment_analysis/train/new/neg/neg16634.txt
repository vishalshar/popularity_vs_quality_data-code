I needed a small container to carry EVOO based salad dressing in in my lunchbox.  After reading many bento lunch sites and such this little container was highly recommended as leak proof for everything, whether oil or non-oil based.So wrong.  I'm glad I took the precaution of Ziploc bagging it for its first use.  Put my 1tbsp EVOO and a bit of vinegar in it; sealed it; put in the Ziploc; sat it upright and braced it solidly in my lunchbag/box.  Apparently just going up apprx 20 steps at work was enough to slosh the oil a bit, and boy, when I took this out to put on my salad, the inside of the Ziploc was coated with a fine sheen of EVOO.This will probably work well for peanut butter, cream cheese, hummus and the like but not for oil based salad dressing.
