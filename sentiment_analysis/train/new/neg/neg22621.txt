I bought this product along with the pilot, sailor dresses. We dress him with each of this on his monthly birthday. I took a lot of pain to buy these as I am in India and had my friend pick up. The dress looked adorable in the package.I was little disappointed with the product quality as I was used to softer fabrics with carters, gerber, nautica kids etc.Baby Aspen can improve the product considering below points:1) Make the fabric softer. It is rough compared to the baby outfits from other brands2) Mixture of sizes : Cap is too small, Dress fit exactly for my 3 month baby and the socks were very loose.3) There are no mittens provided with the dress but this was shown in the picture - no surprises there.4) The white fabric used in all clothes looks bluish rather than pure white as compared to other brands like carters, gerber etcI just love the themes and concepts baby aspen provides but would like to see better quality for the price we pay. Themed costumes are costlier than the regular ones from carters or gerber but hey should be equivalent in the quality.
