The pattern is very cute and matches my baby's nursery. The fabric is soft. However, when I washed it, the brown decorative piping around the edge of the cover stained the rest of the fabric and it won't come out. Why wasn't the piping prewashed before the cover was assembled? Because of course it's going to get washed - this is going to be used for a baby!
