I had used this pump once a week for almost a year. Then a few months later I used it about once a month for 6 months. So I had it for about 1.5 years. The whole time it never ran as strong as the first day I used it. It was sluggish and would constantly have poor suction. In that time I replaced the duck bill valves about 2 dozen times! I also had to replace the filter about 10 times! Very, very expensive to do. This was with minimal use. Every time I called the company this was there recommendation. I went to use it again and the whole part where the filter screws into just broke off. I contacted the company and I was told I could have it fixed for $100 or more depending on what was wrong with it. I paid almost $350 for this pump. I am so disappointed in its performance overall and its durability. At the end, I contacted the company to "recycle" the pump as they advertise. I found out that I would have had to pay $25 in shipping. I responded kindly to the company telling them that this was a very sad experience for me and the response was "have a great day" basically saying that they did not care:  no apologies, just a kinda sarcastic response. I wish I would have never bought this pump and just bought a Medela. I have several friends who own Medela pumps that they have been using for years and still are going strong.
