I was really hoping to like this, but when I first received it what I noticed is how "tall" it is and was worried about it not fitting my purse and diaper bag. It's also very narrow when you open it, and I just don't see myself positioning the baby perfectly in the middle so they won't touch the surface beneath it. The diaper pouch and wipes case are a nice addition, but they swing out from the changing pad on the sides right about where the baby's arms would go. This is not optimal if you have a small space or the changing area is against the wall - that pouch/pocket would just flop over onto baby.
