Have a mixed review, I ordered 3 for xmas gifts and 2 turned out great where as the last one seems like it came from a completely different company. The 2 that turned out have a nice finish to the frame, the roller tools were painted and finished, the consistency of the clay was great with a nice light color and after 20 hours has started to dry nicely. The other one is completely different, the frame has a different finish, the tools that were sent were unfinished raw wood, and the clay was extremely sticky and grey. We kneaded the clay for about 20 mins hoping that it would become the consistency of the first 2 but that was not the case and almost immediately started cracking as it dried, I put damp paper towel on each one and it still dried cracked. The first 2 were great the third not so much, will be in touch with the company for lack of consistency.
