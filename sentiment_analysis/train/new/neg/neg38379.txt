If I could go back I would purchase something else and now I might have to. The night vision is pretty grainy for the most part (this is the only mode I use it in). Also, after using this monitor for only about 6 months the antenna broke off and I was told it's not covered under the warranty. The signal has always been spotty in the room furthest from the camera, but this is only about 30 feet away so I'm not sure why. Now with no antenna it's basically useless for me 75% of the time.
