I tend to agree with other reviewers here.  I bought this item assuming it was identical to the blue "Classic" version, aside from the fact that it uses batteries rather than a cord and has no additional digital readout on the face, as the "Classic" does, and of course features a sheep rather than a bunny.  Mainly I was assuming that the "Product Dimensions" as conveyed by Amazon on the details page were correct, but they are not.  Both descriptions claim dimensions of 9 x 2.5 x 7.5 inches, which may be the case for the "Classic" blue, but in fact, the green "Globetrotter" is quite a bit smaller.So, if you're looking for a portable, travel version of the clock, and/or don't want to deal with an electrical cord (and/or prefer the sheep icon to the bunny icon), and don't mind the smaller size, then "Globetrotter" is your clock.But if you prefer a larger face that can be read from across the room, and don't mind that it plugs into an outlet, go for the "Classic."  I initially bought the "Globetrotter," realized it was too small to be read from across the room, returned it, bought the "Classic" and all is well.  I must credit Amazon's easy return policy for enabling me to do this with no penalty.As for the clock itself, it does take some training to teach your child that when the bunny is asleep, the child stays in bed, and then the bunny wakes up, the child can get up.  This is easier said than done, but it's not the clock's fault if it doesn't work perfectly!  It's sometimes just tough to teach an excited little kid to stay in bed.But in terms of a fun ornament for a kid's bedroom with some element of time training and/or sleep training, this clocks does the job.
