We bought this before our little one was delivered.  She is now 10 months old and we have stopped using this thermometer all together.At first we thought this little thing would be great and that by taking the temp from the ear would be noninvasive to her. Well here is what we found:1. To use this, you have to pull up on the ear to get an accurate reading.  This means you will be waking your baby up in the middle of the night to check his/her temp.  -Fail2.  Want to recheck the temp to make sure it is what it is reading?  Good luck.  For some reason, you cannot take back to back temperature readings.  This is what ultimately caused us to stop using this thermometer.  It got so frustrating to figure out the special secrete combination of up up down down left right left right..... just to get it where it would read a temp again.  BEST DIGITAL - make a button you press to take the temp.  Then add another bottom to do all the other crap for memory or turning it to celsius.  Seriously, 3am and you are trying to not wake an already unhappy baby and your product is frustrating you to the nth degree.Gave it two stars, because it does what it says it does, and does read accurately after averaging a couple temps together.We have placed this in the diaper bag as it is small and doesn't take up too much room.  About 4 inches in length.
