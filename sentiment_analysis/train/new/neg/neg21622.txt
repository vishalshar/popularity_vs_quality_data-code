This would be a great little board if it hadn't arrived totally broken. Issues with the dry erase part of the board seem to have been resolved (from reading other reviews).This had great big splits up the sides of the legs where the screws were obviously screwed in too tight, and great bg chunks of wood gouged out of the "frame" part around the chalkboard. the wooden pegs to hold the little tray - well, one was there and the other 3 missing.Sadly it was beautifully packed. Wrapped in plastic, then with styrofoam round the edges, then in  well fiting box. Theres NO reason any of the damage would have occured during transit. It was obviously packaged broken. GREAT quality control. NOT.
