The product is good.  It's great.  I bought it because we live in the northeast and my daughter cried each time I put her coat on to go anywhere.  Once she got into the car seat, everything was fine, but she really didn't like getting into a coat. I thought that if I could put her in and just zip this up, she'd be less upset.Well, it worked, she was less upset about getting into the carset and the whole deal.  But it turns out that once she was in the car, this product wouldn't let her see out the window, it blocked much of the view that she had before because it doesn't tuck back in.We're back to using coats.Just something to consider.
