LOVE LOVE LOVE my Alva diapers, but I can only leave a 1 Star review because I have had a terrible time with the seller, Baby Brighter.  It has been more than 90 days since I ordered, so Amazon won't let me leave seller feedback.  Long story short, I placed my order on February 24th and received my order today, June 2nd.  For more details, keep reading:2/24/14: Placed order for 12 diapers and 24 inserts4/3/14: Emailed Baby Brighter: "I received my package today, and it contained 4 covers and a total of 10 inserts.  I ordered 12 covers and 24 inserts.  Can I expect another package with the rest of my order?"4/4/14: "you next half is still on the way. can you kindly let me know which has already been delivered to you? would you mind to take a picture of the delivered items. please don't worry we will compensate you for the inconvenience we may cause you. thanks"  Clearly they had no idea which diapers they had shipped.  At this point, I was angry, so I didn't reply for a bit.4/16/14: "Here are the four diapers I received.  When can I expect the rest of them to arrive?"4/17/14: "you will expect the package in next 10 days. please wait for the delivery to complete your order. thanks"5/6/14: "Any update on my package?"5/8/14: "we have reshipped the package under a new tracking# CRN140417I7P000001. there will be a new tracking# for USPS reference. please don't worry, as we promised, we have reshipped the diapers to you."I checked several different shippers from China, and the tracking number corresponded to none of them.  I was too angry to contact the seller again.Today, June 2nd, I received the rest of my diapers.  This experience was infuriating.  I am happy to FINALLY have the rest of my Alvas, because I love the diapers, but working with Baby Brighter was an absolutely excruciating experience.  Over three months  to receive my order was ridiculous.
