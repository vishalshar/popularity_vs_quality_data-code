I thought I would love these from all the reviews I had read on them. But I actually don't like them as much as my other flannel wipes. The terry side is great to wipe up the messy diaper clean ups but the flannel side has gotten rough to the touch and I don't want to irritate baby's buns with it. Also they feel bulky because there's one side flannel and one side terry and it's hard to get into skin folds.
