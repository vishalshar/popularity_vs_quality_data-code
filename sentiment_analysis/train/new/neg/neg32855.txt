The reason I purchased these cups was that I wanted to get something that was safer for our son. I do love that they are more "green" than some plastic cups. That being said, Trying to stack them up is a little difficult. My son is 13 mo and he's got great fine and gross motor skills for his age. I even have difficulty stacking these cups and keeping them stacked. I find it slightly discouraging when making the stack/tower with him. The colors are just as shown in the picture. They have tiny holes so you can use them in the bath if you'd like. They have shapes atthe bottom of some of them as well. All in all they're "ok." I hope that over time my son will learn to stack them even though they're quite difficult.
