I got this to extend the visor of a sit and stand stroller to provide coverage for both the kids riding in it. This was kind of a bust because of the way it installs on the stroller, it creates a covered wagon effect on the back end of the visor, which makes it only helpful for the child sitting in the front of the stroller. It is also bulky and unwieldy when folding up the stroller. If you install it backward to help the child sitting in the back of the sit and stand, the front of the visor gets pinched and bunched up. So, it totally didn't work for what I wanted. I am hoping that the extended range of the visor in the front will make it worth it on our upcoming road trip, and I will update in that event.
