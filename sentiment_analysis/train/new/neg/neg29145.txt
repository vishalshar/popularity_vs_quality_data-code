I am not one to review products because frankly I don't normally care but this one I just could not let somebody else suffer with what I have to go through every day! I read the reviews and thought the reviews are OK! When I got mine it was and still is a piece of junkHere are the pros and cons to this stroller.Pro* looks good( oh man I didn't realize that's the only nice thing I have to say)Con* frame is weak mine is bent now because it is so flimsy*wheels are foam so you will hear clicking constantly because of the stones that are stuck in them* you can not put the hood on to protect your second baby sitting in the back if you have the car seat attached* the rain cover does not fit over the car seat so if it rains your screwed* this isn't a stroller for a new born and toddler* the back chair reclines an inch if you UNZIP yes I said UNZIP (cheap) both sides of the chair* the little metal buttons to attach the frame always get stuck inside of the frame (very dangerous)* the wheels squeak constantly (very embarrassing)* there is no cup holder (try pushing two kids with a drink in your hand! Extremely stressful)* basket is not a carrying basket it is your baby's foot room (I can get a gallon of milk and that's it)* the seatbelts are a pathetic excuse of a seatbelt they come unbuckle with a bit of force* if you have a small car don't not dream of getting this thing in your trunk even though you have to take it apart anyway* I have to attach the car seat to it because the chair are so unsafe* to navigate I feel like I am pushing a car there is no help with the wheels it's like not having power steering in your carAnd the list could go on........ Like I said I am not normally one to write reviews but I just can't let you find out by the "oh I'll see how it is and if I don't like I'll send it back" motto the return shipping is a PAIN That I why I still have mine they seriously made me go around the houses to then tell me that I am now too late to return it. Anyway I have never had a problem buying anything from amazon before and will stay a loyal customer but if I get another dodgy thing at my door step I am going to CRY!!!! Hope this helps good luck.
