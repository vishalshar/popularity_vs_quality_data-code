This is not worth the money.  It's kinda crappy.  The quality is fabric covered cardboard.  It mounts to the wall with a little stitched loop.  So you would put a nail in the wall and essentially hang it on it.  I'm not all that pleased with it and I don't think I'll be putting it up in the nursery because it's just sort of cheap and crappy looking.
