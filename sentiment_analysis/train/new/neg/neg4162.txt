I bought the 9 month size for my almost 10 month old. He is tall and lean (17lbs, 29 inches). He's always been 10th% for weight and 95th% for height and wears the size of clothing equal to his age or a size under (so at 9 months old can wear 9 month and 6 month clothing).  So I knew better than to buy the 12 month size. However this suit swallows him!!! Everything except the vest is way to big. The pants in my opinion are a 12 month size. The waist just falls off his body and the length is at least 3" too long which says a lot since he is tall for his age. It also seems to be poorly made; lots of loose threads and the buttons on the shirt were all stuck in the threading when I tried to unbutton them. But if it fit him I would still use it because he looks adorable in it and for the price it's a good deal. I just wish it came in a 6 month size. It's too big to even try to hem/alter. I will be returning and finding another suit for him. He's the ringbearer in my brothers wedding in 8 weeks but I know he still will not grow enough in that time frame to fill this suit out!
