We purchased this to try out one of my many ideas for helping our special needs son adjust to items used in public venues a couple of years back, because it is a style of high chair frequently found in restaurants, etc. Ok, so this is a skill set we are still down in the trenches working on for our little man, but this particular product got abandoned quite quickly.Why? This particular wooden high chair has several problems.  First off, the safety strap is pathetically easy to get out of and won't hold any sort of tightened down position.  Even for a child with profound fine motor delays...he was able to get himself out of it within the first week of use.  Next up is that the little wooden accents that go over the screws have one by one all popped off, they started popping off within the first couple of weeks, which, if you have a child who puts everything in their mouth, makes them a choke hazard.The aesthetic appearance of the item is fine, but for us, the safety strap failure was a huge issue that rendered this item all but useless, and for an item that is designed for a high chair, I think it is essential that the safety strap should be a well-functioning restraint.
