I ordered this product for my son when he started teething around 5 months old. The product is a bit heavy and is quite large, so if he was laying down and picked it up he would sometimes hit himself in the face with it. Also, you have to really bite or press hard for the vibrating action, so the majority of the time he is using it, I have to press down for him and hold it in his mouth so he can have that relief. Also, it seems that you have to press in certain areas rather than all over the rubber sides for it to vibrate. Might work better for an older baby who can bite down harder and has a better grip.
