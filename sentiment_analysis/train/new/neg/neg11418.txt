Let me start by saying that I actually love the cups themselves. I wish I had found these years ago with my first child, they never leak, take tons of drops on the floor and are super easy to clean. It's this 4 pack that gets no stars from me. I ordered the 4 pack for boys, thinking I'd get 4 different designs. Didn't matter the designs, just that they were different so I can keep track of the cups. Not to mention, the pics shown in the description show aliens, cars, an alligator. Description says color and designs will vary. That's what I want! Well, I ordered these and got two sets of the same exact cups. Wrote to customer service to have them send me a 2nd set, hoping I'd get different cups and could return the ones that were duplicates. Nope, same 2 sets of cups, so I ended up returning all of them. If that's the only way they come it would've been nice if customer service actually read what I wrote when I requested the return of the first set so the same thing didn't happen again.
