The shades arrive in a very small cardboard package.  As a result, they are folded many times and are very wrinkled when you unfold them.  I laid them out on a flat surface and used a hair dryer to relax the folds to flatten them out.  This was only slightly successful, so I covered the sheets with the tissue paper that came with them and applied a warm iron to the surface.  That got most of the wrinkles out, but they still aren't completely flat.  They stick fairly well to the windows, but still have some bubbles from the wrinkles.  I'm hoping they will eventually flatten out with time, but not so far (it has only been a couple weeks).Overall, they seem to work okay, but it would be much better if they were packaged and shipped rolled up on a tube instead of being stuffed into a small box.  I suspect some users just give up and toss them out after trying to get them to lay flat on a window.  I would give them four stars for working as a sun shade, but one star (or less) for the shipping packaging.
