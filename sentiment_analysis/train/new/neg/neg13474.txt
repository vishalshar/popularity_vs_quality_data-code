Ok product. The flanges are all one piece and seem a little smaller then when compared to medela brand. I mostly bought it for the spare tubing and membranes. Overall good pricefor the amount of spare parts you get.Update: so I have been using these for a while and notice a couple new things, the shaft of the flanges are much shorter then those of the medela brand so if you have large nipples and used a strong suction setting on your pimp, you nipple will hit the back of the flanges wall. Also with a high auction for whatever reason with my breast, the friction sometimes caused little cracks where the areola and nipple meet causing them to bleed (ruining the milk I pumped). This has never happened with the medela brand. I still you these off brand pump parents but I alter my pump routine when I do.
