I really, REALLY wished I had read the comments before ordering these.I was very excited about ordering this item for an "Around the World" theme party. I thought these balloons would add a very cute touch. They came very fast, which was good. The bad? These balloons look NOTHING like the picture. To begin with, the actual balloon is a dark, dark blue. In the picture, it looked like a lighter blue. The color was very disappointing. Had I known it was a dark, dark blue, I would not have ordered them as the color would not have been right for my party. The next bad thing is that the continents only look like continents if you are holding the balloon. You can't see them from afar. And the continents aren't a dark green to make up for the dark blue balloon. The continents are a light, silvery green (if that makes sense).I ordered 2 packs and regret it so much. I'm glad I took it to the party store to see one blown up first before using them at the party. They would have looked bad. It would have been a cute product if it looked like the picture.
