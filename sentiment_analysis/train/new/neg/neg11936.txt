The construction is good. But as any gate it as good as its locking mechanism. And the locking mechanism is very bad. Depending on how you tighten your gate the locking mechanism is either too easy to open: just lift the gate and push it open without even pushing Unlock button. If you tighten it a little more then it becomes very hard to open - you push the Unlock button, lift the gate, but the latching pin stays engaged. So in order to open it the gate from this position you need literally jerk it and rip it open (forcing the locking pin to disengage). And when you are doing this the gate clanks very loudly (too bad if your baby is very sensitive to noises while sleeping) That locking pin is cheap plastic so I am not sure how much longer it can withstand such beating.My wife and my 11 year old daughter started to hate this gate first time they had to open it. If I install it when it is too easy to open, then it is not safe for my 7 months old baby.I am returning this gate and I DO NOT recommend this gate to anyone. I have no idea how this gate got so many positive reviews. Yes, construction is good, but I repeat - gate lock is terrible. Save yourself a trouble of returning it. See photos for details.
