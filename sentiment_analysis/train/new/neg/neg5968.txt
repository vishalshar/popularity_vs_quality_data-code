I love the music and the different apps for this mobile, but the battery life and sensitivity is a huge issue with me. It only requires 2 DD batteries which sounds great in theory; however, I've had to change out the batteries almost every week. And my son only uses this when he sleeps at night. Also, when I close the gate to his crib it sometimes knocks the batteries lose and the mobile stops working all together. I have to take the mobile off the crib, unscrew the back, push the batteries back in, and then screw the back back on to get it working again. Great music and adorable animations, but the hassle with the batteries are ridiculous!
