I have purchased 3 of these sheet sets in 2 different colors. The quality between the colors is really off. I loved the 2 sets of Mocha that I purchased for my son. They are very soft, have washed really well, and have a beautiful color. So I was excited to order pink for my new baby girl. However, it seems like they were made by a different manufacturer. The material is thicker but stiffer, it fits the crib mattress awkwardly (the same Naturepedic mattress that my son has), and just generally seems to be of lower quality. At this point I'm unsure if I will order another set in a different color. I feel like it would be a total roll of the dice as to what we would end up with.
