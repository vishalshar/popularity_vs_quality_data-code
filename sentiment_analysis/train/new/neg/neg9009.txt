I was really excited for this furniture set, but now wish I would have went for a better quality. The dresser does look like the picture and when removing it from the package we did think they did a good job packaging it all together. Beware that this is a very heavy package! Since it was a heavy package I thought that it was a good sign...the dresser is cheap and there are a lot of parts. The pictures in the instructions are hard to see and not clear, which resulted in some assembly complications. Did not care for the cardboard back and one of the tracks was damaged. I hope the drawer can still stay on track. A screw also broke and there was not another one so we are using wood glue for one side, hoping this will be enough to hold it together. It took us 2 hours to assemble and we thought we had a good pace going until the mix up when putting the tracks on. This dresser is overpriced.Fingers crossed the changing table that goes with this set is not as complicated to assemble and sturdy enough to hold a baby...
