The product is a great size for younger children; my 6 year old loves it and was excited for a 'big boy' bottle without a straw.  No insulation so remember it will be very cold if filled with ice cold drinks (not a big deal because the rubber grip area is perfectly placed).  The pull up nozzle is fine for my 6 year old, but too hard to maneuver for my 3 year old.  The down side is the plastic dome cover broke within the first 2 weeks of use.  The lip used to pull up the dome cover broke and left a pretty sharp zip zag edge.  I ended up taking the top dome part off due to this.  I don't know how it was broken, but the dome cover is not as sturdy as it should be since it is created for younger kids so be aware of this.  Other than that, its great!
