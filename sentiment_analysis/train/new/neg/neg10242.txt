I bought this for my daughter for Christmas 2012. It is a very cute bean bag but I realized immediately that I should have ordered extra beans. It is the perfect size for my 4 year old but would be too small for an older child. I do recommend this Cupcake Bean Bag, but be sure to order extra filling. You will need it.
