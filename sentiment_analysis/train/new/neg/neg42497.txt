Not that I hate this item but it has already been over 2.5 months and I hate yet to see the pillow from the seller tenmillion.  I nearly forgot about this pillow but I was waiting for it for my baby girl. We had order this exactly one before for our son when he was a baby and even though it didn't work really well for preventing flat head, we used it for extra head support for the changing table. At this rate, my baby girl won't need it. If I knew in advance it would take this long, I would just have cancelled the item long ago.Update: order on 10/19 and it's now 1/22 and still haven't receive the item. This is ridiculous.
