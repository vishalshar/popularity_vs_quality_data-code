Beware! The pictures of the "cream" color are very misleading! In person it is not cream, but an oatmeal/tan color. This would not have bothered me so much had I not bought it for a baby blessing expecting something a little closer to the picture and color description. That being said, it was way too cute to send back. I will keep it and use it for an everyday outfit, but I spent a little more than I normally would on  baby clothing thinking it would be used for a special occasion.
