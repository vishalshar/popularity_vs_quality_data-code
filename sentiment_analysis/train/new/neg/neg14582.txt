We have the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders swing that worked really well for our older daughter, but it is battery powered.  With our second, we decided we should have one that plugs in so that we don't have to worry about keeping extra batteries around.  I had read the reviews about the motor, but figured I'd just send it back to Amazon if our motor was bad.  The problem with the swing is that it's not clear if the motor is bad.  It swings, but not quite fast enough to soothe.  We've ended up hardly using this swing and going back to the Ocean Wonders.  Thank goodness we kept it!!
