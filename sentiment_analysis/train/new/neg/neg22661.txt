I definately will not recommend this product.It is too big or should I say too foamy.when put on the car seat handle,your hands cannot go around the seat handle so the only way you can use this product is to lift the baby and the car seat to the elbow which will be very difficult to do when the baby starts gaining some pounds.mine has been in closet ever since I bought it,actually it might be going to my trash because I cant find the receipt to return it.
