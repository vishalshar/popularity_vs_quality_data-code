These are cute, but we are not impressed with the quality.  These are a baby toy, and as such are going to get dirty and need cleaning.  I briefly submerged these in soapy water and all except the butterfly got water inside the "tube" portions.  They have taken several days to dry out and that's during the winter with low humidity.  Mold and mildew are going to be a serious consideration. Also wondering what's going to happen once she starts chewing on the toys--is saliva going to work it's way in, too?  Would be an ok product if they were sealed better.
