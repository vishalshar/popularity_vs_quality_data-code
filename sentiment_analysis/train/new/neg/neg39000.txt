Got this for our 2 yr old boy for potty training. We've used the cushioned seats before, but needed a new one and really wanted Thomas for him (because his world revolves around Thomas the Tank Engine right now). It is geared more for boys, with the splash guard permanently molded to it, which I guess is good, as you really do need a little more in front to prevent stray spraying. Probably would not be great for a girl. This seat is kinda tough to get on and off quickly. You need to put it on sideways first (holding straight, but turned like on a dial), then turn it til it is straight on , and reverse to release it. You can just plop it on and remove it straight off like other ones. It does scratch the actual toilet seat underneath, so plan on replacing your adult seat when you are done using this. But it has his favorite character, and he's in underwear now, so glad to have it to help motivate.
