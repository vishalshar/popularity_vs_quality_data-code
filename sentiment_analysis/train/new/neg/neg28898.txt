We bought this bag so we could check our son's carseat with our other luggage when flying.  His Britax Companion (bucket-style) seat fits well in the bag with some room to spare for other items, but the bag ripped in a couple of spots on its first trip, so it's already sporting some duct tape repairs.  Also, the handle is very poorly placed/designed, making it hard for average-sized adults to roll it on its wheels without hunching over a considerable amount.
