I purchased this baby monitor and an extra camera to go with it.  The monitor and the camera that came together in the box worked ok and I had no issues with it.  Then, I tried to get the baby monitor to link up with the extra camera that I purchased to go with the system and couldn't get it to work.  I easily tried a hundred time to get it to link up, with no success.  I tried calling the company with the information provided in the instruction manual and got an answering machine with a message I couldn't understand (english was not this person's best language).  I then emailed the support team and was told that I need to update my brand new camera before I could link it with the monitor.  They then sent me some firmware update that my computer didn't have the correct software to open and I had to find it online and install the new software.  After that headache was over, I attempted to install the new firmware on my new extra camera and was still unsuccessful.  I tried to do that many times with the same BS result.  I will also add here that the firmware upgrade required the use of a paperclip, a computer, a USB cable, and an extra hand to help push one of the buttons during the process.  The end result for me is that I couldn't get the extra camera to link up and my only recourse other than returning it to Amazon was to send it to the company at my expense and wait for 3-4 weeks while they got around to fixing it.  I'm sending mine back to Amazon and purchasing something completely different and I won't be purchasing anything from Zopid again.  Final Note:  My brother-in-law also had this exact same issue with his extra camera and monitor and ultimately had to send it to the manufaturer because he missed his return window from Amazon.
