The harness on this rocker (the reason I bought it was for the shoulder straps) is awful.  The straps are connected so high up that they are level with the baby's face and they are tightened all the way and still they are so loose they just hang there.  I don't understand why the straps are like that - they should be at or below shoulder height.  Don't waste your money on this product.
