We like the idea... With that being said its plastic and flimsy. It went perfect with my son's car's themed room and he likes watching the lights blink. It would be better if you had an option to keep all three of the lights on without the blinking though. It worked and my son likes it, only reason i gave it 3 stars.***UPDATE: My son had this on his nightstand and was enjoying the lights when one of the bulbs Exploded and this thing started smoking. If I had not been right there it may have caught my house on fire.  Terrible! DO NOT BUY!!!
