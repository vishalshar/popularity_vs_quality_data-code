I bought this for a toddler to use in my home. She doesn't live here,so it's not frequently used. After two months, the seat is giving out. I'm not sure at this point whether to undo the fabric from the bottom to try and repair it, or try to return this bulky item that I no longer have a box for. I'm really disappointed because she loves the chair.
