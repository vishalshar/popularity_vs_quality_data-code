My husband and I decided to buy this product because of the cost.  We really wanted another brand, but we figured it was too expensive.  Now I know why this thing is affordable...it's the worst!!We constantly had error messages, the readings always seemed inaccurate, and the covers are so hard to find in the stores!  Plus, you had to wait an ETERNITY for the reading!  By the time we got a reading, the baby had squirmed so much that we doubted the reading was accurate at all.By the way, we ran out in the middle of the night to get a Braun Thermometer, and we are sooooo HAPPY with it!  It takes a second to get the reading, the covers are sold everywhere, and it's not that much more expensive than this one (only about 10-15 dollars).  Believe me, it is so worth it!!I am going to write the company, as one reviewer suggested.  There are some definite flaws that need to be fixed.
