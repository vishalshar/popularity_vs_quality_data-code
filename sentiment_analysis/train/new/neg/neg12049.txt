There is a major design flaw with this product...the fabric DOES NOT FIT properly! It is impossible to assemble this as directed. The fabric is way too small to button and/or zip. The item comes desembled so it is up to you to fit the fabric on the item. We got the fabric on but its not secured the way it should be. This is very frustrating. Too bad because its a great looking and functional piece. I strongly suggest another bassinet. Even if you can somehow manage to get the fabric in place, once it gets soiled, good luck getting it on and off for washing...
