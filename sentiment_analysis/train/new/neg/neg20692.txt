I bought two packages, both were supposedly slow flow.  One package was and we use them fine.  The other package, although labeled exactly the same, definitely has fast flow nipples.  My infant twins both had the gag reflex because it was too much milk for them to swallow.  I did a side by side comparison and one package had all four nipples with flow twice as fast as the nipples from the other package.  Quality control FAIL.
