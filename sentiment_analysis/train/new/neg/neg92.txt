Not true to size. Bought this when my daughter was 3 months old and it barely fits. My daughter is petite and in the 25th percentile with her weight and hight so she's not abnormally big, she's petite. daughter is 6 months old and this fits like a blouse and barely covers her bottom. I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry, so it didn't shrink. Even tho it says 100 % cotton it does not feel like it. It's actually rough to the touch. It's going to be my new dusting cloth too much of a hassle to go thorough the process of returning it.
