I was a little disappointed at how quickly the design came off the handles.  I think within two dishwasher runs, the design was pretty faded and I use a normal setting - not hot or anything.  It does work and fits well into my kids hands though, so it provides use.  Just disappointed that my kids aren't as excited about them anymore since they can't see the fun designs.
