I was excited to order this since it allows the child to get to the toilet without touching it. But once I got it, it was HUGE! It barely fit into the bathroom but then was so bulky in there, that it rendered the bathroom unusable.  We decided to send back.  Other than the fact the seller requires us to pay to send back which is why they lost a star, returning was smooth and easy.
