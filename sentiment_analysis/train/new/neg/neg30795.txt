I wanted to love this a lot more than I did.  It is very comfortable once you actually get baby in, but I found that to be quite difficult, especially as a newborn.  The newborn "insert" is awkward and tricky and doesn't work very well in my opinion.  My baby was so fussy that it wasn't worth the fight to get him in it.  Also when he was really little he was swallowed up by it.  He was so far down in there even with the insert that I could see his face and worried he would smother.  He also didn't like facing in and wanted to be able to see out which he couldn't in this carrier.  I'm sure this works well for some babies and it is very comfortable and well made, it just wasn't for us.  When he was old enough I got a Baby Bjorn and it was perfect.
