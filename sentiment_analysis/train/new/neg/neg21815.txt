Great idea but the zipper is small and thin and fell apart before the first use. The people I purchased the order from did not offer to replace it they told me to call the manufacturer. if they would have made this bag with a stronger zipper it would be perfect, however, this bag is rendered useless with out the zipper because the zipper is on the bottom. The zipper is too small for the product.
