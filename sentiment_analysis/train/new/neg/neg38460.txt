The image is clear enough, but I hate this monitor. I have 2 cameras, one for each child's room. Camera 1 loses its signal every time I turn the monitor on. So so so annoying!  I have to go into the baby's room and unplug/replug the camera. It sucks because the outlet is behind the baby's crib. I have the camera mounted high on the wall so I can't just unplug the power cable from the camera. Camera 2 has no problems, odd because that camera isn't even the one that came with the video monitor...I bought it separately.I also hate that it doesn't have a temperature gauge on it. My old video monitor had one and it was so convenient knowing the exact temp in the room.The sound is good. I ALWAYS hear when one of my kids whimpers, which is what is important. I just wish the camera would stay connected to the dang monitor!
