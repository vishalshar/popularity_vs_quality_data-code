Just bought it for our trip to Disney World and not impressed. I must admit it that, being an owner of a Bugaboo Cameleon and (former) owner of a City Mini Double, it's hard for me to get used to umbrella strollers, but anyway this one is not worth it. It looks good for a stroller that price, almost like a Maclaren, but it is very hard to open/close, very wide, my 3 year old kept dragging her feet on the floor, making it dangerous. It reclines nicely, has nice storage baskets, but the canopy is a joke: it keeps detaching from the side and doesn't keep the sun away. It is also very heavy for an umbrella stroller.It could be a much better stroller if they would be willing to fix those problems.
