When I got this product I was impressed at first but then after everything was set up I went to run the swing and then i relized the motor to the unit was not working at all, it just made a humming noise and then refused to move.Called customer service and after answering about 45 minutes of questions they are sending me another motor unit (four to six weeks for delivery)and we know what that means when a baby dosent have a swing. headache sleepness and exhaustion for parentsCustomer service was excellent. Quality of unit is poor. Thats why I give it three stars. Would be very hesistent to purchase another graco product with electrical parts
