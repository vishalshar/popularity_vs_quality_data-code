I bought this after my sister recommend it to me for my baby registry. She has one and really loves it. I ended up returning it though. The pad is a nice size and folds up nicely for sticking into a baby bag or large purse. The reason I decided to return it was because I bought another brand from Babies R Us that I liked much more and is more convenient for me. The one I got instead is the same size but has a hard plastic container for holding wipes and built in pocket for the wipes container, a pocket that holds about six size one diapers, and a little spot to hold plastic bags for keeping dirty diapers in if you are unable to dispose of it right away. You can just grab it out of your bag and have everything you need for a diaper change at your fingertips. So overall I think this pad is fine but it didn't seem as practical to me.
