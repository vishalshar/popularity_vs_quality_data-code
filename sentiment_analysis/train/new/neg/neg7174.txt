I am not saying this product is bad, but it will not work on a fussy overactive toddler. As soon as I put it on my 22 month old's wrist, he started fidgeting with it and tugging it around. In no time he had it completely scrunched up and impossible to read. I couldn't cut the band very short, because then you can't write much on a tiny 2 yr old's wrist size band.Will try this again, when he is slightly older and understands.
