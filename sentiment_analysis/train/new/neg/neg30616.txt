Completely FAKE product, buyer beware. The one we received has a hole in the end of the pacifier that my infant can suck air through and the quality of the sewing is terrible. We bought a real one to show comparison photos. From product to packaging this is clearly a fake. The real one is on the left in the photos, and the packaging of the real one is on the left as well.
