I have 2 older Britax seats - the pavillion and the advocate and have had no problems with those. I got these for my 2.5 year old who is 28 pounds and it is extremely difficult getting her in and out of the car seat due to the very tight straps... if she has a jacket on - or even a light sweater- we can barely buckle her in... going to call and ask Britax for longer straps - I hope they aren't that difficult about it or I am going to have to return the seat
