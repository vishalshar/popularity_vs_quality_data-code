We got the traveling pillow for our daughter who was moving from a large youth seat to a simple booster seat.  We thought that this would be good on those long trips when she gets tired and just wants to lay her head against a pillow to sleep.  The suede material is very soft and she likes the color; however, she doesn't like how it slides up and down the belt.  We did like the Velcro closure.
