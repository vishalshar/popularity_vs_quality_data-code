Ok, I love some of Safety 1sts products - they're cheap, they're available everywhere, and they make almost everything.  But this monitor was no good.  No matter where the reciever was, we had to crank up the volume to be able to hear him.  Then, we he finally did make some noise, the sound would go in and out from SUPER LOUD to not a sound at all.  Sometimes, the little red lights would be going up and down like crazy and I would finally wake up to hear my baby crying in his room with no sound at all coming through the speaker.  Plus - sometimes if you stand in front of it or put your hand on it - it'll crackle or whine like microphone feedback.Waste of money.  We bought the next step up Safety 1st monitor and took that one back as well.  We ended up paying the extra 20$ to get a good quality monitor and never had to worry again.
