Its alright, I suppose.  The grips should be bigger so that you can hold it more securely.  This would help if the kid was awake.  The curved blade helps a little, and its nice and sharp, but the poor grip makes you feel less safe when doing the cutting.  I'd recommend going with the safety 1st nail cutter.  There's a lot more control with it than the scissors.
