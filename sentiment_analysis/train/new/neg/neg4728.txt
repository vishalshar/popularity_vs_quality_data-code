Beautiful crib and very versatile. You will need some experience assembling furniture. The picture of the assembled crib was more useful than the instructions. The instructions assume each piece has a corresponding letter on it. Most pieces aren't labeled. The holes for the barrel nuts were drilled too deep. So if you push the barrel nut in too far you will need a rod to push it back out. I used a narrow T handle hex wrench. The wood is soft and will dent easily. The styrofoam is like explosive debri. It gets everywhere. I've never seen anything like it. The components were well wrapped and packed. I was missing one 3" bolt and barrel nut. I went to their website and ordered it.
