I bought this seat for my 17 pound 26 inch, 4 month old. After 2 hours of trying to install it I was extremly frusterated. I had read several reports on other sites saying this was a horrid seat, but after going to our local Babies R Us and trying the seat out in there test area, we thought it was wonderful. When I took it home I realized the latch belt was hard to install yourself, the instructions weren't all that clear, I'm not sure I could have figured it out if I hadn't seen it in the store. I did finally get the seat in with it attached to the base, which I felt was safest. Even after I installed it the "Level with ground" indicator was NEVER level to ground no matter how hard I pushed. Finally I took it over to my local Fire station because I was worried that since it wasn't level it wasn't safe. They completly unhooked it and reinstalled it, but it took 3 men pushing it down into the seat to get the latch hooked. They aslo used a rolled up sheet to put under the front trying to make it more level. All in all they got it in a little better then I had it myself, and it took them another hour.As far as the seat itself, one reason we bought it was for the recline, which in my SUV (Ford Escape) it did not recline very far at all.  My son has a little trouble sleeping in it. The seat itself is nice and soft, it seems durable and I really like the fact it turns into a booster. For the money its an OK seat, just be prepared to spend a lot of time with the initial install!
