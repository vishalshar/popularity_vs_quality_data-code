I got unlucky wipes contained that fiber glass kind of upset becasue I love this brand must have been a bad batch that inspection passed i use this for my face to whipe off make up or my hands inbetween products since its not really glass i dont get cut or anything no harm done but that sparkly stuff that i thought was some weird new glitter does look kind of off but its an ok product just wonder when this brand no longer have this fiber stuff mixed in it.
