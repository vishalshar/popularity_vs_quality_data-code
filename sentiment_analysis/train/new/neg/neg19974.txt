It was flimsy and breaks apart when you pull on the cord below the wrapped portion.  I was hopeful it would be more solid, like wrapping it around a spool, but it was not as robust as I hoped.  I don't recommend it because the plastic pop top is the only thing holding everything together, and it does not have enough friction to work well.
