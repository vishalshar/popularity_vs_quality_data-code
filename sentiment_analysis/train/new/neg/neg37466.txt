When these arrived yesterday I was almost giddy (not my usual reaction to blankets!)at how beautiful,soft and just perfect they were. I even made my husband take notice. I told him, "look, one side is a nice, soft, warm flannel and the other is more of a cool, soft cotten. Best of both worlds!"Put them in wash with other brand new baby items,(another blanket, oneies, sleepers)on gentle, warm, and with Dreft. Transferred to dryer on LOW heat, gentle.These beautiful blankets came out with the look of being used and washed and dried for 6 months to a year! They even frayed on the satin trim! The flannel/cotten is all nubby and both blankets just look very used now.I am seriously SO DISAPPOINTED! The "most helpful" review even said that they washed well...I wonder what she did to wash them???? And did she dry them??? I wish I knew because I would have done whatever it took to keep their lovelyness!
