i love this bra, the ability to either breastfeed or pump is PERFECT for a working mom.  However, I have to say, I am very disappointed as after 4 times wearing it the seams around the pump flange holes (on the inside layer) are already coming undone.  This is without it even being washed yet! I also bought the black one, but havent had any issues with the seams coming undone.  For the price, I would expect this product to be more resilient.
