I was able to set the 4 digit tumblers and insert the cable. Cannot get the cable head back out. I tried scrambling the numbers, returning to the combination I set and nothing. It doesn't unlock.I had planned to use this item on a European train trip to lock my luggage. I cannot depend on it to possibly work. Please give me instructions on how to return for a full refund ($10.48).I sent this email to the company the day I received it (April 4, 2014). As of this posting I have heard Nothing from the company.
