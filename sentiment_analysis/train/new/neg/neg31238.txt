This is a cute activity center that also lets baby bounce.It's construction is sturdy and very easy to assemble.The only complaints that i have is that the toy rattle easily snaps off and the toy bar is made out of a hollow plastic and easily bends.i'm afraid in time it will break off.But my daughter loves this toy she has to be in it all day everyday.
