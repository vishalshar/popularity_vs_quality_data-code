This thermometer is a total waste of money. I have 5 little kids and have gone through several thermometers. I got this one thinking I would give it a try. Like most people said, it does not give accurate readings. I had a child running a 101 degree fever and it was reading 97 degrees. I thought it might just be harder to get an accurate reading on a child with a smaller ear canal, but it is impossible to get a good reading on an adult too. I should have looked up reviews before buying this product. Save your money and buy a good thermometer.
