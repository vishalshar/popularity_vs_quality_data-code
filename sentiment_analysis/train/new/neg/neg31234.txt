These did not work for us.  I wish they did.  The tape sticks to the window frame just fine, but the piece that is supposed to stop the window just slides along the velcro when the window is pushed against it!  It seemed to work when I first applied it, but after the first test, it just kept falling off the velcro tape. Now I have to return them an figure out another way to keep my kids from falling out the windows.
