Cup was not as pictured , it is similar but is a different style and has pictures of a dog, cat , a ball, and something else. The reason this bothers me is that I was trying to replace my sons sippy cup which he loves and won't drink out of anything else. That'd be the cup that is shown. He accepted this cup simply because it is similar enough I guess and said its not so bad. Big disappointment though. I did contact seller before purchasing to see if they could guarantee I could get 2 of the yellow-orangish cups the seller was very helpful but I guess I was too vague on this one.
