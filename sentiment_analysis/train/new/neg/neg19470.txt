I've received this Bag a week ago, didn't actually look at it till yesterday as I found that the "GERBER" inscription is written upside down!!! When I hold it, I'm the one who can read it but outdoor people would just think I bought a crap for $3 or something as it has this VERY OBVIOUS FLAW!!Ofcourse I can't return it back as I've traveled with it and I'm in Egypt now and I'm not gonna spend $30 for an international package to return something that cost me $18! But Still I've lost my money in this!!
