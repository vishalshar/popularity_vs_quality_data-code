I've tried several different spoons and these are only slightly better than average - not great.  First, they are only good for right-handed children.  One of my sons prefers to eat left-handed so he cannot use the spoon.  My other son does fine.  Second, despite product labeling to the contrary, the holes don't seem to keep food on the spoon better than those without.  The only real advantage I have seen after using them for a couple months is that the angle helps the child get the food to his/her mouth a little easier.  I think the spoons are a little pricey for only an average product.
