Sadly, I didn't realize that there are two types of the potette potties.  I have the Potette Plus.  It is amazing!  I love it!!  My daughter loves it.  And in a couple of years, I hope my son will love it.  Can't say enough wonderful things about the toilet!  It works on a big toilet great.  It folds up into a diaper bag.  It works as a stand alone.  Just a wonderful tool for toddlers and preschoolers.BUT - make sure you note which refill you are getting.  I gave it three stars because Amazon recommends buying the Kalencom Potette Plus & On the Go Potty Liner Re-Fills 10-Pack, along with the toilet and the product on this page.  Don't do it!  Check to see which toilet you have/are ordering and make sure you get the right refill.  This refill does NOT fit the Potette Plus.Lesson learned for me!
