I got these as a suggestion from another mom regarding potty training.  Overall, great concept.  My kids like them and think they're special, but can take even longer to apply to the seat than the ones that are already in the public stalls.  Here's my pros and cons for this particular potty topper:Pros:-nice graphics, kids like-easily compact and portable-affordable-keep kids bottoms (mostly) off the public potty-thick, good quality.  can be used for 2 kids to go one after the other.Cons:-there are 3 sticker tabs you remove if you want them to stick to the potty.  the tabs you remove are like saran wrap and impossible to get off at times.-these 3 sticker spots are meant to stick to the potty seat in 3 places.  i have used 1 out of 15 public seats where 2-3 stickers have stayed in place.-not flushable.  since the stickers don't stick, the seat falls in.  this most recently has happened, and i have since purchased a different potty topper ( i haven't used them yet, so tba on that review).Overall, if you need a potty seat solution, this is ok.  Frustrating in the long run, a relief short term.  But there are probably better.
