These bibs are super cute and soft and would be great, however I have no use for them now because they are too small and choke my 10 months old. They are "one size" like all or most bibs, but all other bibs fit my baby just fine with even a little more room to go. The bibs will only work on a newborn and newborns generally don't need bibs. Or I could use them as a cleaning rag. At least I only spent $3.
