I purchased all the Eddie Bauer teddy decor and this is a horrible product.  The sound was absolutely abysmal and out of tune.  I literally cringed when I heard it.  The little cloth umbrella was wrinkled and too small to fit on the pegs.  I ended up throwing this away and buying another mobile from a local store.
