First, this is marketed as 18+ months.  Unless your child has super powers, it will not be strong enough to pull the lever by themselves.  What good is a toy that a parent has to help use, while trying to avoid being doused in water?  Poor design.  Wait, let me rephrase that, horrible design.  Water has no way to get out of this bath toy.  The water accumulates in the bottom "tentacles" and guess what happens then? MOLD!  I can't believe this passes baby toy inspection, if the toy can potentially accumulate mold, its unacceptable.  DO NOT BUY.
