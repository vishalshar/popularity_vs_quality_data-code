The style of these leg warmers is very cute.  They have a layered look to them, with soft airy fabric. The size of the opening as well as the overall size of these legwarmers is much too large for my 10 month old.  I have purchased several other leg warmers that fit her well, but these are significantly larger.  I will save them for her to try again maybe when she's 4-5 years old. I think that if the size of the opening was smaller then she may be able to wear them next year.
