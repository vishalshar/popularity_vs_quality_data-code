This thermometer consistently reads 1 degree lower than our legacy glass-mercury oral thermometer, on healthy members of our family (and YES we removed the protective cover ha ha!).  As it claims to measure core temperature, which ought to be a degree higher still, that means it is off by at least two degrees at the normal temperature.  I have no idea what it would read if it measured a fever.  I expect it would under-report a fever and that makes it dangerous.I had read the scientific literature about the accuracy and reliability of temporal artery thermometers, and various instructions and recommendations for its proper use.  I chose this brand as they are the innovators and hold the key patents.  I consider myself to be fairly literate and technical with a scientific background.And yet no matter how we use it, it is consistently reading low.I give two stars rather than one because Amazon did issue a refund when I explained the problem.Still, I am disappointed, I wanted it to work.  Our Braun tympanic thermometer is fast and seems accurate, but it is unreliable with a wide range of successive readings.  Our glass-mercury is accurate and reliable, but slow and a hazard around young children.  Professional models like the Welch Allyn SureTemp  might be our only option despite its high price.Given its erroneous readings, I would be cautious buying this thermometer.  It is a matter of safety.PS If you disagree with my review, rather than down-vote, please leave a comment with advice.  I'd be happy to try and report back, since I have the thermometer anyway.
