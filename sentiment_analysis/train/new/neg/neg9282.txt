We went through two of these consoles in about six months, and the same thing happened to both: the Velcro straps ripped away from the fabric.  When we replaced the first one (ripped immediately upon install; I thought it was a fluke), the replacement that came was a slightly different design.  It looked like they redesigned to reinforce the straps against the kind of failure I had experienced. Well, the new design did last a few months longer than the first one before it also ripped, but there were still problems.The straps are too short to mount to the straight sections of the handle, so you are forced to mount it to the angled sections, even though the design of the console doesn't really accommodate that positioning. All the straps are the same length, and the sides of the console do not mirror the angle on the handle, despite how it looks in the photos. It constantly shifted on the handlebar no matter how loose or tight the straps were because of the awkward placement. It kept scooting toward me and getting in my way, and the resulting slack caused the cupholders to sag and spill my drinks. I am sure the added stress all the repositioning put on the straps is what caused them to eventually fail. The center zip pocket is inexplicably small, too.  It is deep, but I'm baffled as to why it is only about the size of a credit card, leaving a lot of empty real estate between it and the cupholders. I had to use the cupholders to hold anything more than a phone and a small keyring.Even if the consoles hadn't ripped, the zip pocket and the slippage would have made this only a 2-star product. There's really no excuse for BOB to have put out such a terrible product.
