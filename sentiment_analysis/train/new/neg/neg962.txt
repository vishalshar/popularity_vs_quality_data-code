While the "easy pour" feature is nice, the plastic itself is very poor quality. It makes the milk smell plasticy, is fragile and leaks. Also, the area you write on is in the same place the milk is so it makes it hard to write and you also run the risk of puncturing the bag unless you use a permanent marker or something similar. In my opinion, the nice easy pour feature isn't worth wasting the money on the bags. I reccommend Lansinoh brand bags!
