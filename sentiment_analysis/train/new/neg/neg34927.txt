Once they transition to toddler I'd say get a new mattress.-When I first used it, I hated that it was unbreathable and plastic coated, especially during the hot months. But a many accidents later I realized, it was the only choice.-It's a great, mattress for a baby/newborn, on the softer, but still supportive side.-I say upgrade once they can stand/walk, because it's light duty, not made for jumping and not all that resilient with the increased weight of a toddler over an infant.-This mattress has maintained it's status though with awards and 'Best Buy's through the last few years though, so I'm sticking with it.
