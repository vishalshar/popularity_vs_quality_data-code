I used these bibs for over a year now, I lost some at day care and some are still pretty clean.1) I like the size - my daughter is now over 2 and it still fits her neck and covers her chest well.2) If my daughter spills large amount of liquid, the bib gets soaked through, but it's okay for small amounts.3) The problem is the velcro. I think I read somewhere that it gets stuck to other clothes during washing. What actually happens is that the velcros don't stick to each other, they only stick to other clothes. So while my daughter is eating, the bib falls off quite often. But when I wash the bibs, even if I close the velcro before washing, when I take the laundry out they are always open and stuck to other clothes.
