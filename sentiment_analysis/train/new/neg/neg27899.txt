This is a fantastic looking toy and seems like it is made from quality materials. However, the first one we got worked for about 5 minutes before something went out in the wiring, even though I double checked to make sure that the battery cover was closed tightly and that the filter was clear. It ceased to work. Amazon replaced this one for us quickly. Then we had the second, which was a fun toy, but a couple of weeks ago stopped working. I thought that maybe it was because we had used it too much. So I replaced the batteries, and nothing. And of course just a little while after the return policy has expired. I fiddled with the batteries and cover a few times making sure all contacts were good and the cover was on tight, but we now have a non working toy... again. Fun toy, but shoddy electrical craftsmanship. Why pay this much for a few plastic boats?
