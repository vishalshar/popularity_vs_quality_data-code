I bought this off my registry so that my newborn would have a nice soft pad to lay on, but I soon realized that changing pad covers are totally impractical and I won't be getting a lot of use out of this. Babies leak fluids from every whole, and the changing pad (obviously) gets pretty dirty. Taking a cover on and off of it multiple times a week (if not multiple times a day) is impractical. It is much easier to just wipe down the plastic pad when it gets dirty.  I will admit that the heavy use of my changing pad has already lead to a rip in the center, and keeping it covered would have probably protected it better, but the changing pads are cheap enough that I can just toss this when it's beyond repair and buy another. Unless you are planning to stock up on changing pad covers so you can change it daily, there is really no need to have one.  I will say that this one did wash well and was both soft and absorbent.
