I am a busser in a very popular, high traffic restaurant and I see quite a bit of parents use the things. i have to say, nothing frustrates me more than trying to remove these things from the table top. I know this just sounds like an aggravated rant, but over half of the tables at the restaurant have one or more square residue outlines left from the sticky side of these place-mats. These marks aren't only frustrating for the restaurant staff, but are also unsightly for the guests of the restaurant. I know that this review wont matter to most who read it, but please, before you buy this,try to be conscientious of the restaurant and the table you're about to ruin.
