I received my package and the box was in good shape. So was the styrofoam inside. So it's as if they packed a broken piece! I tried calling to send it back or whatever but you gotta go through all sorts of stuff and wait. While waiting I realized it's a small piece and it may not even show. So I decided to try and put it together. It was ok to assemble. Instructions aren't very detailed. Not 100% easy and for the price I paid I would expect better quality. This piece should only be about 100$ max! I can buy a huge cabinet made of same material for cheaper. And the screws and nobs on the drawers either don't match or just won't tighten. Now I have wobbly nobs on the drawers and stripped screws. It also came with lots of scratches on some of the white. Gotta find a way to cover them. Oh and the broken piece worked but you can see it is broken. Hoping once I get baskets in the cubbys you won't see it as bad. Not satisfied at all!On the plus side, I did receive it way earlier than expected. Which I assume is thanks to Amazon.
