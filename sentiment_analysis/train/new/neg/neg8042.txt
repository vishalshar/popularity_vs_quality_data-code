My husband and I decided to purchase this system along with the bassinet attachment after seeing my sister-in-law use it with both of her kids. It seemed very convenient: the car seat could be transferred from the car to the stroller base and therefore you wouldn't have to mess with the baby (especially nice when the baby is sleeping). In addition it was VERY easy to fold. When our baby actually came these things turned out to be true, however, after 5 months of use we ended up selling it and investing in a lightweight stroller rather than moving on to the toddler seat attachment. First of all, the infant car seat is bulky and not universal; I barely ever made it out with the baby to do errand shopping because the car seat (unlike most infant car seats) wouldn't fit into the child seat area of any shopping cart. I had to place it into the actual shopping cart and it took up so much room that I couldn't shop for much more after that. In addition it was very heavy to get in and out of the shopping cart. It would only fit facing away from me in other shopping carts so that was a nuisance when trying to keep an eye on the baby: I would have to pull the shopping cart from the front rather than push it in order to see my baby. Furthermore, my baby outgrew it within 4 months. Granted my baby is in the 95 percentile for height and weight, thats still pretty ridiculous considering how much the system cost. $900 for a system that lasts only 4 months is nonsense. Compared to other infant car seats that my friends owned, this one seems to have a pretty low height/weight limit. Once my baby outgrew it I didn't feel like it was worth paying another couple hundred to upgrade to the toddler seat attachment. All things considered, this system looks great, folds super easily, and is pretty nice when the baby is very young, but there are plenty of other such systems (where the car seat transfers to a stroller base) that are a lot more affordable.
