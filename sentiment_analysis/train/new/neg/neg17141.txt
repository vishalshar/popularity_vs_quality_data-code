I got this for my infant and she like it, reminds me of an old fashion toy.  It winds up and plays music while the picture scrolls, there are grooves in the screen itself so it looks like the animals are moving.  Only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can hear the motor inside while it's playing.  Still a great item though.UPDATE:  It's been about a month since I got this toys and now it's defective, the screen gets stuck and now you can hear major clicking.
