I have used these for about 1 month (washed every 4-5 days). The stitching is coming out of so many of the wipes. Poor quality. For this I give them 2 stars.These are thick for heavy duty jobs (even though the stitching is not). Since I soak my wipes in a solution (instead of spraying a solution on the cloth for each use), the thickness is a drawback for me.  For 12 wipes I need about 2 cups of water to lightly dampen all of the wipes.
