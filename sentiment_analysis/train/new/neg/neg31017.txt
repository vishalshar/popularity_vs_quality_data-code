When this arrived I was thrilled. It is amazing what a difference  it makes to have your hands free while pumping. Using it with an Ameda Purely Yours.Only problem is I've barely had it over a week and the stitching is already coming apart where the clasp connects to the band. Pretty bummed because I really love the convenience of the PumpEase.
