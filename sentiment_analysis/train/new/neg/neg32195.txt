The bag appears black with neon english roses but it's brown. I am very dissapointed about the color discrepency but other than that the bag itself is perfect! I would give it 5 stars if it looked like the picture and if I had a chance to try it out but I am probably returning it due to the brown background :( i wish it was black. I don't like any other bag better. Sad to have to consider something else.
