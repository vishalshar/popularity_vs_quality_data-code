My husband and I were so excited when we got this at our baby shower.  But now that we are using it, we realize there are a few flaws.  If you have twin newborns, or two children under the age of two...PERFECT! But this stroller is NOT well paired with a child over 2 or 2 1/2 years old, particularly ones over 37" tall.  This is why:First, if you put the older child in the back seat, you must remove the adult cup holder tray if you don't want your child to rest their head on it.  Second, if you put your older child in the front seat, their legs are most likely not going to rest well on the foot rest, but will drag in-front of the wheels.  This is a HUGE danger! My 2 1/2 year old sat in the front at first and he was barefoot...BIG MISTAKE! His foot got stuck and he bled.Needless to say, he sits in the back seat now, while newborn sis takes the front. But of coarse, we had to remove the adult cup tray (bummer, no place for my keys and drinks now).  I definitely wouldn't buy this one again.  Unfortunately the pickings are slim out there for older kids.  Why is my older child still in a stroller you ask? He's autistic and won't stay with me if given freedom.  I guess these circumstances are rare, so most people are probably well suited for this stroller.  I don't know.  But that's my two cents anyway.
