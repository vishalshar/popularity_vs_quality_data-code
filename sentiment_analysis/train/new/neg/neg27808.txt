I love the looks of this mobile, it's absolutely adorable. However, the music leaves something to be desired.  It's a wind up music box that plays only one song.  I'm not familiar with mobiles and maybe that's how they're all supposed to be, but my friend has one that plays three different songs and has two sound levels.  Also, when you wind it up it only plays for a minute or two, not enough time for baby to fall asleep.  I used it for decoration only for awhile.  It completed the look I was going for in my nursery but I didn't get much use out of it.
