We love this cup and my daughter has been drinking water from it since age 6mo. Unfortunately the clear insert for the mouth piece falls out and the the cup leaks everywhere or water comes out too fast for baby. I purchased one for a friend and the same thing happened to theirs which was in arising for me. If they fixed this issue this would be 5 stars for sure.
