I love the idea of these and have bought a second one for my second daughter, but unfortunately these are just made too big in my opinion. Both of my children are in the <10th percentile, but the anklet just now started to fit on my 2 year old, and she wears a 4.5 shoe. I have to put them on under snug socks on both kids, and never get to leave them on consistently so it's hard to say if they are really getting any relief. I would not recommend these for any child under 6 months of age, and be aware of length before purchasing.
