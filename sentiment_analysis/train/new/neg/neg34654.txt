I bought this for my daughter a few months ago.  It does some things well, but needs some more features to truly do what the manufactures intended it to do.Let's start with what it does well.  The lights and sound are soothing.  I've found that it does help my baby go to sleep/back to sleep.  The manual start button is easy to press.  This device has helped me create a sleep routine that helps my daughter, currently five months old, fall asleep quickly, both at bed time and nap time.The main problem with this device is the implementation of the voice activiate feature.  The whole idea is that the sound of your baby fussing turns the lights and sound on and helps baby go back to sleep.  I've found this to be pretty effecitive if it turns on right away.  However, my daughter has to work up a pretty good wail before it turns on, which, in my opinion, rather defeats the purpose.  I can get up and manually turn it on when she starts to fuss, and she'll usually fall back asleep.  However, the whole point of getting something voice activated is so that I don't have to get up.On a lesser note, the attachment to the crib is rather clunky.  It certainly attaches securely and is not a problem safety-wise, but you have to remove the entire device in order to change the batteries, typically about once a month.  Again, this is a small thing, but for something that I need to take on and off easily, it is rather bothersome.Bottom Line:  I am glad I purchaced this light. It has helped with getting my daughter to sleep.  However, if they came out with one that had sensitivity adjustment for the voice activated feature, I'd buy it in a heart beat.
