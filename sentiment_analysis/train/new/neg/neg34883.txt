My son threw this on the ground like most 15 month old boys do and it dented so bad it would not sit up without falling down. I bought this because a friend told me she liked it. Well I have since bought him 2 kleen kanteen sippy cups and he throws them so hard and they barely dent. I wish they used stronger metal.
