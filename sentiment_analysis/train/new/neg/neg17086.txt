I thought these gowns would be like the Carter's layette gowns I have purchased for years.  They are very small.  The size is NB for newborn, weight range 5-8 lbs.  They used to be 0-3 months, weight range up to 11 lbs., which was a much better size.  Even a large baby could wear them and smaller babies could wear them for several months.  Bring back the old sizing, Carter's!
