I wanted to like this bc it was cute and I didn't have to waste bags but I really don't like it.  If you put chips in it by lunch time they are stale.  I kept wondering why all of a sudden my daughter wasn't eating her chips at lunch and she told me she didn't like them anymore so I tried them well no wonder they were yucky and stale.
