I received my order and immediately decided to put it together. It looks great and quality seems to be very good, however, one of the metal frame bars that should have clicked indicating that the frame is put together and secure (before you put the fabric on it) didn't click and no matter which way you turn or try to insert it just didn't click and get connected properly.So, we figured that it was a defect from the manufacturer. The price I paid was very low and I decided not to return it since once you put the fabric seat on, it seemes to be pretty stable and doesn't appear to cause a problem, but still it was a little disappointing and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of shipping it back and calling the customer service, etc.
