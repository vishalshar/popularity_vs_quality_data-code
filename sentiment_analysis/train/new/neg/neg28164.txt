I got these cups for my 6 month old baby girl.  Just to be sure, I decided to try it myself first.  After that, I decided I will never give this to my daughter.  The whole design is flawed in that it's very hard to actually get the water out.  The small cross shaped slit to get air back into the cup will not open.  So after 3 hard sucks, the cup becomes a vacuum and no more water will come out no matter how hard you suck.  I even cut a hole in the spot and it's still fairly hard to get water out.  I don't plan to actually give this to my daughter to use.
