I purchased a berry teether locally. It was such a hit, I decided to order more online. Unfortunately, I got 2 banana monkeys.The vibrations only activate if the banana is chewed on in specific place (wow that sounds bad written out), but the berry is activated no matter where it's chewed. I wish they were more consistent.
