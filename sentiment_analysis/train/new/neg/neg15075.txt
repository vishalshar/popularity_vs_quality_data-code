I generally like Green Sprouts products and am happy that these have sterilized water inside vs. some sort of mysterious and possibly unsafe gel, but the outer skin is so overfilled with water that they're very firm and not invitingly chewy for my teething 5 month old baby. My son bores easily with these, even when chilled. I also received a markedly different shape of teether than pictured here. They look like thin donuts with 5 equally sized nubs on one side, nothing like little hands. I would have happily overlooked this if the teethers had been more functionally successful.
