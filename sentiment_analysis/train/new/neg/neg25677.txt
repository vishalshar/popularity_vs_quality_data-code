My husband and I purchased this monitor for two reasons.  One b/c we are expecting another little one in April and two b/c we wanted something to watch our toddler with while we transition him to his "big boy bed".  I purchased the monitor based on the reviews from Amazon and found that the product didn't meet our expectations.  I mounted the camera in a corner of my sons room in order to get a good view of his bed and some of the floor.  Unfortunately the night vision was so shotty that I couldn't make out where is was in his bed.  This may be due to the fact that Levana says the night vision is best when the camera is no more than 10 feet from what you want to view.  I did try to just set the camera on his dresser which was approximately 8 feet from his bed, but again the night vision wasn't very clear.  I also noticed that there was some static pulse like feed back in the sound portion of the monitor.  We do have wireless internet and cordless phones so I am not sure if this may have been the culprit.  I also didn't like the fact that there wasn't a button to turn on the camera only the switch on the side of the unit which was not terribly difficult to find, but just not at easy to use.  My husband and I ended up going with a summer infant monitor that had better overall video quality.  The night vision on the Levana may work just fine for closer observation of little ones in cribs, however it didn't meet our needs for our toddler's safety.
