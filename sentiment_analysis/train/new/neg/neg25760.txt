This chair has this plastic tray that cant be removed. There is the tray that snaps on that you would put food and other items on and that tray has a removable part to make clean up easy. All that is fine. The odd part is that when the main try that you expect your highchair to have is removed there is anothe small plastic tray that can't be removed that makes it so that when the chair is on the lowest level your child can not get themself in and out of the chair. My 21 month old loves to climb in and out of her chair when it is on the low setting. She thinks she is helping. With this odd part there is no way she can do that with this chair and it makes it hard to get her in and out because she has long legs. I would not keep this chair if I had known this before my husband set it up and started using it and got rid of the box. The hard tray also scrapes her legs. I hate this chair
