I got this product after reading all of the previous reviews despite all of the negative ones. I knew going into the purchase that I may have to do some maneuvering with the air spout as previous reviewers stated. This thing is not worth the aggrevation!! I placed tape over the air spout behind yellow blow holes (tricky as it is) and the thing worked 30% of the time to blow a few bubbles. Most of them popped before coming out and was a big disappointment after all of the hassle. Save your money and buy the babies R us brand equivalent....it has worked just fine witout manipulation.
