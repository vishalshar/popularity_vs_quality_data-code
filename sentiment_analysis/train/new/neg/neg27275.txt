This reusable liner fits the Kalencom Potette Plus perfectly! It's great to have a non-disposable option for the potty.It doesn't clean as easily as hard plastic--stains and odors linger more readily unless you thoroughly wash the liner. (I usually use a baby wipe to clean our hard plastic potties.) It also doesn't collapse flat to travel easily. It sort of folds and rolls, but it's lumpy and springy. I'm still willing to use it instead of bags on trips!
