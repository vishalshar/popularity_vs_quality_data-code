I guess I'm not sure what all the fuss is about these. They cost A LOT for what they are, but because of the rave reviews, I bought them for our newborn. They are, indeed, soft, but they are small and not anything particularly special. We have wash cloths from target that were a fraction of the cost and work just as well. If you're looking to splurge on your new baby, I wouldn't recommend you do so on these, but if you have money to blow, go for it. Definitely nice that they are organic, but they're not life changing by any means.
