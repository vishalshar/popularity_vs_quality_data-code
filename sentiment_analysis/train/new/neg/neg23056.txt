This pump is good only if your planning to use it for couple of times a week or so. I am a working mom and bought this pump to use it everyday. After a month and half, it stopped working. All it pumped was air. This product is not meant for everyday use. i would rather spend more and buy Medela or Ameda that lasts for atleast 10 months. I have been using Medela after this evenflo pump fell apart and have no complaints at all.
