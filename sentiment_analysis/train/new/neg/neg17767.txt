I bought these for my sister. While the diapers are soft, they look like diapers my grown non-organic children had. They also came wrapped in two industrial plastic bags. I thought the point was to get away from that? This may be a benefit-I bought these to make a diaper cake. After rolling all of the diapers and putting them back into the box, I noticed both sides of the box had ripped almost all the way down to the bottom. So the box is not durable. I hope the diapers are more durable for the price.
