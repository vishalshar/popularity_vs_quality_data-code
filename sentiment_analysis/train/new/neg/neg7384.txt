I don't know how all of the other reviewers got this to work because it wouldn't work for me.  I put it together exactly as the directions stated and it would not turn as it's supposed to.  The music and light worked but there was absoloutely no motion, just the minute sound of the motor turning,which didn't spin the birds.  Would have been great if it did work!
