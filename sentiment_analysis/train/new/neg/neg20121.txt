I love the concept of this item but these aren't made very well. They will melt very easily in the dishwasher. First of all, I needed something for my infant son to take his cereal out of. I wanted a nipple already safely made to do this, without me having to put holes in his bottle nipples. And I wanted a container to strain it so he wouldn't choke. These were fine for the first few weeks except I wish they were larger and would hold more. He would suck one down in no time. And they didn't hold up well at all. This company could make these more durable and easier to put together. It's confusing putting them together when your in a hurry with a screming child. There aren't many companies that make these and this company could make a fortune if they would make the quality better. I finally, put bigger holes in the nipples of his baby bottles and we made it thru the reflux stages. But, if your in a bind and need these for a few weeks or a month. Get about 4 to six of them so they will be there if you need them. They won't last long but it's all that's on the market. Non of the Y cut nipples help. I just put holes in mine with trial and error until we got it right.
