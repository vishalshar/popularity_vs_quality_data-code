I bought one of these gates for the top of my stairs and the bottom. The gate at the top of the stairs automatically closed for about a good 4 months but now if it is left open to far it stays open. The gate at the bottom of my stairs has never automatically closed. I even purchased another one and replaced the gate downstairs thinking it was defective. I don't know why one would work and the other wouldn't. It was disappointing to me. The whole reason I wanted an automatic close was because I knew my older children would never remember to close it. you also need to lift up on the gate in order to open it. I've noticed my 1 and a half year old is very close to being able to do it himself. There should be a latch or button of some kind in addition to lifting up on the door.
