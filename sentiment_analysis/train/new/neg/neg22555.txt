We bought this clock for our daughter's room exactly one year ago. It worked fine for the first six months or so, but then started having problems. The time was not accurate and would continuously stop working. We changed the batteries several times and reset the clock/time, and it would work for a few weeks and then stop working again. Finally, last week it stopped working altogether and we cannot get the hands to work. For the price we paid, we did not expect to be having to buy a new clock for our daughter so soon.
