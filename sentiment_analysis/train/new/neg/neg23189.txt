Didn't have nearly the space that I thought it would to hold items & also the crease on top where the green meets the pink has separated & I've only had it a week, should have bought the Winnie the Pooh one like I did for my other 2, that has held up way better... 13 & 5 years later... This one is constructed very poorly
