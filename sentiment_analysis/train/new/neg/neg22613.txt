The stroller is very good quality and you can see right out of the box that it is a piece that will last you a while.I do have two problems:1: the stroller does no fold up very well. It stays very large at fold up. Unless you have a full/large SUV you're gonna have a problem trying to bring this thing along.2: This is my major problem. We bought the stroller to be used with our Graco Snugride 35 carseats. Contours sells adapters to attach the carseats but I feel they are a very poor design. Basically the adaptors are metal bars that the carseats sits in between/on top of and is secured only by one strap. The car seats do not click into place or hold on in any way themselves to this adapter. The strap just goes over the carseats directly where the baby sits. It has to secure in the lowest point cutting into your baby's stomach. It is quite uncomfortable for the child an does not feel very secure. My children are 7lbs. Now an there is no way they will be able to fit under that strap much longer. I am surprised with how great the quality is that Contours did not take time to think how a child would be able to sit in this seat with the strap.I would not recommend this stroller for application with Carseats. We are saving this stroller for when the kids are larger because it is going to be great when they can sit in the actual seats but had to buy the Graco twin stroller for now.
