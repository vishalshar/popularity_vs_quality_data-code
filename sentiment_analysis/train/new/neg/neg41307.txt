They are pacifiers and they do their job--I have nothing either glowingly positive or amazingly negative to say about them. That said, I would not have purchased these given the price point since I only received two instead of four. Be aware that 2-count doesn't mean two packages with 2 pacifiers each. It means two pacifiers total. I would not have purchased these had that been clear. When I went to give seller feedback to that effect, it gave me a message that the product is currently under review and not available for me to leave feedback. I hope that means that for future customers, this item will be more clearly labeled as to quantity shipped.Unrelated: As some people have noted, moisture can get sometimes inside the nipple of Nuk pacifiers (as with most any pacifier) but I sterilize them once a day in the microwave in a sterilizer bag, squeeze out any moisture, and let them air dry. I've had no problems mold, getting them clean, etc.
