Out of this kit, I use one item - the nail clippers.  The cute little blue case is great, but - the thermometer takes two long to read the temperature.  Invest instead in a Safety First High Speed Thermometer - it takles like 10 seconds to get an accurate rectal temp.  The medicine thingy is too big and most medicines come with syringes or little droppers which work better.  The nasal aspirator does have a strong enough suck.  The big green one you get from the hospital works much better - find a way to get more of these.  The rattle is cute, but I have toys that I already keep in the diaper bag.  Don't buy this - buy everything separately and make a little kit yourself of good quality and necessary items for your baby on the go.
