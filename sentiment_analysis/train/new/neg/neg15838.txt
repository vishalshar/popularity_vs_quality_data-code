I was extremely disappointed with the product.  It does not look lile the item on the picture.  It was deformed and it had what seemed to be nail polish stains on the side (I took pictures).  It is considered a collectible item so I was willing to pay the hefty price since my daughter wanted it badly.  Not what we expected.  I returned the item right away.
