My fault for not reading the description close enough, but I didn't realize these weren't Medela (probably like everyone who buys this product, all my time and attention is being spent on a baby). I'm fine with the one-piece design since I knew what flange size to get, but the flange is shorter than the Medela brand which can cause some pinching. Maybe it's not a common issue b/c I couldn't use the Freemie cups at all b/c of the flange length, but I couldn't find many reviews on those that talked about the pain I was having; if you don't have a length issue those cups would be great since you can pump with your shirt on). Anyway, these flanges are alright but I have had some milk back-up in the tubes and, as mentioned, the length is shorter than Medela brand. I bought them to have an extra set, so I just try to use my original set most of the time.
