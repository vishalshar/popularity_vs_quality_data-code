This warmer is great. Very convenient and easy to use. Makes cloth wipes simple and makes you feel like a mom that has it all together. I will admit its just a luxury not a necessity. You have to constantly be on top of it and fill it up what feels like everyday. It does keep the wipes quite warm though which is awesome. My main regret about this product (which is why only 3 stars) is the light that stays on while plugged in. I can see while having a newborn the light would be awesome because it illuminates the room so you can nurse and change diapers at night without blinding everyone in the room. But for me, my son was about 9 months and didn't need diaper changes at night and i had to go in the room one night and was shocked how bright the room was! the light literally lights up the entire room. And there is no off switch! i started throwing a heavy blanket over it but later worried that something would catch fire because its plugged in and warm. Then I decided to just unplug it right before bed but in the morning didn't like frigid cold wipes when i needed them because i would sometimes forget to replug it in in the morning (plus it takes 30 min to heat all the wipes up). Finally my husband was a genious and cut the wire that was the light. So now there is no light and it still does the job! I love it so much and it's really handy when you use cloth wipes. After fixing the light problem it became a 5 star product but I'll keep the rating because of the hassel. It's extremely worth it if you want to cut the light wire lol. And it looks perfect still- just doesn't light up.
