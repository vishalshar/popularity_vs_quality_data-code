We have had our son in a Britax roundabout since he was 3 months old.  We LOVED this seat. We were happy with the reviews and he was comfortable and safe.  We recently purchased a Britax Marathon since he is now 3 years old.  He is able to reach down to the release and easily pull up on it and can make his straps loose without me even knowing he is doing it which is extremely unsafe !!The roundabout has a push button that he is unable to reach and press so that worked to keep him safe.  I went to the Britax website and saw that this is a common complaint,  WHAT????  It seems that we are to teach our children not to unlatch it by themselves...  I have an overactive toddler and I cannot watch him while I am driving.  I wanted a carseat instead of a booster so he could not unbuckle himself. I am now looking for a different brand reluctantly.
