We discovered Grobags when my son was a year old and could easily get himself out of other brands of sleep sacks (especially those with snaps at the shoulders). I have been really happy with most of the the Grobags that we own. They are nice and warm and it's great that they have some designs that don't have the shoulder snaps. In the past, I've found that they hold up well through a lot of use and frequent washings. This one, however, pilled immediately - on the outside and inside - the very first time I washed it (gentle cycle) before the first use. We're not just talking a little bit of pilling, but it almost looks as if it's shedding fabric pills. I don't know if we somehow got a dud but for the price, I would expect much better.
