I was really excited about using these with my son who is between a 2t and a 3t due to his height.  Unfortunately I did not realize these do not work on pants without loops, so they will not work on a lot of his pants.  I just looked thru the product description again and I think they could have made that fact more clear.  I ordered the add-on clips for loop-less pants and I will see how it goes and possibly revise this review at a later date.
