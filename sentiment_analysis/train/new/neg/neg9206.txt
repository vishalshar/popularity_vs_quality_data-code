First of all, this does not convert into a sleep sack. The legs are very long making it look huge out of the package, but it did fit my 12lb 3 month old with the legs cuffed up although it is a bit snug in the thighs for her. Keep in mind that their arms will be inside making it appear larger than it is and try it on. The separate legs are great for putting the baby to sleep in the swing, but really inconvenient for diaper changes. Because the legs are narrow and the suit is quite warm, I wind up putting the baby in only a onsie under it which is fine for night sleep, but a pain to strip her down for each nap.On the plus side, there is absolutely no way she is sneaking her little arms out of this one. Overall this is fair. I see that woombie makes a legless summer onsie sleep swaddler that contains only the arms, has the mesh on the front for ventilation and closes at the crotch (so it could go over her pants vs. having to take them off). I think that would make way more sense and I would rather have gotten that.
