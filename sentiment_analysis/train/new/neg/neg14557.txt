We have been purchasing these tables for years.  The tables are better than we've found elsewhere and provide the kids a great table to place their drinks, their food, books, etc.  We are fortunate, however, that we can afford to replace these when they fail, which is frequent.  We have two minivans and have two of them in each car for our 8 and 6 year old.  If you have children who lock and unlock the table (you need to raise and lower as the kids get in and out of their seats), they will not be gentle enough to assure they remain usable for long periods of time (6-12 months).  The locking mechanism are made of VERY SMALL interlocking PLASTIC teeth.  If these teeth were metal, this would be the best table hands down.  I would pay an extra $20-$30 for the better design.  I might have resisted the first time at the steep price; however, now that we have used them and replaced them as much as we have, I recognize their great utility, yet also know how badly the locking mechanism is engineered.  BOTTOM LINE: if you have younger kids and you will be the one locking and unlocking the table in place, then it should last a while.  However, once your kids are able to get in and out of their own seats (booster seat age), they will most likely lock and unlock on their own and not be careful enough for the tables to last longer than 6-12 months). We have tried other options, but none are as good as these, despite the flaw in this locking mechanism.  If we had a tighter budget, I would be much more unhappy.  Hope this review helps.
