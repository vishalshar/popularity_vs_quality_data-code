This stays in place with the stickers it comes with until your child gets old enough to pull on it.  Your 1 year old can pull these off and they all seem to do that.  You can get much stronger glue or adhesive but then you will ruin your furniture once you try and remove these.  I like the concept very much as corners can be scary if your kid lands on it but first, these things need to stay on.
