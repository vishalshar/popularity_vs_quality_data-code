I can only give this 3 stars due to the "fit". I have about a 2 inch gap on both sides of the crib. I had to roll up blankets to fill in the gaps which is not safe at all! I have the Graco Travel Lite Portable Mini Play hard so I don't understand why it doesn't fit snugly.  I used it first when I was using the bassinet feature of the crib which made the crib area smaller and the mattress did fit in snugly then, but unfortunately it made the mattress too tall and covered all the mesh sides that are there to keep the baby from suffocating. The other big down side is getting sheets to fit. The only place I could fine sheets to fit the mattress was here on amazon. And they are not cheap. If you are going to order this crib mattress then order the sheets with it, you won't find them anywhere else.
