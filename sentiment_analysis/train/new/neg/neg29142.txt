Had this lasted through even one child, I would have given it five stars.  It is nicely padded and I like the contour of the pad.  The problem is that my son wasn't even 16 months old before it started to tear in the center of the pad.  Having the pad ripped, especially right in the area where the diaper is put on is not sanitary...now I need to buy another one.  If this was a $10 pad, that would be ok but for the price, it should last through at least one child.  I won't buy this brand again.
