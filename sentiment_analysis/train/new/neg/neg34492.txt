This is a cute little book with a classy, gender neutral look and has exactly the content I was looking for in a baby book -- places to record weight, development, include photos and so on. So, here's why I give it only three stars. When it arrived there were some light smudges on the front cover. If you purchase, keep in mind that the cover is off white and will stain easily. This isn't an album you'll want your child looking through as he/she grows up, unless you're not concerned with it getting fingerprints all over the cover. So, I got over the small smudges that the book came with and looked inside. The most irritating thing is that printed at the bottom of almost each and every page is a "photos memory page suggestion." I don't mind the suggestion, but why must it be printed on every single page? I intend to put something over all of these unnecessary reminders throughout the book (such as "include sonogram photo." Really? Do I need this suggested? Of course I will put the sonogram photo in the album?!).  Why not include a little instruction pamphlet with these suggestions instead of marring the inside of the album with this information on EVERY page? I also didn't find the ink print all that easy to use. You're only given four cards to try and get it right. We finally got a foot print we were satisfied with (I used by own card stock once we went through all the cards provided with the book), but it's still smeared slightly. On the other hand, it's nice that you don't end up with ink all over your baby's foot, and of course -- even with smears -- the footprint is adorable. If I had to do it all over again, I might purchase a different book. One that's not going to smudge as easily on the cover and without unnecessary suggestions from the manufacturer on each page. I could probably find similar content in another album. At the same time, I like the mix of scrapbooking and record-keeping this book has to offer. It's got a great look.
