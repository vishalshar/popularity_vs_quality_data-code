I loved the way this toy looked and was designed but today my 9 month old had this wooden ring in his mouth and this tiny part next to him was wet so he must have had it in his mouth as well. It is secondly a choking hazard. I bought this for Christmas and today is Jan 2. This is the first bad review I've ever given on Amazon, but I feel like this could be extremely dangerous to an infant or toddler should the same thing happen to another child. It is disappointing because it is a cute and fun toy but now it's going in the trash.
