This toy is dangerous!  The screws are screwed into very soft wood and they are short so my baby just playing with it was able to rip off one of the wooden pieces along with the screw which I found on the floor.  Luckily I saw it right when it happend but he could have choked on the screw!  Very dangerous toy and not durable enough for a toddler.  I examined it after it happened and realized I could easily pull on all the wooden pieces and without much effort rip them off the toy along with the screws!  Again screws are short and screwed into very soft wood.  Do not buy this toy for a child under 3!  Even an older child can be injured by playing with a screw so I personally would not buy it for any child!
