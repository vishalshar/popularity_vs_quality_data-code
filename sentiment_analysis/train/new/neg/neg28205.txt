Before purchasing this item, please check with your safety services division in your state regarding the use of this product with carseats.  I purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm - but after I received it I was told by the Director of Safety Services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats.  I also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well. Instead, I returned it and purchased a Kiddopotamus, which is shearling-lined and zips but fits OVER the carseat.  The Bundle-Me item is perfect for strollers, but NOT for use with a carseat.  While I want to keep my baby warm, I think it is MUCh more important that she be safe and secure in her seat.
