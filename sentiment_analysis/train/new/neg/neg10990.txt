Horrible accessory. The Peg car seat does not even fit on the stand. There is a crossbar missing to attach the car seat. However, it does work for the Skate bassinet. Also, the piece is made of cheap plastic, which makes it unstable - not a very appealing feature when it comes to the safety of any newborn baby.
