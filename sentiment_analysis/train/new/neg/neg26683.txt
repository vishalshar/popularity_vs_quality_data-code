I keep purchasing these accidentally when I mean to buy the nylon ones.  The nylon Dappis are great - same fit, only softer, more breathable, and seem to hold in the urine equally well.  When we use the vinyl ones, if my little guy is sweaty, his skin is very damp when I take them off.  I would never use the for a longer outing during the summer because he is prone to diaper rash.  Other than the material, they are fine.  They fit over gerber training undies, however you do need to be sure to arrange the fabric so the undies are completely under the legholes (no big deal, but it takes more time).
