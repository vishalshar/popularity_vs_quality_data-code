If I could give 0 stars I would. This is the worst piece of furniture that I ever bought. Do yourself a favor and listen to the 1 stars reviews here. This thing is a joke. First, it was a nightmare to assemble. I'm a product designer and I'm pretty good at things like this obviously. This furniture is poorly designed and the whole thing felt apart in few months. The finishes are also poor and the sharp corners caused my baby's feet to get cuts in them!!!! I wish I was a lawyer because I would sue this company for selling such an insecure product for babies. It's wobbly, the door felt off 20 times, and after fixing it 20 times it's unfixable now, so the shelves are exposed and now that my baby can walk this is a huge hazard. One time I tried to move it to grab something my baby threw in the back of it and the feet simple cracked in pieces because the material is poor. Also! Yes, you can't reach throught the back of it on the floor because it has a back piece that goes all the way to the ground, so everything your baby throws back there gets stuck, then you have to move the furniture to get all of the stuff but I need to get my husband together everytime to lift both sides of the furniture, and if I try to do by myself the parts keep cracking and my floor gets super, extremely scratched, again from the poor material and finishes.Resuming, research a little more, spend a little more, get something nicer!!! I'm stuck with this crap and after having the baby I still didn't have time to trash this. Yes, that's what I said, I need to throw this in the dumpster.
