Like the other person said it is pretty hard to get them to stand up on thier own. I wouldn't buy this thinking you can actually go penguin bowling. I will say though I go this for my daughter when she was 3 months and is 6 months now. She still loves chewing on them and exploring each one. They are pretty cute and each one has a different activity.
