Received this promptly and was happy about that, but the tail was broken and it was not the quality I was expecting.  My husband saw it and said he hoped I did not spend over one dollar for it!  He works with wood and knows quality.  Sorry, but that's the way it goes.  I didn't have the nerve to tell him the actual cost!
