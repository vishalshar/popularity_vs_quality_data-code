I've been bathing my son in the infant tub inside the regular bathtub for the past month or so.  I figured it was time to switch to a larger baby-tub so I bought this.  To be honest, I'm a little disappointed - i thought the inside part (where he actually sits) would be larger.  I actually think this is SMALLER than the infant tub and more annoying to use since he turns around in it.Also, I thought the duck's head would be a nice back-rest but it's exactly the opposite.  If I put him with his back towards the duck-head, he ends up slouching and leaning forward because of the shape.I like that the tub has a drain in it, and the plastic material seems to be good (it's the same thickness as an inflatable pool) but that's about it.It has a suction cup on the bottom to hang it up to dry but even when it's completely dry, the suction cup isn't strong enough to hold it up.Oh, and as others mentioned, the "white hot" indicator is useless.  The water can be lukewarm or even a little on the cold side and it'll show that it's too hot.Too bad.
