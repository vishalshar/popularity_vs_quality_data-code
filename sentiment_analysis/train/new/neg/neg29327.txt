*UPDATED REVIEW APRIL 20,2015*After going through 2 of these ducks in a 7 month period, I am updating my review to 3 stars. I LOVE the concept, look and practicality of this tub (as stated in my original review), but I have had 2 duck tubs deflate on me in a short period of time. It started off small and barely noticeable and within 1-2 months of owning this tub, it ends up being more and more deflated between uses. We are now on our 2nd tub and to the point of having to blow it up every night prior to use. I could tasted Munchkin and didn't receive any response. Disappointed, because we loved our duck tub! Will not be repurchasing.I purchased this duck tub as an alternative to the infant style bath tub that our little one was getting too big for.  There are some really great features to this tub!Likes:-Size is great for little ones.  Allows baby to sit up and play with toys without toys floating away.-Textured bottom to help prevent baby from slipping all around.-Adorable duck style is fun for baby.-Temperature marker on the bottom to signal if water temp is too hot.-Easily inflatable.-Suction cups on bottom ensure the duck won't slip around in tub.My only complaint is that after a couple months of owning, it seems to be losing its ability to stay inflated.  We use this tub nightly and now each night it has to be partially reinflated.  It's also getting worse as time goes on which likely means we'll have to purchase a replacement soon.I do recommend this tub for anyone needing a bath tub option for a little one that is too big for their infant tub, but not quite ready to sit solo in the adult tub.  It's a great price and the perfect choice!
