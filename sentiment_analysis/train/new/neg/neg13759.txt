The nice thing about this cup is its cap and straw. The straw can be folded and be kept clean especially in transport such as a field trip or shopping. However, the same cap and straw made the cup essentially useless. The anti-leaking valve is badly designed. Sucking the straw needs great effort. I cut the valve to open it a little wider. This makes sucking easier, but the anti-leaking valve is broken.The anti-leaking valve needs to be carefully cleaned for it can be dirty after some uses.
