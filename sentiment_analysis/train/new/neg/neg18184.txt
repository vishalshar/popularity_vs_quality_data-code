I was really excited to find this set when I was pregnant with my son.  It is really cute and can grow with him.  However, in hindsight, I don't think that buying a bedding set is really worth it.All you really need is a bumber and a few good quality sheets.  This set is very pricey, and you don't really need the diaper stacker, crib skirt, or quilt.  You can buy the valance and sheet separately if you want them (but one sheet is $17!).  The sheet in this set tore after just a few washings, and then again after I had sewn it.  We've had much better luck with some cheaper sheets that had elastic all the way around, not just at the head and foot.Instead of buying the whole set, I would recommend getting:4 mix-and-match crib sheets1 bumpersome All-Star accessories to decorate the room (the valance is cute, and we have the lamp, too)All in all, the set is cute but not worth the money.  Go with some mix-and-match pieces instead and get sports-related accents.
