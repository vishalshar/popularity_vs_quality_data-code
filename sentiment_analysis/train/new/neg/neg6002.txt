I love the design the cartoons on it, but I do not like the material. It is not the cotton-soft & smooth kind, but more of a polyester-rough kind.We just have a wooden infant / toddler cot, so the strings cant be attached to the sides as two of my cot sides are just plain wooden ones. I believe this wld go great for convertible kinds only.
