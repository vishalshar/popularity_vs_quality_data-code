This set was purchased for our 3 year old son for Christmas 2015. My rating is based on it. We were disappointed by its function. Although our son is crazy about building machines, he says the spoon is silly and impossible to eat with. I would say that the product is designed for older children.PLUS:- Great idea- Quality materials- Made in USACONS:- Cutlery have short handles. It means that spoon does not hold in its place (marked by arrow and "Spon") and flips over the edge of the plate. (You can see it in the product photo - the spoon hardly stays in the plate.) Our little son cannot hold cutlery properly. When construction machines are "in the field" and try to push food down by bulldozer's track, his fingers and the handle is grubby from food. The handle of the fork lays in food right from the start.- Protruding letters on the rim of the plate are hard to clean.- In reality, the product is a lot smaller than it looks from the photos (and than the price suggests).- Our son is dirty when eating with this product (because of the short handles etc.), he is not enthusieastic about it, our nervousness is rising and it affects eating habits.
