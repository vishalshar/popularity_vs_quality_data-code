I don't know what I did wrong but I placed it exactly how it's shown (it's not rocket science) on my daughters new diono car seat and it did not work! It fit perfect in the diono yet she had an accident and when I lifted it out the seat was wet! I believe it's because the liquid beads up and probably rolled to the open sides of the piddle pad, who knows but I was very disappointed! Will attempt again just in case but so far not happy!
