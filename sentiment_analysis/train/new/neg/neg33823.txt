They seem a bit on the cheap side.  The gate itself seems pretty good but the lags that come with it to install it into the wall are not strong enough.  There is always too much pressure on the adapter and the bracket that holds the gate in place.  If you put pressure on the gate (a couple lbs the wrong way) the bracket and adapter will most likely come out of the wall.  This happened twice and now I have holes in my wall from a gate I do not want.  I would most definitely not recommend this gate as a safety gate.
