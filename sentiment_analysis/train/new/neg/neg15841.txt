I will say this upfront, the Dreambaby sunshade is a complete waste of money. I had spent time researching the sunshades for our baby and decided to purchase both these and Brica Mega White Hot sunshade. as we have an SUV and needed wider sunshadesWhere do I start, the worst part is that the suction cups refuse to stay on even after just an hour. It's also very poorly made, with exposed shade material on the roller, the clips do not swing out of the way if you decide to use suction cups and the attachment looks like it could break at any time.I highly recommend the Brica Mega White sunshade as I purchased it at the same time and tried it on the other window, and it has been holding strong for a week now (as opposed to Dreambaby that didn't even stay on for an hour). and the design of the Brica is so much nicer, the material for the shade is actual fabric, the roller is fully enclosed in plastic so it looks nice and the shade is protected when retracted and the clips swing out of the way.I hope this helps.BRICA Mega White Hot Sun Rollershade
