I just received my order for MobiCam DXR Touch baby Monitor .  The camera will not turn on at all!  After plugging the camera into an outlet, the red light turns on, but no matter how long or short I hold down the power button, the camera will not power on and the light will not turn green, making the whole system unusableWorse thing about it is, I contacted Mobi to ask them how to resolve the issue, and they told me I could ship it back to them and once they receive, they will send a replacement.  But they want me to pay for the shipping!  For a $250-$300 product that did not work out of the box, they want me to pay for the shipping for an unusable product!  Rep on the phone said that's what the owner of the company wanted.  It's bad enough they would not ship a new product right away and I'd have to wait the 2 weeks for the turnaround for me to ship, them to receive, process, and then ship another out, but they won't even cover the shipping.Funny thing, is there is a note in the box that asks for you not to contact the seller if something is wrong and to contact Mobi directly.  Guess they want to hide all the flaws from the Mobi dealers, yet Mobi refuses to fix the problem.Very disappointed.***UPDATE*** 10/01/13I contacted the seller, and they were nice enough to ship a second MobiCam DXR Touch baby monitor to replace the defective 1st one.  I decided to give Mobi company a second try since I had never owned their products before.  I shouldn't be surprised, but the 2nd one I received is defective as well.  The sound will barely come through the monitor.  Even with the volume set on 9, the highest setting, and the camera volume set on the highest setting.  In order to hear anything, I have to literally hold my ear to the back of the monitor...and that is in a silent room.  This does not make for a good baby monitoring system.After 2 failed products, I would strongly advise against purchasing this product.
