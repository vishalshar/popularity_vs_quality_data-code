We needed a narrow car seat so that we could put three car seats side by side for our 5 year old, 3 year old, and infant.  This one is nice and slim.  It seems to have good cushioning.  It has a pad that is supposed to function as a "spill guard" that the child sits on.  However, this spill guard doesn't snap or velcro down - it basically floats free.The strap for the bottom buckle doesn't adjust.  There is only one slot for it, unlike on other car seats.  This means that as your child grows you won't be able to adjust the strap (although the shoulder straps do have several different heights).
