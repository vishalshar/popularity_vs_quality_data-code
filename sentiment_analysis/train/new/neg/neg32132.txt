Now I am stuck with three refill bags and no dispenser. Amazon needs to update the description. If you're expecting the dispenser, don't. As a review of the actual product, I used these in my diaper bag a few years ago and I love the "make your own size" flexibility to hold diapers or soiled clothes, etc. I want to use them again if I can find the dispenser for sale somewhere.
