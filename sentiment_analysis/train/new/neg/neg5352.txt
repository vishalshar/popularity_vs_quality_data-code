My sister-in-law recommended me Orbit Baby, because they used g2 for two kids. I had heard good things about g2, but unfortunately not g3.I had replaced three g3 already. Three have clicking sound next to green break release button. My third g3 was purchased at Buy Buy Bay ( without this problem); however, in three weeks of use, the front wheels get stuck and refuse to go forward. It's very difficult to move it, I have to straighten the wheel out first, in order to go straight. Awful.Now, I am thinking to switch to other stroller. Probably Bugaboo.
