My baby does enjoy this toy. He likes to kick it and hear the music, and I like that it has 3 modes - it will just play music for 10 minutes, the baby can kick it to play songs, or it can be set to play like a keyboard when kicked. The only problem (one I see with many crib toys right now) is that it doesn't fit my crib. It has 3 ties that are meant to be attached to the spindles of a crib. The problem is most cribs now (such as mine) have solid ends, and you can't tie anything to them. This toy is meant to be used at the end of a crib, and it simply won't fit. If you have a crib that has slats or spindles on the ends then you will be fine. I don't, so the only way for me to use this toy is to hold it while my baby kicks at it.Fun for him, but not for me.
