Yes, this is cute and the flip lid is cool.  However, I regret buying this because there's no way to clean it thoroughly.  I used this for my newborn and soon realized I couldn't throw anything wet with pee or spit up in there because it would dirty the hamper.  The only way to clean it is just wipe it with a damp cloth.  Mine definitely had some stains and some stink to it.I would recommend either a cloth hanging hamper that you can throw in the wash, or a plastic one with narrow slits (so little socks don't fall out).
