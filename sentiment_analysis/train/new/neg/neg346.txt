I bought this to wear my 7 month old on my back.  I had a tough time following instructions and getting her on my back.  I have been able to wear her on the front, facing both towards me and away.  In these positions, I rather wear the Baby Bjorn, which ends lower and allows her arms to be free. I hope that once she is at an age where she will allow me to place her on my back and wrap the straps, it will be easier to manuver this carrier, but I am not hopeful.
