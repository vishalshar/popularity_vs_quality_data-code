Im not too impressed with these. Washed them 5 times in hot as recommended. I've been using them daily for about a week. They don't seem to be very absorbent. Hopeft they get more absorbent with time... They are nice and soft & thick though. I bought them because a few of my  clotheez prefolds (very worth the price) finally bit the dust and I wanted to try out something new.
