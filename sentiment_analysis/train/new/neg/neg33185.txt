These are not necessary. I bought these before going back to work, thinking I would need them to wipe down my pump parts in between sessions throughout the day. I've been back at work for 4 months now, and have only used maybe 5 of these (all within the first week back). I quickly discovered that a plain paper towel does the job just fine, and you can stick your pump parts in the fridge in between sessions to save time. These wipes left a soapy residue behind, so I always felt like I needed to at least rinse them after using them, so they really don't save you any time.
