I loved the idea of this product, and could not wait to get it home. Once I put it on the floor, my daughter was quite interested in the different colored "petals" and the different fabrics and textures, but the twirling ladybug just did not work out.  When she was young enough to need tummy time, the ladybug was very uncomfortable, and she would cry after less than a minute of being in it.  It didn't matter if she was gently spinning or not, she wanted nothing to do with it.  We took the ladybug off (hooray that it's not attached!) and she loved the mat.  Now that she can hold her head up easily and is old enough to start scooting around, she's more interested in the ladybug, but it's not a tummy-time toy for her anymore.  Without the ladybug spinner it's just like any other play mat - bright, colorful with different textures and toys to play with, but it's a bit smaller than standard.  I'd recommend going with a normal-sized mat and skipping the awkward ladybug.
