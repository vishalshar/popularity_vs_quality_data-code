I bought these last minute because we needed a lot of bottles quickly, and it seemed like a good option if my baby rejected them, but they seem to leak a lot around the ring about half the time which is tragic when you are spilling breastmilk. No other complaints, I do like how straightforward they are.Before I had a baby I thought there was some kind of magic in choosing the perfect bottle. My baby doesn't seem to care at all.
