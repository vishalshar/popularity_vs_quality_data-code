These cups do a great job keeping the liquid in and not leaking.  However, after two months, the mouthpiece starts to "fray" with bits of a plastic coating peeling off as my daughter drinks.  I would try to shave and trim off theses pieces.  In addition, other reviewers have mentioned that the Elmo images wear off after time.  This is true, but what happens is the paint get sticky and rubs off on my daughter's hands!  I can't imagine that this is safe.
