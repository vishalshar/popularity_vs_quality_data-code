I really wanted to like this crib. I was so excited to find a piece of furniture that had dual purpose. We live in a small apartment, so this is key for all of our furniture! The one downfall, and unfortunately its a big one for me, is that the changing table part is not that great for many reasons.For one thing, it is NOT long enough! I had read that the pad it comes with is thin...which it is and in my opinion not acceptable for use by itself, so I bought a standard changing pad for extra padding and it nowhere near fit!! It was about 4 inches too long and I had to cut it to fit. Now I have a very long baby, almost 23 inches at birth, so maybe this wont be an issue for shorter babies but I feel like when he squirms around he almost hits his head or feet on the railings....ouch! This will definitely become a major issue as he grows taller.All in all, the actual crib is great, love the color of the wood, pretty easy to put together and the storage under the changing table is great but the actual changing table part does not work for me , which is SUCH a bummer because that's what I was most excited about. Unfortunately we had to keep it and I'm trying to make it work but I find myself just changing him on my bed instead...again I'm super bummer about this.Always keep in mind that my reviews are based off of my experiences with the product, and if you have a baby that is let's say ,only 18 inches, this might be a great piece for you! It just doesn't work for me and my tall baby boy. :(
