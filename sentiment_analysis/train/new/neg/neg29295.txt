This item is pure JUNK...one step higher than card board.  The sides came pre-fabricated and the remaining pieces came KD (knock down).  Problem is the sides use cheap wood dowels...ours broke during installation.  If your wondering...I was a licensed carpenter, welder, and glazier so I know about fabrication.I decided to just trash the unit and did not want to deal with getting a refund.  Even if the changing station didn't break...I probably would not use it since the unit is poorly constructed and I would not trust our baby girl lying on the top level.Very disappointed since the other reviews were good.  It's possible that we got a lemon but I would caution others about trusting your baby on a cheap structure that's held together with cheap dowels and...not even wood glue to hold everything together.  If the side panels had screws it probably would not have broke...very poor construction.
