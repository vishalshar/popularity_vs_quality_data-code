I appreciate the sharpness, and the fact that if you go carefully these are effective, but I just feel clumsy with these. Add to that the fact that the blades have to be positioned just right and I feel like it actually takes longer than traditional clippers to cut my baby's nails.  Initially, I thought they were super safe and "fool proof" but much to my dismay I clipped his tiny little fingers on 2 occasions to bleed. Not worth the trouble, and I wanted to get on board so badly...
