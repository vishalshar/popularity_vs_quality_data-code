Snaps are positioned weird. Instead of going straight across the top at the waist band, they dip down in a U shape. Doesn't let me get a good fit around the tummy and leaves a gap allowing leaks at the waist band. I paid to have someone add new snaps across the top in a straight line and now it fits perfect. The fabric is very thick and sturdy. Definitely does not leak through the fabric itself, only in areas you can't secure a snug form. Gave it 3 stars only because of the heavy duty materiel. I'd give it 0 stars for snap placement. Just thankful I found someone to add snaps or it would have been useless. Course I had to pay them to do the snaps so I didn't really save any money.
