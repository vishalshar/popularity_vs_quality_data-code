I bought this adorable mobile in hopes that my 3 month old would enjoy watching it move about and listen to the music.  The crank is so loud, and the music lasts around 20-30 seconds.  You have to stand next to the mobile and the crib and escort Pooh around the arm of the mobile - it's horribly designed.  Pooh's too big to make it past the arm so the mobile goes 3/4 turn and gets stuck.  If you want to stand at your crib and keep turning a mobile; you'll already be close to re-wind the music as well.  BUT if you want to be able to start a mobile and LEAVE the room, don't buy this one.  Cheap and plasticky...the only positive thing about it is the adorable characters on it.
