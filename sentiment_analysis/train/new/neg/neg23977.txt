I bought this mobile for my baby who is currently in the nicu. She loved it and seems to only like the music that this mobile emits but unfortunately the music windup device has broken down only after less than three months of usage. Now I'm going to have to buy the whole mobile again since this is the only thing that seems to soothe her in the hospital. I wished they'd sell only replacement parts rather than buying the whole thing over since money is tight :(
