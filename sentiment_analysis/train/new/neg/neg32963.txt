Not worth the money.  Gets stuck in the base - so hard to pull out.  It is also extremely heavy, very difficulty to move around and pull from base.  So disappointed I bought this.  Instead of having to deal with the seat and pulling it out each time, I just take my daughter in and out of it in the car instead of messing with this heavy, bulky and difficult car seat.  Can't wait until I can transition her to the bigger seat.  I have on several occasions wanted to throw this seat out the car.  Ugh, don't buy into the hype.  Save yourself the trouble and skip it!
