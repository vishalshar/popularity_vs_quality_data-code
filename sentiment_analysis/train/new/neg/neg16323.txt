This is not an original iteam but does fit the medala pump as it is described but it also has a strong quemical/plastic smell that will not came off after washing or venting it out of the bags, after sanitizing it was even worst and the plastic seem so cheap that I didn't feelSafe usinging it and I sent it back...I went back to the store and get an original replacement the doble of the price but it didn't have any smell and it was holding ok even after putting on boiling water to sanitized. I am all about getting great deals but not to risk the wellness of my baby.
