I was disappointed when our monitor suddenly no longer worked when it wasn't plugged in (we own this one:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OD8SU/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  I wasn't willing to spend the money again and invest in another one, especially when we were happy with the night vision and sound.  As I was researching monitors, I came across this product.  I saw from another review that someone with the same monitor was happy.  I verified this battery was exactly the same as what was in our current monitor.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I couldn't find it on Prime and it took quite a while for us to receive it.  Some of this was due to USPS, but I have really become accustomed to 2 day shipping.  When you have a product you rely on as heavily as we do with the monitor, we really preferred to have it quickly.  Nonetheless, it does fit our monitor and so far, so good.  We only received it a few days ago, but it works and has kept us going.  I actually ordered two so we have an extra in the event this battery quits and we can't find a replacement.2 month update:  Well.  Yesterday it appeared the battery was dying.  I thought I had forgotten to plug it in.  Tonight when I went to get it, it was so wicked hot it burned my arm.  My husband opened the back and managed to unplug the battery,  but it melted the plastic cover.  Not sure if we'll be able to get the battery out :(.  I'm downgrading this from my 4 stars to 1, given that it could cause a fire.
