I bought these for convenience in pumping... who loves to have to pour milk from bottles into bags? The first time one leaked, I chalked it up to error.  The second time (the next day), I knew that I took the time to seal it really well.... and the third? I was just furious.  Luckily, I was almost done with the package of bags by that time. That said, having 4 bags leak out of 50 is unacceptable. I know that this is a meme, but people who say that you shouldn't cry over spilled milk DEFINITELY aren't pumping mamas!! I did cry, and the only saving grace was having read previous reviews and using a ziploc to store the bags.  I lost some milk, but not all, thankfully! I dure as heck won't spend the extra cash to buy these again. The bag quality is poor and the single zipper is flimsy.
