Bought this item for my newborn. Purchased it in April and baby was born 2 weeks ago. Went to use it today for only the second time and the infant sling broke whend I set my son in it. Now I'm unable to return it since it's been longer than 30 days since it was purchased.  Will be contacting customer service.
