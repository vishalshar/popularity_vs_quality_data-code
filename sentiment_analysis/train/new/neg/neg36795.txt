I own a similar door stop also purchased at Amazon that I love: Fred Loose Leaf Doorstop, but it was expensive. I needed more doorstops, and thought I found a great price for 4 doorstops here.  I was very disappointed when I opened the box. These were smaller leaves made out of very rigid plastic with parts sticking out of the bottom. They scratch my wood floors, so I'll be returning them.
