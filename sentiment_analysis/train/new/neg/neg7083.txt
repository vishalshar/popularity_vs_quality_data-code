I should have read the reviews. This item is difficult to latch onto a seat and stay in place. You have to tighten so much that the plastic feels like it's going to break. They also have the snack compartment in the front and water on the back. My son can't even put the water bottle back because it's too far back.I would keep looking for a new one. This one falls short for multiple reasons.
