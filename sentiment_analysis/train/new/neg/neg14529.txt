This diaper is just ok. I've used it on my small two month old daughter starting when she was about 8.5 lbs. She's now 10.5 lbs. My little one is a heavy wetter, and this diaper has leaked every time that we've used it. I don't think the inside is absorbant enough. While the diaper is pretty thin, who cares about a diaper's thinness if it has terrible absorbancy. Also, the leg gussets look neat, but they're designed poorly.  The white lining of the leg gussets is not made out of the waterproof material, so if they get wet then there is leakage at the legs. My final issue with this diaper is that the rise is way too low. I'm saying that and I have a girl. I can only imaging how much worse this issue would be if I had a boy. I think Bumgenius all-in-ones are definitely better!
