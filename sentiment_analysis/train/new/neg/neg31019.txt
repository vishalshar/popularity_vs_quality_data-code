Product appears very cute, I searched online for different leg warmers for both babies and toddler b/c I was searching for sizing information. Most products claim the same - one size fits all.  Unfortunately I have one of those adorably chubby legged babies and upon opening the package noticed right away that there is no way these will fit my child's legs right now. I kept the product hoping that once my child starts crawling his legs will thin out and we might be able to use them in the future. But be forwarned... large legs do not fit in these one size/infant/toddler leg warmers.
