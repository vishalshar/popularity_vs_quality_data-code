I'm happy with this item, but had to knock off a few stars because searching for sheets, mattress padding and a waterproof cover that fit in order to use this "crib" was a pain. If you are marketing this as a crib and intend it to be used as one, IMO the "mattress" should be a mattress or one made available that is comfortable, able to be made waterproof and not the typical, hard cardboard, barely padded, spot clean only one appropriate for a pack and play. Maybe this item would be better described as an occasional crib? I think it is genius that they combined these items and that it is slightly easier to travel with and (hooray!) fits through a door, but they missed a few things along the way. Sorry for the rant. I'm grateful for how usable this item will be with our upcoming extensive travel plans to 4 of our relatives houses, although it is still very heavy BTW and not what I would consider traveling lite lol. I also like that baby might fall asleep when playing and I can move him to a more quiet room. On the other hand, I feel like I bought a small pack and play for almost the price of a full-sized one. I do feel it comes down to the conveniences of this item and if they mean a lot to you, you will be more satisfied.The Summer Infant Bassinet Pad for adding padding fits with no gap and is still firm enough =) the Carter's Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad as a waterproof non-fitted layer covers all but about an inch of the mattress and Carters Easy Fit Jersey Bassinet Fitted Sheets fit over the Graco "mattress", bassinet padding and waterproof layer, snugly and are very soft contrary to some of the reviews. Item titles are from here on Amazon. Happy shopping folks.
