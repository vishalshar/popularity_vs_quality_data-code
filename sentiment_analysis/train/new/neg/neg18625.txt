Although this is a nice highchair cover, DO NO purchase this product if you have an older Graco highchair model 36035. This highchair cover does not fit my Graco highchair at all. It doesn't even come close to fitting it. I am very disappointed because I spent a lot of money for something that I won't be able to use. Shame on Graco for not making replacement highchair covers. I now need to go buy a whole new highchair because I can't find a replacement cover for the one I have. You can be GUARANTEED I won't be buying a Graco highchair this time around.
