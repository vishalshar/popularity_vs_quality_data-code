Obviously no stroller is going to be perfect. I bought this stroller because my sister had the same one and she said it was easy to manuever while shopping. It doesn't have the large, bulky wheels that the Graco strollers have. And she was right, this stroller is smaller than the Gracos and does manuever very well. If that's your top priority for a stroller, then buy this stroller. However, for some reason, we had problems getting the infant carrier to snap in place. My husband and I have both fought with it many times and it was frustrating. The stroller cannot be folded with one hand but isn't that difficult to fold or unfold. I agree with other reviews that say that the cup holder is crappy. It's not very deep and doesn't fit some cups. I've spilled a lot of drinks because of the bad cup holder. Also, the basket is small and very hard to access. I've found myself just using the stroller handles for my diaper bag and shopping bags. But like I said, if you're looking for a stroller that isn't so huge, this is a good stroller.
