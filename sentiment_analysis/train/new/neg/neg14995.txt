I'm always on the lookout for baby gear that will fill a need -- without filling my apartment with clutter. The Linkadoos Take Along Swing fit the bill. I bought this swing when my daughter was one month old. We both enjoyed the swing. She loved the motion, the toybar and the music. And I loved that it freed up my hands to get things done around the house.When it's not in use, the swing folds impressively flat. I'd just lean it up against a wall to keep it out of the way or slip in the closet when company came over.But it could have used more power. The lowest setting is basically useless, and the second setting was pretty wimpy too. We stuck to the upper three speeds, though, and it worked well. As my daughter got a little bigger, around 4 or 5 months, she would try to sit up in the seat, which would throw off the swinging motion, and it would come to a standstill. If she leaned back and I gave it a couple pushes to get it back in sync, it would start up again. But eventually I got tired of doing that, so we used it less and less until I put it away around 6 months.One note about the size: I saved the box to store it in for baby #2, but it won't fit back in. Turns out you cannot remove the toy bar once you attach it. Not a HUGE deal as the assembled swing folded up is only a few inches taller and a couple inches wider than the box -- so you're not losing a ton of closet space. But don't even bother saving the box.
